At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Genuine Parts Company First Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). I would like to turn the call over to Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sidney Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company first quarter 2014 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We'll begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom? Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Sid, and I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President, and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, are both on the call as well and each of us has a prepared remarks and once completed we'll look forward to answering any specific questions that you may have. Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2014 results and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them, but for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.625 billion which was up 13%. Net income was $157.5 million, which was up 9%, and earnings per share were $1.02 this year compared to $0.93 in the first quarter last year, and the EPS increase was 10%. We are pleased with our overall results in the first quarter and we feel that the GPC team is off to a solid start to 2014. The combined 13.3% sales increase was our strongest performance in a few quarters and certainly acquisitions helped boost the overall results, but we were pleased as well with our performance of the underlying businesses especially in light of the number weather related closures that we experienced across each of the businesses during the quarter and we are also pleased that our increase in sales on a per day basis improves sequentially in each of the businesses as we worked away through the quarter which is encouraging. In looking at the sales results by segment, our Electrical and Automotive operations had very strong quarters with Electrical being up 30% and Automotive up 23%. Industrial was plus 4% and Office Products was down 0.5%. Paul will cover the automotive details in a few minutes but first I will make a few comments about the non-automotive operations, starting with Motion Industries, our industrial distribution company. You recall that this segment had a challenging year in 2013 ending the year down 0.5%. We saw a bit of a pickup in the fourth quarter when we were up 3% and this was followed by their 4% increase in the first quarter, so a bit encouraging. Also encouraging is the fact that 9 of our top 10 customer segments are generating positive results for the first quarter with automotive and iron and steel categories leading the way along with customers and the lumber and wood products, and coal aggregate and cement product categories growing nicely as well. This latter two are important parts of our overall business and it's nice to see them showing solid growth, perhaps indicative of improvement in the housing and construction sectors. It's also interesting to note that after several quarters of decreases the original equipment manufacturing segment was up modestly in the quarter and hopefully a sign that demand from this important segment is starting to improve for us. Our general sense is that demand in the overall industrial segment is firming up a bit. Still a bit uneven across certain customer and product categories, and then talking with our customers we still hear a bit of cautiousness, but not as pronounced as it was six months ago. And importantly two important leading demand indicators for us, the industrial production and capacity utilization indexes, continue to be at historically health levels. As a result of all of these, we continue to anticipate a respectable year from our industrial operations. Moving on to EIS, our electrical electronic company, they had a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 30%. Certainly recently completed acquisitions were a big part of their increase, but we do see signs that the underlying conditions are improving somewhat. As with Motion, there is a bit of unevenness in the recovery, but encouraging signs all the same. This combined with the ongoing contributions that we will get from the recent acquisitions as well as the continuant firmness in the ISM Purchasing Managers Index, a key demand indicator for us; all of this will enable us to look forward to strong double digit for EIS over the remainder of the year. And finally a few comments on office products. Although down slightly for the quarter, we were a bit encouraged by a few of the trends that we saw develop in the first three months. Our business with the independent office products resellers was down 1% on the quarter, but this part of our business actually improved as the quarter progressed and was nicely positive in March, and somewhat similar comments on the mega segment of our business. This group was up mid-single digits in the quarter with March being the strongest month. On the product side, furniture was up mid-single digits while technology products, core office supplies and cleaning and break (inaudible) were each down a bit but encouragingly all four product category showed nice positive growth in the month of March, and it's been a while since we have seen all four of the major product category show positive results in the same month. Certainly the biggest news for office products segment is the reason announcement that S. P. Richards has been named the first call wholesaler for the combined Office Depot, OfficeMax business. We are honored and we were proud to have been selected and this enhanced relationship will add over $100 million in annual volume to S. P. Richards starting on the second half of the year. So an incremental $50 million or so over the second half and this will be a nice boost to the overall S. P. Richards sales results in 2014. So that's a quick overview of the non-automotive businesses, and at this point I will turn it over to Paul to go with the automotive segment. Paul? Paul Donahue : Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our conference call. I'm pleased to join you today and to have an opportunity to provide an update on the first quarter performance of our automotive business. As was mentioned in our previous conference calls, we now include in our automotive recap the results from GPC Asia-Pacific, which was consolidated into our results on April 1, 2013. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, our automotive business grew top line revenues by 23% in the first quarter. To further explain our growth, the numbers breakout as follows. Acquisitions, primarily GPC Asia-Pac, contributed 17% of the 23%, our core business grew 7%, and currency had a negative impact of 1 plus percent. I would like to take this opportunity to walk you through our North American numbers and provide an overview of our first quarter performance. As we reflect on this past quarter's results, it would be apparent the numbers are very similar to our fourth quarter performance. A combination of colder weather, solid industry fundamentals and a shift in the Easter holiday but most importantly improved execution in the field enabled us to report another good quarter. All of these factors played a part in our team generating a 7% top line increase. When evaluating our quarterly performance, we are encouraged to see that all regions of the U.S. are positively contributing to our sales growth. As was the case in the fourth quarter, the top performers in the first quarter were once again those that were most impacted by the colder winter temperatures. Our division stretching from the plains across the Great Lakes to the Northeast continued to lead the way for the company. In addition these colder temperatures provide a positive momentum for a number of our key product categories which I'll touch on later. But as Tom commented in his opening the extreme weather we encountered during the month of January and even into February and some southern states as well as up and down the eastern seaboard forced numerous store and customer closures and had a negative impact on our business. However, we continue to believe the overall benefits to the parts business as a result of these extreme cold temps outweigh any of the negatives. Now turning to our U.S. company-owned store group. Comparable same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter came in at plus 8%. This strong performance follows a 7% same store sales growth in Q4. Our sales growth in the first quarter was driven by a healthy 8% increase in our commercial and our wholesale business. Diving deeper into our commercial results, our non-fleet related business turned in another stronger quarter generating an 8% increase. For the second consecutive quarter, both our major account customers as well as our 15,000 plus NAPA AutoCare centers generated double-digit increases. We are pleased with the progress, our team continues to make in this all important segments of our commercial wholesale business. We also can report an increase in both our average wholesale ticket value and our average number of tickets for the quarter and we are encouraged by both of these trends. Wrapping up our discussion on the commercial segment, we generated strong results in our fleet business, generating 8% growth in the first quarter. And these are the best results out of this segment of our business in a number of quarters. Turning now to our retail business, we can report this important segment outpaced our wholesale business in the quarter by posting a 9% overall increase. It has been a number of years since we reported this significant of an increase from our retail business. As we saw with our wholesale business, both our average ticket value and our average number of tickets increased in the quarter. We are pleased with our team's efforts in our stores and the energy behind our many retail initiatives. Now, let's take a look at a few of the product categories driving our growth. Much like the fourth quarter, our NAPA batteries and battery related accessories continued to pose strong results. These categories grew mid-double-digits in the quarter. Not surprisingly, the cold winter temperatures throughout much of the country also drove double-digit increases in both our starter and our alternator business. Other big growth categories for us in the quarter were our wiper and our chemical business, as well as our chassis business. Key product category such as brakes, filters, belts and hoses all mid-single-digits in the quarter. As we head in the spring and with the arrival of warmer temperatures, we expect to see sales in these core product categories ramp up. So in summary, we remain encouraged that both our North American and our Australasian automotive operations report another quarter of improved results. We remained positive about the core fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket and the growth opportunities available to us in both the retail and the commercial sectors. We have a new ad agency in place, a new 18-year-old NASCAR driver named Chase Elliott who has posted back-to-back victories in recent weeks, and a new retail customer loyalty program that is currently being piloted in a select number of operations. To-date, we are pleased with the results. We plan to rollout additional locations later in the year. Many of the key aftermarket industry metrics remained positive. However, we are seeing a couple of trends that we will continue to monitor. Let us start first with the positive. The average age of vehicles on the road remains an excess of 11 years and deferred maintenance remained at historically high numbers. A couple of key metrics we will keep an eye on is the price of gasoline and miles driven. Fuel prices have steadily increased over the past 30 days and have seen an increase of $0.05 in just the last two weeks. And as for miles driven and after posting positive growth numbers of 2013, they have now trended down slightly for two consecutive months. Harsh winter conditions could be impacting these results and we would hope to see these numbers normalizing as we head into the summer months. So in closing, we are pleased with our first quarter results and encouraged by the strong start of the year. We are proud of our management team and know they remain committed to driving profitable growth throughout 2014. While we have much work ahead of us, we remain optimistic that the initiatives we have put in the play are having positive impacts on our results. We like to personally thank all of our NAPA associates both in North America and GPC Asia-Pacific and Australia and New Zealand for their efforts in the first quarter. So that completes our overview of the automotive business. And at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with the review of our financial results. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. We will get started with the review of our first quarter income statement and the segment information, and then we will review a few key balance sheet items. Tom will come back up and wrap it up, and then we will open the call up to your questions. Total revenues were $3.6 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 13% from last year, consisting of a 10% contribution from acquisitions, 4% underlying growth, and this was offset by 1% headwind from currency. Gross profit for the first quarter was 29.9% of sales, up 110 basis points from the 28.8% last year. Primarily, the increase reflects the favorable impact of higher gross margin in our alteration business which owns 100% of its stores. Excluding the impact of GPC Asia-Pacific which we will annualize in the second quarter, our underlying gross margin was down slightly from last year's first quarter, and this was due mainly to customer and product mix shift across all of our businesses. We will continue to seek opportunities for margin expansion. And for the year, we would expect gross margin to be in the 30% range. As an additional point of interest, we are seeing some slight inflation in our non-automotive businesses today and not seeing that in the automotive sector, and we do not expect this change much over the balance of the year. Our pricing year-to-date through the first quarter is flat for automotive, 0.8% for industrial, 0.7% for office product and 0.8% for electrical. Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses were $841 million in the first quarter, representing 23.2% of sales. Our SG&A expenses as a percent of sales were up 130 basis points for the quarter. And much like the change in gross margin this primarily reflects the impact of higher SG&A cost and GPC Asia-Pacific again due to their 100% store model. Before GPC Asia-Pacific, our expenses are slightly improved from last year as a percent of sale and primarily reflect the cost savings associated with the freeze of our pension plan that was effective January 1, 2014. Although, these savings were partially offset by increases in other retirement related benefits, the pension freeze will continue to favorably impact our overall retirement related cost in the periods ahead. In addition, we continue to focus on effectively managing the cost in every area of our business. We're seeing progress in areas such as supply chain efficiency and labor productivity and we see room for further improvement in future period. The first quarter savings from our cost initiatives were offset by increases in items such as healthcare and incentive-based expenditures. And we remained challenged by the lack of leverage associated with only slight underlying sales growth in our non-automotive businesses. That said, in consideration of the GPC Asia-Pacific store model and ongoing savings associated with our cost initiatives and the expectation of the gradually improving sales environment in our non-automotive segments, we expect total SG&A to improve in the quarters ahead and to be approximately 23% of sales for the full year. Now, let's discuss the results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the first quarter was $1.9 billion and represents 52% of sales, and up 23%. The operating profit of $150 million is up 24%, so the margin improved 10 basis point to 7.9% from 7.8% last year. Our industrial sales were $1.14 billion in the first quarter, which is 32% of total revenue and up 3.7% from 2013. Our operating profit of $83 million is up 5.3% and the operating margin of 7.3% is up 10 basis points from the 7.2% in the prior year. We are pleased to see this improvement in Motion and continued top-line growth in this business will help this further. Our office products revenues were $418.1 million in the quarter or 11% of our total revenues and down just the 0.5%. Our operating profit of $33.9 million is up 2.3%, so their operating margin was up 20 basis points to 8.1% from the 7.9% last year. The Electrical/Electronic Group had sales in the first quarter of $180.3 million, which is 5% of total revenue and up 29.6%. Their operating profit at $15.5 million is up 48.6% and their margin shared a strong jump to 8.6% from the 7.5% in 2013. So our total operating profit was at 16% in the first quarter and our operating profit margin was up 20 basis points to 7.8. We're encouraged by this improvement and especially pleased that each of our businesses contributed to the overall increase. We are focused on consistently growing our margins in the periods ahead and expect to show 10 basis points to 20-basis point improvement for the full year. We had net interest expense of $6.2 million in the first quarter which is up from last year due to the incremental interest income earned in the first quarter of 203 that was in associated with our large cash balance held for that period. This cash was used to purchase GPC Asia-Pacific on April 1, 2013. And we expect interest expense over the next three quarters to be slightly favorable to the prior year and can be in the range of $22 million to $24 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense was $8.9 million for the first quarter which is up from 2013 due primarily to the GPC Asia-Pacific acquisition as well the industrial, electrical and office acquisitions that were completely more recently. Currently, we expect amortization expense to be in the $35 million to $37 million range for 2014. The other line which reflects corporate expense was $23.6 million expense for the quarter, which is up from the $14.3 million in the first quarter last year. This increase reflects higher expenses for a variety of items including insurance and incentive related costs. In addition, we had a more favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment in the first quarter last year. We expect this line to be in $75 million to $80 million expense range for 2014, which compares to $67 million in 2013 before the $33 million one-time gain on GPC Asia-Pacific acquisition that was reported in the second quarter of 2013. For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.5% which compares to 35% last year. The lower Australian tax on GPC Asia-Pacific's pretax earnings continues to benefit our overall rate which is typically lower in the first quarter relative to our full year rate. Last year we had a more favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment which is non-taxable. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be in 36% to 36.5% range for 2014. Net income for the quarter was $157.5 million and EPS was $1.02 compared to the $0.93 last year and up 10%. Now let's move on to the balance sheet. Our cash at March 31 was $103 million, which is down from the approximate $842 million in March of 2013 and $197 million at year-end. The decrease in cash related to the cash used in the first quarter of acquisition, a pension contribution and share repurchases. Additionally, our cash position was especially high at this time last year as about half that balance related to the cash we held for the April 1, 2013 acquisition of GPC Asia-Pacific. With these items in mind we are comfortable with our current cash position at March 31. Accounts receivable of $1.8 billion at March 31 increased 13% in the same period which is inline with our 13% sales increase for the quarter. We remain focused on our goal of growing receivables at a rate less than revenue growth in the periods ahead and we're very satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time. Our inventory at quarter end was $3.0 billion, which is up 1% from December 31 and up 16% from March 31 last year. Before the impact of acquisition, our inventory is down 1% from December 31 and up 1% from March of last year. So our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory level. We will remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward through the year. Our accounts payable balance at March 31 was $2.3 billion which is up 30% from March of the prior year due to the positive impact of our extended payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors as well as the impact of acquisition. Our continued improvement in this area and its positive impact on our working capital in days in payables is encouraging and we expect this trend to continue in the periods ahead. Our working capital $1.9 billion at March 31 compares to $2.3 billion at March 31, 2013. Effectively managing accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable is a high priority for our company and our ongoing effort with these key accounts have resulted in solid improvement in our working capital position and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition at March 31, 2014. Our total debt at $900 million at March 31 represents approximately 21% of total capitalization. It includes two $250 million term notes as well as another $400 million in borrowing under our multi-currency syndicated credit facility. We're comfortable with our capital structure at this time although we may choose to pay down some of our current debt outstanding under the syndicated credit facility during 2014 depending on the investment opportunities that could arise. In the first quarter, our cash from operations was approximately $60 million and for the full year we would expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range, and we would expect free cash flow which deduct capital expenditures and dividends to be on the $500 million range. We are pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our first priority for cash is the dividend which have paid every year since going public in 1948 and have now raised for 58 consecutive years, which is a record continues to distinguish genuine parts from other companies. Our annual dividend of $2.30 per share on 2014 represents a 7% increase from the $2.15 per share paid in 2013 and it's approximately 52% of our 2013 earnings per share, which is well within our goal of the 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward. Our other priorities for cash included the ongoing reinvestment and each of our core businesses, strategic acquisitions were appropriate and share repurchases. Our investment and capital expenditures was $18.4 million for the first quarter, which is up from the $12.9 million in 2013. We expect our capital expenditures to pick up over the balance of the year and look for CapEx spending to be on the range of $140 million to $150 million which compares to the $124 million last year. As usual, the vast majority of our investments look to be weighted towards productivity enhancing project primarily in technology. Depreciation and amortization was $36.9 million for the quarter, which is consistent with the fourth quarter but up from the $26 million in the first quarter of last year. The increase on this line reflects the impact of Asia-Pacific as well as our more recent acquisitions and we would anticipate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $145 million to $155 million for the full year. Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of catch for us and they are integral to the growth plan for the company. Thus for on 2014, we have had three acquisitions including one each for industrial, electrical and office businesses with estimated annual revenues totaling $235 million. These businesses as well those acquired over the last several periods are performing well and in line with our expectations and we are encouraged by the growth opportunities we see for each of them. We will continue to seek new acquisitions across all of our businesses to further enhance our prospect for future growth generally targeting those bolt on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in $25 million to $125 million range. Finally, in the first quarter, we used our cash to purchase approximately 300,000 shares of our common stock under the company's share repurchase program. This follows 1.5 million shared purchased in 2013 and today we have another 10.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program over the balance of the year as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with our dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. So that is our financial update, and in closing we want to also thank our GPC associates for all they do. It's a team effort here and everyone's hard work is truly appreciated. The company is well-positioned for continued growth and we look forward to updating on our future progress when we report again. I will now turn it back over to Tom. Tom? Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Carolyn and Paul for your updates. So that will wrap up our prepared comments and, in summary, we would say that we feel that we came to the quarter in pretty good shape and about where we had planned to be. As we look out over the reminder of the year, we continue to feel positive about our prospects in all four of our business segments. In automotive, we anniversaried the GPC Asia-Pacific acquisition as of the 1, April, which will moderate our overall automotive group growth rates over the reminder of the year. But we continue to feel good about the underlying fundamentals and the automotive aftermarket as Paul just covered and we feel good as well with results that we are seeing from our various initiatives. The one unknown for us right now is the strength of the headwind that we will encounter over the reminder of the year due to currency exchange. As mentioned earlier, it was over 1% in the first quarter. With all of that said however, we feel that we should raise the bottom end of our full year automotive guidance plus 5% to plus 6% and for now leave the top end to plus 7%. As mentioned during our comments, we're a bit encouraged by some of the signs that we are seeing in both the industrial and electrical markets and we would reaffirm the previously provided full year revenue guidance of 5% to 7% for industrial and 25% to 30% for electrical. And in office products now having the bit of clarity around the Office Depot business we need to raise the guidance from the previously provided plus 1 to plus 3 to plus 3 to plus 4. Putting all this together will give us a full year increase of 68% which is up from our previously provided 5% to 7%. On the earnings side, our prior expectation was to be in the range of $4.47 to $4.57 and at this point we would say that a range of $4.49 to $4.59 is probably more appropriate. Now although we don't provide quarterly guidance, as a point of information there will be a bit of choppiness on the quarterly basis due to some of the one-time purchase accounting adjustments related to the GPC Asia-Pacific acquisition in Quarters 2 and 3 last year. And as you are updating a model Sid will be available to talk with you on this. But we are comfortable with the current annual guidance of $4.49 to $4.59 that we just provided and we will look forward to refining this a bit further as the year progresses. With that said, we would like to address your questions and we'll turn the call back over to Holly. Holly? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with RBC. Scott Ciccarelli - RBC: Paul went through I guess again as I get older here, but Paul went through a couple of the different growth rates on the auto side. Can you just re-summarize those quickly, and number one. Number two, you guys had some nice improvement on the payment terms, and the accounts payable to inventory. Is that coming from across the different segment or is that more a leverage toward auto where obviously some of your competitors have very capable APied inventory ratios? Thanks. Carol Yancey : I would say that on the accounts payable that's primarily coming from auto and that would be the majority of what we have seen recently and what we expect to see, but I would also say all of our businesses have initiatives focused on it and it's something that all of our businesses are looking towards doing and have some improvement there. But I would say the majority of the increase is certainly coming from automotive. Scott Ciccarelli - RBC: Got you. Thank you. Paul Donahue : And Scott, specifically what were you looking for me to repeat on the automotive numbers. Scott Ciccarelli - RBC: Well, I guess I think you had said both commercial and wholesale were up to 8% or is that -- Paul Donahue : That's correct, yeah. Commercial and wholesale were up 8%. Our same store sales were up 8% and our retail business was up 9%. Scott Ciccarelli - RBC: I got it. Okay. And then so we were looking 7% because of the currency? Carol Yancey : Yes. Scott Ciccarelli - RBC: Where that's all organic? Paul Donahue : Yeah. Scott Ciccarelli - RBC: I got it. Okay. Yep, that cleared up. All right. Thanks guys. Paul Donahue : You are welcome. Tom Gallagher : Scott, one of the thing I would just add is one of the things that we really find pleasing about the quarter in the automotive business is the consistency of the performance across all of the segments. I think our team did a terrific job of touching all the bases in this quarter. Scott Ciccarelli - RBC: Got you. Thanks, Tom. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Greg Melich, ISI Group. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Hi, thanks. Paul you mentioned March has had a nice improvement over the weather disruption in January and February. Could you help us give an idea of the magnitude and whether there was need to shift but impacted that and how April is looking to look more like March or more like the whole first quarter? Tom Gallagher : I'll take that, Greg, and I will comment on all of the businesses. Automotive showed consistency throughout the quarter; we saw some pickup in March. And then if we look at the other three businesses, one of the things that was a bit encouraging is that in each of those businesses we actually saw sequential improvement as the quarter progressed. And those businesses were prone to be hurt by the impact of weather, but March was a good month for us in all four other businesses. Greg Melich - ISI Group : And did April look more like March or like the first quarter? Tom Gallagher : April looks more inline with March. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Great. And then, second, could you give us some update on how the Australian business is doing organically? And if -- got lost a little bit in that seven number of it, anything in terms of traffic and comp trends there? Tom Gallagher : As you know, we do not break out that business separately. I think we would just believe that we continue to be very pleased with the job that that team is doing and we think that has got a very bright future. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : My primary questions relates to auto supply and related two parter. The first just relates to how much of the wholesale business associated with a Depot Max deal that you did not previously -- did you think you will capture and I am particularly asking with regard to geographic coverage and do you feel like you have the coverage to get all of their markets? And the second question is related to that. As you think about the price that you may have paid to get that business, is there any margin pressure you would expect on the legacy business as result of whatever it is you took in that bid? Thank you so much. Tom Gallagher : And I will try to answer that. In terms of how much of the business will we capture we've been named first call as you know. So that gives us the opportunity to fulfill all of their needs across the entire enterprise. And how much will we get, we are pretty optimistic that we are going to get a very high percentage of it. We do have the geographic coverage to support it. We have got the ability to handle all of that business and our intentions are to handle all of that business. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Great. Tom Gallagher : And then, in terms of any pressures on the legacy business, we would not anticipate that. I think it may be important to point out that I don't believe that this was first and foremost a price decision on the part of Office Depot. I think price certainly was an element. But I think it is important to remember that we have had the Office Depot business for 20 years, and part of the reason I suspect that we might have got the nod is that we have done I think a pretty commendable job of handling that business from day one. So I think price is always a factor but the value add and the level of service and the level of support that you can provide is an important element as well, and I think we faired reasonably well in that over the past 20 years. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : And then a very brief follow-up. We can handle this after the call, if you like. But to the extent that you spoke about purchase accounting dynamics for the second and third quarter last year, would there be any adjustments to the current year's numbers or is it just simply a function of understanding the charges that you might have incurred a year ago? Carol Yancey : We are not anticipating any purchase accounting adjustments to speak out for 2014. It was just a reminder, that we did have the large one time adjustment in the second quarter and then we had a smaller adjustment in Q3. So it's just a reminder about the choppiness due to the prior year numbers. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Aaron (inaudible) with Wolfe Research. Unknown Analyst : Hi. This is actually Chris (inaudible) on for Aaron. Hoping to get your thoughts on -- I was hoping to get your thoughts on increased vehicle complexity. The trend appears to be solely hurting DIY and favor DIFM. But wondering if the increase complexity tick with high grade (inaudible) and even the aluminum F-150, if there comes a point where like the smaller bay and the three bay garage as they are no longer able to handle the work, and how should we think that this relates to NAPA? Tom Gallagher : Well I would try to take it. Paul may have something to add. I would say one, you are right that the vehicles are going to become more complex and they are going to require a higher level of training and sophistication to do the repair work in the years ahead. On the NAPA side, we have been anticipating this for several years now and we have got training programs for all of our commercial customers that if followed will enable them to do these repairs going forward. The other thing to keep in mind is that the aftermarket is a very, very large industry and you have got 251 million vehicles on the road today. And this new technology that comes in, it comes in on a gradual or evolutionary basis, not a revolutionary basis. So there is a multiyear opportunity for us to be prepared not only from the technical training point of view, but also from the supply chain point of view to handle demands of the vehicle in the future. So we actually see it is an opportunity. To your point, I do think that those on the repair side that for whatever reason are going to avail themselves of the training or aren't a position to buy some of the new diagnostic equipment and tools that will be needed they are going to be threatened. But at the same time, we think that good customers like our major account customers, our NAPA AutoCare customers, this is an opportunity for them to perhaps gather up some share as we evolve through the transition we are going to be going through. Paul Donahue : : Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Chris Horvers, JPMorgan. Chris Horvers - JPMorgan: So I wanted to try to parse out a little bit more on some of the March, April commentary. We talked about an Easter shift. Is it possible to look at what average daily volume growth was like in the DIY in the commercial side of the order parts business, to try to figure out what the underlying trend is? Tom Gallagher : It is a hard number to come up with, but it will be -- we would suggest it would be less than 0.5%. Chris Horvers - JPMorgan: I got you. In terms of the impact. I understand. In that DIY number was just I mean through the roof, is there any reason to think that first the Easter shift had more of an impact of that side of the business? And can you dig into some of the category performance in DIY where that acceleration was made. As I think, then DIY would say well wiper, it's cold, it's smelly as batteries, as wipers and that really surge of demand in DIY should have already past, that actually seems like it showed up later. So can you just talk about the category that show the acceleration and how you think about the performance in DIY and commercial, both took you and then as you get into the balance of the year? Paul Donahue : Yeah. Chris, this is Paul. Just to -- let me take the retail piece first. And I think I would start by telling you that, overall our team is performing at a higher level, executing at a higher level. We have done a lot of work in our stores. We reset our stores, re-merchandized and extended hours, better signage, better associate care on the floor for our customers and dedicated care on the floor. So I think all of that has a positive impact on our retail business. And we really saw that trend throughout the past year. You couple that with the harsh winter weather and that harsh winter weather that really drove we think some real emergency type repairs. An emergency type repairs, you got stuff breaking down right, so you got batteries that need to be replaced, wipers that need to be replaced, wipers that need to be bought, chemicals that need to be bought. We saw positive growth in every one of those categories throughout the quarter. So I would say really it's a combination. I think, one, our execution is better and then I think the harsh winter weather grow folks into our stores to get some emergency repairs done quickly. Chris Horvers - JPMorgan: You would think in, I mean, Tom's comment that April looks more like March in auto, you would think that people aren\u2019t repairing, changing their batteries out, because it's warmer and the cars were starting. So I guess it's the demand starting to spread to more of the repair and maintenance categories that aren't more emergency in nature? Tom Gallagher : I think that's a fair assumption. And my comment about April was not just for automotive. That was also for other businesses as well. Chris Horvers - JPMorgan: Understood. And then that's a good segue. So on the industrial business it did, it seem like the organic growth came in the little lighter than you were originally anticipating. So did actually the weather end up having more of an impact on that business in the middle part of the quarter that you expected is what you have seen in March and April, more in line with how you originally thinking about the year. Tom Gallagher : Well we did have an improved quarter organic growth wise. We did have an improved quarter around for the addition of some acquisition volume as well, but we did see some improvement organically and we also had the impact negative impact of the currency exchange in the quarter which was just over 1% in the industrial business. To the second part of your question. Our non-automotive business are hurt by the kind of whether that we experienced in the first quarter, because its business closures and we don't experience increased demand because of cold temperatures. We do get the benefit of increased demand on automotive offset by whatever number stores and customer locations that are closed, but it was a headwind in the quarter the weather was and that's behind us now. So we have got a degree of optimism for the reminder of the year. Chris Horvers - JPMorgan: Okay. And then just the final one on the margins. At what point an organic growth in the non-automotive businesses do you start to see vendor allowances picking the year to year and then similarly getting leverage on the SG&A side? Thanks. Tom Gallagher : I will try to that and Carol can help, but I would say that we need approaching mid-single digit growth in those businesses. One of the offsets potentially to any volume instead a program is a fact that our team is doing a better job ever increasing better job on our inventory management. So I think Carol covered the inventory numbers overall but we are doing a better job and each of the business is on a continuing basis. So we run the businesses, we don't use the balance sheet to prop up the income statement. So if we can generate mid-single digit growth in any of these businesses and at the same time through better visibility and better technology hold inventories even that's what we are going to do; we are not going to push the inventories in order to try to qualify for any additional rebase that might be earned. Carol Yancey : And I think just one of the things on the volume incentives, there was not really an impact on the quarter. Our volume incentives were basically flat compared to the prior quarter and we're modeling flat this year for 2014. So I think there are some other things that should come into play with our gross margin initiatives that we should get the improvement from those areas rather than just the sheer volume incentive. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Ruvolo, Bank of America. John Ruvolo - Bank of America : First question would be to you, Carol. If we think about the auto business if we think about the year-over-year incremental margins, they have been in the low kind of 8% range over the past few quarters. I guess the question is this a reasonable one way to think about or other additional levers now that can be pulled given an Exebel would be fully integrated and so forth? Carol Yancey : Well traditionally, and we try not to base everything on this first quarter. So first quarter tend to be a low margin business especially on the automotive side, and we do have a better seasonality certainly with Asia-Pacific and what our first quarter is their winter, if you will, but we have the seasonality so on a full year basis we would point you more to looking at the full year margin numbers and so that's what we would expect to be on a full year. And we also looking for a 10 to 20 basis point improvement on a full year basis. John Ruvolo - Bank of America : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe more of just a strategic question here thinking about the office products business and you guys currently have eight proprietary brands there which it would appear that there would be at least some degree of costs that's associated but supporting those trend. Is there any business rational potentially should consolidating the brand and going to the market with maybe a more consolidated portfolio, if you will? Tom Gallagher : I don't think that's part of our thought process currently. I think what we are comfortable with the way we are managing the product portfolio today. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli & Company. Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: A couple of questions here. With auto being at 8%, how much do you think a piece of that came from market share gain and how much do you think may have come from what will be the advance General Parts conglomerate when that's all integrated? Paul Donahue : Yeah, Brian, this is Paul. A couple of things. One, it's kind of difficult to tell at this point but I would tell you that as far as your question on the Advance CARQUEST acquisition though. It's pretty early we are encouraged by the things that we are seeing happening in the fields but it's very early. And I can tell you that for the first quarter there was really no material impact on our numbers in the first quarter as a result of those two businesses coming together. Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: Okay. And just Motion Dynamics staying fairly stable so far. Paul Donahue : Absolutely, you are talking about in the marketplace, Brian? Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: Yeah. Paul Donahue : Yeah, so for everybody is -- it seems to be pretty rational out there. We are certainly as Carol pointed out in her comments we are not getting any help from price increases, but it's rational. Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: As this year progresses and let's say things begin to get any better do you foresee a mix shift back towards the best and better products, Paul, or is that just something that you think it's going to be a major part of the marketplace going forward? Paul Donahue : Well it's hard to tell. Brian, we do have a good, better, best offering of products for sure on the marketplace. We promote all three, we push all three, we have seen bit more of a flight to value on recent years and I don't know that that's going to change to any effect going forward in '14. Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: All right. Thank you. On just one of your comments you said you guys made -- pay down some debt as the year goes on. Given how cheap your borrowing or why would that be the best use of cash as you guys look at how to allocate capital? Carol Yancey : Right now, what we were saying is we are at 900 right now and we may; it's really going to depend on what opportunities may present themselves between now and the end of the year and certainly that could come in the form of the acquisitions or share repurchases. And honestly, we have to look at how our cash is going to be and our cash flow coming in. So it's really a balancing we made the level similar to last year. We were saying we may take it down a bit from the $900 million that it is first quarter. But we haven't rule out anything, because it's really we are going to look at it as things present themselves between now and the end of the year. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Seth Basham, Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Good morning. So I have a couple questions. First, if you could give us a better sense of what underlying gross margins were year-over-year for the auto business when you strip out a specific business? Carol Yancey : We do not break out the gross margins specifically to the segments. But what we would say is, that you took out the impact of Asia-Pacific for those quarter, our core gross margins were down about 10 basis points and that was really reflected in all of our businesses. And we said that was more of a customer and product mix and it is really representative of all of our businesses. And we would hope -- we have got some things in place and we hope to see that come back a bit between now and the end of the year. And we are kind of targeting at around 30% or just little bit better than that by the end of the year. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Okay. So full year gross margin guidance hasn't changed versus the prior guidance, right? Carol Yancey : No, it hasn't. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Okay, great. And then, in terms of the auto business again, the gap between some of our strongest markets that you referenced, the weather affected markets in the north and north-east versus the least strong market, did that gap changed in this quarter relative to the last quarter? Paul Donahue : Well, it get somewhat, Seth, and primarily, because some of our divisions and groups down in the south were impacted by the weather in the negative fashion, right. So we had some customer closure and store closures which certainly the folks of north deal with the weather a lot better than we did down here in the south. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : And does that imply that the northern markets actually accelerated in terms of trend in the fourth quarter or the first quarter versus the fourth? Paul Donahue : Well the north divisions continue to as they were in the fourth quarter, Seth, continue to be strong operators for us absolutely, your assessment is correct. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Okay, great. And then, can you remind us last year what your same store sales was, the U.S. NAPA Business, adjusted for any selling day differences? Paul Donahue : Hold on. Tom Gallagher : Just give us a second. Paul Donahue : Yeah. Tom Gallagher : Hold that up. Carol Yancey : For the first quarter? Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Yeah. Carol Yancey : 5%. Tom Gallagher : No, no. Carol Yancey : That is not. Tom Gallagher : First quarter 2013, our same store sales were just up modestly, basically flat. Carol Yancey : It has\u2026 Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : On a same day basis? Tom Gallagher : On a same day basis. Paul Donahue : Yeah. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Okay. And then lastly, it relates to be office business, the incremental $100 million of sales you guys expect from the OEP win, should we expect that to come at similar margins to the segment average? Tom Gallagher : No there will be, it will be a little bit lower than the overall average. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Keith Hughes, SunTrust. Keith Hughes - SunTrust: My question has been answered. Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thanks Keith. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Bret Jordan, BB&T Capital Markets. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : A quick question I guess is as you look at the accounts payable to inventory and you are pushing towards 80% and I imagine mostly that is on the back of the automotive side, where do you see that number getting to? Do you think you can get the motion and electrical suppliers to sort of drink the cool aid on extended terms or because most of it come from auto they might be hard to get it up from here? Tom Gallagher : I don't think we plateau. So I think you will see a bit of improvement from here. As far as the first part of the question, this concept is not spread throughout the other businesses. So it's going to be more difficult and more time consuming to accomplish what we would like to accomplish in those businesses but I think we still have a little bit of headway yet in terms of bringing it up. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Would we think that your auto AP inventories in the 90s if your aggregate AP was in 79. Tom Gallagher : We haven't worked that number. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then I get the question go back to market share unlocked you say has changed in the first quarter but as you picked up distributors from the CARQUEST transaction. Tom Gallagher : We have had some positive results there, it's little early in the process, but there have been some movements, yes. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Talk about how many or (inaudible) where you to drive that or Tom Gallagher : No, we wouldn't want to do that. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then one last question. I will give you one last one. As you talk about the strong categories I think you said the friction you were getting better into the second quarter. Is chassis or any other categories staying strong out of what with the venture of real seasonal demand spike as people do post winter repairs? I understand with batteries are hitting a much of amount of peak in Q1 but are there other peaks in the business that are driving Q2? Paul Donahue : Yeah, Bret, you are right, we saw certainly Q1 was big growth and batteries as we saw in Q4. Our chassis has a good first quarter as well. We are expecting that business to continue strong into Q2, you look at some of the potholes up in the northern part of the country I think there is going to be an opportunity for chassis for sure. As we look at our core categories breaks and filters, for example, with people now as the weather warrants up people get the cars into the base that's the business that we are expecting to see a nice ramp up here in Q2 and Q3. Operator : And your final question is a follow-up question from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group. Mike Montani \u2013 ISI Group : Yes, hey, guys. This is Mike Montani on for Greg. Just wanted to follow-up on the full year guidance. It seems like the revenues were increased by about $140 million, but then EPS by only about $0.02, which seems to imply about $5 million of net EBIT. Is there something that I am missing there, it seems like interest is up a little bit and may be other amortization line items as well to offset? Could you just help me to understand the flow through there? Tom Gallagher : We will have to get back you on that, Mike. Carol Yancey : We did not do in terms of the actual revenue and the EBIT. One thing we did do is raise the bottom end of the automotive guidance, so we brought that up in five to six. But I think there were some other changes, some other headwinds in there. And honestly, currency is playing in there a bit too. So did not necessarily come about the way you did. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn this conference call back over to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey : Well, we appreciate you attending our call today and we appreciate all the questions. And if we can be of further assistance, let us know. Otherwise, we look forward to reporting out after of second quarter numbers. Thank you for your support. Operator : And once again, we'd like to thank you for dialing in for toady's Genuine Parts Company's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Holly and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn today\u2019s conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sid Jones - Vice President, Investor Relations : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts second quarter 2014 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company\u2019s latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom? Tom Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Sid. And I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President along with Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and I will each handle a portion of today\u2019s call. And once we have concluded our individual remarks, we will look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have. Earlier this morning, we released our second quarter 2014 results and hopefully you have had an opportunity to review them, but for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.908 billion, which was up 6% over the prior year. Net income was $197.7 million, which was down 9% on a reported basis, but up 9% on a comparative basis, which I will comment on in a moment. Earnings per share were $1.28 this year compared to $1.39 last year and this represents an EPS decrease of 8% on a reported basis, but up 9% on a comparative basis. As a reminder, last year\u2019s net income and earnings per share numbers were favorably impacted by the one-time positive adjustments that are attributable to the purchase accounting treatments on our Australian acquisition that was completed in the second quarter of 2013. Carol will cover this in more detail during her comments, but in looking at the results from pure operating standpoint, with sales up 6% and both net income and earnings per share up 9% on a comparative basis, we feel that the GPC team operated pretty well in the quarter. Looking at the sales results by segment, our automotive operations were up 5% in the quarter. Considering the fact that currency exchange had a negative impact of almost 2%, which indicates an underlying growth rate of 7%, we feel that this is reflective of the good sales job being done by the automotive team and Paul will cover more of the automotive details and highlights during his comments. Our industrial operations also had a solid quarter, posting a 7% increase. Acquisitions contributed a little over 3% to the increase, while currency exchange had a negative impact of just under 1%. Netting all of this out means that our underlying industrial business was up a bit over 4% in the quarter, which is right where we expected them to be and it continues a trend of gradual revenue improvement for our industrial operations over the past few quarters. In looking at our sales results by customer category, 9 of our top 10 customer segments were positive in the quarter and 7 of the 10 had increases of 5% or more, which we feel shows good balance in the results and is a bit encouraging. Automotive, iron and steel, coal aggregate and cement, lumber and wood products were among our top performing sectors perhaps indicative of a gradually improving overall economy. And at this point, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for our industrial business over the second half of the year. Our electrical segment had another strong quarter, with sales up 32%. Acquisitions completed over the past six months basically accounted for all of this increase and we are pleased with the contributions and progress being made in both the wire and cable and fabrication sides of the business. We continue to struggle in the electrical/electronic side of the business however. Sales into the original equipment manufacturing side of the electrical business have not recovered yet as they have for the industrial segment. And sales for the electronics side of the business are being impacted by non-recurring sales to electronic contract manufacturers in 2013. Fortunately, our EIS team feels good about our continued progress in the second half for the wire and cable and fabrication businesses. And based upon what they currently see they are anticipating a modest recovery for the electrical, electronic business in the months ahead. Turning to the office products segment, we are pleased to report a 4% increase. This is their best quarter in sometime and while the GCN acquisition that was completed earlier in the year accounted for about one half of the increase, we were encouraged by the fact that both the independent reseller segment and the mega channel each had positive growth in the quarter. While the mega results have been positive in five of the past six quarters, this is the first time that the independent channel has shown positive growth over that same timeframe. And we are hopeful that this is a turning point for this important segment of our office products business. On the product side we had increases in the quarter in the cleaning and break room furniture and core office supplies categories and a modest decrease in the technology category. And we are a bit encouraged by the fact that all four categories had second quarter results that were stronger when compared to the first quarter results, so a bit of sequential improvement which hopefully we can sustain in the quarters ahead. Before closing on office products, we do want to mention that we completed the acquisition of Impact Products on July 1. Impact is a distributor of safety and facility services products and they will add approximately $85 million in revenue on an annual basis. Additionally, the Impact acquisition complements the GCN acquisition mentioned earlier. And it enables S. P. Richards to further diversify its product offering as well as its customer base which is an important part of our long-term strategy for the office products segment. And we are pleased to have the Impact Products team now part of the GPC family. So that will conclude our comments on the non-automotive businesses. And I will ask Paul to cover the automotive segment. Paul? Paul Donahue - President: Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone and welcome to our conference call. I am pleased to join you today and have an opportunity to provide you an update on the second quarter performance of our automotive business. Just as a reminder, we mentioned in last quarter\u2019s conference call that on April 1, we annualized our acquisition of GPC Asia-Pacific and you will see that reflected in our Q2 numbers and on a go forward basis. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks our automotive business grew top line revenues by 5% in the second quarter. To further explain our growth, our core automotive business grew 7% with a 2% offset due to currency exchange. I would like to take this opportunity to walk you through our automotive numbers and provide you an overview of our second quarter performance. As we look back on this past quarter\u2019s results you will see \u2013 you will note our numbers are fairly consistent with both our fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014. Our teams continue to execute well in the field and coupled with solid industry fundamentals enabled us to report another good quarter with underlying growth at plus 7%. When evaluating our quarterly performance, we are encouraged to see that all regions of the U.S. are positively contributing to our sales growth. As has been the case the past couple of quarters, our divisions stretching from the Plains across the Great Lakes to the Northeast continue to lead the way for the company. In the second quarter we also saw strong sales growth in both the Southern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the country. An update on the automotive aftermarket wouldn\u2019t be complete without a weather update. So after one of the coldest winters in a number of years, patches of extreme weather conditions continue to impact our business along with our good customers. The dry conditions in out West continue to plague the state of California as over one-third of the state is officially in a drought. This has a direct impact on the dairy and agricultural businesses and ultimately our customer base. On the opposite extreme the month of June was the wettest on record in the past 25 years. But despite these headwinds along with the shift in the Easter holiday, our team persevered and produced solid sales results across the U.S. Now turning to our U.S. company-owned store group, comparable same store sales growth in the second quarter came in at plus 7%. This 7% increase is on top of 5% same store sales growth in the second quarter of 2013 giving us a to two year stack of 12%. In addition, it continues a solid pattern of organic growth dating back to the fourth quarter of \u201813 when we generated a 7% same-store sales increase in the first quarter of \u201814 when we grew same-store sales 8%. Our sales growth in Q2 was driven by healthy 7% increase in our commercial and wholesale business. Diving deeper into our commercial results, our two big wholesale initiatives Major Accounts and NAPA AutoCare, once again delivered double-digit increases in the quarter. This marks four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in the Major Account business. And turning to our 15,000 plus NAPA AutoCare centers, this group posted double-digit growth for the third straight quarter. Overall, we are pleased with the progress our team continues to make in both of these segments of our business. It\u2019s also worth noting we posted strong results in our fleet business generating 6% growth in the second quarter. We are encouraged by these results as our team has now generated solid fleet numbers in back-to-back quarters. We can also report improving trends in our average wholesale ticket value with little or no inflation support and our average number of tickets increased in the quarter as well. Turning now to our retail business, this segment of our business grew 7% in the second quarter. We continue to be encouraged with our growth in our retail business. And if you recall, we increased this segment 9% in the first quarter. As we saw with our wholesale business both our average ticket value and our average number of tickets increased in the quarter. Our team has been working hard to drive our retail business and it\u2019s great to see the improved results these past few quarters. Let\u2019s take a look at the product categories driving our growth. Our heavy duty business continues to post strong results as this group generated double-digit growth in the quarter. We also saw high single-digit growth from core product category like brakes, chassis and our filter business. We would also mention that we continue to see good momentum in our electrical business driven by strong battery sales. I\u2019d like to give a special plug to our electrical team as once again we are promoting in the month of July our battery starter and alternator products, with a portion of the proceeds being contributed to the Intrepid Fallen Hero Fund. Supporting our returning military veterans is something our NAPA team believes in very strongly and we are proud to announce that once again this year we will raise in excess of $1 million for this very worthy cause. So, in summary, we remain encouraged as our automotive operations report another quarter of strong results. We remain positive about the core fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket and the growth opportunities available to us in both the retail and commercial sectors. The industry fundamentals have not really changed quarter-over-quarter. The average age of vehicles on the road remains in excess of 11 years and deferred maintenance remains at historically high numbers. A couple of key metrics we continue to monitor closely are the price of gasoline and miles driven. While earlier in the quarter, we saw a spike in fuel prices, we have now leveled off and are essentially flat year-over-year. And in the all-important miles driven category, after posting negative numbers earlier in the year, we saw positive growth in both March and April. So, in closing, we are pleased with our second quarter results as well as the first half of 2014. We are proud of our management team and know they remain committed to driving profitable growth throughout 2014. And while we have much work ahead of us, including tougher comps in the second half of the year, we remain optimistic that the initiatives our team is focused on will continue to drive strong results. We would like to personally thank all of our associates both at NAPA North America and at GPC Asia-Pacific and Australia and New Zealand for their efforts in the second quarter. So that completes our overview of the automotive business. And at this time I will hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol? Carol Yancey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Paul. We will begin with the review of our second quarter and six month income statements and the segment information and we will also review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up and then we will open the call up to your questions. Our total revenues were record $3.9 billion for the second quarter an increase of 6% from last year, including the 5% underlying sales growth and a 2.5% contribution from acquisitions, and this was offset by the current headwind of slightly more than 1%. If we turn to our gross profit and SG&A, we want to remind everyone as the prior year one-time items that are impacting our comparisons. In the second quarter 2013, we reported a favorable purchase accounting adjustment associated with the April 1, 2013 acquisition of the remaining 70% interest in GPC Asia-Pacific. To that end, we are required to revalue the company\u2019s initial 30% investment and this re-measurement met a certain one-time purchase accounting cost amounted to a free tax income adjustment of approximately $36 million. And when combined with a lower tax rate, this favorably impacted our earnings per share by $0.22 in the second quarter of 2013. In accounting for the pre-tax adjustment, approximately $18 million was recorded in cost of goods sold and a $54 million gain net of expenses was recorded to selling, administrative and other expenses on our income statement. Additionally, the $36 million net adjustment is included in the other net line in the segment information provided in today\u2019s press release. Any references we may make through our comparable results are intended to exclude the prior year impact of these one-time items. With all that said, our gross profit for the second quarter was 30.2% compared to 30.1% last year. For the six months, our gross margin of 30.1% compares to 29.5% reported last year. On a comparative basis, our second quarter gross margin is down 40 basis points from an adjusted 30.6 basis points in 2013. This is due mainly to customer and product mix shift across our businesses, but primarily in the automotive and office segments. We thought it would be good to add as well that the gross margin differential at GPC Asia-Pacific is no longer relevant in our quarterly comparisons as we have anniversaried that acquisition on April 1 as Paul mentioned earlier. Turning to the periods ahead, we certainly see room for improvement and we remain focused on seeking those opportunities to expand our margins over the longer term. For the balance of 2014, however, we continue to expect our margins to be in the 30% range. As an additional point of interest, we are seeing some slight inflation in our non-automotive businesses to-date, but we continue to see very little inflation in the automotive sector. And we don\u2019t expect this to change much over the balance of the year. Our 2014 year-to-date pricing is 0.1% for automotive, 1.0% for industrial, 1.1% for office products and 0.4% for electrical. Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses were $869 million in the second quarter, which is 22.2% of sales compared to 21.5% reported last year. For the six months, our total SG&A expenses were $1.7 billion, which is 22.7% of sales compared to 21.7% for the same period in 2013. On a comparative basis, our second quarter SG&A expenses have improved as a percentage of sales decreasing 80 basis points to 22.2% of sales from the 23.0% in the second quarter last year. This improvement primarily reflects the expense leverage gained on our sales volume for the quarter as well as cost savings associated with the freeze of our pension plan that was effective January 1. We expect the pension freeze to continue to favorably impact the overall retirement related cost in the periods ahead and we continue to remain focused on effectively managing the cost in every area of our business. Through these initiatives, we expect to show continued progress on our SG&A line in the periods ahead. And now, let\u2019s discuss the results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the second quarter was $2.1 billion and represents 54% of total sales and is up 5%. Our operating profit of $207 million is up 11%. So, their margin improved nicely up 50 basis points to 9.8% from 9.3% last year. For the six months, our automotive sales of $4 billion, also represent 53% of our total sales and is up 13%. Our operating profit of $357 million is up 16% and our margin is up 30 basis points to 8.9%. Our industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the second quarter, which is 31% of our revenues and up 7%. Operating profit of $94 million is up 7% and our operating margin of 7.9% is unchanged from the prior year. Our year-to-date industrial sales of $2.35 billion represent 31% of our revenues and are up 5%. Our operating profit of $178.5 million is up 6% and our margin of 7.6% is up 10 basis points from last year. Our office products revenues of $419 million in the quarter or 10% of our total revenues are up 4%. Our operating profit of $31 million is up 5%, so their margin was unchanged at 7.4%. For the six months, our office revenues are $837 million, representing 11% of the total and is up by 2%. Our operating profit of $65 million is up 3% and our margin is up 10 basis points from last year to 7.8%. The electrical/electronic group had sales in the quarter of $188 million, which is 5% of our revenue and up 31.5%. Our operating profit of $16.5 million is up 35% and their margin is 8.8%, which is up 30 basis points from the 8.5% last year. Year-to-date, our sales for this group were $368 million, which is 5% of our revenues and up 31%. Our operating profit of $32 million is up 41%. So, our margin is up significantly to $8.7 million from the $8.0 million, which is an increase of 70 basis points. So, our total operating profit was up 10% in the second quarter and our operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to $8.9 billion. This follows a 20 basis point margin improvement in the first quarter. And for the six months, our total operating margin is 8.4%, which is up 20 basis points from 2013. Especially encouraging is our overall growth is supported by year-to-date margin expansion in each of our four businesses. So, we are very pleased to report this level of progress and we remain focused on continued margin expansion in the periods ahead. We had net interest expense of $6.2 million in the second quarter, which is down from the $7.9 million last year. For the six months, interest expense is $12.4 million and we expect this cost to remain relatively steady over the balance of 2014. We currently estimate $24 million in net interest expense for the full year. Our total amortization expense of $8.5 million for the second quarter and it\u2019s $17.4 million for the six months. Our year-to-date amortization is up from last year due to the acquisition activity across our four segments. We expect amortization expense to be in the $35 million to $37 million range for the year. The other line, which reflects corporate expense, was a $25 million expense for the second quarter. This is an increase from last year, but relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2014 corporate expense. In the second quarter last year, this line was a $14 million income item, which reflects the $36 million positive purchase accounting adjustment that we covered earlier. For the six months, this line shows an expense of $48 million, which is up from $36 million last year, excluding the accounting adjustment. This increase reflects higher expenses for a variety of items, including legal and professional, insurance and incentive-related costs. Currently, we expect this line to be in the $80 million to $90 million range for 2014. For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 36.25% compared to 31.3% last year. For the six months, our 35.9% rate compares to 32.8% for the same period last year. The increase in our tax rates for both the second quarter and the six months relates primarily to last year\u2019s favorable tax rate on the gain that was generated by the re-measurement of our Asia-Pac investment. Looking ahead, we expect our full year tax rate to be in the 36.0% to 36.3% range for 2014. As Tom mentioned, net income for the quarter was $198 million and EPS was $1.28 and on a comparative basis, both our net income and EPS increased by 9% from the second quarter in 2013. For the six months, our net income of $355 million is up 9% on a comparative basis and our EPS of $2.30 is up 10% on a comparative basis. So now, we will discuss a few key balance sheet items. Our cash at June 30 was $153 million, which is down from $197 million in June 2013 and also at December 31. We continue to use our cash to support the growth initiatives in each of our businesses and we remain comfortable with our cash position at June 30. Our accounts receivable of $1.9 billion at June 30 increased 8.5% from the same period in 2013, which is slightly higher than our 6% sales increase for the quarter. We remained focused on our goal of growing receivables at a rate less than the revenue growth. And we see room for improvement in this area in the periods ahead. We are also very satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time. Inventory at quarter end was $3.0 billion, which is up approximately 1% from December 31 and up 7% from June 30 of last year. Before the impact of acquisitions, our inventory is basically unchanged from December 31 and up only 4% from last June. So our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels. We will remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward through the year. Our accounts payable balance at June 30 was $2.5 billion, up 21% from June 2013 due to the positive impact of extended payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors as well as the impact of acquisitions. Our continued improvement in this area and its positive impact on our working capital and days in payables is encouraging and we expect this favorable trend to continue in the periods ahead. Our working capital of $2.0 billion at June 30 compares to $1.8 billion at June 30, 2013. Effectively managing accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable is a very high priority for our company. And our ongoing efforts with these key accounts have resulted in solid improvement in our working capital position and our cash flow. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition at June 30, 2014. Our total debt of $806 million at June 30 is down from the $900 million at June 30 last year and represents approximately 19% of total capitalization. Our June 30 debt includes two $250 million term notes as well as another $306 million in borrowings under our multi-currency syndicated credit facility. We are comfortable with our capital structure at this time although we may choose to pay down some of our debt outstanding under the credit facility during the year depending on the investment opportunities that could arise. Thus far in 2014, our cash from operations is approximately $367 million and for the full year we currently expect cash from operations to be approximately $950 million. We expect free cash flow which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be in the $450 million range. We are pleased with the continued strength of our cash flow and we remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our first priority for cash is the dividend, which we have paid every year since going public in 1948 and have now raised for 58 consecutive years, a record continues to distinguish Genuine Parts from other companies. Our annual dividend of $2.30 per share for 2014 represents a 7% increase from the $2.15 per share paid in 2013 and it\u2019s approximately 52% of our 2013 earnings per share, which is well within our goal of 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our core businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. Our investment and capital expenditures was $21.5 million for the second quarter, and is $39.9 million for the six months. Although these expenditures are down from the second quarter and the six months in 2013, we currently expect our capital expenditures to pick up over the balance of the year. We currently look for CapEx spending to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million which compares to the $124 million last year. As usual, the vast majority of our investments will be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in technology. Our depreciation and amortization was $37 million in the second quarter, which is consistent with the prior year and at $74 million for the six months which is up from the $63 million in the prior year. This six month increase on this line reflects the impact of GPC Asia-Pacific as well as our more recent acquisitions and we currently expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $145 million to $155 million for the full year. Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of cash for us and they are integral to the growth plans for the company. For the second quarter, we have added four acquisitions, including one in each of our four business segments and with estimated annual revenues totaling approximately $255 million. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we added our fifth acquisition for the year on July 1 with the addition of Impact Products to the office products group. We are encouraged by the growth opportunities we see for each of these acquisitions and will continue to seek new acquisitions across our businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth and generally targeting those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range. Finally, thus far in 2014, we have used our cash to purchase approximately 635,000 shares of our common stock under the company\u2019s share repurchase program. Today, we have another 10 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. And while we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program over the balance of the year. We continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. So, that\u2019s our financial update. And in closing, we want to thank all of our GPC associates for all that they do. It\u2019s a team effort here and everyone\u2019s hard work is truly appreciated. The company is well-positioned for continued growth over the balance of the year and beyond and we look forward to updating you on our future progress when we report again. I will now turn it back over to Tom. Tom Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Paul and Carol. So, that\u2019s a recap of our second quarter and first half results. And as we look back over the past two quarters, we feel that our folks have made good progress in a number of key areas. Our sales and earnings on a comparative basis at the mid-year point are at record levels and all four of our business segments are showing year-to-date operating margin improvements. On the balance sheet side, accounts receivable and inventory have been managed well and accounts payable continues to trend in the right direction. Cash from operations is solid and working capital efficiency has shown nice improvement. From an individual business perspective as we look back over the first six months of the year, we are encouraged by the steady and consistent performance in our automotive business on a comparative basis and we are encouraged as well by the sequential improvements in our non-automotive businesses. At the same time, we are a bit unclear as to where we are in the economic cycle. While most of the external indicators and indices are generally favorable for all of our businesses, we still hear and sense a degree of uncertainty and caution among many of our customer base and the strength of the economic recovery is a bit weaker than many had predicted. Additionally, we still have the variability of currency exchange which as we said earlier impacted us by over 1% both on the revenue and earnings side in the quarter and first half of the year. With all of that said, however, based upon our performance year-to-date and the solid initiatives that are underway across each of our businesses, we feel that a few modest upward adjustments in our revenue guidance are appropriate. At this point, we would leave industrial and electrical the same. Our prior guidance was plus 5 to plus 7 for industrial, which we would leave the same. Electrical was 25 to 30 and we\u2019ll leave that the same. But in the automotive segment, we think we need to increase the prior guidance of plus 6 to plus 7 to current guidance of plus 7 to plus 8. In office products, our prior guidance was plus 3 to plus 4. And at this point, we would raise it to plus 6 to plus 7. And this increase for office products includes the contribution from the Impact Products acquisition in the second half of the year as well as the increased business that we will be getting from the new Office Depot agreement. The net result of all of this is that we would increase our overall GPC guidance from a prior 6% to 8% increase to a current 7% to 8% increase. And on the earning side, we feel that an upward adjustment is also appropriate. Our prior guidance called for earnings per share of being in the $4.49 to $4.59 range and at this point we would raise that to $4.54 to $4.60, which would give us an EPS increase of 3% to 5% on a reported basis and 8% to 10% on a comparative basis. So that will conclude our prepared comments. And at this point, we will turn the call back to Holly to take your questions. Holly? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs : Hi, good morning. This is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. How are you? Tom Gallagher : We are fine. We hope you are. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs : Hi, thank you. We just had a quick couple of questions. We wanted to check if there is any impact for you winning the consolidated Office Depot of snacks business now that particularly as the business shifts to you as the acquisition seasons? Tom Gallagher : Well, what we have said in our prior call was that on an annualized basis this will yield about $100 million in annual revenue. The revenue is starting to shift currently. We have said prior that it would start to kick in on July 1 and it is in fact starting to flow through currently. And then there was a question in the prior call as to whether or not this would impact our gross margins and we said that it would have some impact on the gross but we will get some leverage off of the increased volume as well. Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs : Alright. Perfect. Thank you. And my second question relates to your industrial margins, we wanted to basically understand is there potential for stronger recovery on industrial margins, particularly now that you are starting to see some revenue growth and as this growth continues to persist into the year? Tom Gallagher : If in fact the growth continues in the high-single digit levels, yes we would think that there might be some opportunity for margin expansion. Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs : Alright. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Tom Gallagher : Alright. Thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from the line at Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Thanks. Good morning. Tom Gallagher : Good morning Chris. Carol Yancey : Good morning Chris. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: A couple of questions on the updated guidance, so the increase in auto and office is that mainly and each one of those reflecting the year-to-date and then in the case of the office now you have this acquisition or are you inherently raising your outlook for the back half as well? Tom Gallagher : Well, I think it\u2019s a combination. The first part of your comment I think is accurate. We have seen \u2013 we will see the impact in office products of the Impact Products acquisition as well as increased Office Depot business which will have a positive impact. In the case of automotive, we have seen some \u2013 we think pretty good performance from the automotive team. We think the external factors are generally positive and our expectation is that based upon where we ended the first half of the year that something in that 7% to 8% range is a reasonable expectation for us on the automotive side. I would just add one other thing, Chris. We were a little bit encouraged by a couple of things in office products. It may be too early to tell if it\u2019s a trend. But I mentioned in my comments that we did see sequential improvement in all four of the major product categories. And then we also saw improved performance coming from our independent resellers which our team has been working on for quite some time and hopefully that\u2019s the beginning of what maybe some sustainable positive growth coming from that important part of our business. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Okay. So then just to clarify, it sounds like auto is sort of what we are seeing year-to-date passing out through to the revenue outlook for the year or whereas in the office there is the acquisition and some encouraging signs that\u2019s taken your confidence up as to actual back half outlook? Tom Gallagher : I think that\u2019s accurate. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Okay. I know your last year you mentioned June being a pretty wet month out there, are you normally hoping for very hot weather, so cars are breaking down or was that actually a drag to the auto performance in June? Paul Donahue : Yes. Chris this is Paul, certainly a bit of a drag. What we had hoped for coming off that brutal winter we had in many parts of the country was to move right into the hot summer. And we have not seen that in most parts of the country and certainly June being as wet as it was, we did not see the kind of lift that we normally would have with some hotter temperatures across the country. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: But is \u2013 I guess is your \u2013 does that suggest that or how do you think that plays out than as you look out over this summer and then to the balance of the year I mean the lag impact from the weather, is your outlook anymore positive or negative as a result of June\u2019s outcomes? Tom Gallagher : I don\u2019t think our attitude is anymore negative. If we get a hot stretch we get two weeks of unusually warm weather, yet in July or in August, we think that we will see some positive impact from that, but even absent that, I think that the performance that Paul had outlined both on the retail side and on the commercial side, Major Accounts, NAPA AutoCare, I think those results are really what give us a little more confidence in partly why we have raised our guidance. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Understood, very clear. Thanks very much. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thanks, Chris. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Chris. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli & Company. Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: Hi, good morning Tom. Hi Carol. Hi, Paul, how are you? Carol Yancey : Good morning, Brian. Paul Donahue : Good, Brian. Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: A question on just within auto, you\u2019ve got a lot of changing dynamics regarding the competitive landscape, what are you seeing as far as maybe your ability to either gain some share this quarter or do you think that, that you are performing in line with your peers? Paul Donahue : Well, Brian, this is Paul. We are the first ones out. So, we will hear our peer group here in the weeks ahead, but we are pleased with our quarter. It\u2019s consistent with our first quarter and it\u2019s consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. And we are very pleased with the cadence of the quarter, April was strong, May was strong, June as was referenced earlier was a bit softer, but the comps get tougher in the second half. And I think I referenced that in my comments. But we are pleased with where we find ourselves and with the initiatives that the guys are all working on it. Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: Any opportunities to \u2013 have you taken in any prior Carquest distributors into the NAPA family? Tom Gallagher : We have taken some, Brian and hopefully we will take some more as time goes on. Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: What do you think has been the biggest differentiator for you in having those crossovers take place? Tom Gallagher : But I think those that have made the change have benefited from the comprehensiveness of the NAPA program. And I think they have been surprised by the strength of the NAPA program. And I think they are pretty outspoken in terms of what is done for them and their business. So, hopefully there will be a few more that will make their way to the NAPA system in the months ahead. Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: And the other three businesses, if I am looking at the last eight months or so you guys have obviously been very acquisitive, what does that pipeline look like now for potential deals and just do you think you have another good 12-month, 24-month runway, where you can be this acquisitive? Tom Gallagher : Well, in the acquisition side of it, you never know what the timing is going to be. And you have always got to have a number of discussions going on at any given time. So, I think the best way I could answer that is to say that we have multiple discussions that are occurring, but we will have to wait and see how many of them actually develop and come to fruition, but we are pleased with where we find ourselves in terms of the discussions and we are certainly proud of the team for what they have been able to get done over the past year or so. Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: If you were to find something that would be the size of an Exego either in any of your four groups, would that side scare you at this point or would you be open to it? Tom Gallagher : No, I don\u2019t think we would be intimidated by the size. It really is a function of how accretive it could be to the shareholders at Genuine Parts Company. And if we can find any business that we acquire needs to be accretive to GPC. We don\u2019t knowingly do any acquisitions that are dilutive. So, the size is not the most critical factor. It\u2019s what we think the performance will be post-acquisition. Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: Alright. And just last one from me. Carol, I think I heard you say that you may look to pay down some debt with cash flow as the year progresses, if you are paying 3% on your debt and you get a 2.6% current return on given the dividend, why wouldn\u2019t share repurchase, more aggressive share repurchase be the right use of capital there? Carol Yancey : Well, Brian, we are not committing to anything. What we are doing is trying to keep some flexibility as we look at our balance sheet and our capital structure so and keeping that flexibility be it incremental share repurchases or an acquisition opportunity. So, we are just trying to balance. We haven\u2019t totally committed on what we are going to do on the debt. We are just going to look to balance what our cash needs are and what makes the most sense for the shareholder. Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company: Alright, thank you very much. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Brian. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Good morning. Tom Gallagher : Good morning Bret. Carol Yancey : Good morning Bret. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Couple of quick questions and in your prepared remarks you had mentioned some gross margin pressure in the automotive from customer and product mix, could you give us a little bit more color, is that just a migration to national accounts or is there anything changing on the promotional environment on the products side? Carol Yancey : I guess I will give a couple of comments and then Paul might comment as well. One of the things we are talking about is the product and customer mix across all of our businesses, but primarily not with automotive and office. So as Paul mentioned the key wholesale programs that we have and talking about some of those with the double-digit growth and those would be generally at a lower gross margin and then on the product mix we called out a couple of product categories that do come in at a little bit lower gross margin. But I would point out that we continue to have programs in gross margin, all of our businesses have key things going on, on the buy side and sales side to hopefully get those margins back up or at least flat. But the really nice thing is we have been able to do on the SG&A side so what you are getting is we saw that volume going through is we are able to leverage more on the expenses. So the teams and primarily auto have a done a terrific job on the SG&A line for us. Paul Donahue : And Bert to the second part of your question there hasn\u2019t been any fundamental change in promotional activity. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : : Paul Donahue : Well. We don\u2019t breakout the Australian numbers, but we can tell you that they are performing in line with our expectations and they are performing in line with our overall automotive business. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then one last question on the accounts payable, it\u2019s a pretty good number there. If we look at the business lines separately and clearly the auto vendors are more used to being asked for extended payables. I guess how much room is left if your \u2013 is auto getting close to 100% APed inventory and the other \u2013 other segments need to raise theirs or is there still room to extend payables on the automotive vendor side? Tom Gallagher : I think we still have some room we have ahead of us on the automotive. And you are right in your comment that this is much more prevalent than the automotive business than it is in the other businesses that we are in. But I think there is still some opportunity for us in the non-automotive businesses. So I think in the quarters ahead you will continue to see some nice improvement. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : And with Exego\u2019s payables been well levered as well or is there still would there be more room within the Exego? Tom Gallagher : Well, I think we will just leave that there is still room in the automotive side of the business and we feel good about our prospects honestly. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks. Is there a target for APed inventories you have out there sort of on a two or three year basis company side? Carol Yancey : We don\u2019t have a stated target, I guess what we look at is our working capital and we have \u2013 we make sure that we have plans in place for all the categories for improvement each year, so no specific target. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay, great. Thank you. Carol Yancey : Nice Brett. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush: Good morning. Tom Gallagher : Good morning Seth. Carol Yancey : Good morning Seth. Seth Basham - Wedbush: The first question I have to you goes on some small cost items for clarification, it seems like you have bumped up the cost expectations for the other line as well as D&A, can you just give us some more color as to the drivers there? Carol Yancey : Well, I think as we called out on the other lines, what we are seeing is some of the legal and professional, insurance and some of our incentives related costs. So that would primarily be what\u2019s driving that line and some of it is in the technology area, we mentioned some of our technology improvements. So that\u2019s primarily what\u2019s driving that line. And then the other depreciation and amortization, was that your other one? Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush: Yes. Carol Yancey : Yes, the depreciation and amortization that\u2019s the combination of a function of the additional acquisitions and the amortization that flowed in. And then the incremental depreciation if we look what our increase in CapEx is going to be on the full year. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush: Got it. Okay. Despite those bumps up, obviously you guys had great SG&A leverage you are expecting SG&A leverage going forward, was there anything different about this quarter relative to last in terms of the cost base and some of the moving pieces that drove the strong leverage? Carol Yancey : I would just comment as we mentioned \u2013 that both Tom and Paul mentioned as you look from Q4 to Q1 and Q2 where we saw the sequential improvement especially in the non-automotive businesses or as you look at their core business improving over the last quarter or two, Q2 being the stronger one. What we are getting is additional leverage off the SG&A there. Seth Basham - Wedbush: Got it. And within auto itself, did you have better SG&A leverage this quarter even with the same type of top line growth? Carol Yancey : Well, we did. And I mentioned that earlier, automotive, again with that strong volume that\u2019s pushing through, we are having some nice improvement on their SG&A as well. Seth Basham - Wedbush: Got it. Okay. And then looking at Exego, can you give us anymore color on how you think you can grow that business going forward? Have you examined the growth opportunities? Do you have any color to share? Tom Gallagher : We have examined it. And we think there were several opportunities there. I think that expanding the store count will help us as we go forward and that can either be organic growth or perhaps acquiring some smaller independent companies and then some product line extensions we think will help them in their growth strategy going forward. So, we are pretty optimistic about what can happen with that business. Seth Basham - Wedbush: And that\u2019s all within existing geographies? Tom Gallagher : Well, that would be in existing geography. And then at the outset when we made the acquisition, we have said that our first priority would be to continue to build out and enhance market share in Australia, New Zealand and then medium term, we would be looking to use that company as a platform company to expand up into some Southeast Asian markets, which we still think could make some sense. Seth Basham - Wedbush: Got it. Thanks a lot. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Michael Montani, ISI Group. Michael Montani - ISI Group : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom Gallagher : Hey, Mike. Carol Yancey : Hey, Mike. Michael Montani - ISI Group : First one was for Carol, just wanted to understand how you guys are thinking about gross margins for the back half. I think from the last quarter\u2019s call, it sounded like there was opportunity for slight upside to gross margins and now I am hearing kind of around 30. So, is there any initiatives maybe you have on track that could kind of take those margins up all else equal or is it really going to be a function of customer mix and product mix? Carol Yancey : What \u2013 I think what we are saying is we are getting a little bit further down we are saying around 30%. I mean, we certainly as I mentioned all four of our businesses have committees and a lot of initiatives going on, where they are looking at a lot of things, but I think some of the things that are headwinds to us will remain and some of that as I talked about within automotive and their key large customers, but we have got initiatives working in all our areas. And I think I guess that will be helpful just to maintain those margins or not have the deterioration that we have had, but certainly we are combining that with our SG&A improvement and the idea would be that we maintain this 20 basis point improvement in operating margin that we have right now. Michael Montani - ISI Group : Alright, okay. Thank you. And a follow-up for Paul if I could on the auto side, there has been so much made of kind of volatility in weather and you touched on it somewhat, but the way we have been thinking about it is maybe like a low double-digit increase in April could still be up low to mid single, can you provide any color in terms of either how you guys exited, what July looks like or really what the sequential moderation would have been there? Paul Donahue : So, Mike, we came out of Q1 as you know very strong and that continued right through both April and May. We saw some deceleration in June. And while it was still a good month, we were certainly up against some stronger comps. And I would say that early in July, just a couple of weeks in, we are seeing some of those same, I don\u2019t want to say softness, but it\u2019s not at the run rate at April and May. Michael Montani - ISI Group : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess the last question I had was just on the mega versus independent splits, in the past you guys have provided some color there in terms of year-over-year growth, can you provide an update there perhaps Tom or just how should we think about the balance between those two? Tom Gallagher : But the mega growth was mid single-digit and the independent growth was just a tick down from that. And as I said, it\u2019s the first positive quarter that we have seen on the independent side in six quarters. So, we were pleased to see it and it\u2019s the closest comparable performance we have seen between the two over that same time period. Michael Montani - ISI Group : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Good luck. Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Mike. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Mike. Operator : And we do have time for one final question. Your final question for today will come from the line of Liang Feng with Morningstar. Liang Feng - Morningstar: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Liang Feng - Morningstar: Could you discuss in further detail the main drivers of your Major Accounts growth and whether your go to market strategy in this segment has changed a lot to help drive this double-digit performance? Tom Gallagher : I will take a first step at it and Paul may jump in. The way the program is structured is that we have headquarters to headquarters contact. And we talk about what our capabilities might be and what our value proposition might be to a major account. If there is an interest on their part to expanding the relationship, some of the terms and conditions are negotiated at the headquarters level. But then the actual implementation is done at the store level, market by market. And our proposition to the major accounts hasn\u2019t changed for a number of years. Perhaps our consistency, dependability, our level of execution in the field may be partly what\u2019s driving that at the rates that we are growing today. Paul Donahue : Yes. I would just add to that that we have got great relationships with our key partners on the major accounts side. So you are talking about the likes of AAA, and Firestone, and Goodyear tire kingdom. Our competitors are chasing that business as well. We have got a very focused effort. We have got a great team that works very hard to grow our market share inside of those major accounts. And our team has done a very good job as I think is evident in our recent numbers. Liang Feng - Morningstar: Yes. This performance is particularly notable because several of your larger competitors have noted the desire to target major accounts more aggressively, have you noticed any changes within your competition from these larger competitors within this field? Paul Donahue : No, I would just say that everyday the battle, right. Whether it\u2019s major accounts or the business on the street, but we have not seen a major change in the levels of competition with our majors. Liang Feng - Morningstar: Thank you. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer portion. I would like to turn the conference call back over to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : We want to thank everybody for participating in today\u2019s call. And we appreciate your interest in and support of Genuine Parts Company. And we look forward to reporting back out at our third quarter release. Thank you. Operator : And once again we like to thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn today\u2019s conference call over to Mr. Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sid Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts third quarter 2014 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company\u2019s latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom? Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Sid. And I would also like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President along with Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and I will each handle a portion of today\u2019s call. And once we have completed our individual remarks, we will look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have. Earlier this morning we released our third quarter results and hopefully you have had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were 3.986 billion, and this was up 8% over the prior year. Operating income was 298.3 million, which was up 10%; net income was 190.5 million, which was also up 10% and our earnings per share were $1.24 this year compared to $1.12 last year, which is an 11% increase. So with revenues up 8%, net income up 10% and EPS up 11%, we feel that we came through the quarter in good shape. And as you will hear from Carol in a few minutes, all four of our business segments were able to show operating margin improvement in the quarter, which is encouraging and in our opinion indicative of an overall good job done by each of our management teams. Turning to the individual performances by business segment, as we customarily do, I\u2019ll make a few comments on the non-automotive operations and then Paul will follow with an overview of the Automotive segment. Starting with industrial. This is our second largest segment representing 31% of total company revenues on a year-to-date basis. We\u2019re pleased to report another solid quarter from the industrial team. Sales were up 10% and this continues the trend of sequentially strengthening sales results going back to the final quarter of last year. After being up 3% in the fourth quarter of 2013, we were up 4% in the first quarter, 7% in the second quarter and 10% in the third quarter. And if we look at it without acquisitions and foreign exchange impact, in the first quarter were up 2%, second quarter up 4% and third quarter up 8%. So a nice trend in the sales progression and our industrial operations are now up 7% year-to-date. And looking a bit more closely at the results on a product basis, we\u2019re pleased to see positive growth across all of our major product categories in the quarter. And then from a customer perspective, 11 of our top 12 customer segments are showing growth in the quarter as well. The strongest segments in alphabetical order are automotive, coal and aggregate, iron and steel, lumber and wood products and pulp and paper. And similar to our overall sales results for the quarter, each of our top 12 customer categories had their strongest sales increases of the year, perhaps reflective of further strengthening in the industrial segment of the economy, which should bode well for our industrial business in the quarters ahead. Moving on to EIS, our electrical, electronic and wire and cable segment, we\u2019re pleased to be able to report another strong revenue quarter with sales up 35%, which is the strongest quarter of the year. However, it is important to point out that most of our revenue increase is attributable to acquisitions completed over the past 12 months and the underlying business is up just slightly similar to what we have seen pretty much all year long. Lower copper prices had been a slight headwind to our revenue growth on the electrical side, but more significant has been the deferred demand that we have seen from telecommunication customers in the wire and cable segment and reduced demand from several contract manufacturers in the electronic segment. While we don\u2019t anticipate significant changes in any of these specific situations until early 2015, we do see some modest improvement in the early days of the fourth quarter. And this, combined with the acquisition revenue, will enable EIS to report a strong finish to the year. Switching to the office product segment, S. P. Richards turned in a fine quarter with sales up 15%. As with our industrial operations, we have seen nice sequential improvement from the office products group. In the fourth quarter of last year they were down 4%, they were even in the first quarter of this year and then up 4% in Q2 and up 15% in Q3. And looking at it without acquisitions and currency exchange impact, we were down 4% in the fourth quarter of last year, down 1% in the first quarter of this year and then up 2% in Q2 and up 8% in Q3. As just referenced, acquisitions accounted for approximately seven points to the increase in the third quarter and the increased volume from our new Office Depot agreement was a significant contributor as well. However, we were encouraged with the mid single digit growth that we saw with our independent office products resellers. This is back-to-back solid quarters with this important segment of our customer base and we\u2019re pleased with the results that we\u2019re seeing here. We\u2019re also pleased to see solid results across all four of our main product categories. Technology products, core office supplies and furniture reached up mid to high single digit in the quarter and facility and breakroom supplies were up low double digit. So good results across all of the product categories as well as across our two primary customer categories, the independent resellers on the megas and we\u2019re pleased with the consistency and the balance that we saw in our sales results in the quarter. And importantly, we feel that the office products team is well positioned to end the year in good shape. So that\u2019s a brief overview of our non-automotive businesses. And at this point we will ask Paul to bring up-to-date on the automotive segment. Paul? Paul Donahue :  Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone and let me add my welcome to our quarterly conference call. I\u2019m pleased to join you today and to have an opportunity to provide you an update on the third quarter performance of our automotive business. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, our automotive business grew top line revenues by 4% in the third quarter. This essentially reflects our core automotive growth for the quarter of 4.4%. This sales increase was in line with our expectations. We were able to deliver on our commitments in spite of the milder than normal temperatures here in the U.S., evidence of our teams out in the field continuing to perform at a high level. When evaluating on our quarterly performance, we\u2019re encouraged by the solid results across our automotive businesses, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Australia and New Zealand. In the U.S., all regions of the country are positively contributing to our sales growth. As has been the case the past several quarters, our Midwest and Central divisions continue to lead the way for the company. We also saw solid sales growth in the Southern, Atlantic and Mountain regions of the country. Turning to our U.S. company owned same store sales. Comp store sales growth in the third quarter came in at plus 6%. This 6% increase is on top of 4% in the same quarter of 2013, giving us a two year stack of plus 10%. This solid performance continues to run up strong same store sales numbers dating back to the fourth quarter of 2013 when our team delivered a 7% increase. The NAPA team continued to execute well as they delivered an 8% increase in the first quarter of 2014 followed up with a 7% increase last quarter. While we\u2019re pleased with these strong numbers, we also are well aware of the tougher comps facing us in the quarters ahead. Our sales increase in Q3 was bolstered by continued strong growth in our commercial wholesale segment. We followed up our 7% increase in Q2 with another healthy increase of 6% in the third quarter. As most of you know, the key drivers of our commercial business are the NAPA AutoCare centers and our strong alliance with our major account customers. These two big wholesale initiatives continue to exceed expectations and we\u2019re proud of our dedicated teams in both these businesses. Let\u2019s start with our major account business. This important segment of our business delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of low double digit sales growth. And turning to our NAPA AutoCare centers, we continue to grow the overall number of AutoCare centers, now totaling over 15,500. This team posted high single digit sales increase in the quarter and through nine months they were up low double digits year-over-year. So all in all, another fine performance by these two segments of our commercial business. Another segment of our commercial business worth breaking out is our all important fleet business. As a reminder, this segment posted a 6% increase in the second quarter and we followed that up with a 7% increase in the third quarter. This strong performance puts us at plus 7% through three quarters. We can also report improving trends in our average wholesale ticket value with little to no inflation support. We are also encouraged to see our average number of tickets continuing to increase. We continue to be pleased with our improved performance in our retail business. This segment of our business grew 5% in the third quarter. And if you'll recall, our retail business generated a 9% increase in the first quarter and a 7% increase in the second quarter. As we saw with our wholesale business, we generated a mid single digit increase in our average retail ticket value while we experienced a slight decline in our average number of retail tickets in the quarter. Our team has been working hard to drive both increased foot traffic and our average retail ticket value. These efforts are beginning to take hold and we\u2019re pleased with this performance through nine months. Now, let\u2019s take a look at the product categories driving our growth. Our heavy duty business continues to post strong results as this group generated low double digit growth in the quarter. We also experienced low double digit growth in our brake business and strong growth from our tool and equipment business. Core product categories like chassis, ride control and our filter business, all experienced mid to high single digit growth. Conversely, the milder temps experienced this summer had a negative impact on our heating and cooling product sales. So in summary, we\u2019re encouraged by the growth opportunities available to us in both the retail and commercial sectors of the automotive aftermarket. While we have much work ahead of us, we remain optimistic that the initiatives our team is focused on will continue to drive strong results. We would also add that the industry fundamentals remain steady and positive for the aftermarket. The average age of vehicles on the road remains in excess of 11 years, the total fleet is large and growing and deferred maintenance remains at historically high numbers. Likewise, important metrics such as the price of gasoline and miles driven are trending favorable. Fuel prices continue to decrease and accordingly miles driven have increased now for the sixth consecutive month through August and stand at plus 0.6% year-to-date.  In closing, we\u2019re pleased with our third quarter results as well as our year-to-date performance. While we didn\u2019t experience a hot summer we\u2019re all hoping for, our NAPA team persevered and delivered another in a series of good quarters. We are proud of our management team and know they remain committed to driving profitable growth throughout 2014 and beyond. We would like to personally thank all of our associates both at NAPA North America and at GPC Asia-Pac and Australia and New Zealand for their efforts in the third quarter. So that completes our overview of the automotive business. And at this time I\u2019ll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol? Carol Yancey :  Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with a review of our third quarter and nine month income statements and the segment information and then we will review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back up to wrap it up and then we will open the call up to your questions. As Tom mentioned, our total revenues were a record 4 billion for the third quarter, an increase of 8% from last year, which includes the 5% underlying sales growth, a 3% contribution from acquisitions, and this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 0.5%. Our gross profit for the third quarter was 29.7% of sales compared to the 29.9% gross margin reported last year. For the nine months, our gross margin of 29.9% compares to the 29.6% reported last year or 29.8% excluding the one time purchase accounting adjustment in 2013 that\u2019s previously been disclosed and also referenced in today\u2019s press release. The pressure on our third quarter gross margin reflects the impact of our ongoing customer and product mix shifts that we see in our businesses. For 2014, we expect our margins to approach the 30% range with the gradual expectation of margin expansion in 2015 and the years ahead. This is an area that is receiving a good bit of our management team's attention. As an additional point of interest, we\u2019re seeing some slight inflation in our nonautomotive businesses year-to-date, but we continue to see very little inflation in automotive and we don\u2019t expect this to change over the balance of the year. Our year-to-date cumulative pricing for 2014 is 0.2% in automotive, 1.2% in industrial, 1.2% in office products, and 0.3% in electrical. Turning to our SG&A. Our total expenses were 885 million in the third quarter, which is an improvement of 30 basis points to 22.2% compared to the 22.5% reported last year. For the nine months, our total SG&A expenses are 2.6 billion, which is 22.5% of sales, compared to 22% in 2013 or 22.5% before the purchase accounting adjustment mentioned earlier. The improvement in our third quarter SG&A expenses continue to reflect a combination of our cost savings associated with the freeze of our pension plan effective January 1st as well as the ongoing benefits of our cost saving initiatives and expense leverage. We remain focused on effectively managing our cost in every area of our business and through these initiatives we expect to show continued progress on our SG&A line in the periods ahead. Now let\u2019s discuss the results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the third quarter was 2.1 billion and represents 52% of total sales and is up 4%. Our operating profit of 193 million is up 7.3%, so their margin improved by 30 basis points to 9.2% from the 8.9% last year. For the nine months, our automotive sales of 6.1 billion is up 10%. Our operating profit of 550 million is up 12.8% and our margin is up 20 basis points year-to-date to 9.0%. Our industrial sales were 1.2 billion in the third quarter and this is 31% of our total revenues and up 10% from 2013. Our operating profit of 95.3 million is up 20% and our operating margin expanded a strong 60 basis points to 7.8% from the 7.2% last year. Year-to-date industrial sales of 3.57 billion are up 7%. Our operating profit of 274 million is up 10.7% and our margin of 7.7% is up 30 basis points from last year. Our office products revenues were 497 million in the quarter or 12% of total revenues and up a very strong 15.4%. Our operating profit of 33.3 million is up 19%, so their operating margin increased by 20 basis points to 6.7%. For the nine months, office revenues of 1.3 million represent 11% of the total and are up 6.4%. Our operating profit of 98.4 million is up 8% and our margin is up 10 basis points from last year to 7.4%. The electrical group had sales in the third quarter of 193 million and that's 5% of our revenue and up 35%. Operating profit of 17.8 million is up 41% and their margin is 9.2% which is up 40 basis points from last year\u2019s 8.8%. Year-to-date sales for this group are 562 million or up 32%, and our operating profit of 50 million is up 41%. So our margin is up nicely to 8.9% from the 8.3% last year which is a solid increase of 60 basis points. So our total operating profit was up 13% in the third quarter and our margin improved 30 basis points to 8.5%. This increase follows a 20 and 30 basis point margin improvement in the first and second quarters respectively. So for the nine months, our total operating margin is 8.4%, which is up 20 basis points from 2013. As covered earlier, our overall margin expansion is supported by increases in each of our four business segments in both the quarter and the nine months. So we\u2019re encouraged by this progress and we remain focused on continued margin expansion in the periods ahead. We had net interest expense of 6.3 million in the third quarter which is down from the 7 million last year. For the nine months, interest expense is 18.7 million and we expect this cost to remain relatively steady over the balance of 2014. We currently estimate interest expense to be 24 million to 25 million for the full year. Our total amortization was 8.9 million for the third quarter and this is 26.3 million for the nine months. Year-to-date our amortization is up from last year due to the acquisition activity across all four of our segments. We expect amortization expense to be in the 35 million to 36 million range for the full year. The other line which reflects our corporate expense was 26 million expense for the third quarter, which is relatively consistent with the first and second quarters, although up from last year. The increase from 2013 reflects an unfavorable $4 million swing associated with our retirement plan valuation adjustment as well as higher expenses for a variety of items including legal and professional, insurance and incentive related costs which have continued to impact this line item. For the nine months, this line shows 75 million of expense and this is up from the 47 million last year excluding the one-time purchase accounting adjustment in 2013 of 33 million. Currently we expect this line to be in the 90 million to 95 million range for 2014. Our tax rate was approximately 36.1% for the third quarter of 2014 and 2013. For the nine months, our 36% tax rate compares to a 34% tax rate for the same period the prior year. The increase in our nine months tax rate is primarily due to last year\u2019s favorable tax rate on the one-time purchase accounting gain. Looking ahead, we expect our full year tax rate for 2014 to be in the 36% range. Our net income for the quarter at 190.5 million compares to the 173.7 million or up 10%. Our EPS of $1.24 compared to the $1.12 last year is up 11% and for the nine months our net income of 546 million is up 9% and our EPS of $3.53 is up 10% from the nine months of 2013 on a comparative basis. Now let\u2019s discuss some of the balance sheet items. Our cash at September 30th was 136 million, which was down from approximately 321 million last September and 197 million at December 31st. We continue to use our cash to support the growth initiatives in each of our businesses and we remain comfortable with our cash position at September 30th. Our accounts receivable of 2 billion at September 30th increased 12% from the same period in 2013 on an 8% sales increase for the quarter. We remain focused on our goal of growing receivables at a rate less than the revenue growth and we have some work to do in this area in the periods ahead. But we\u2019re very satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time. Our inventory at quarter end was 3 billion which is up approximately 6% from last September and up only 2% from December 31st. Before the impact of acquisitions, inventory is basically unchanged from year-end and up 3% from last September so our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels. We will remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward during the year and also into 2015. Our accounts payable balance at September 30th was 2.5 billion or up 15% from September 2013 and this is due to the positive impact of our extended payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors and to a lesser extent the impact of acquisitions. Our continued improvement in this area and its positive impact on our working capital in days and payables is encouraging. We expect this favorable trend to continue in the periods ahead. Our working capital of 1.9 billion at September 30th compares to 1.8 billion at December 30th of 2013, an increase of 6%. Effectively managing accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable is a very high priority for our company and our ongoing efforts with these key accounts have resulted in solid improvement in our working capital and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition at September 30, 2014. The total debt of 835 million at September 30th is relatively unchanged from last year and it represents approximately 19% of our total capitalization. The September 30, 2014 debt includes two 250 million term notes as well as another 335 million in borrowings under our multi-currency syndicated credit facility agreement. We are comfortable with our capital structure at this time. Thus far in 2014, our cash from operations is approximately 586 million and for the full year, we currently expect cash from operations to be approximately 900 million. We expect free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the 425 million to 450 million range. We are pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows and we remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our first priority for cash is the dividend which we have paid every year since going public in 1948 and have now raised for 58 consecutive years. Our annual dividend of $2.30 per share in 2014 represents a 7% increase from the $2.15 per share paid in 2013 and that\u2019s approximately 52% of our 2013 earnings and that is well within our goal of the 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal will be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our core businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. Our investment in capital expenditures was 34 million for the third quarter and 74 million for the nine months. We currently expect our capital expenditures to pick up further over the balance of the year and we look for our CapEx expending to be in the range of 120 million to 130 million for the full year. This is down slightly from our previous estimate of 130 million to 140 million, but in line with our prior year CapEx of 124 million. As usual, the vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in technology. Depreciation and amortization was 35 million in the third quarter, consistent with third quarter last year, and 109 million for the nine months which is up from the 98 million in the prior year. The nine-month increase reflects the impact of GPC Asia Pacific as well as our more recent acquisitions. We currently anticipate depreciation and amortization to be approximately 145 million to 150 million for the full year. Our strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of cash for us and they're integral to the growth plans for our company. In the third quarter, we made three acquisitions including one small tuck-in for both our automotive and electrical businesses, as well as the July 1st addition of Impact Products to our office products group, which we discussed in our last call. All in we have made seven acquisitions thus far in 2014 including one in each of our four business segments. We expect these new businesses to contribute total annual revenues of approximately 390 million. We are encouraged by the growth opportunities we see for each of these acquisitions and we\u2019ll continue to seek new acquisitions across our businesses to enhance our prospect for future growth. We\u2019re generally targeting those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range. Finally thus far in 2014, we have used our cash to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. Today we have another 9.5 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases but we expect to remain active in the program over the balance of the year as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with our dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. So that concludes our financial update, a solid quarter but more room for improvement. And in closing, we want to thank our GPC associates for all their hard work. We have a great team. And because of their dedication and hard work, the company is well positioned for continued growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. We look forward to updating you on our future progress when we report again. I will now turn it back over to Tom. Tom? Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Carol and Paul for those informative and comprehensive updates. So that will complete our planned comments. And in recapping our view on the quarter, we would say that we feel good about the performance turned in by the GPC team with sales up 8%, net income up 10% and earnings per share up 11%. As we look toward year-end based upon our year-to-date results, we feel that some modest adjustments to our prior guidance would be appropriate. On the revenue side, we previously had guided automotive revenues to be up 7% to 8% and at this point we would say that that would be up closer to the 8%. In industrial, we previously had said up 5% to 7% and now we would say up 6% to 7%. Office products was 6% to 7% and at this point we would say 8% to 9%. Electrical was 25% to 30% and we would suggest right at 30%. So for the total company, prior guidance was to be up 7% to 8% and now we would say we'll be up 8%. And on the earnings side we previously had guided in the $4.54 to $4.60 range. We are comfortable taking that upside and we now feel that $4.56 to $4.60 is more appropriate and that would represent an earnings per share increase of 9% to 10% for the full year. So at this point we would like to address your questions. And we will turn the call back to. Celina. Celina? Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Becks with JP Morgan. Mark Becks - JPMorgan: I guess just to start off on the automotive side. Looking at your guidance of 8% sales growth, by my calculations it looks like it's sort of like a 3%-ish number in sales growth for NAPA in 4Q. Maybe just trying to get an update on how you are thinking about the automotive trends. Obviously they are still very solid, but you are lapping some pretty impressive comparisons, so maybe what you are seeing in the business now. Thank you. Tom Gallagher :  I will try to answer that. The guidance would suggest some modest deceleration. However, as you pointed out, the comps are getting a bit more challenging. And we also don\u2019t know what the early winter weather impact we may get this year. As far as the current trends, we would say that we are pleased with what we see in automotive specifically in the beginning or the early days of the fourth quarter. And I might say that that same comment would hold true for the other businesses as well. We are early in October, but we do like what we see at this point. Mark Becks - JPMorgan: And then on the gross margin side, a little bit of a headwind there. Can you elaborate a little bit on what caused the pressure there? Is there any change in the promotional activity going on in the category? Is that maybe some acquisition related impact? Thank you. Tom Gallagher :  The margin, as I think we mentioned in the last call, the margin is being impacted a bit by the customer mix and the product mix that we see across our businesses. And as you know, the larger the customer in any of our businesses, the greater the discount that they receive. So the margin compacts some. However, the offset to that is the greater the volume, the more leverage that we can get. So in the quarter, our gross margin was down 18 basis points, but our SG&A was down 29 basis points, so we did have a positive 11 basis point improvement in our operating margin. So that\u2019s the primary thing that\u2019s happened. If we look at it on the product side, we see nice growth in a couple of areas that Paul mentioned. Certainly our heavy duty business was up and that\u2019s a little bit lower gross margin, but higher ticket values. The same thing would be true on tools and equipment in the automotive. If we look at the office products business, I mentioned that our technology products were up, again higher ticket value, but lower margin. So I think they would be the primary contributing factors. Mark Becks - JPMorgan:  And then just a follow-up to the margin comment. On the industrial side, presumably you might have hit some vendor rebates kicking in with the big acceleration there, maybe where that\u2019s coming from and the sustainability of that. It looks like incremental margins were kind of mid-teens maybe historically what you've seen with incremental margins on the industrial side. Thank you. Carol Yancey :  So Mark on the gross margin on the industrial, what we would say is certainly with their core growth coming back a bit, we\u2019re seeing some of the volume incentives come back, but I would say it\u2019s really more trending in line with what their sales increases are. It was primarily more their cost savings and the leverage that came through on that for the industrial side. Operator :  The next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. Elizabeth Suzuki \u2013 Bank of America :  Hi, this is Elizabeth Suzuki on for John. In terms of the acquisition landscape, which segment are you most interested in? And how do the multiples being paid for acquisitions compare to about a year ago? Tom Gallagher :  I will try to answer that. And I would say that our overall growth strategies across each of the businesses include a component for acquisition growth. We have been able to make acquisitions in each of the four businesses over the course of this year. In terms of where the acquisitions may come from prospectively, we\u2019ve got active discussions going on in each of the businesses, but there are more possibilities in the industrial and the electrical sides of the business only because those industries continue to be the more fragmented of the two industries that we\u2019re in. In terms of the valuations, valuations are relatively constant with where they\u2019ve been. They might be pushing the top end of what we would consider to be reasonable valuation, but they're still relatively consistent. And I would also, just as a point of information, I would say that we continue to be what we would consider to be fairly consistent in our valuation models and we\u2019re going to \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t fit our model, there is a high probability it won't be a deal that we do. We\u2019re not going to do any deals that are dilutive to our shareholders. Elizabeth Suzuki \u2013 Bank of America :  And then just one other quick one is that GPC once operated in Europe. Do you foresee any future operations there? Tom Gallagher :  As it turns out, I actually was involved in that business stack then. And I think our primary emphasis would be in North America, in Australasia and potentially South East Asia and then also into more in Mexico and Latin America. Not to the exclusion of Europe, but that would be down the list. We think there may be other opportunities for us in these other areas that might be more attractive. Operator :  The next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri \u2013 Wolfe Research :  Hi. This is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aram. Was hoping you can kind of walk us through the incremental margins maybe by segment and what you\u2019re seeing particularly perhaps ex acquisitions. It seems like you had a lot of very strong growth obviously in industrial on an organic basic, the same with office. So maybe just talk about like your maybe implied margins for -- was this quarter \u2013 I want to keep saying Q4, or maybe just long term where you expect those to trend? Carol Yancey : I guess just to comment on -- so a couple of things on the margin. While we were able to see -- what we\u2019re seeing there, and again you\u2019re seeing it in total, so there is some gross margin pressure, but you\u2019re seeing our improvement on SG&A and that really applies to all of our segments. And I think where we\u2019re seeing the improved top line growth, we\u2019re able to really see that push through on the SG&A line. So where we are more on the nine months year-to-date basis, and when you look at what our margins are up for each of our segments, we\u2019re still going to really hope to keep the 10 to 20 basis point improvement for each one of those and a little bit greater than that in the electrical., but I think maintaining where we are at through the nine months and looking for just a continued 10 to 20 basis points for each of the segments. Chris Bottiglieri \u2013 Wolfe Research : And one another additional small question. Can you talk a little bit about the industrial, what\u2019s causing the explosive growth in organic revenue? But at least compared to industrial production, it seems to really have accelerated this past quarter. And maybe one of the segments that you're playing out might be outperforming versus the benchmark? Tom Gallagher :  We mentioned five, I think it was five categories or customer segments that we\u2019ve enjoyed a little bit stronger growth than the overall, and they pretty much follow what you\u2019re seeing happening in the economy. If you look, automotive is a strong segment for us right and you see what\u2019s happening with new vehicle sales. Lumber and wood products and the mining and aggregate are both fairly strong for us and we think that may follow what\u2019s happening with construction, both housing as well as commercial construction. So I think we\u2019re following the overall trends within the economy. The external indices, industrial production capacity utilization, they\u2019ve actually been fairly strong for a number of months now. And it\u2019s been our expectation that we would see some improvement in our sequential growth rates and I think we\u2019re just now beginning to experience some of that. And then one other thing I might add is that in prior calls I think we\u2019ve mentioned that we keep track of what we would call project work, which is work that our manufacturing customers are planning to do where they may take a line down or they may do a complete refurbishment. And to the best of our ability, we try to quantify what that might be and we follow the patterns on that end for a period of time. What we saw is a relatively consistent dollar amount of project work. But to take out on that was not flowing as it had historically. We had seen some deferrals, some delays and we\u2019re beginning to see some of that work being done now. So that\u2019s probably contributing a bit to the overall growth rates as well. Operator :  Next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets :  A quick question, I guess, on the auto. I was about to ask that project work question a second ago, but just to sort of follow off on that. What\u2019s the expectation -- I mean if we sort of look at the quarter on the industrial side, how would it weigh percentage that was sort of just general disposable as opposed to project work from a contribution standpoint, just sort of trying to get a feeling for where we are, what inning we are in the expansion of projects work? Tom Gallagher :  Bret, I\u2019ll try to answer that. And I would say that it was more weighted toward the day in and day out needs than it was the project work. We were pleased to see some increased activity on the project work, but the overall growth rates were more driven by a good, steady demand from ongoing operations. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then back to my other question. If we look at sort of any prospective or early look at market share shifts, are you seeing anything shaking out as far as recent consolidation? I think a question was asked earlier about increased promotional levels. But are you seeing maybe a shift in some of the customers' bias to go with you as a commercial supplier as opposed to other competitors? Tom Gallagher :  I think the best way we could answer that would be to point to our NAPA AutoCare on our major account business. Paul referenced in his comments that we\u2019ve enjoyed nice growth again this quarter and we\u2019ve had a number of really good quarters there. And I think those results would indicate that there has been a bit of share gain with those customers or a share gain by those customers, whichever, and I think we\u2019re benefiting from that. I don\u2019t know if there is more that Paul might want to add to that. Paul Donahue : No. Tom hit on it, Bret. Those two businesses, as we\u2019ve discussed before, continue to perform well and show no real signs of slowing. So I would think with the kind of growth rates that we\u2019ve seen, high single digit out of our AutoCare group this past quarter and low double digits out of our major accounts., we\u2019re very pleased with that performance and our team's really got to go on all cylinders. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : And Paul, one last question. You mentioned that all markets were -- all regional markets were up and some of the standout strong markets. What were the weaker markets relative just geographically? Paul Donahue : As we\u2019ve seen a good bit this year, Bret, out West and certainly when we always like to talk about weather, certainly the drought has impacted, we believe, some of our customers out there both on the installer side as well as some of our independent owners. So that would be absolutely one that would stand out. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Robert Higginbotham with SunTrust. Robert Higginbotham \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Quick first question on auto and imports specifically. Your major competitors have really increased their attention on that piece of the business and they\u2019re doing it in a couple of different ways, a couple of people using the warehouse distributor model and then some cross-sourcing to the legacy stores, if you will, and then one focusing on developing private labels specifically for imports. You guys really don\u2019t talk much about that. Could you give us a sense to how you view that piece of the market? How important you see it and how you see yourselves attacking that going forward? Paul Donahue : Yes, Robert, this is Paul. I will give it a shot. I am assuming you\u2019re referring to a couple of our competitors and recent acquisitions. And you\u2019re right, we don\u2019t talk much about the OE import business. But I would tell you that six plus years ago we did an acquisition of a company called Altrom, which is a OE branded provider that we acquired six years ago. They do business both in the U.S. and Canada. We viewed it then as we view it now as a very strategic and integral part of our overall automotive business. And we\u2019ve been getting after it for a number of years. So I think that what you\u2019re seeing with our competitors\u2019 recent acquisitions, which I think is a good move on their part, it just further reinforces the opportunities that are in that segment of the business. Robert Higginbotham \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. And then on the Asia Pacific, and when you look outside of Australia, in the past you've somewhat loosely alluded to opportunities outside of Australia and using Australia as a foothold, as a platform for growth in the larger region. Could you give us a sense of how -- what you see in those neighboring markets, specifically automotive, in terms of size, competitive fragmentation, kind of what the opportunity is there? Tom Gallagher : I\u2019ll take that one, Robert. First of all, our primary and near term focus is continuing to build out in Australia and New Zealand and the team there is doing a really good job for us in that regard and we continue to see some pretty attractive opportunities in those markets today. At the same time, we\u2019re looking at some other markets. I had mentioned that China is not high on our list. Although it\u2019s a large and rapidly growing market, it\u2019s not one that we think is ready for a company like ours yet or a company like ours is not yet ready for China, either way. But there are some other markets. Although they\u2019re smaller, they\u2019re enjoying very attractive growth rates in the vehicle part. And when you total up a couple of them, they\u2019d become fairly significant. So we\u2019re in the process of trying to gather as much market intelligence as we can currently, make as many contacts as we can with existing players in those markets. And at some point, it\u2019s probable that we\u2019ll make a move to start to do business in some of those markets. Robert Higginbotham \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. And let me sneak one quick one and hopefully -- in the past you\u2019ve talked about a stronger dollar hurting the export business of some of your customers and then that of course are flowing through to softness in your own business. Are you seeing any of that happen now or are you concerned about that? Tom Gallagher : Yes, it continues. The dollar continues to be quite strong vis-\u00e0-vis other currencies. So that continues to be an issue for those customers of ours, primarily capital goods type customers who are shipping and selling product into some of these other markets. And then you combine that with a general malaise in the global economy and you\u2019ve got a combination of maybe a bit softer demand and the higher dollar that causes some compression for some of those customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : I have my first question on office products to change it up a bit and a couple of quick follow-ups on automotive. If you think about the pop that you saw in the underlying growth rate in office supply and if you could sort of isolate as best as you can some of the drivers of it, can you talk about how much maybe layering in the Office Max business would be versus your getting just a bigger share of the pie given your new deal down at Office Depot? And then finally what you\u2019re seeing in terms of intrinsic demand which, based on what you saw from the independents, that also seems like it wasn\u2019t so bad? Tom Gallagher : Maybe we\u2019ll take them in reverse order, Matt. The demand was actually encouraging, especially from the independents and there has been a lot of work going on by our office products team to work with independent owners to help them improve their position in their respective marketplaces and I think that\u2019s a partial contributor to results that we saw. Additionally, we had seen some slowdown in governmental spending, as a general statement, and that has a ripple effect on a number of our independent customers and we saw that improve some over the last two quarters. So, that\u2019s been a contributor as well. As far as looking out a little bit, we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen on the independents side and the expectation is that it should continue to generate reasonably good growth for us over the next quarter or two for sure. It's hard for us -- moving on to the question on the incremental volume from Office Depot and Office Max, it's hard for us to be able to extrapolate that very precisely. I can tell you that the aggregate volume is running very much in line with what we thought it would be and what the Office Depot folks thought it would be. So, we\u2019re very pleased with what we see in the early days and I think it's a reflection of the combined entities, but it's also, I think, a reflection on some improved demand for the combined entity today and I think they're doing a pretty good job. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs :  Great. On automotive, kind of a quantitative question. If you could just help us understand the difference between the 4% reported total growth and the 6% comp, presumably there is -- there would ordinarily be I guess store growth. I might have gone the other way, you have ForEx. Anything else that would have driven that delta? Paul Donahue :  No, you hit on it, Matt. Just to reemphasize, the 6% same store sales number that we mentioned, that\u2019s reflective of our U.S. company owned store base. There is a combination of factors this past quarter that impact the overall number. We had a sales return adjustment that we've contended with as well as a couple of store consolidations, and certainly as you mentioned, the FX impact as well. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs :  And if we think about \u2026sorry. Tom Gallagher : Matt, excuse me for a minute. If you aggregate those three things that Paul just mentioned, that pretty much accounts for the delta between the 4.4% increase that we had and the 6% comp store. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs :  Great. And then also on the automotive number, if your aggregate commercial business -- I believe you said it was up 6%, if I got that right -- and your same store sales number was up 6%, there were a number of initiatives -- you talked about major accounts running double digits, NAPA AutoCare ran high singles, if we solve for the residual, which I guess would be commercial outside of major accounts and NAPA AutoCare, there is some piece of it that must track below 6% for the math to work. So, can you talk about sort of is that just your undesignated commercial business or is there anything else happening in the business that might have been a bit weaker outside of those efforts? Tom Gallagher : No. And you are right. The business set was not highlighted in Paul\u2019s comments is running up, but it's running up low single digit, and it is the unaccounted for, it's the all other in our commercial business. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs :  Fair enough. And then I promise the last. Just Carol, if you could talk about the impact of ForEx by segment, just whatever the revenue impact was for each segment? I know it was 50 bps overall, although I am not sure how that was distributed. Tom Gallagher : Gives us a minute on that one. Carol Yancey :  Yeah, I'll get back on that. So on the automotive, I think Paul already gave you that number. And the industrial, it was a negative 1%. And then really no impact on office or electrical to speak of. And then in total it was 0.5% in total. Operator :  The next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group. Greg Melich - ISI Group :  I wanted to first ask about in automotive, if you could just help us understand a bit what\u2019s driving the continued double-digit type strength in major accounts. Is there business wins that you've had with new customers or the existing customers just doing more business and you\u2019re getting more wallet share? Can you help us understand the drivers there? Paul Donahue :  It\u2019s certainly a combination of both. Our teams are executing extremely well in the field, Mike, and you\u2019ve got -- when you look at the major account business, and you mentioned, it\u2019s continued growth with our existing plus some wins along the way. And when you combined them both and then you combined it with the strong execution in the field, our team continues to do a great job. Greg Melich - ISI Group :  Great. Wanted to follow up with Carol actually on the other line item, which looks like now it could be 125 million to 130 million versus the prior guide I had 115 million to 117 million. So can you just help us understand I guess incrementally what the major changes are and anything to be aware of into the fourth quarter there? Carol Yancey :  Yes. Just to be clear, so that other net line, which is including the interest and the intangible, we gave guidance of 90 million to 95 million for the full year. That\u2019s been running at about 25 million each quarter and we\u2019re at 74 million year-to-date. So, the things that are going in there, I mean you certainly have some increase in some of the costs that we\u2019ve talked about for some time, so legal professional insurance, we have some of our corporate, be it shared services, it could be IT, payroll benefits, depreciation on corporate assets, it\u2019s pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter. We also have -- there would be some things that are sort of non-recurring or we have some unusual items, like we mentioned the $4 million retirement benefits adjustment that was unfavorable. So, we didn\u2019t change it a whole lot, but we\u2019re looking at more of a 90 million to 95 million for the full year. Greg Melich - ISI Group :  And then two last follow-ups, one was on the cash flow guidance, which by my math appear to be about 50 million lower than last quarter, so just hoping to understand the puts and takes there. And lastly was on sort of incremental margins, because you guys ended up putting up certainly stronger growth than I had looked for at least for this quarter, but yet the margins were kind of flattish in total. So, help me if you could to understand some of the initiatives you have there to get EBIT margins expanding at the total company level. Carol Yancey : Okay. Well I\u2019ll take the cash flow one. So you\u2019re right, we did probably tweak that a little bit. I would tell you we\u2019ve had two outstanding cash flow years the last two years. We feel really good about cash from operations at around 900 million. But we didn\u2019t have quite -- I mean we feel good about the numbers, we feel like there is improvement going ahead, but we just felt like it was time to firm that up just a bit. I would say the change was really in the working capital area, kind of a combination of AR and AP. The folks are doing a really good job in inventory. But I think I could say we felt like it was time to kind of firm that up a bit. And I think on your margin question, again I would just point to where we kind of are on a year-to-date basis. And I think where we can maintain our SG&A improvement between now and end of the year, I think you\u2019re going to see the segment margins that we have year-to-date that would basically continue for the end of the year. Operator :  The next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities :  My first question is on the auto group. Can you give us a sense of the cadence of comps for the U.S. company owned stores throughout the quarter? Paul Donahue :  Yes. We talked about this in the last call, Seth. And if you think back, that was in July and we mentioned that early July we saw some softer numbers coming out. That's started to strengthen in the second half of the month. And our numbers firmed up as the quarter progressed, so we\u2019re I\u2019d say pleased with the way the quarter came about. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities : And then remind us looking forward here for October, November, December, how the cadence of the comps compares for Q4? Paul Donahue :  Maybe I\u2019m not sure -- I apologize. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities : Just the comparisons for the next -- for the months of Q4. Tom Gallagher :  We don\u2019t give out monthly guidance. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities : I guess, Tom, another way to ask the question is, how much strong was December relative to October last year, because that\u2019s when the cold weather started? Tom Gallagher :  Well December was, if I recall -- I don\u2019t have it right in front of me, Seth. But if I recall, that was the strongest month of the quarter because we were getting the benefit of some of that cold weather flow through. Paul Donahue :  Yeah. And I would also just mention, Seth, last year Q4 was when we really saw our business start to come on strong. And so our total Q4 last year, we\u2019re plus 7% same store sales. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities :  Okay. Then secondly, maybe Carol you can give us some more color around AR. You talked about it being a focal point. Can you give us a sense of where the increases are coming from, which segments and what their natures are to bring that a little bit more under control? Carol Yancey :  Well I would tell you on the AR, it's really across all of the businesses. And I think we talked about where we had some of these larger accounts and associated with some of those larger accounts, they may have slightly different terms. So what we are able to do is get those same terms back through our vendors. But I think we also have some acquisitions that are also flowing into that and we are trying to integrate the acquisitions in. So the thing is with our accounts receivable the quality of it is outstanding. We have no concerns there. It's just making sure that we are getting all the AR in line to be slightly less than our sales increase and that\u2019s what all of our internal teams are focused on. Operator :  The next question comes from line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets :  Hey guys it's Scot Ciccarelli. Another auto question as well. How much of a difference did you see in geographies? You mentioned that the West was soft, but can you help us understand how soft that was? Number one. Number two. You did mention in drought conditions. Can you help us better understand I guess outside of wipers and such what else from a product standpoint really struggles under those kinds of conditions? Tom Gallagher :  Scot, I will take the first half of that. In terms of the delta, we wouldn\u2019t want to quantify that, but we would go back to what Paul said and that is that all of the geographic areas had positive growth for us in the quarter but, some are stronger than others with the West being on the bottom end of that. And in terms of the impact of the drought. You are right about something like wiper blades, but it goes a whole lot further than that when you think that California for instance is a big agricultural state and the impact that the drought has on the crops there, that impacts not only demand from the agricultural concerns, but it impacts the truckers who hold that product, that impacts the processors who process the product. So it has a pretty long tale in terms of how it can influence demand. A lot of the workers in the ag community may not have quite as much disposable income. It can affect a retail business. So it\u2019s a significant factor. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets :  And Tom, specifically who are your primary competitors when it comes to stuff like the agricultural products or is it the right way to think about it, just the long tail that you mentioned and because of that it's just a cascading effect? Tom Gallagher : I think the right way is the long tail. When we talk about the competition, it's all of the companies that you would know. We are all located in those respective markets. Now there will be some specialists as well. But for us, for the product that we are selling, the primary competitors would be our peer group and the companies that you are well aware of. Operator :  Your question comes from the line of Mario Gabelli with Gabelli & Company Mario Gabelli - Gabelli & Company:  Yeah. I had to ask the question to you and Paul and Tom. Paul, when you sit down with Tom and he says to you his experience in Europe, what structurally does he remind you about that he had as a problem that you won't encounter in Southeast Asia, either political, rigidity of labor or just the notion of only traveling eights hours versus 24? Tom Gallagher :  You know what, Mario, I think I better let him answer the question. I'm staying clear of that one. Paul Donahue :  That one is up upward delegation right there, Mario. No, the structural -- it would be getting at it was my comment about the... Mario Gabelli - Gabelli & Company: Yeah. Tom, it was about 35 years ago, wasn\u2019t? Tom Gallagher :  No. In terms of our business over there, it's performing really well. We will in fact expand it outside of those countries. Mario Gabelli - Gabelli & Company:  No. But what happened in Europe that says I don\u2019t want to go back as a high player? Tom Gallagher :  In Europe what we saw was we had our doubts about how long it would take for the common market on the the EU to actually come into being. And number two, how successful would it be over the long-term. We didn\u2019t have any insights beyond anybody else\u2019s, but I think current situation might suggest that we were asking appropriate questions back then. Back then you didn\u2019t have the common currency that you have today, but you have got different languages, you have got different rules of law, you\u2019ve got different methods of approaching the business. And our feeling at the time was that we would continue to be successful, but it was going to be a much tougher slog than what we were accustomed to. And keep in the mind also we had just acquired S. P. Richards and Motion Industries and we had been approached someone who wanted to buy our business and we felt we could repatriate the money and invest it in S. P. Richards and in Motion and do a better job for the shareholder and I think that that has proven to be the case for the most part. Mario Gabelli - Gabelli & Company:  Well, the conclusion we agree with that's it's been a fantastic 35 years since you got out of Europe. Thank you very much. Operator : I will now turn today's conference call back to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey :  We want to thank everybody for their participation on the call and we thank you for your interest in and support of Genuine Parts Company. We look forward to reporting out in February on our fourth quarter earnings. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. This will conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is [indiscernible]. I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Genuine Parts Company's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn today\u2019s conference call over to Sid Jones, Vice President and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sid Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts' fourth quarter and full year 2014 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the 2015. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses. The Company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the Company\u2019s latest SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom? Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Sid. And I would also like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, the President of Genuine Parts Company along with Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and I will each handle a portion of today\u2019s call. And once we have completed our individual comments, we will look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have. Earlier this morning we released our fourth quarter and year end results and hopefully you've all had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $3.822 billion, which was up 9%, net income was $165.6 million, which was up 10% and earnings per share were $1.07 this year versus $0.97 last year, which was also up 10%. So we feel that our team came through the final quarter of the year in good shape. For the year sales were $15.342 billion which was up 9%. Net income was $711 million up 4% on a reported basis and up 9% on a comparative basis. You'll recall that in 2013 we had one time purchase accounting gains that were related to the GPC Asia-Pacific acquisition and that had a onetime favorable impact on the 2013 results. Earnings per share for the year were $4.61 and EPS was up 5% on a reported basis and 10% on a comparative basis. Sales net income and earnings per share, each reached record levels in 2014 which we're certainly pleased to report and we're also pleased that the sales in EPS results both came in a bit above our full year guidance that was provided back in October with all four of our business segments contributing nicely. Turning to the individual segments, I will cover the non automotive operations first followed by Paul who will then review the automotive performance. Starting off with industrial, the motion industries team came through the year in good shape. Sales for the year were just under $4.8 billion and this was up 8% and we were pleased with the cadence of the year with sales being up 4% in the first quarter, 7% in the second and then 10% in each of the final two quarters of the year, and these solid results were underpinned by broad based positive contributions across the major product categories as well as the major customer segments. On the product side we ended the year with 11 of our top 13 categories showing growth and encouragingly all 13 were up in the final quarter. Among our top 12 customer segments 11 posted positive results for the year and all 12 were positive over the final three months, again encouraging trends. Among the strongest growing segments for the year in no particular order were automotive, coal aggregate and cements, iron and steel, lumber and wood products. This a diversified cross section of the North American manufacturing base and we feel that these solid results are reflective of the improved conditions that we currently see in the overall economy, which is encouraging as we head into the new year. Before ending our comments on industrial, we do want to mention that we completed the acquisition of Miller Bearing as of February 1st of this year. Miller is a highly regarded regional industrial distribution company headquartered in Orlando, Florida. They operate 17 branches and have annual revenues of approximately $40 million. This will be a great addition to our Industrial group and we\u2019re pleased to have the Miller organization now a part of Motion Industries. Turning to the Electrical segment EIS was up 23% in the fourth quarter and they were up 30% for the year. So it was a strong performance from this team in 2014. While certainly pleased with the overall results, we do want to point out that acquisitions were the major contributor to the sizable sales increases. In fact the EIS underlying business was only up 1% for the full year. However we were encouraged to see the underlying business up 4% in the final quarter which was the strongest performance of the year and hopefully a sign that demand is starting to pick up a bit in this segment. As we enter 2015, EIS will continue to see sluggish demand among our telecommunications customer base at least for the first half of the year and the deflation in copper pricing will also present a headwind, but the EIS team has a number of strong revenue initiatives underway and we expect a solid performance from this team in 2015, especially over the second half of the year. And finally office products. Total revenues came in at $1.8 billion and this was up 10%. As with our Industrial segment office product sales get stronger as the year progressed. After being flat in the first quarter they were up 4% in the second quarter, 15% in the third quarter and 22% in the fourth quarter. This progression clearly shows the positive impact of our enhanced relationship with a significant customer that kicked-in in the second half of the year, as well the nice contributions from the Impact Products acquisition that was completed mid-year.  But beyond this we\u2019re also pleased to see single digit growth from our independent office products reseller channel for the entire year and this segment actually firmed up as the year progressed and we were also pleased to have ended the year with solid growth in all four of the major product categories. So the results from the Office Products group were broad based from both a customer and product perspective which is encouraging and this team goes into 2015 with a bit of momentum, which is good to see.  So that\u2019s a quick overview of the non-automotive businesses and as this point I\u2019ll ask Paul to bring you up-to-date on the Automotive segment. Paul? Paul Donahue : Yes, thank you Tom. Good morning everyone. And let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I\u2019m pleased to join here today and to have an opportunity to provide you an update on the fourth quarter performance of our Automotive business. We\u2019re pleased to report to our global Automotive business grew top line revenues by 4% in the fourth quarter. This 4% number consists of 6.5% core Automotive growth which includes slight benefit from acquisition offset by 2.5% of currency adjustment. The currency adjustment was a bigger headwind than we had anticipated for the quarter. Our team was able to overcome this challenge with stronger than expected core growth. When reviewing our quarterly performance, we continue to be encouraged by the solid results our teams are generating across our entire automotive business. During the fourth quarter we saw our U.S. team posted 7% sales increase, while our International businesses including Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand grew mid-single digits. In the U.S. all regions of the country are positively contributing to our sales growth. The Atlantic, Western and Midwestern divisions led the way for our Company in the fourth quarter. Now let\u2019s turn to our same store sales numbers. Our U.S. company owned store group grew comp same store sales in the fourth quarter by 7%. This 7% is on top of the 7% increase we generated in the fourth quarter of 2013, which gives us a two year stack of plus 14%. This solid performance continues the strong same-store sales run dating back to the fourth quarter of 2013. Our quarterly breakdown for 2014 is as follows. In the first quarter we generated an 8% same store sales increase and in Q2 we posted a 7% increase and in Q3 we\u2019re plus 6%. Rolled up that gives the U.S. automotive businesses a full year same-store sales number of plus 7%. We are proud of our team for generating these solid results but we are also well aware we have a steep hill decline in 2015 to continue to build on these comps. Our 7% sales increase in Q4 was driven by a combination of strong sales on both our commercial wholesale side of the business and by our retail business. Let\u2019s start with our retail results. As mentioned in previous calls we have put renewed focus on this segment of our business and we are pleased to report these initiatives are beginning pay dividend. Our team did an outstanding job in the quarter, driving an 11% increase in our overall retail business. As generally is the case, there was no one single initiative that drove this double digit increase, but rather a combination of things that our team has been working on for the past 12 months that really began to take hold in the quarter. Retail basic such as extended store hours, proper staffing, dedicated retail associates and increased training all played a part. In addition we have fined tuned our radio and our print advertising. We focused our team on [indiscernible] compliance and we are driven to increase both the size of our average ticket and the number of tickets falling through our stores. In Q4 we saw a significant increase in our average retail ticket and an increase in the number of retail tickets. We are by no means satisfied with where we are today and we have a great deal of work left to do. However it is a testament to our team's hard work that we are moving the needle on this important initiative. So now let's turn to our commercial wholesale business or our Do It For Me segment. This segment turned in a 6% increase in the fourth quarter. Recapping our year's performance, our commercial business was at or exceeded 6% growth in each quarter of 2014. Highlights for the quarter included solid performances by our two major wholesale initiatives NAPA AutoCare and major accounts. Starting with our major account business this strategic segment delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of double digit growth, a terrific accomplishment by our entire major account team, and our NAPA AutoCare centers now totaling over 15,500 nationwide posted a high single digit to sales increase in the quarter. This performance insured another year of low double digit increase for our AutoCare business. We'd also like to report on our fleet business. This important segment continued a solid year-over-year performance by posting a 5% increase in the quarter and we wrapped up 2014 at plus 6%. We can also report good trends in our average wholesale ticket value which add positive growth in the month and in the quarter with little or no inflationary support. We also saw a year-over-year growth in the average number of tickets flowing through our stores. Now a quick review of the product categories driving our growth. In the fourth quarter, we experienced double digit growth in our Bright business, our tool and equipment business and our NAPA Import Parts business, a great job by our sales teams in all three of these important categories. As we look ahead to 2015 and beyond, we continue to be encouraged by the fundamentals in the Automotive aftermarket. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years, the size of the fleet continues to grow, and not surprisingly the all-important miles driven metric recorded its largest growth in the past five years. After relatively flat to even negative numbers in recent years, miles driven was up 1.4% through 11 months. We saw a jump in miles driven as the price of the gasoline dropped in late Q3 and Q4. Miles driven was up 2.3% in September, 2.6% in October and 1.1% in November. This growth is a direct result of the lowest fuel prices we've seen in six years. That said, we are beginning to see fuel prices bench back up in early February, however the national average is still significantly below last year's fuel prices. So in summary we are pleased with our fourth quarter results as well as our full year performance. Our teams in the U.S, Canada, Mexico and Australasia continue to post solid growth, and as good as we feel about 2014 and our industry in general, we are facing our share of headwinds as we move into 2015.  Foreign currency has a significant headwind for non-U.S automotive businesses which we'll continue to monitor. In addition we will face challenging 2014 comps in every quarter of 2015. That said, we are confident in our strategy, the key initiatives we've laid out and the management team we have in place to make it happen. And in closing, we want to thank our management teams, both in North America as well as our team on the ground in Australasia for another fine year for the GPC automotive business. So that completes our overall view of the GPC automotive business and at this time I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you Paul. We'll begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year income statements and our segment information and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back at the end of my remarks and then we'll open the call up to your questions. Our total revenues were $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 9% from last year. This consists of underlying sales growth of 8% and a 3% contribution from acquisitions. These items were offset by a currency headwind of approximately 2%. For the year our sales increase of 9% was 5% of core growth with another 5% from acquisitions offset by a 1% currency headwind. Our gross profit for the fourth quarter was 30% of sales and this compares to the 31% gross margin last year. For the 12 months, our gross margin of 29.9% compares to 30% reported last year or 30.1% excluding the onetime purchase accounting adjustment in 2013 that was previously disclosed and also referenced in today's press release. We're pleased that our fourth quarter gross margin was in line with our expectations. We also recognize the need for further progress on this line and as we've stated before, this area has our full attention. As we move forward in 2015, we will rely on well executed margin initiatives across all of our businesses to offset the ongoing customer and product mix shifts that are pressuring our gross margins today.  Additionally, our initiatives are important in addressing the generally low inflationary environment, especially in the Automotive segment. Our supplier price increases for 2014 were flat for Automotive, up 1.5% for Industrial, up 1.4% for Office Products and up three tenths of 1% for Electrical. And currently we are planning for about the same pricing environment again in 2015. Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses of $881 million in the fourth quarter were up 2.9% from 2013 and at 23.1% of sales. This is 130 basis points improvement from the 24.3% reported last year. For the full year our total SG&A expenses are $3.5 billion, which is 22.7% of sales compared to the 22.6% in the prior year or 22.9% before the purchase accounting adjustment mentioned earlier. So this is a 20 basis point improvement on a comparative basis for the full year. The improvement in our fourth quarter and full year SG&A expenses reflect the benefit of effective cost management in every area of our business, as well as greater expense coverage especially across our non-automotive businesses in 2014. Our teams remain focused on effectively managing our cost and we expect to show continued progress on our SG&A line in the periods ahead. Now let's discuss the results by segment. So Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.99 billion and that represents 52% of our sales and is up 3.7%. Operating profit of $150.3 million is down 2.3%. So their margin declined by 40 basis points to 7.6% from the 8.0% last year. For the year automotive sales of $8.1 billion, which is also 53% of our total revenues was up 8.1%. Our operating profit of $700.4 million is up 9.2% and our margin is up 10 basis points to 8.7%. So despite the pressure on our margin in the fourth quarter, we're very pleased to report a slight increase in our operating margin for the full year. Our Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which is 31% of our revenues is up 10.4% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $96.3 million is up 31% and our operating margin showed strong expansion this quarter of 120 basis points to 8.0% from the 6.8% last year. For the year our Industrial sales of $4.77 billion represents 31% of our total revenues and is up 7.7%. Our operating profit of $370 million is up 15% and our margin is 7.8%, which is up 60 basis points from last year. This is a solid margin improvement for industrial and we're especially pleased to see the expansion come from both core gross margin improvement as well as SG&A leverage. In addition we had the benefit of stronger supplier incentives in 2014. So this was a very good year for Industrial. Our Office Products revenues were $469 million in the quarter or 12% of our revenues and up a very strong 21.7%. Our operating profit of $35.3 million is up 12%, so their operating margin was down 50 basis points to 7.5%. For the year office revenues of $1.8 billion or 11% of sales are up 10%. Our operating profit of $134 million is up 9% and our margin is down 10 basis points from last year to the 7.4%. Again, our customer mix shift is imposing our net margin for this business but we're pleased with our overall top line growth. The Electrical group had sales in the quarter of $177.4 million, up 5% of revenue and up 23%. Operating profit of $15 million is up 23%. So their margin is basically unchanged at 8.5%. For the year sales for this group are $739 million or 5% of our revenues and up 30%. Our operating profit of $65 million is up 36%. So our margin is up nicely to 8.8% from the prior 8.4%, a solid 40 basis points improvement. So in total, our operating profit was up approximately 10% on a 9% sales increase in the fourth quarter and our operating profit margin improved 10 basis points to 7.8. Operating margin expanded in all four quarters for 2014 and the full year is up 30 basis points to 8.3%. We are very encouraged by this progress and we remain focused on continued margin expansion in the periods ahead. We had net interest expense of $5.5 million in the fourth quarter and this is down from $6.1 million last year, and for the 12 months interest expense is $24 million, which is consistent with the prior year. Looking ahead for 2015, we currently expect net interest expense to be approximately $22 million to $24 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense was $10.5 million for the fourth quarter and $37 million for the full year. Our amortization for both the quarter and the year is up in 2014 due to the acquisition activity across all four of our segments. For 2015, we expect amortization expense to be in the $40 million to $42 million range. The other line which reflects our corporate expense was $15.7 million expense for the fourth quarter, which is down from the $20.7 million in the prior year. For the full year, our corporate expense is $90 million, which is up from $35 million from the prior year or up $67 million before the one-time purchase accounting adjustment that we previously discussed. The favorable fourth quarter comparison primarily reflects certain yearend adjustments from the prior year which slightly increase our expenses in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the year the increase from 2013 reflects a variety of items including higher overall expenses in areas such as legal and professional, insurance and incentive based compensation. In addition, an unfavorable $7 million swing for 2014 associated with our retirement plan valuation adjustment also impacted this line item. With these and other factors in mind we expect corporate expense line to be in the $85 million to $95 million range again in 2015.  Our tax rate was approximately 37.6% for the fourth quarter, up from 36.2% in 2013 as the mix of income by country and relative foreign income tax rate primarily drove the overall higher tax rate. For the year, our 36.4% tax rate is up from the 34.4% in the prior year due to several factors, including the favorable rate on the one-time purchase accounting gain in 2013. In addition our lower retirement plan valuation adjustment and our foreign income and rate mix also contribute to increase in our rate in 2014. Looking ahead, we would expect our tax rate for 2015 to be in the 37% range. Net income for the quarter was $166 million compared, to the $150 million in the fourth quarter or up 10%. Our EPS of $1.07 compared to the $0.97 reported last year also up 10%.  Now let\u2019s discuss a few key balance sheet items. Our cash at December 31st was $138 million, which is down from the $197 million in the prior year. We continue to use our cash to support the growth initiatives in all of our businesses and we remain comfortable with our cash position. Our accounts receivable of $1.9 billion at December 31st increased 12% from 2013 on a 9% sales increase for the fourth quarter. We remain focused on our goal of growing receivables at a rate less than revenue growth and we\u2019ll be working hard to achieve this objective in the periods ahead. We continue to be satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time. Our inventory at the end of the year was $3 billion which was up 3% from the prior year or up just 1% excluding the impact of acquisitions. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we\u2019ll remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward in 2015. Accounts payable balance at year end was $2.6 billion or up 13% from the prior year, due to the positive impact of our improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We remain encouraged by the continued improvement in this area and its positive impact on our working capital in our days and payables. Our working capital of $2 billion at December 31st is down slightly from the prior year. Effectively managing our working capital and in particular our accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable is a very high priority for our company. Our ongoing efforts with these key accounts have resulted in solid improvement in our working capital position and cash flow for the last several years and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition.\\ Our total debt of $755 million at December 31st is down approximately $70 million from the nine months ended in September and is basically unchanged from the prior year. This represents approximately 19% of total capitalization, which is also consistent with the prior year. Our debt includes two $250 million term notes as well as another $265 million in borrowings under our multi-currency credit facility, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time.  We continue to generate solid cash flows and in 2014 our cash from operations was approximately $800 million and our free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends was $335 million. While not at the level of the historical record achieved in 2013, we\u2019re very pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows. For 2015 we currently expect cash from operations to be in the $800 million to $850 million and the free cash flow to be approximately $350 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our first priority for cash is the dividend which we\u2019ve paid every year since going public in 1948, and have now raised for 59 consecutive years, effective with yesterday\u2019s Board approval of $2.46 per share annual dividend for 2015. This represents a 7% increase from the $2.30 per share paid in 2014 and it\u2019s approximately 53% of our 2014 earnings per share, which is within our goal of a 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate, and share repurchases. Our capital expenditures were $34 million in the fourth quarter, down from $40 million in the prior year and for the year our capital spending totaled $108 million, which is a slight decrease from the prior year. The decrease in expenditures for the fourth quarter and the year primarily reflects the timing associated with certain projects. With this in mind, we currently expect our capital expenditure to pick up again in 2015 and we look for our CapEx spending to be in the range of $125 million to $145 million for the full year. As usual, the vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in technology. Depreciation and amortization was $40 million in the fourth quarter, up from $36 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year and its $148 million for the full year which is up from $134 million in the prior year. The fourth quarter and full year increases reflect the impact of our capital expenditures, as well as acquisitions and we currently depreciation and amortization to be approximately $155 million to $165 million for the full year in 2015.  Strategic acquisitions continue to be an important use of our cash and they're integral to the growth plans for the Company. In 2014 we made seven acquisitions including at least one in each of our four business segments and we expect this new business to contribute annual revenues of approximately $390 million. We also have remained active in 2015, acquiring JAL associates for the office segment in January and Miller Bearings for the Industrial segment on February 1st that Tom discussed. Combined, we expect these two acquisitions to generate approximately $50 million in annual revenues and to be accretive to our earnings in 2015. We will continue to seek new acquisitions across all of our businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth, generally targeting new [ph] bolt-on acquisition with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range. Finally in 2014 we used our cash to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock under the Company's share repurchase program. Additionally we have purchased another 500,000 shares thus far in 2015 and currently we have 9.1 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock as an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. So that concludes our financial update. It was a solid fourth quarter and a record year but as always there is opportunity for improvement in the periods ahead. We look forward to updating you on our future progress when we report again in April and in closing I would also like to thank all of our GPC associates for all their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Tom. Tom? Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Paul and Carol for your updates and thanks to both of you and your respective teams for the fine job being done and also for the important role that each of your plays in the overall success of Genuine Parts Company. So that concludes our prepared remarks on 2014, and in closing I would say that we're pleased with our overall results. As we look back there were a number of notable achievements. Sales and earnings rose to record levels in all four of our business segments and this enabled GPC to report a record year with sales going over the $15 billion mark for the first time. The 9% sales increase follows an 8% improvement in 2013, indicating a good two year progression. Operating profit improved by 30 basis points with three to four business units contributing nicely. We kept the balance sheet strong and flexible with debt to total capitalization being 18.8%. Cash generation, although down from last year's historic levels were still strong with cash from operations coming in at $790 million and free cash at $335 million. And working capital efficiency improved nicely again in 2014. We returned over $440 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends and with the 7% dividend increase approved by our Board of Directors yesterday, we've now increase the dividend for the 59th consecutive year. So in summary we're proud of the achievements in 2014 and we're appreciative of the fine job that was done by the GPC associates throughout our organization. Now in looking ahead we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals for each of our business and all of the GPC businesses have well thought out growth strategies for 2015. We're a bit less certain however of the overall impact of the strength of the U.S dollar as well as the impact of the global economic and geo-political issues. But to the best of our ability we have tried to take all of these factors into consideration as we set our expectations for the year ahead. With that said, our initial revenue guidance for total GPC is to be up 3% to 4% for the year, but we want to quickly point out that this includes a 2.5% to 3% negative impact from currency over the course of the year. So you can see that currency will be a significant factor for us in 2015. Adjusting for this translates to a 6% to 7% comparable revenue increase, and this basically reflects core growth. So our underlying growth expectations remain in line with the core revenue growth that we experienced in 2014. And looking at by segment, for Automotive business which is the segment that will be most impacted by currency, our expectation is to be up 2% to 3% for the full year, which includes a 4% negative impact from currency. Adjusting for this currency impact, it represents 6% to 7% increase in the underlying revenues for automotive. In Industrial, we anticipate a 5% to 6% increase and this accounts for 1% negative currency exchange. So before the impact of currency our Industrial sales should also increase 6% to 7%. Office Products should be up 6% to 7% with no material currency impact and we anticipate the Electrical segment to be up 5% to 6%, also with no material currency impact. On the earnings side, our initial guidance would be for EPS to come in between $4.70 to $4.80 and included in this is approximately $0.15 per share that's due to unfavorable exchange rates and the related increase and the tax rate which Carol referenced in her remarks. Stated another way, before the impact of currency and the tax differences, we're guiding to a range of $4.85 to $4.95, which will be up 5% to 7% on a comparative basis. So that will conclude our prepared comments and at this point we'd like to turn the call back to Nicole to take your questions. Nicole? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matthew Fassler : Just start by asking you briefly about Automotive margins. You alluded to the fact that they declined. I don't think you gave a lot of color as to why they were down as sharply as they were with very strong revenue growth. So any color you could give there would be terrific. Carol Yancey : Yes, Matt, I'll speak to the fourth quarter margins and then kind of talk about it on a full year basis. So our gross margin was down a bit in the fourth quarter within Automotive and we talked about customer and product mix and we offset [ph] some of the foreign currency pressures and some of that flows through to the gross margins as well. And in addition our SG&A wasn't as favorable in the Automotive segment in the quarter. So what I'd point to is -- what we are really pleased to show is that for the full year our Automotive margins were up 10 basis points and I would tell you that, that primarily came from SG&A leverage. Matthew Fassler : I think all my follow-ups are probably going to relate to this question. First of all, if you think about FX and you think about translational impact versus transactional impact, it seems like you had some transactional friction in there. And if you could just tell us how big -- whether I'm right and how big a hit that was to you? In other words paying in dollars and selling in foreign currency? Carol Yancey : Yes, we're not going to quantify what the transactional impact is, but just to say that it was somewhat of a headwind in our margins in Automotive in the fourth quarter. The currency was a little worse than what was anticipated and you certainly sell that on the top line. You sell that a bit and then margins as well. Tom Gallagher : This is Tom. I might also add -- perhaps this might be helpful to you and others on the call and that is that our core NAPA business, the operating margins were strong and improved more than our overall automotive margins. The biggest contributor in the quarter, and frankly even on a year-to-date was the currency exchange and if you recall back to my guidance comments a few moments earlier, we said that automotive was going to be impacted by our estimate, 4 points on the revenue side in 2015. So what's happening outside of U.S. with the strength of the dollar is causing us to see the impact in a pretty heavy way. Matthew Fassler : Totally understood. Just two more very quick ones that follow from that initial response. As we think about -- was incentive compensation part of the equation? You clearly had a very good year in Automotive from a revenue perspective. Was there any catch-up for bonuses in fourth quarter? Carol Yancey : Absolutely. I'd point out again while we're pleased to see the great results in Automotive, the extent that we had on the top line, that flowed through on the incentives. So we had less of a favorable year if you will in the fourth quarter as it related to that incentive compensation. You're exactly right. Matthew Fassler : And then my final question relates to mix. So I know you spoke about customer mix and product mix really across the collective enterprise. If you think about Automotive, obviously the standout number was DIY or retail. Was that a part of the mix impact on margin? And if so, was that the innate mix -- the innate characteristic of that business, or what you had to do to capture that business? Carol Yancey : I guess I would say on the quarterly margins again for automotive, when we talk about the customer and product mix, the examples that they would point to our major account business and the AutoCare business as those businesses continue to have the strong growth. And when we talk about that being in a lower margin, also Paul called out a couple of product categories, one of them being T&E, batteries, our heavy duty products, that's sort of the product and customer mix that we're talking about. Certainly you had something that was more favorable on the retail side that those are unfavorable on the other side, on the commercial side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Tom, you were able to outline the expected EPS impact for 2015 of roughly $0.15. Do you guys have a number for the fourth quarter? Is there a reason you can\u2019t give a little bit more detail on that? Tom Gallagher : I don\u2019t think we have that number here, You can follow up with Sid and he might be able to give you a little more input on that, Scott. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay, all right. And then I guess a little bit follow up on Matt\u2019s question. You had retail sales outpace commercial in the quarter. I know it\u2019s on lower base but I guess -- why do you think you saw that shift? That\u2019s little bit more pronounced than what you guys have typically seen given your commercial focus, number one. Number two, is that a trend that you\u2019re expecting to continue for the next couple of quarters there? Paul Donahue : Scott, this is Paul. Our retail business, we did have a good fourth quarter and we had a good year. Our overall retail business was high single digit year-over-year, and that scenario that we intend to continue to focus on. Now I do want to point out that we\u2019re not going to forget where we came from and that\u2019s our commercial wholesale business and that's still -- that\u2019s our bread and butter. But if we can pick up some share on the retail side, and as I mentioned Scott, it\u2019s with some of the very basic blocking tackling in relation some of the things our team is doing on the store hour side, staffing side, just compliance side with our planogram. So we\u2019re very pleased with our retail business and honestly if we can continue to grow that mid to high single digit in \u201815, we\u2019ll be pleased. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. And how much would you attribute -- I know this always tricky to figure out. Historically we\u2019ve seen a little bit bigger impact from changing gas prices on the retail side and the commercial side. A, do you think that\u2019s an accurate statement, and B, is there any way to estimate that? Paul Donahue : I\u2019ll give a shot, Scott. I think -- listen, the consumer has got, I think I read recently about $70 more disposable income in their pocket. Does that help our retail business? I think absolutely it does and how it impacts the commercial business? Well, if you look at what\u2019s happened with Miles Driven and the spike that we saw in late Q3, early Q4 in Miles Driven which are at some of the highest levels we\u2019ve seen in a number of years, that\u2019s going to drive -- obviously that drives our miles driven number up and that\u2019s going to increase our parts business overall. Tom Gallagher : And Scott, I might add just one additional comment to Paul\u2019s and that is if we look at some of the discretionary items, I think we saw a little bit of an uptick in the flow through of those, which perhaps is attributable to more discretionary income. Scot Ciccarelli : And that will be mostly on the retail side where you saw that tone? Tom Gallagher : Yes, it would be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Becks from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mark Becks : Just a follow up on that. Was the decline in gas prices, if you look at the 7% comps in the fourth quarter, it was roughly 200 basis point improvement on the two year. Anyway to sort of get a sense of how much of that is gas versus weather versus some of the internal company initiatives that you guys have been delivering upon. Tom Gallagher : Mark, I don\u2019t think we can get that granular. There are just so many variables, it\u2019s really hard to try to pinpoint specifically which one is impacting it, we would just say that with the lower gas prices, it is positive and a significant positive for the automotive aftermarket in our opinion. Mark Becks : Okay. And then on the gross margin side, just trying to get an idea of the direction going forward in 4Q more specifically. Just curious; why was it so severe in the fourth quarter? Was it simply a compare issue, a LIFO? Was there any one-time things in there? And how do you feel about the ability for gross margin expansion in 2015? Tom Gallagher : If you look -- I might take a stab at it and then Carol will add more color. But if you look, first of all at Q4 last year, it was clearly the strongest gross margin quarter of the year and we were going up against a tough comparison there. As we think about gross margin across the enterprise in \u201815 all of our businesses have gross margin improvement initiatives and our expectation is that we will show some gross profit improvement over the course of 2015. Carol Yancey : Yet another thing I would add, the prior year fourth quarter we had more of a one-time non-recurring adjustment that didn\u2019t repeat in this year fourth quarter, which we knew all along because we've been staying around 30%. And the second thing I would say is, if you think about the volume incentives and our inventory was only up 3% for the year and our team has done a very good job of keeping that inventory down, certainly a good bit than the sales increase. So to the extent that we have volume incentives and those wouldn\u2019t have been necessarily at the same level, that was some pressure on gross margins. And also the Office Products margins were down 10 basis points for the year and that was primarily attributed to gross margin. So we \u2013 again we were in line with where we were for the full year at 30% and I think that\u2019s a reasonable assumption going forward. Mark Becks : Tom, you alluded to some gross margin initiative. To the extent on a call on a public forum you'd be willing to, can you share some of the specific margin improvement initiative that you guys are working on? Tom Gallagher : Not we wouldn\u2019t want to get into the specifics. I would just say that we\u2019re looking at both sides of the equation and you've got buy side and sell side initiatives and we're working on both of those. Mark Becks : And then one just quick follow up then lastly. On the guidance if you look at Automotive, you're expecting up 2% to 3% in the year, which is a little bit below what you delivered in fourth quarter. If we think about automotive margin profile in 2014, assuming you guys hit your sales guidance what does that suggest for automotive margins in 2015? Tom Gallagher : Well, I'd first respond to that by just reminding that we're looking for our core Automotive to be up 6% to 7% before the impact of exchange rates and we think that all of our businesses can and should show operating margin improvement over the course of 2015. Operator : Your next comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Tom Gallagher : Hello? Nicole, we might need to go on. We didn\u2019t get anything come through on John Lovallo's call. We might need to go to the next caller. Operator : Certainly. The next call is from Brian Sponheimer from Gabelli. Your line is open. Brian Sponheimer : Hey it's Brian. Few things here. One within Motion, any impact from decline in price of oil in the quarter, particularly in some of those Western Canada markets you got into? Tom Gallagher : Yes Brian this is Tom. Certainly we're going to be impacted like anybody else that services the oil patch. I would say that for us it\u2019s a low single digit percentage of our total volumes. So while it's significant in terms of gross dollars, it's not as big as it might be for some others. Brian Sponheimer : Low single digit of motion. Tom Gallagher : Of motion. And the other thing I would say is that importantly we are going to see a near term decline in demand coming out of those areas. But the segment is not going to go away. It's going contract but it's still going to be there. And potentially an offset for Motion is the lower fuel prices that Paul referenced, that give the consumer a more discretionary income and as that money starts to get spent, it will flow through other segments of the economy, which could and should impact in a positive way some of the other manufacturing customers that Motion deals with. So near term we think it will be a bit of a headwind. Medium and longer term we think it will probably balance out. Brian Sponheimer : Just thinking about the fourth shut down. Have you guys seen any impact on some of your vendors been able to get product to you? Tom Gallagher : We look at it a couple of ways; one, with what's happening with some of our vendors; and two, what's happening on some of the direct importing that we're doing. And what we've seen is I think most people are doing a pretty good job of working through the situation. I know in our own case we've had to divert shipments to other ports. So it has not had a significant impact on service levels but it has added to our lead times but it's something we're watching pretty carefully. Brian Sponheimer : All right, and as I'm thinking about the guidance up 4%, that implies roughly speaking at the high end $15 billion revenue for 2015. What impact do you factor acquisitions for that? Is that the $390 million you referenced before? Tom Gallagher : No in that would be the acquisitions that were completed in 2014. But we have not factored in anything for any future acquisitions. We do have the Miller Bearing acquisition in there that we mentioned promotion $40 million on an annualized run rate. But anything that happens subsequent is not factored in there. Brian Sponheimer : And what's the non-comp revenue number that you're implying with that $16 billion. Tom Gallagher : When you say non-comp? Brian Sponheimer : Acquired business that you expect to flow through, is it upwards of 250 million? Tom Gallagher : We don\u2019t have that here Brian. We can have Sid get back to you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham : My question is around NAPA. You mentioned that core NAPA operating margins were strong and improved overall auto margins in 4Q. Just to clarify, the NAPA U.S margins increased year over year in the fourth quarter and how did that compare to recent quarters trends? Tom Gallagher : The margins improved on a quarterly basis and for the full year. So the NAPA organization performed quite well for us this year again. Seth Basham : Got it. So the entire drag was really driven by business outside of the U.S. Tom Gallagher : That\u2019s right. Seth Basham : And then\u2026. Tom Gallagher : And Seth, just one other thing. That was due to a currency exchange. As Paul referenced we had local currency growth and improvement in these other businesses but when we translated, we lost all of that. Seth Basham : Got it. Understood. Clearly you guys put up some good core numbers for NAPA U.S. Do you have a sense of where you might be taking share from? Paul Donahue : Hey Seth, this is Paul. That's always difficult to tell, especially as you look at some of the good numbers our publically traded competitors put out, but I would have to think that if we're taking a bit of share, it may be from of the smaller regional players that are out there, that perhaps are not growing quite at the level that we are and perhaps some of our publically traded competitors. Seth Basham : Okay. And what about the independent side of the business in the U.S.? How did that perform, and are you acquiring more independents for that business? Tom Gallagher : Independent, the thing we liked about the performance honestly is how balanced it was. Both our Company store group and our independent group grew at comparable levels. Paul Donahue : And to answer the second part of that question Seth, in terms of -- continue to expand our independent business and to our convert other independent owners out there, absolutely that's core to our business and something that our team is very focused on every year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Higginbotham from SunTrust. Your line is open. Robert Higginbotham : Question about a recent transaction in the Automotive space. Uni-Select recently sold their US Automotive business to Icahn. And so I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about what the new owner of that business might do with that asset; how you view that as either an opportunity maybe to pick up jobber stores, or a threat competitively. And actually on that front, when you look at other wholesale, independent versus owned store business models, you guys have been a clear standout in terms of consistently executing that business, where others have struggled. What would you point to as kind of your secret sauce to success? And what is and would be difficult for others to replicate? Paul Donahue : Hey Robert, this is Paul. I'll take the first part of that question and I know you're referring to Uni-Select U.S. and the acquisition by Carl Icahn. Very early on in the process and honestly we probably know about as much as you do at this point. It does not change the competitive landscape. So Uni-Select U.S., I think I read where they were ranked as the No. 5 player in the U.S. So that doesn't really change the competitive landscape at all for us at this point. It may open up some opportunities and I would say that in terms of other Icahn owned business, which of course is Federal-Mogul, they are a long time supplier to NAPA, they are a long time supplier to our industry and they are a good supplier. So for us at this point, until we learn a whole lot more Robert, it's essentially business as usual. The second part of your question then, as it relates to the secret sauce, I don\u2019t know that we have any secret sauce. We have a good strategy each year. We tend to stick to our core. We have a very good group of independent entrepreneurial owners in the marketplace who are very good at what they do and we provide them what we think is best in class training and programs to enable them to compete everyday out there on the street. And so if there is any secret sauce, that may be the takeaway. Robert Higginbotham : Okay. And switching gears to Office Products, how should we think about the potential impact of the pending Staples/Office Depot merger? Could you help us at least maybe size what you see the opportunity -- and risk on the flip side of that of being to maybe gaining some first call volumes; and again on the flipside maybe potentially losing some first call volumes. And then how to think about just overall margin trends, as presumably that bigger entity will push you on price. Tom Gallagher : Robert, I'll take a stab at that and I start by saying that these are both good companies and this transaction seems to make good strategic sense for each of them. As you probably know they're both fine customers to S.P. Richards who are first call with Office Depot; and we've got a significant second call position with Staples. From the published reports, and that's all we can go on but from the published reports that we've seen, the transaction is probably going to be consummated toward the later part of the year. So between now and then it's business as usual and we're going to continue to provide the best service that we can provide, and the best support that we can provide to both entities, and certainly post transaction will hope to be the first call -- a wholesale provider to the new entity. As far as trying to size it, we wouldn\u2019t want to get into that here. But we\u2019re optimistic about what\u2019s going to happen in the future. We think there is a lot of upside there potentially. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from BB&T. Your line is open. Bret Jordan : Most have been hit, but could we talk a little bit about the Mexico initiative? I think you were ramping that up in the fall of 2014; and maybe some early signs on success there? Paul Donahue : Yes, absolutely, Bret, we did launch our NAPA Mexico initiative back in October. We opened our distribution center and a number of company owned stores in the marketplace. It\u2019s very early on. We\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making and it\u2019s going to be a long initiative for us for sure. But in the early days we\u2019re pleased with the progress that our team is making down there. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then one follow-up question on an earlier topic and you're picking up independent distributors and clearly there's been some transition out there on the Carquest side. Could you give us any color? Have you added -- and the numbers that you have added to Carquest, ex-Carquest distributors? Tom Gallagher : This is Tom, Bret. I think the way we\u2019d like to answer that is that we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made to-date. We continue to see opportunities and we think we\u2019ll continue to make progress but we would not want to disclose the absolute numbers. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Melich : I had one follow-up on the margin progression on the guidance, and then a little more mechanical question for Carol. First, it sounds like although margins were down only because of FX in the fourth quarter, and so when you look at your guidance for this year, when you say that you expect the margins to be up, is that in core in Auto? Or do you think that once you bring in the FX, they could actually be down a bit at least for the first few quarters? Carol Yancey : I guess our gross margin guidance that we would be giving would be in total, since we don\u2019t really get into it by segment. And I think our around 30% guidance assumes probably flattish in all of our businesses. I think the operating margin improvement that we\u2019ve talked about in each of our segments and we\u2019ve talked about the 10 to 20 basis point improvement and coming off of this year and have 30 basis points, we\u2019ve been really pleased to see that, that we\u2019ve got certainly some headwinds going into 2015. That's primarily going to probably more come through the SG&A line more so than the growth margin line. Bret Jordan : And then, Carol, on working capital, given the nice improvement that you saw, if I\u2019m not mistaken the cash from ops actually came in a little bit lower than the guidance you had earlier in the year. I think it was 900 million and ended up being about 100 million less than that. What was driving that? Was that the receivable growth that you talked about? And could you help explain a little bit what your business has been and how that will normalize? Thanks. Carol Yancey : Yes. So, you\u2019re right. We were a little bit short what we had anticipated from our cash from activities and I would tell you the two primary areas for accounts receivable that you mentioned and that's primarily in the Automotive and Office Sector and again with the stronger revenue growth in what we had, on some of that is we have additional terms. I would tell that our day sales outstanding, we look at it over the course of the couple years. In the past four years that\u2019s been flat. So we\u2019ve been pleased to see that. The second factor in working capital was accounts payable which you mentioned and it goes to a little bit earlier when I mentioned our team really did a good job in the inventory area. So we had in a couple of the segments and it was certainly Industrial and Electrical that slowed down their purchases if you will. So you didn\u2019t see as much on the accounts payable side. And then the other thing is on automotive, which is certainly where we see a lot of the improved terms, we have anniversaried some of those. And it was largely a timing thing that we didn\u2019t have as much coming into the quarter. So we\u2019re looking for improvement on those lines. And again, it was a strong number but not quite where we thought it would be. Greg Melich : Would it be fair to sum up that last year\u2019s earlier goal, the $900 million, included a bigger working capital benefit? Instead now you\u2019re going to see that benefit over a few years, and that\u2019s why now we\u2019re using $800 million to $850 million. Is that a fair summary? Carol Yancey : I think that\u2019s a fair summary, yes. And I think that and we don\u2019t talk about it as much is our [indiscernible] to inventory was 84% this year and 77% last year. So it\u2019s improvement each year but I think it spread out over little longer period. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We want to thank you for your participation today and your support of Genuine Parts Company and we look forward to reporting back to you in April after our first quarter numbers. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Jackie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Genuine Parts Company First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Sid Jones, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sid Jones : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts' first quarter 2015 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses. The Company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the Company\u2019s latest SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We\u2019ll begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom? Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Sid. And I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer are both on the call as well, and each of us has a few prepared remarks and once completed, we\u2019ll look forward to answering any specific questions that you may have. Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2015 results and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $3.736 billion, which was up 3%, net income was $161 million, which was up 2%, and earnings per share were $1.05 this year compared to $1.02 in the first quarter last year, and the EPS increase was 3%. And although these sales and earnings growth rates have moderated from the results in recent quarters, they are pretty much in line with what we anticipated for the quarter and as such we feel that we came through the quarter in pretty good shape. We knew at the beginning of the quarter that we were facing tough comparisons with first quarter 2014 revenues up 13% and earnings per share up 10%. Additionally, we felt that the strength of the U.S. dollar would be a significant headwind for us and as it turned out, this cost us 2% on the revenue line in the quarter and $0.02 in earnings per share. And then weather had a bit of a negative impact as that did a deceleration in the oil and gas segment of the economy. So all in, we feel that our teams did a pretty good job in navigating their way through the quarter and we remain optimistic about the remainder of the year. Turning to the sales results by segment, I\u2019ll make few comments on each of the three non-automotive businesses and then Paul will give you an update on the automotive operations. Starting with Office Products, S.P. Richards turned in another strong quarter at plus 17%. Acquisitions completed in 2014 certainly helped as did the enhanced first call relationship with one of the mega companies. But importantly, the underlying business performed well also with solid growth in both the mega and independent reseller channels. The e-commerce an alternate channel customers performed well in the quarter as well. From a product category perspective, all four categories, technology, facility and breakroom, furniture and core office products each showed nice growth in the quarter and we are pleased with the balance and the composition of our office products growth, both from a customer and a product category perspective. And we feel that the office products team has positioned to turn in the solid performance over the remainder of the year. Moving on the Industrial segment, Motion industries ended the quarter up 3%. 11 of our top 12 product categories generated positive results in the quarter and nine of our top 12 customer groups grew nicely in the quarter. Our strongest results came from customers in automotive, coal aggregate and cements, lumber and wood products and rubber and plastic products. And this follows a relative strength of each of these segments in the overall economy. We had weaker results in oil and gas, pulp and paper, and steel again mirroring, what we see happening in the overall economy. As we look ahead, we\u2019re mindful of the deceleration that we have seen in the industrial production; capacity utilization and Purchasing Managers Index over the course of the first quarter and each of these have been reliable leading demand indicators for our industrial business, so we\u2019re watching them closely, but despite the modest deceleration, it\u2019s important to note that each remain at historically healthy levels. And at this point, our industrial team remains optimistic about the reminder of the year. Perhaps partly driven by the fact that our pending project work is up substantially over the same period last year, which is encouraging. Moving on to the third of our non-automotive businesses, EIS was up 1% in the quarter. Some of the same factors that impacted our industrial business were headwinds for the electrical segment as well. Things like the deceleration in the oil and gas customer segment, the strength of the dollar impact on export related customers, lower defense spending this year versus last, and the lower copper pricing again this year. To one degree or another each of these will continue to be factors in the quarters ahead. However, we were encouraged to close out the first quarter with a solid performance in March. And then our team feels that they\u2019re starting to build a bit of momentum as we enter Q2. Additionally, they completed the acquisition of Connect-Air into the wire and cable segment as of April 1st and this will add about $28 million to their annual revenue. So that\u2019s a quick overview of the non-automotive business. I\u2019ll now ask Paul to comment on the automotive segments. Paul? Paul Donahue : Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone and let me add my welcome to our first quarter conference call. I\u2019m pleased to join here today and have an opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our automotive business. For the quarter ending March 31st, our global automotive business sales were flat year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 3% core automotive growth. The benefit of just less than 1% from recent acquisitions, which are offsets by approximately 4% of currency adjustments. The currency adjustment was in line with our expectations for the quarter. When reviewing our quarterly performance, we knew going into the quarter, we were up again strong comps from one year ago and part driven by the extreme cold winter weather. Unfortunately, Mother Nature did not cooperate this past winter. We saw a little benefit as a result of the winter temps and in fact a heavy snow and ice experienced in places like Boston and a good portion of the Northeast create challenges for our operations and our customers. In addition, like many businesses, we felt the impact of the West Coast port slowdown and the effect that had on our overall supply chain. During the first quarter, we saw our U.S. team posted 3% sales increase, while our international businesses including Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand grew mid single-digits in their local currencies. Overall, we\u2019re pleased to see steady growth in all of our markets and expect to see steady growth for the balance of 2015. In the U.S., all regions within country are positive contributing to our revenue growth with the exception for the \u2013 few of the more energy dependent areas of the country. As we saw in the fourth quarter, we experienced continued strength in the Atlantic division, Midwest, and western divisions. In addition, our southern division had a solid first quarter. So now let\u2019s turn to our same-store sales numbers. Our U.S. company owned store group grew comp same store sales in the first quarter by 3%. This 3% is on top of an 8% increase generated in the strong first quarter of 2014, which gives up a two year stack of 11%. This performance was not unexpected due to the tough comps we were up against, but we would also like to point out that we expect this number to improve as the year progresses. A 3% sales increase in first quarter was driven by a combination of solid sales on both our commercial wholesale side of the business and on our retail side of the business. So let\u2019s start with our retail business. As mentioned in previous calls, we have put a renewed focus on this segment of our business. We\u2019re pleased to report, these initiatives are continuing to pay dividends. Our team did a good job in the quarter driving a 6% increase on our retail business, which was on top of a 9% increase one year ago. Retail basic such as extended store hours, proper staffing, dedicated retail associates, planogram compliance and increased training have all had a hand on our recent improved performance. We continue to push for increases with both the size of our average ticket and the number of tickets flowing through our stores. In the first quarter, we experienced an increase in our average retail ticket and an increase in the number of retail tickets. This performance was consistent with our fourth quarter metrics, so it\u2019s encouraging to see our average ticket in whole. We would like to complement both our retail team at headquarters as well as all of our associates on our stores for stepping up and embracing our retail initiatives. We still have a great deal of heavy lifting yet to do, but it\u2019s clear, we\u2019re on the right track and the opportunity for growth is there. So now, let\u2019s turn to our commercial wholesale business or our Do It For Me segment. This segment turned in a 3% increase in the first quarter. Highlights for the quarter include solid performances by our two major wholesale initiatives, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts. Starting with our Major Account business this strategic segment delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of low double-digit growth, a terrific accomplishment by our entire Major Accounts team. And our NAPA AutoCare centers, now totaling over 15,500 nationwide, posted strong single-digit sales increases in the quarter. We\u2019d also like to report on our fleet business, after reporting a solid increase in this important segment in 2014, we posted a mid single-digit increase in the first quarter of 2015. So we\u2019re pleased to see the continued growth in this important segment of our business. We can also report solid trends in our average wholesale ticket value, which registered positive growth in the month with no inflation support. We also saw positive year-over-year growth in the average number of tickets flowing through our stores. Now let\u2019s take a look at few of our key product categories and review some of the trends we experienced in the first quarter. We are pleased to report continued growth in both our Bright business, as well as our tool and equipment business. In addition, our NAPA Import Parts business was up low double-digits once again this quarter. One additional product category worth noting is our all important Electrical business, including our rotating and electrical product lines and our battery business. Despite double-digit growth in the month of March, we were up just over 1% for the quarter. It\u2019s a clear illustration of the strong prior year comps that we faced in the January and February timeframe. It is worth noting that we experienced supply chain interruptions with one of our key under car lines in the first quarter that has now carried over into the second quarter. This interruption had an impact on our operations in our customers\u2019 business in the quarter. We are diligently working toward a solution anticipate improvement in the weeks ahead. Despite the slower start to the year, we continued to be encouraged by the automotive aftermarket fundamentals. The average age of the fleet remains at excess of 11 years, the size of the fleet continues to grow and not surprising, the all-important miles driven metric recorded its largest growth in the past five years. As we reported last quarter miles driven up 1.4% through 11 months in 2014. Then in the month of December, miles driven increased by 5%, and most recent figures were January show 4.9% gain. This growth is a direct result of the lowest fuel prices in almost a decade and both well for future demand. So in summary, our first quarter was pretty much in line with where we felt we would end up. Foreign currency as expected was the significant headwind and we expect this to continue for several more quarters. That said, our business in our international markets continues to perform well in their respective local currencies. And as expected, we experience some softness in areas of the U.S. that are more energy dependent. And lastly, we knew going into the new year that we would be up against strong comps in the first quarter and we would need to weather the storm. We feel we did just that. We are encouraged with our same store sales and we remain optimistic with the outlook for the balance of the year. So in closing, we want to thank our management teams in North America, as well as our team on the ground in Australasia for a solid first quarter for the GPC automotive business. So that completes our overview of the GPC automotive business and at this time I\u2019ll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you Paul and good morning. We\u2019ll begin this morning with a review of our income statement and the segment information and then we\u2019ll review some balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back up to wrap it up and then we\u2019ll take your questions. As Tom mentioned our total revenues at $3.7 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 3.1% consisted of our underlying sales growth of 3.8% and a 1.5% increase from acquisitions. These items were offset by a strong currency headwind at 2.2%. Our gross profit for the first quarter was 29.8% and this compares to 29.9% growth margin last year. This was in line with our expectations for a relatively constant gross margin in 2015, as the margin initiatives across all of our businesses are intended to offset the ongoing customer and product mix shifts that continue to pressure our gross margins. With that said, there\u2019s slight decline in our first quarter gross margin directly related to the customer mix shift that we are facing in our Office Product segments. Looking ahead, we continue to expect a relatively constant gross margin in 2015 that this area has our full attention and we\u2019re committed to making progress towards an enhanced gross margin for the long-term. Our gross margin initiatives are also critical in offsetting the low inflationary environment that has persisted across all of our businesses for several years now especially in automotive. Our supplier pricing thus far in 2015 indicates that we should expect more of the same lack of deflation again this year. Our cumulative supplier price increases through March were down four tenths of 1% in Automotive, up four tenths of 1% in Industrial, up six tenths of 1% in Office Products and up two tenths of 1% in Electrical. Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses were $861 million in the first quarter, which is up 2.5% from 2014. This represents 23.1% of sales which has slightly improved from the 23.2% last year and encouraging giving the underlying sales growth of approximately 4% for the quarter. We attribute this progress to the benefits of our ongoing emphasis on effective cost management and we expect this is our continued progress on our SG&A line in the periods ahead. Now we\u2019ll review our results by segments. Our Automotive revenue for the first quarter was $1.9 billion, which was flat with the prior year and 51% of total sales. Our operating profit of $151 million is up four tenths of 1%, so their margin held constant with 2014 at 7.9%. This is in line that what we would expect on a 3% compared to sales increase. Our Industrial sales were $1.18 billion in the first quarter, which is up 3.4% for 2014 and 31% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $88 million is up 6% and our operating margin increased 10 basis point to 7.4%. We\u2019re pleased to, excuse me, to see the expanded margin given at 3% sales increase and we would add that this was driven by slightly improved gross margin for the quarter, as well as an improvement in their SG&A. Our Office Products revenues were $490.3 million in the quarter, up a strong 17%, and represents 13% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $36.5 million is up 8%, so their margin was down 70 basis points to 7.4% as the customer mix shift pressuring our gross margins continues to impact the net margin for this business. Electrical/Electronic Group have sales in the first quarter of a $182 million 1% increase and 5% of our total revenue. Our operating profit at $15.5 million is down four tenths of 1%, so the margin was down 10 basis points that remain strong at 8.5%. So in total, our operating profit increased 3% in the first quarter, which is in line with our sales growth. Our operating profit margin held constant with last year at 7.8% and this follows the 30 basis point expansion in our operating margin for the full year in 2014, and we remain focused on our initiatives to show further expansion in the periods ahead. We had net interest expense of $5.3 million in the first quarter, which is down from $6.2 million last year. We continue to expect net interest expense of approximately $22 million to $24 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense was $8.6 million for the first quarter, which is fairly consistent with last year. We currently estimate $40 million to $42 million in total amortization expense for the full year. The other line which reflects our corporate expense was $25 million expense for the first quarter, which is up slightly from the $23.6 million in the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect corporate expense to be in the $85 million to $95 million range for the full year. Our tax rate was approximately 36% for the first quarter, which is up slightly from the 35.5% last year. For the full year we now expect our tax rates trend in the 36.7% to 37.0% range. Our net income for the quarter of $161 million compared to the $157.5 million or 2% improvement and as Tom mentioned our EPS was $1.05 compared to last year\u2019s $1.02. Now we\u2019ll discuss a few key balance sheet items. Our cash at March 31 was $166 million, an increase from approximate $103 million at March of last year. We continue to use our cash to support the growth initiatives in each of our businesses and we remain comfortable with our cash position. Our accounts receivable of $2.0 billion at March 31 increased 8% from the prior year on a 4% core sales increase for the first quarter. We remain focused on our goal of growing receivables at a rate less than revenue growth and we\u2019ll be working hard to achieve this objective in the periods ahead. We continue to be satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.0 billion which is up approximately 1% from March of 2014 and actually down 1% from year end. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we\u2019ll remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels in the periods ahead. Our accounts payable balance at March 31 is $2.6 billion, up 12% from the prior year, due to the positive impact of improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We shall continue the improvement in this area for several periods now and we are encouraged by positive impact on our working capital and our days and payables. Our working capital of $1.9 billion is down 3% from last year and effectively managing our working capital and in particular our accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable is a very high priority for our company. Our ongoing efforts with these key accounts have resulted in solid improvement in our working capital position and cash flow for the last several years and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition at March 31 of 2015. Our total debt of $894 million at March 31 is basically unchanged from the prior year and this represents approximately 22% of our total capitalization. Our total debt includes two $250 million term notes, as well as another $394 million in borrowings under our multi-currency syndicated credit facility agreement. We're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We continue to generate solid cash flows and we\u2019re well positioned for the balance of 2015. For the full year we expect cash from operations to be in the $800 million to $850 million range and free cash flow which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be in the $350 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our first priority for cash is the dividend which we paid every year since going public in 1948, and have now raised for 59 consecutive years, a record that continues to distinguish genuine parts from other companies. The 2015 annual dividend of $2.46 per share represents a 7% increase from the $2.30 per share paid in 2014 and it\u2019s approximately 53% of our 2014 earnings per share, which is well within our goal of a payout of 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our core businesses, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. Our investment in capital expenditures was $16 million for the first quarter, which is down slightly from $18 million in the first quarter of 2014. We expect our expenditures to increase as the year progress and we continue to look for CapEx spending to be in the range of $125 million to $145 million for the full year. As usual, the vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in technology. Our depreciation and amortization was $36 million in the first quarter and looking ahead, we are projecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $155 million to $165 million for the full year in 2015. Our strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and an important use of our cash for us and they\u2019re integral to the growth plans for our company. As reported on our year end call in February, we made a few small acquisitions in the Industrial and Office business early in the first quarter and these are performing well for us. Effective April 1, we close on two additional acquisitions, one for Automotive and one for Electrical, and we expect these two operations to contribute annual revenues of $35 million or approximately $25 million in 2015. We will continue to seek new acquisitions across our business segments to further enhance our prospect for future growth generally targeting those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range. Finally, during the quarter we used our cash to repurchase approximately 870,000 shares of our common stock under the Company\u2019s share repurchase program. Today, we have 8.7 million shares authorized and available for purchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. So that concludes our financial update on the first quarter of 2015, overall solid results and in line with our expectations that we\u2019re pleased with the first three months of the year and encouraged by the opportunities before us. We look forward to updating you on our future progress when we report again in July. And in closing I\u2019d like to thank all of our GPC associates for the outstanding job that they do each day. That concludes our financial review and now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Tom. Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Carol, and thanks to you and Paul for your comprehensive updates. So that will conclude our prepared comments on the quarter, and as mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter pretty much inline with what we thought we would be. With that in mind we would like to reaffirm our full year guidance that we provided back in February and just as a reminder at that time we guided for Automotive revenues to be up 2% to 3%, which includes an estimated 4% negative impact from currency exchange. We guided Office Products to up 6% to 7%, Industrial and Electrical to each be up 5% to 6%. And based up on the current trends and the external indices, as well as softness in the energy and export sectors, our current bias will be towards the bottom end of the range for both Industrial and Electrical. Putting all of this together would give us an overall GPC sales increase of 3% to 4%, which includes 2.5% to 3% negative currency impact. On the earning side our guidance remains for EPS to come in between $4.77 and $4.80. And as a reminder this includes approximately $0.15 per share impact from unfavorable exchange rates and the related increase in our overall tax rate. So that would conclude our remarks at this point and we\u2019ll turn the call back to Jackie to take your questions. Jackie? Operator : [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Good morning. Tom Gallagher : Good morning, Seth. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Seth Basham : My question is on the Auto business, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of your view of the slowdown in the comp sequentially from the last quarter given the miles driven strength. Do you think its industry wide phenomena or do you think it\u2019s only a supply chains issues are the primary factor hurting you this quarter? Tom Gallagher : So, Seth, I\u2019ve taken and may be in a couple of buckets. Certainly we are up against some really tough comps, we knew that going in. First quarter was our strongest of the year, last year. So I\u2019d certainly say that had an impact. Two, I\u2019d say, some of the key product line disruptions that we experienced along with the West Coast port issues cost us in the first quarter. And I don\u2019t think that will be strictly relegated to GPC and NAPA, I think, that will be felt by others, as well. The energy sector had an impact for sure, Seth. Some of the \u2013 certainly Texas which is what everybody thinks about when they think about the energy sector, but parts of the Mountain Division for us, as well as some parts of Canada, certainly Alberta, Canada were impacted, as well. And then last but not least, the one that we always chat about and that\u2019s the weather, the weather was of no help at all to us, we don\u2019t think in the first quarter. Seth Basham : That\u2019s helpful. So do you quantify those three buckets in a Asia perform [ph]? Tom Gallagher : I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared to do that at this point of time, Seth. Seth Basham : All right, no problem. Thank you very much. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Hi thanks. I want a follow-up a little bit about the Auto trends and tie it through to margins and working capital. Given that retail is driving a lot of growth, I would sort of expect gross margin that maybe be better given that there\u2019s basically the deflation in the buy. Could you help us understand why margins are not expanding in Auto? And then the tide in the working capital, there were this increase in payables. Should we assume that this is a good run rate is there a steady point of an AP ratio that you target Carol? Carol Yancey : Yeah, I guess I\u2019ll start with the margin first. So we mentioned that decline in gross margin on a consolidated basis was solely related to the Office Products decline that you saw in the operating margin. So that would lead you to assume and while we don\u2019t disclose it separately is that the non-office businesses were either flat to up slightly. So we actually were pleased with the automotive gross margins this quarter and the progress we\u2019ve made. So, I would say that a lot of our initiatives and some of the impact that we talked about earlier with transactional FX headwinds that we had in Q4. Our teams did a lot of hard work in that area. We continue to have the usual customer product mix, but I think a lot of our initiatives are helping us to show that improvement. But honestly, where we \u2013 when we only have a 3% sales increase, it\u2019s hard for us to get that operating margin up 10 or 20 basis points. So, we would still look for that on balance for the rest of the year. But I think we were pleased to keep the margins flat in automotive in light of what the comp sales increase was. And then the second question on the working capital, we were pleased with the progress that we made. And I think when we\u2019re looking at the rest of the year; we would say that there would be improvement. We\u2019ve reiterated our guidance on the working capital and the cash flow, but I think we saw some better results coming through on the first quarter. So, if we can continue to do the job with payables and inventory, I think you\u2019ll see a continued improvement. Greg Melich : And then on the receivables, is there any particular thing driving the growth with a certain category or new terms of certain customers? Carol Yancey : Really, that\u2019s been specific. I think again as we look towards what we\u2019re seeing in receivables, we just try to make sure that again if its customers are certain programs that we\u2019re getting the corresponding offset on the payable side with our vendors. Tom Gallagher : And Greg I would\u2026 Greg Melich : And then last one if I could and then I\u2019ll let someone else. Yes\u2026 Tom Gallagher : Greg, I would just add to that. I think we would expect that the receivables will improve sequentially and be more in line with the overall revenue growth as we get towards the second half of the year. Greg Melich : And then, Tom, you mentioned if there\u2019s one area where you think it\u2019s on the lower end and it\u2019s Industrial and Electrical. Could you point us to why specifically that is other than just may be energy a little bit, is there industrial production or other things that you think look a little softer? Thank you. Tom Gallagher : Yes in fact we do think oil and gas will continue to be a headwind. And that\u2019s got a fairly long tail, it\u2019s not just the number of rigs that are running. When you think about that it also extends into steel, for instance, I\u2019ll referenced steel in my comments earlier, none of those pipes are being purchased to go down in the wells and extends into some of the other customer segments additionally. So that would be one thing. And then with industrial production and capacity utilization and the Purchasing Managers Index, we did see some moderation. As the quarter progressed, we were pleased to see a slight uptick in the March industrial production from the revised February industrial production, but we just want to be a bit cautious. And as I mentioned in my comments, we do track to the best of our ability what we would refer to as project work. And we are a bit encouraged by the fact that both the number of projects in-house and the dollar amount are showing nice increases and hopefully they worked their way through the income statement in the months ahead. Greg Melich : Great, thanks a lot. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, this is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aram Rubinson. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. Carol Yancey : Hi, Chris. Q \u2013 Chris Bottiglieri : Good morning. I just had a quick question on the Automotive business, can you give us a update on the independence if you\u2019re seeing any kind of pick up in [indiscernible] switching on the NAPA brand, or if you\u2019re just seeing any increased number of conversations being held? Paul Donahue : Yes, Chris, this is Paul. For sure the \u2013 what we\u2019ve got a good deal of activity that\u2019s continuing on that our team has involved in and the field that. And honestly, we\u2019re quite pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve seen both really in the second half of last year as well as in the first quarter of this year. And I would tell you that we don\u2019t see that activity slowing down at all. As a matter of fact, we\u2019re optimistic with what we see ahead of us in 2015. Q \u2013 Chris Bottiglieri : Got it, thanks. And one longer term question I have. You see this is like an overall sense on your kind of long-term view of the independent business as some of these businesses owners are getting retired. Are you seeing them kind of pass down their businesses within the family to selling to other independent? Or do you think like [indiscernible] this could become a pipeline for GPC Company on service down the road? Tom Gallagher : I will try to answer that, Chris this is Tom. I think it\u2019s a combination of all of the things you referenced. The way we work with our independent owners is that we try to stay very close to them not just operationally, but also with their succession planning. And if they don\u2019t have someone in mind to pass the business down to another family member perhaps or good long-term employee then, we\u2019ll work with them to identify another independent that might have an interest in buying their business and we\u2019d have several different programs available to help facilitate that. And then if in fact we don\u2019t come up with someone that should have opt to buy the business, we\u2019ll certainly step in and buy it, and in many cases we\u2019ll run it for a period of time, until we find a good locally based independent to run the business from that point on. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay, very helpful. Thanks for your time. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Okay, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Becks with JP Morgan. Mark Becks : Hi, can you talk about the cadence in Automotive over the quarter and perhaps in the April if you\u2019re willing to address, I know March was \u2013 last year was strong. But just interested in the trend, trying to get a better understanding of why you\u2019re expecting that business to accelerate from here? Paul Donahue : All right, yes, Mark, this is Paul. I would tell you that throughout the first quarter it was pretty consistent, from January, to February to March, but we did see a little bit of a lift in the final two weeks of March for sure, which really that along with the extra selling day that we had in the month of March, gave us a record sales month. So I'm not prepared to talk about April, but we would hope to see that performance move into Q2. Mark Becks : And then as a quick follow-up to that, can you talk about the trend in North East business, and did that experience a similar rebound to the overall business, or is that still tracking pretty softly? Tom Gallagher : I think most of our regions showed some pick up in the second half of March as Paul referenced. And also as he referenced, we continue to see headwinds in the energy related areas. But much of what we experienced in the first quarter was transitory. If you think about the comps, the comps get a little bit easier, they were strong all year along, but they get little bit easier as we work our way through the year. Certainly the impact of the weather will moderate as we work our way through the year and the impact, just for clarification, the impact issue is that we did not have the extreme temperatures over the period of time that we had in the early part of Q1 last year. What we did have is there is a lot of ice and a lot of snow that had a negative impact on all of our businesses frankly because we had a number of closures, both our own facilities, as well as customers\u2019 facilities. So we\u2019re through that at this point and some of the supply chain disruption that Paul referenced will moderate as we work our way over the next couple of months. So you know, we gave you the number for the quarter we also gave you the guidance for the year, and the guidance for the year suggest that we expect our Automotive business to pick up in the remaining three quarters of the year. Mark Becks : Yes, so just to be clear it seems like the port shutdown and the supplier issues, while still not completely gone there at the margin improving? Tom Gallagher : They are improving somewhat, that\u2019s right. Mark Becks : Okay, and then just last housekeeping, can you remind us what the Texas exposure in NAPA, and then the overall any MI exposure to oil and gases? Tom Gallagher : Yes, we don\u2019t give that out, but we have said in the past that the direct exposure for Motion industries is low single-digit, but the hard number to really get to is the indirect exposure. And what I mean by that, I referenced earlier that certainly the rig operators, our business with them is down, but then if you went to the steel side of things, all of the demand for new piping to go down hole that\u2019s gone. Some of the pumps and motor demand that would be the anomaly that\u2019s diminished and then what we don\u2019t and can\u2019t quantify is that when you have the massive number of layoffs specific to that segment, you have all of those workers that are for the most part moving in other areas, but that takes the demand out of the areas that they were in and it doesn\u2019t get replaced one-for-one into the areas that they move to, so you see the ripple effect of that. And we see that back up on other manufacturing customers. So it\u2019s hard to get a true number, but the direct absolute impact we know is in the low single-digit. And then it ripples beyond that. Mark Becks : Okay, thanks for those comments and good luck. Tom Gallagher : Thank you very much. Carol Yancey : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra : Hi, this is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. Very quickly guys, could you contextualize if there was any impact from shift of Easter? Paul Donahue : Well certainly, we\u2019ll see that impact in April, but not really much in Q1. Chandni Luthra : Got it. And the 3% growth that you talked about on comps that\u2019s inclusive of the extra selling day in the month of March, right? Paul Donahue : Yes, it is. Chandni Luthra : Perfect. And then lastly, could you throw some color on you DIY initiatives that kind of helped your margins to hold their own? Thank you. Tom Gallagher : I think Paul might reiterate the comments he made earlier about some of the things we\u2019re doing. Paul Donahue : Yes, thanks for the question. Basically, some of the things that we\u2019re doing on the retail side, really it\u2019s not right at the time we\u2019re focused on the basics and the basics as I mentioned in my opening comments, simply are to ensure our stores are well stocked, ensure our planograms are up to-date, ensure our people are well trained on the floor and ensure our stores are open when customers want to shop them. And so it\u2019s many of those basics that we have reinforced with our team and our company-owned stores and we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re seeing, we saw it throughout last year and we continue to see in the first quarter of 2015. Tom Gallagher : And also I want to go back on the question about did the comps include the extra day in March, yes they did, but in the quarter, we had the same number of dates for the quarter, we were short one day earlier in the quarter and we picked it up in the month of March. So the comps are comparable. Chandni Luthra : Got it, thank you. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen we have one more caller on the line, your final question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Market. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning. Carol Yancey : Good morning, Bret. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Hi, Carol if we looked that accounts payable to inventory for the Auto segment alone, where would that number be? Carol Yancey : Good question Bret. I would \u2013 we don\u2019t give it out by segment I would tell you that as you know it\u2019s more prevalent in automotive industry with the extended terms programs with the supplier. So a lot of our improvement is coming by way the Automotive Segment, but I would tell you also that all of the segments have programs going on and we visited with our teams and each one is them be it Office, be it Industrial, all have programs going on with their suppliers. So we looked at our AP to inventory and it\u2019s 87% at the end of the quarter, it was 84% at the end of the year and 79% a year-ago, and I would tell you again that we don\u2019t give it out by Automotive, but they\u2019ll certainly be higher than that. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then the question for Paul, I guess as you look at the quarter and it didn\u2019t have as much temperature-driven product sales as last year in Auto. I guess, if you look at the extreme weather and what we did to things like road condition, do you think that the net impact of the first quarter\u2019s weather would be positive and that under-car and ride control and some of the categories that might benefit in the second quarter. We\u2019ll pull through or do you think is just a net negative and weather for 2015? Paul Donahue : Well, Bret great question, honestly we\u2019re banking on some of that improvement coming in the second quarter. I think I mentioned to you we saw our battery business really take off in the month of March which we did not have in January and February. And we would hope for the same in some of the other key more weather related products as well. Bret Jordan : Okay, getting a little more granule, I guess, if you look at things that might be seasonally positive, how we are looking nationally on things like temperature control right now are we setting up I guess we\u2019ve had some normal weather on the West Coast for a favorable year-over-year comparison in some of those summer categories or just to where they are now? Paul Donahue : Too early to tell Bret, I would tell you that that category was down slightly in the first quarter. And again we all keep an eye on the weather charge and we\u2019re hoping for some warmer weather this summer. And if we get it, we think our owners and our stores will be well stocked with heating and air conditioning type products and we\u2019ll take advantage of it. Bret Jordan : Okay, and then one last question for Tom, I guess, you mentioned that pending projects were up substantially, I think for motion. Could you give us a little color and may be what\u2019s driving that. Tom Gallagher : Well, I think, our customer base, let me back up first Bret. What we call project work is a lot of times our customers will have plans to do some major refurbishment on a piece of equipment or take a line down to refurbish the line. And they let us know in advance of what their plans are, so that they can be sure that we\u2019ve got all of the product that they may need, when they get into the actual work. So we tried to track as best we can the number of those that we\u2019ve been notified of and also the estimated value of the work. So, we see a nice increase both in terms of numbers, as well as in terms of the dollar value. Now not all of them come to fruition we have seen some overtime we\u2019ve seen some that we\u2019re plan get differed. But with the increase that we see right now we would lead us to believe that over the next quarter or two, we\u2019re going to see some nice project work flow through the revenue line. And what\u2019s driving that as you know we\u2019ve got an aging base of the equipment that\u2019s out there, you\u2019ve got all customers are looking to be more efficient in what they do. So I think it\u2019s been driven by the business demands that they see with their end markets and wanting to be sure that they are in a position to avoid any downtime going forward. Unplanned downtime. Bret Jordan : Okay, thank you. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation on the call today, and we thank you for your continuous support of Genuine Parts Company. We look forward to reporting back out in July with our second quarter numbers. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Stephanie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Sid Jones, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sid Jones : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts' second quarter 2015 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company\u2019s latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We\u2019ll begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom? Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Sid. And I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer are both on the call as well, and each of us has a few prepared remarks and once completed, we\u2019ll look forward to answering any specific questions that you may have. Now earlier this morning, we released our second quarter 2015 results and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.940 billion, which was up 1%. Net income was $195.4 million, which was down 1%, and earnings per share were $1.28 this year compared to $1.28 in the second quarter last year, putting us even in EPS for the quarter. So it was a challenging quarter for us both on the revenue and earnings side, largely attributable to the impact of currency exchange on our international business, as well a continued slowdown in specific segments of the economy which impacted several of our businesses. Paul and I will comment more on these factors as we review the individual business results in a bit more detail. I'll cover the non-automotive businesses first and the Paul will follow on the automotive segment. Starting with Office Products, this team turned in another strong quarter with sales up 14%. The biggest contributor to our overall growth rate continued to come from the mega accounts as has been the case for the past four quarters, and we're enjoying strong results with this customer segment. On the independent reseller side, we saw some moderation in the overall results in the quarter. After four consecutive quarters of steady growth, the independent channel was flat in the second quarter. We were pleased to see a respectable month in June, however, from this important customer segment, and hopefully this will carry on in the months ahead as well. On the product side, we were pleased to see solid growth across all four of our major product categories with facility and breakroom and furniture continuing to post the strongest increases, but we had solid results from technology products and core office suppliers as well. Now as a point of information, in the third quarter, we will anniversary the acquisition of Impact Products which was acquired on July 1st of last year. Additionally, we will anniversary the increased volume from the Office Depot/OfficeMax combination. So as a result of these two factors, our overall office products growth rates will moderate some of over the second half of the year. However, we continue to feel good about the progress that is being made by the office products team and they will turn in a solid performance for us in the second half and for the full year. Moving on to our two businesses that are tied to the manufacturing segment of the overall economy, EIS and Motion Industries. We'll start with EIS, our electrical company. After being up 1% in the first quarter, this team posted a 3.5% increase in the second quarter which was good to see, but candidly acquisition volume drove the improved results with the underlying business actually ending the quarter down 2%. All of this decrease in the underlying business is attributable to the ongoing slowdown in the electrical side of the business, and this is largely due to the continued challenges faced by a number of our original equipment manufacturer customers, challenges faced by our oil and gas customers, as well as a sizeable reduction in copper pricing year-over-year. Conversely, our wire and cable and fabrication and coating segments continued to perform well for us. These two businesses now account for just over 55% of our total EIS revenue, and we are pleased with the progress that they are making. Looking out over the remainder of the year, our expectation is that we will continue to face challenges in the electrical side of the business, but we do expect a solid second half from the wire and cable and fabrication and coating teams. Before turning it over to Paul, a few comments on Motion Industries, our large industrial distribution company. These folks had a challenging second quarter ending with sales down 2%. Unfavorable currency exchange was a factor in the quarter, but in addition to that we saw further weakening in certain segments of the customer base in the quarter as well. From a product category perspective, across our top 13 categories, we had six categories that had increases, one category was flat, and six categories had decreases in the quarter. These 13 categories in total account for over 90% of our industrial business and you can see the inconsistency and the choppiness in the results. If we look at our top 20 customers, the pattern is somewhat similar. Among these 20 customers, 11 were up, 2 were even with the prior year, and 7 were down. Again, inconsistent and choppy results. Our strongest performing customer segments, both for the quarter and year-to-date, are in the automotive, aggregate and cement, and lumber and wood products categories, and these results would mirror the strength of the performance of each of these segments in the overall economy. On the other side of the ledger, our weakest results will be with customers in the oil and gas, iron and steel, pulp and paper, and original equipment and machinery segments. And here again, we think that this is reflective of overall economic trends and the uneven recovery among the North American manufacturing base with some segments fairing better than others. Of our four business segments, industrial is the one that is most challenged currently, largely attributable to the tepid and inconsistent end market environment and conditions right now, and this is not a situation that we see changing materially in the near term. So under these circumstances, our industrial team is focused on market share, and share of wallet initiatives, and actively looking for strategic bolt-on acquisitions as they work to improve their revenue picture over the second half of the year. At this point, we'll ask Paul to update you on the automotive results for the quarter. Paul? Paul Donahue : Yes. Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I\u2019m pleased to be with you here today and have the opportunity to provide you an update on our second quarter performance of our automotive business. For the quarter ending June 30th, our global automotive business sales were flat year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 4% growth in core automotive, which is an increase from the 3% core growth we reported in the first quarter. However, similar to the first quarter, this was offset by approximately 4% of currency adjustments. The currency adjustment was relatively in line with our expectations for the quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, our US team posted a 3% sales increase, while our international businesses, which include Canada, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand grew mid-single digits in local currency. Overall, we believe this represents fairly steady growth across all of our markets, and we expect to see this continue over the second half of 2015. In the US, we are pleased that nearly every region of the country positively contributed to our revenue growth in the second quarter. This includes the Northeastern region, which was impacted in the first quarter by the strong weather driven comps of a year ago, as well as the Southwest region. This region has been hit hard by the current oil and gas slump, so we are pleased to see even modest growth. Our strongest growth for the quarter occurred in our Atlantic and Central regions of the U.S. We should note the Midwest section of the country which had reported double-digit growth in 2014 and positive growth in the first quarter was flat in the second quarter as the rain and generally dismal weather patterns that had plagued this area in recent month dampened demand. Across Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, rainfall records were set in the month of June with each day receiving twice its average monthly rain levels. We are encouraged to report that two weeks into July as more normal weather \u2013 summer weather has set in, our business is coming back strong. Let's turn to our same-store sales. Our US company owned store group grew comparable same store sales in the quarter by 3%, consistent with the first quarter. This 3% increase was on top of the 7% increases generated in a strong second quarter of 2014, giving us a two year stack of 10%. Our 3% sales increase in the quarter was driven by a combination of increases on both our commercial wholesale side of the business, and by our retail business. Let\u2019s start with our retail results . As mentioned in previous calls, we have put a renewed focus on this important segment of our business. Our retail associates out in our stores, as well as our retail team here at headquarters continued to get the job done driving a 7% increase in the quarter, which is up from the 6% increase in the first quarter and on top of the 7% increase from one year ago. We are encouraged with these continued strong results, and it confirms the initiatives our team is focusing on are the right ones. Our retail initiatives have had a positive impact on both the size or average ticket and the number of tickets moving through our stores. In the second quarter, we experienced an increase in our average retail ticket and a significant lift in the number of retail tickets. Our retail strategy continued to be refined but be assured it remains a priority for us. We realized we've got a great deal of work ahead of us but our results are reassuring and the opportunity for further growth is out there. So now, let\u2019s turn to our commercial wholesale business. This segment turned in a 2% increase in the second quarter. So we experienced slight deceleration from the 3% increase in the first quarter, but with 7% growth last year we can report a 2 year stack of 9%. Our fleet business the key component of our commercial wholesale segment moderated in the second quarter and while still positive contributed to our overall deceleration in this segment of our business. Highlights for the quarter included solid performances by our two major wholesale initiatives, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts. Our NAPA AutoCare centers now totaling over 15,800 nationwide and our Major Account business delivered high single digit sales increases. We can also report solid trends at our average wholesale ticket value, which registered positive growth in the quarter with no inflation support. Although we did see a slight decline in the average number of tickets flowing through our stores. However, we did point out after a slow start to the quarter, we saw our ticket count improved throughout the quarter and in the month of June we experienced a solid increase. Let\u2019s take a look at few of our key product categories and review some of the trends we experienced in the second quarter. Consistent with the first quarter, we can report strong growth in both our Bright business, as well as our tool and equipment business. We are especially encouraged by the double-digit growth we saw in the month of June with our heating and cooling product, after a slow start to the quarter warmer than normal temperatures in the west, the mountain in the Southwest generated strong air conditioning related sales. In addition, our NAPA Import Parts business was once again up low double-digits this quarter. Finally in our first quarter call we commented on supply chain interruptions with one of our key under car [ph] lines. We can report that this issue was mitigated in the second quarter as we felt much of our unmet demand with alternative suppliers. So looking ahead to the second of the year, we expect a significant foreign exchange headwind impacting our reported results to continue at its current level. That aside we'll be working hard over the second half of the year to improve on our 3% to 4% underlying automotive growth achieved thus far in 2015. We continued to be encouraged by the automotive aftermarket fundamental. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years, size of the fleet continues to grow, fuel prices are down on average of $0.89 from a year ago and as you would expect miles driven continues to post substantial gains up 3.9% through April. Each of these fundamentals bodes well for future demand. We also have plans in place to drive stronger growth in the quarters ahead. We announced last Friday the pending acquisition of Covs Parts, a 25 branch distribution company in Western Australia. Covs will be a great addition to our growing Repco business, as this business is focused on original equipment and aftermarket automotive parts, truck product and mining and industrial consumables. The addition of Covs Parts which we expect to close by October 1st, further expands our presence and scale in Western Australia and is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $90 million in US dollars. This latest acquisition coupled with our continued Greenfield store expansion, puts us over the 500 store mark in the combined markets of Australia and New Zealand. This type of bolt-on acquisition will increasingly be a key focus for our teams throughout North America and Australasia. So in closing, we want to thank our management teams in North America, as well as our team on the ground in Australia for all that they do for the GPC automotive business. So that completes our overview of the GPC automotive businesses and at this time I\u2019ll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul and good morning. We\u2019ll begin with a review of our second quarter income statement and the segment information and then we\u2019ll review our balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back up and then we\u2019ll open the call for your questions. Our total revenues previously stated was $3.94 billion for the second quarter, an increase of 1%, which consisted of underlying sales growth of 2.2% and a 1.3% contribution from acquisitions. These items were offset by a strong currency headwind of 2.7%. For the six months through June, total revenues are $7.7 billion, a 2% increase consisting of 3% core growth, 1.4% from acquisitions offset by a 2.5% foreign currency headwind. Our gross profit for the second quarter was 29.9% of sales and this compares to 30.2% growth margin last year. For the six months, gross margin at 29.85% compares to 30.05% reported last year. Primarily the second quarter and six months declines reflect our ongoing customer and product mix shifts which continue to pressure our gross margins. This is been especially prevalent in the office business over the last few quarters. In addition, we experienced some added pressure in our industrial business gross margin in the second quarter due to the reduction in sales volume and the related impact of lower supplier incentives earned. Executing on our gross margin initiatives is a key priority for our management team and this area has our full attention. We are committed to making progress towards an enhanced gross margin for the long-term. Our gross margin initiatives are also critical and offsetting the low inflationary environment that has persisted across our businesses for several years now, especially in automotive. And our supplier pricing through June would indicate more of the same for 2015. Our cumulative supplier price changes through June were down three tenths of 1% for Automotive, up one half of 1% for Industrial, up six tenths of 1% for Office Products and down 1.2% for Electrical. Turning to our SG&A, total expenses were $868 million in the second quarter, which is flat versus the second quarter of 2014. Our SG&A improved as a percent of sales by 20 basis points to 22.0%. For the six months, our total expenses of $1.7 billion are 22.5% of sales versus 22.7% last year. In light of the 2% and 3% underlying sales growth for the second quarter and six months respectively, we're relatively pleased with our ability to control our cost and encouraged by the positive of impact of these measures in this challenging period. That said, we believe there are opportunities for more improvements in this area and we'll continue to focus on our SG&A line in the periods ahead. Now we\u2019ll discuss the results by segments. Our Automotive revenue for the second quarter of $2.1 billion was flat with the prior year and 53% of our total sales. Our operating profit of $207 million is up four tenths of 1%, and their margin improved 10 basis points to 9.9%. For the year, automotive sales of $4 billion are unchanged from the prior year and our operating profit of $358 million is up four tenths of 1% and our margin is constant with 2014 at 8.9%. Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the second quarter, a 2% decrease from 2014 and 30% of our revenues. Our operating profit of $89 million is down 7% and our operating margin declined 40 basis point to 7.5%, as the loss of leverage and lower incentive pressured this group in the quarter. For the year, industrial sales of $2.4 billion, represents 31% of our revenues and are up 1%. Their operating profit of $177 million is down 1%, and our margin is 7.5% which is down 10 basis points from last year. For Office products the revenues of $478 million in the quarter, up a solid 14%, and representing 12% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $35 million is up a 11%, and their operating margin was down 20 basis points to 7.2% \u2013 and for the year office revenues of $968 million are up 16% from 2014. Our operating profit is $71 million is up 9%, so our margin is down 50 basis points from last year to 7.3%. As mentioned earlier, the customers mix shift is impacting our net margin for this business, but we remain encouraged by our overall growth. The Electrical/Electronic Group had sales in the second quarter of a $195 million, a 3.5% increase and 5% of total revenue. Their operating profit of $18.6 million is up 13%, so the margin for this group improved to 9.5% which is up 70 basis points and a new record high. For the year, sales for this group are $377 million and up 2%. Operating profit of $34 million is up 6% and the margin is up to 9.0% from 8.7% which is a solid 30 basis point increase. So for the second quarter, our operating profit was flat with last year and our operating margin held constant at 8.9%. For the year, our operating profit is up 1% and our operating margin is 8.3 compared to the 8.4 for the same periods in 2014. Another [ph] type of expansion we would expect to produce over the long-term that relatively steady given the sales volume for the quarter and the year. We had net interest expense of $5.7 million in the second quarter, and year-to-date our interest now stands at $11 million. We would expect net interest expense of approximately $21 million to $22 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense of $8.8 million in the second quarter and $17.4 million through the six months, which is relatively consistent with last year. We currently estimate $36 million to $38 million in total amortization expense for the full year. The other line which reflects our corporate expense was $25 million expense for the quarter, which is consistent with last year. Through June our corporate expenses are $50, which is up slightly from the first six months of last year. This is relatively in line with our expectations and for the year we would expect corporate expense to be in $90 million to $95 million range. Our tax rate was 37% for the second quarter, and 36.5% for the six months through June. These rates are up slightly from 2014 due to changes in the mix of foreign income and the related foreign tax rate, as well as the less favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment in the second quarter. For the full year we expect our tax rates to be in the range of 36.7% to 37%. Net income for the quarter of $195 million compares to $198 million in the second quarter last year and our EPS was $1.28 which is basically flat with 2014. Now let's turn to a discussion of the balance sheet. During first quarter and the year we have further strengthened our balance sheet which positions us well for future growth. Specifically this speaks to our ability to effectively manage our working capital and drive increased cash flows. Our cash at June 30 was $224 million, an increase from approximately $153 million at June 30 last year. Our cash position is strong and we continue to use our cash to support the growth initiatives in each of our businesses. Accounts receivable at $2 billion at June 30 is up 5% from the prior year on a 2% core sales increase for the second quarter. We continue to closely manage our receivables and we would add that June had an extra billing day relative to 2014 which accounts for a portion of this increase in the quarter. We also remain very satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time. Our inventory at quarter end was $3 billion which is up a margin [ph] of 1% from June of 2014 and actually improved by approximately 1% from year end. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we\u2019ll continue to remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels in the periods ahead. Accounts payable at June 30 was $2.7 billion, up 10% from 2014, which reflects the positive impact of our improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We have shown continued improvement in this area for several periods now and we're encouraged by a positive impact on our working capital and days and payables. Our working capital was $1.9 billion at June 30, an improvement of 6% from last year, effectively managing our working capital and in particular our key accounts such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable continues to be a very high priority for our company and we're pleased with our ongoing progress in this area. Our total debt at June 30 was $850 million. This includes two $250 million term notes, as well as another $350 million in borrowings under our multi-currency syndicated credit facility. Our total debt to capitalizations approximately 21% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time, as we believe that provides us with both the financial capacity and the flexibility necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We also continue to generate solid cash flows and we\u2019re raising our 2015 projections for cash from operations and free cash flows by $50 million. For the full year we're now planning for cash from operations to be in that $850 million to $900 million range. Additionally, we currently expect free cash flow, which deducts capita expenditures and dividends to be in the $350 million to $400 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our first priority for cash is the dividend which we have paid every year since going public in 1948, and we've now raised for 59 consecutive years, a record that continues to distinguish Genuine Parts from other companies. The 2015 annual dividend of $2.46 per share represents a 7% increase from the $2.30 paid in 2014 and it\u2019s approximately 53% of our 2014 earnings, which is well within our goal of a payout of 50% to 55%. Our goal is to maintain this level of the payout ratio going forward. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our core businesses, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. Our investment in capital expenditures was $21 million for the second quarter, which is consistent with 2014 and through the six months our capital spending was $38 million, down slightly from the $40 million last year. Our expenditures should increase in the second half of the year and we're currently planning for CapEx spending to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million for the full year. As usual, the vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in technology. Our depreciation and amortization was $36 million in the second quarter and $71.5 million through six months, which is down slightly from 2014. Looking ahead, we are projecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $145 million to $155 million for the full year in 2015. Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and an important use of our cash for us and they are integral to our growth plans. In the first six months of 2015, we invested approximately $80 million for the acquisition of several new businesses, including Miller Bearings in the industrial and segment and Connect-Air for the electrical business, as well as a couple other smaller companies. In addition, last Friday we announced the acquisition of Covs Parts for Australasian automotive business which we covered earlier. We will continue to seek new acquisition opportunities across our business segments to further enhance our prospect for future growth. And although we find that many of these opportunities are smaller size companies with annual revenues in the $25 million $150 million range, we're open minded to new business of all sizes, large or small assuming the appropriate returns on investments. Finally, during the quarter we used our cash to repurchase approximately 670,000 shares of our common stock under the company\u2019s share repurchase program. For the six months, we repurchased 1.54 million shares and today we have 8 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. That concludes our financial report for the second quarter and six months of 2015. In summary, we're looking to improve on our first half results over the balance of 2015. We have our growth plans in place and we're intensely focused on showing progress in periods ahead. Despite our recent challenges and the relative uncertainty in the economy over the near term we're encouraged by the fundamental opportunities we see across our core businesses. We look forward to updating on our future progress when we report again in October. Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Tom. Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Carol, and thanks to you and Paul for your updates. So that\u2019s a quick recap of our second quarter and mid-year results and in summary, we would certainly say that we founded to be a challenging quarter. And as we look back over the quarter from our perspective there were three strong headwinds that were encountered. First, the strength of the US dollar and its impact on the currency exchange. Second, the continued and pervasive impact of the slowdown in the oil and gas sector and third the further slowdown in certain segments of the manufacturing sector of the economy. As pointed out earlier, currency had a 3% negative impact on our combined GPC sales in a quarter and a negative 4% per share in earnings. Our Automotive operations experienced the most significant revenue impact of currency being just over 4% headwind. But it\u2019s important to point out that our core NAPA business continued to perform well as evidenced by their 3% same-store sales increase on top of the 7% same-store sales increase in the second quarter of last year. So we feel continue to make progress on the NAPA side of the business. Additionally, our non-US based automotive operations each generated solid mid single digit local currency increases, indicative of continued progress by our Canadian, Australasian and Mexican teams. Unfortunately these all translated to sizeable decreases when converted to US dollars. And then looking at the cadence of the quarter, we were encouraged to see that our automotive sales improved sequentially as the quarter progressed, despite the impact of currency exchange. Additionally, the early July results are in line with June and hopefully a positive indicator for the months ahead. Our Industrial operations were also impacted by currency exchange which caused them 1% revenue growth in the quarter. But even more impactful was the continued and further slowdown in certain segments of the industrial end markets. As mentioned earlier, we saw mixed results among our top 20 customers segments with 11 showing increases, two being flat and seven posting decreases. While the 11 at the top remained relatively steady from Q1 to Q2, the rate of decline for the seven that are running decreases actually accelerated during the quarter which significantly impacted our results and at this point unfortunately we don\u2019t anticipate a reversal of this trend in the near term. So due to the ongoing challenges of currency exchange and the continued and accelerating rate of decline among certain segments of our industrial customer base, we feel a downward adjustments to our prior full year guidance are appropriate at this time. On the revenue side, our prior segment guidance was for automotive to be 2% to 3% at year end and right now we would say that should be 1% to 2% net of a 4% to the currency exchange headwind. Previously we guided industrial to being up 5% to 6% and now we would say flat to up 1% net of a 1% currency exchange adjustment. Electrical, we were at 5% to 6% and we would see 3% to 4% currently and in office products we previously guided 6% to 7% and we're actually increasing that to 7% to 8% at this time. In total, our prior guidance was for GPC to be up 3% to 4% and now we would say plus 2% to plus 2.5% net of a 3% currency exchange impact. On the earning side, we previously guided to $4.70 to $4.80 and currently we would say that $4.65 to $4.70 is more appropriate and this includes a $0.15 per share currency adjustment. On a percentage basis, we'll be up 1% to 2% on adjusted and up 4% to 5% on a comparative basis. So that would conclude our remarks and we\u2019ll turn the call back to Stephanie to take your questions. Stephanie? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I wanted to follow up on a couple of things. Carol, you talked a lot about gross margin and some of the initiatives that you have in place there. Could you help us understand a little better what drove the decline in the quarter and specifically what initiatives you have? Is there anything on vendor rebates that may have moved things around or how it will flow to some of the segments? And then I had a follow-up on SG&A. Carol Yancey : Okay. On the gross margin, I would say really what we saw this quarter, the big impact that we had was in the industrial area. I mean, that was what was different than say last two quarters. We had the continued pressure on gross margin in the office segment that we talked about before, but on the industrial side, the combination of their lower volume and having to do also with their customer and product mix, but also the volume incentives that are related to that. And as we adjusted what our thinking is between now and the end of the year, that\u2019s factoring into what our adjusted guidance is, it\u2019s lowering that for the industrial volume incentive. And then some of the initiatives, actually our core automotive gross profit and we've put some things in place over the last six to 12 months, and we're pleased with how that\u2019s working, but we're up against some of the other pressures that\u2019s in the other segment. So, it\u2019s on the buy side and the sell side. It\u2019s really initiatives that we work on all the time across all of our businesses. Tom Gallagher : And Greg, if I could also add one point, the fact that office products is up 14% in the quarter, it had an impact on the total gross profit as well. Greg Melich : Is it fair to say, if you \u2013 ex industrial and office products, were gross margins up in the auto business? Tom Gallagher : That\u2019d be a fair assumption. Carol Yancey : Yes. We actually had improvement in both electrical and automotive. Greg Melich : Great. And then on SG&A dollars, I noticed they were nicely controlled. Would the impact there on FX be the same as on the top line? In other words, if FX went away, we would expect SG&A dollar growth to be closer to the 3% to 4%, not flattish? Carol Yancey : Yes. We would say, if you think about the FX kind of all the way down the income statement if you will, it\u2019s pretty consistent. I mean, there is really not an impact on our net margins. So you can pretty much just take it all the way down the income statement, its pretty consistent. Greg Melich : All right. Thanks a lot. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Greg. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Carol Yancey : Morning, Scot. Tom Gallagher : Morning, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi. How are you? I was hoping to get a little bit more color on specifically what has softened so much on the industrial side. Obviously, it's a pretty big sea change coming out of you guys, Tom, and we haven't seen that in multiple years. And I guess what I'm asking is, is it particular products or product lines and maybe another way of looking at it is, of the seven end markets that we saw the deterioration in, are there certain ones that were much worse than others? Like can you highlight those because it's down 10%, 15%? What's the best way to kind of think about those? Thanks. Tom Gallagher : Well, I think you've kind of answered your own question in a way Scot, and that the ones that we highlighted in the order oil and gas, iron and steel, pulp and paper, and the original equipment manufacturing segment, they are the ones that had the most significant decreases in the quarter for sure. And as I mentioned in my commentary, what got our attention a bit was the sequential deceleration in the decreases. So these four categories were down in Q1, but they were down even more dramatically in Q2. And maybe to put a little more color on it, if you look at oil and gas, obviously the fact that the number of rigs running is down over 50% year-over-year. Certainly that has an impact directly, but the indirect impacts ripples through other customer segments as well, certainly the steel segment for any steel manufacturer that has been producing piping to go into exploration, they are having the same situation that we're experiencing. So their volumes are down. You can look at some of the pumping manufacturers those that have down hole pumps would be experiencing some of the same contraction that we're experiencing. So it runs, it pretty much runs through a number of other categories in addition to the oil and gas. And part of it too is the fact that some of the businesses, iron and steel and pulp and paper would also be having some issues because of currency exchange, they are not exporting as much, and in fact they are fighting some import pressures, some product coming in from offshore. So it\u2019s a combination of factors. Scot Ciccarelli : So when you look at the second half in these particular end markets, is the assumption that they kind of do in 3Q and 4Q what they did in 2Q, or is there an expectation that they actually deteriorate further from here given the additional declines we've seen in some of the commodity complex? Tom Gallagher : Well, I'd preface my comments by saying, we just don\u2019t know as clearly as we would like. But our expectation is that we've experienced the worst of the deceleration. We may see just a bit more or we may have stabilized some. But it\u2019s going to be another couple of quarters before we see this start to turn back up in our opinion. Scot Ciccarelli : Got you. And then just one quick qualification if I might. You talked about some - the cadence that we saw in the auto business. And just to be clear, you were talking about it on an organic basis, is that correct, in terms of the acceleration? Tom Gallagher : Yes. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Tom Gallagher : Yes. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Tom Gallagher : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Becks with JPMorgan. Mark Becks : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just to pick up where Scot had left off, on the industrial, can you speak to how your growth looks like for the market and then I guess across your segments? Can you clarify how you look at the growth, whether you have been maintaining share or perhaps gaining or losing share? Tom Gallagher : Well, I think as best we can tell we're maintaining share at a minimum and maybe gaining just a little bit based upon the data that we have. And you know, its all not, its all not doom and gloom within the segment. Certainly we've got some customer categories that are really challenged right now. But as I pointed out, we do have a 11 of our key 20 customer categories that are showing increases. And additionally, we've got some positive things going within the industrial segment. It\u2019s just unfortunate that the seven that are down are down in such a magnitude that they are overshadowing some of the good things that are going on. But over time we think that they will show themselves and things will start to turn back up. But we're just not ready today to say that we're starting to see some of that up term. We think we got another quarter or two before we'll experience some of that. Mark Becks : Okay. And then can you give a little bit more color on the Australasia landscape? That's now well over a $1 billion business for you and you just did the $90 million Covs Parts. What's the size of that market and how does the margin profile look versus the US business? And then just given your recent investments over there, what does that say about your outlook for the US market? Tom Gallagher : We would \u2013 by our numbers we would say that we would have market share that\u2019s in the mid teens there in the Australasian market place. And the outlook we think is generally favorable in local currency. But I would say that the economies over there are equally challenged and I think the numbers that our team has put up would indicate that we're gaining a little bit of share over there currently. In terms of the outlook and future growth prospects, I think we'll continue to have recently good organic growth from the team over there. I think we'll sprinkle in a couple of acquisitions over time and we continue to feel like we get a good return on our invested capital in that market place. The margin structure is very much similar to what we would experience in our core automotive business. So it\u2019s equal in worst case and perhaps slightly accretive in best case. Paul Donahue : Hey, Mark. This is Paul. I would also add you mentioned the US market. We \u2013 it\u2019s our intent to continue to grow our footprint here in the US as well, but I would also say the same about Canada and Mexico. Mark Becks : Okay. That's helpful. And then just last question, can you shed a little light on the dividend and how you might be thinking about that this year? You've raised it for 59 consecutive years now. It looks like earnings growth will be cyclically flat given the updated guidance. And I know you target a 50% to 55% payout ratio. But just curious how you are thinking about the growth, factoring in EPS, which has been a bit of a drag from FX, but then your cash flow position strengthening. Thank you. Tom Gallagher : It\u2019s a little bit early perhaps because we visited the whole dividend discussion at our February board meeting. But at this point we would suggest to you that you'll see an increase in the dividend in February of 2016 and we'll pay out 50% to 55% of prior year earnings. We just can't comment now on the size of the increase. But you'll see an increase. Mark Becks : Okay. Thank you. Tom Gallagher : All right. Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Good morning. Tom Gallagher : Morning, Seth. Paul Donahue : Morning, Seth. Seth Basham : I'd like to ask a couple of questions on the auto business. Tom, you mentioned that trends for the quarter were improving. But how do they look on a two-year stack basis, as I remember you had some pretty easy comparisons toward the end of Q2 2014? Tom Gallagher : We're going to get that number for you right now, so. Seth Basham : Okay. And related to that, you mentioned an extra billing day in June. Any quantification of how much of a benefit it was to your sales and auto or across the rest of the enterprise? Tom Gallagher : No, but the numbers that I cited are on a per day basis, so we saw a sequential per day increases and strengthening as the quarter progressed and the same thing would be true in our month to date results. So I think we're looking at an apples-to-apples comparison. Carol Yancey : Yes, just to be clear, that we had the same number of days in the quarter, but the comment on the extra day for June related to more the increase in accounts receivables, because the extra day was in June and we had one last day in May. Seth Basham : Got it. That's helpful, Carol. And then you mentioned, Paul, the number of transactions on the wholesale side were down in the quarter. Any thoughts as to where the weakness was coming from? Was it in fleet or was some other area of the business? Paul Donahue : Yes, we saw a little deceleration in the fleet business Seth, which really we attribute really to some of the ongoing prices on the oil and gas side. But it did come back towards the latter part of the quarter. So I don\u2019t think its anything structural. We've been seeing solid increases quarter-after-quarter and our ticket count side, I think was a bit of an aberration that we'll see bounce back tin Q3. Seth Basham : Got it. That's helpful. With that outlook, you ticked down your sales guidance for the segment for the year. Any more color as to your thought process there? Tom Gallagher : No, its \u2013 part of it is due to the fact that we think currency is going to continue to play a factor for sure. I think that might be a primary driver. I want to go back to what I think I understood to the question earlier, Seth, and you asked about the comps, and if we look at our comps in Q2 of this year and last year, and Q2 last year we had 7% comps both for DIY and for DIFM and this year we were seven on the DIY and two on the DIFM. So its not that comps weakened in the quarter, I think we were going up against some pretty good comps. And if we look out over the remaining quarters of this year we were up 6% in Q3 and we were up 7% in Q4 of last year. So I think we're going up against reasonably good comps and I think we'll come through it fine, but I do think the comps don\u2019t soften any for us in the near term. Seth Basham : Got it. And just lastly to clarify, on FX, are you saying that you expect more FX headwinds for the year than you initially did in the auto segment? Tom Gallagher : Well, I think across all of our businesses that are affected and maybe just to put a little color to that. If we look at year-over-year our FX comps and I look that on the 15th of July, 15 the difference between July 15, 2014 and July 15, 2015 we had 19% deceleration versus the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso and 21% decline against the aussie dollar. So that\u2019s a little stronger than what we had originally anticipated. Seth Basham : Got it. All right, thanks and good luck. Tom Gallagher : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Elizabeth Suzuki : Good morning. Given the miles driven in the US really started to accelerate in recent months. I think the expectation may have been that the auto division would have been a little bit stronger in core growth. Do you think auto is going to start reflecting that improvement in driving trends and vehicle usage in the coming quarters, or are there competitive pressures at play that could hold back some of that same-store growth? Tom Gallagher : Well, what I would say first of all is the underlying growth for automotive was I think reasonably good at 4% and I think historically that\u2019s a pretty good number. I think Paul referenced some of the underlying factors are generally favorable, miles driven as for instance through the last three quarter [ph] we've seen are up 3.9% year-to-date, that\u2019s the best we've seen a while. So our expectation would be that demand should remain pretty good over the remainder of the year. One thing that impacted automotive as Paul referenced in his comments, was the abnormally worst conditions we've experienced up through the Midwest and that affected not just the normal DIFM type of business it certainly affected our agricultural business up through that part of the country as well. But assuming that we don\u2019t hit abnormality, so I think that demand pattern should be reasonably good as we work our way through year end. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay, great. And with foreign exchange having a larger and larger impact as you grow internationally, are there any plans to put currency hedges in place? It just seems like FX is causing a lot more fluctuation in your earnings than we are used to. Tom Gallagher : We're looking at it, we haven\u2019t done anything as yet, but we recognized it\u2019s something that we need to spend a little more time on. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay. Great\u2026 Carol Yancey : Part of the FX when you are just translating the dollars into your income statement, you can't really hedge against that, What we're looking at as more on the cash flow and balance sheet side, but we're just translating the sales in from these foreign countries, we do have an impact there, you really just have to translate the lower dollar. Elizabeth Suzuki : All right. Thanks very much. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot. And good morning. Tom Gallagher : Good morning, Matt. Carol Yancey : Good morning, Matt. Matthew Fassler : A couple of follow-up questions on automotive. Can you give us a sense for the order of magnitude of fleet deceleration? Just trying to understand how much it contributed to the DIFM slowdown because it looks like your DIFM comp slowed from 3 to 2. We had assumed that in the first quarter your fleet was up kind of mid single, a [indiscernible] I mean, year-on-year basis\u2026 Paul Donahue : No. Matt, this is Paul. Fleet business was actually up a couple of points in the quarter, but it wasn\u2019t at the trend that we've seen in recent quarters which you already hit on was closer to mid single digit. So we saw a \u2013 yes, we saw a little bit of deceleration in the quarter and if you break it down its certainly an element of our overall commercial wholesale business and its an important element for sure, but again we don\u2019t think there is anything structural there and that we'll see that bounce back in Q3 in the balance of the year. Matthew Fassler : And then just a follow-up, Paul. So we have your new automotive revenue guidance for the year and we have the number gross of FX, net of FX. To the extent that you ran a US comp of 3% in both the first quarter and the second quarter, what's the directional expectation for that number within the automotive business in the second half of the year? Tom Gallagher : This is Tom, we would say probably consistent with what we've seen through the first of the year. Matthew Fassler : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli. Brian Sponheimer : Hi, good morning. Tom Gallagher : Good morning, Brian. Carol Yancey : Good morning, Brian. Brian Sponheimer : To try and focus more on the positive within Motion, can you talk about, outside of auto production, maybe some of the sub-pockets of growth that you may not have foreseen heading into the year? Is construction one of them? Tom Gallagher : Yes, anything related to construction Brian we're showing good results, so if you get into the aggregate and cement category, that\u2019s a nice category for us currently. Lumber and wood products is a nice category for us as well. So its \u2013 I think its fair to say if you looked at those segments of the manufacturing sector, that are performing reasonably well they tied pretty closely to those segment of the overall economy that are performing pretty well right now. So\u2026 Brian Sponheimer : All right. And then just on the OE side within Motion, would you say that it's driven more on the equipment side by mining, or is this now fully an ag and potentially some broader machinery issue? Tom Gallagher : I think it\u2019s a combination. And I think it\u2019s a factor of curtail demand here domestically but also its an FX situation as well to the dollar some of these companies that have reasonably strong export businesses are not getting the same type of demand that they might get under more normal FX circumstances. So I think it\u2019s a combination of both elements [indiscernible] Brian Sponheimer : All right. Thank you very much. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thanks, Brian. Operator : We have time for one question. Your last question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies [ph] Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, guys. Carol Yancey : Morning, Bret. Tom Gallagher : Morning, Bret. Unidentified Analyst : Just a quick question on the DIY trends. Obviously, 7% is better than the market. Are you seeing market share gains in any particular regions or do you see yourself picking up share from any particular channels? Tom Gallagher : Bret, its hard to tell, our retail increases are wide spread and you know, I think as I've said in prior calls, its our team that\u2019s been really just focusing on the basics, better store hours, better training, better planogram execution, better in store stocking. We've gotten, I would tell you we've got creative in some of our recent promotions that have performed well for us, but its hard to say if we're actually picking market share or not but I would think with the kind of increases we've been showing we are most likely taking it from one of the competitor. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then as far as temperature control, you mentioned double-digit growth. Was that something you are talking about double-digit growth regionally? I think you called out the West. Or was that double-digit growth as an entire category? And I guess to follow up, how are inventory levels when you're seeing that kind of growth? Are you being able to meet the demand? Tom Gallagher : Yes. So the double-digit growth was that to cross all of NAPA that was we really, it was driven in the western part of the country we had record heat out west in the month of June Bret in California, Oregon, Washington record temps, so they really drove the increase. But we're seeing significant increases across the country and right now we're into good shape at our inventory level. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then one last question. Mexico, the branding under NAPA as opposed to AutoTodo, what are you seeing? Are you picking up share sequentially with NAPA or is it too early to tell? Tom Gallagher : It\u2019s too early to tell, we're still early in our rollout we have 11 companies stores up and running. We have a certainly goal that continued increase at our \u2013 its still early Bret but we're on plan and on target. Unidentified Analyst : All right, great. Thank you. Tom Gallagher : You're welcome. Carol Yancey : Thanks, Bret. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'll turn it back over to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We thank you for your interest in Genuine Parts Company and your continued support and we look forward to reporting to you on October with our third quarter results. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Sid Jones, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sid Jones : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts' third quarter 2015 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom? Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Sid. And I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer are both on the call as well, and each of us has a few prepared remarks and once completed, we will look forward to answering any specific questions that you may have. Earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2015 results and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.922 billion, which was down 2%. Net income was $188.1 which was down 1%, and earnings per share were $1.24 this year compared to $1.24 in the third quarter last year, putting us even in EPS for the quarter. As has been in the case for year along, currency exchange has been a significant headwind for us both on the revenue and earnings results and the impact accelerated in the third quarter. Importantly, the local currency results for our international businesses remain solid but when converted to U.S. dollars we lost 4% on the revenue line and 5% per share in EPS in the quarter. Or stated in another way without currency impact our sales were up 2% and EPS was up 4%. In addition to the currency headwind, we continue to experience a slowdown in specific segments of the economy which impacted several of our businesses but most significantly in industrial and electrical. We will comment on this factor a bit more as we review the individual businesses and as we customarily do I will cover the non-automotive operations and then Paul will report on the automotive segment. Starting with Office Products, this Group saw this deceleration on the revenue side in the quarter. After being up double digit since sales growth in each of the first two quarters, the Office Products team ended the quarter up 3%. The deceleration is primarily attributable to anniversary in both increased volume from the Office Depot/OfficeMax merger last year, as well as the impact products acquisition that was completed in July of 2014. Each of these was a significant contributor to the double digit growth rates generated over the past four quarters and we anticipated the moderation in Q3. However, we would have to say that we saw a bit more deceleration than expected and more so as the quarter progressed. Our sense is that the underlying Office Products demand has softened over the past 90 days. From a channel perspective, the softening was more pronounced on the independent reseller side and we ended the quarter down mid single digits. Our mega channel remains strong posting another big double digit increase. On the product side, facility and breakroom supplies and furniture each had strong quarters and core office supplies were positive as well. Our technology products were down mid single digits. So putting it all together, our Office Product segment was up 3% for the quarter which in the current environment is probably a solid performance. However, we were expecting just a bit more in the quarter and we're watching the recent slowdown closely. Before closing on Office Products we do want to mention the acquisition that was completed on October 1. Malt industry is a $20 million distributor at safety products and this acquisition will help to further diversify both the product and customer portfolios for impact products and for S. P. Richards and we\u2019re pleased to now have miles industries as part of our organization. They will contribute nicely to our Office Products results in the quarters ahead. Moving over to the industrial segment, Motion industry has experienced another challenging quarter ending the quarter with a 4% decrease. And demand patterns across our customer base were similar to what we have seen pretty much all year long. Customers and segments like lumber and wood products, food processing, cement and aggregate and automotive were generating solid positive results for us and we continue to make good progress with these accounts. Conversely, however, customers in the mining and resource oil and gas, iron and steel, pulp and paper and original equipment manufacturing are all running sizable decreases for the third quarter and year-to-date and notably the rate of decline actually accelerated as the quarter progressed. So despite the fact that there are number of positives within our industrial results, they are being more than offset by some of the specific headwinds and circumstances that we\u2019re encountering and we don\u2019t see this changing in the near term. In the meantime, our industrial team remains focused on key elements of their growth strategy. They were able to complete one acquisition in the quarter, Lake Erie Tool & Abrasive was acquired on September 1. This is a pre location distributor of tools and abrasives with annual revenues of approximately $30 million and Lake Erie will be a nice addition to the Motion organization. Additionally, the Motion team continues to make progress in the areas of securing new corporate account agreements, penetrating new markets and expanding share of wallet initiatives, each of which will contribute incremental revenue in the months ahead and will help to offset some of the declines that we are experiencing in the key customer categories mentioned earlier. But as with office products, we saw deceleration in our industrial results over the quarter which we feel is reflective of the ongoing challenges being faced by many segments of the manufacturing sector in the economy and this is a situation that will take a bit more time to work us way through. And I will wrap up the non-automotive operations with a few comments on EIS, our Electrical Segment Entity. This Group ended the quarter up 2% but in looking at the results more closely it shows that they are down 2%, netted acquisitions and copper pricing and similar to Motion many of their manufacturing base customers are experiencing end market headwinds. However it's interesting to note that EIS is made up of three different business segments. Electrical is the largest at 40%, fabrication is 30% and wire and cable is 30% and it's in the electrical segment where we are experiencing the most challenges. This business is running behind year-to-date while our fabrication and wire and cable segments are both generating solid increases, validating the diversification strategy that was embarked upon several years ago and this is something that they will continue to drive in the quarters ahead. End markets will remain challenging for the EIS team at least for the near term especially on the electrical side but they do have a number of potentially positive initiatives underway primarily in the fabrication and wire and cable sides of the business, and we are pleased with the progress they have made in each of these segments. So that will conclude the comments on the non-automotive businesses. And Paul will now review the automotive operations with you. Paul? Paul Donahue : Thank you, Tom. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I\u2019m pleased to be with you here today and have the opportunity to revive you an update on our third quarter performance of our automotive business. For the quarter ending September 30, our global automotive sales were down 2% year-over- year. This performance consists of approximately 4% in core automotive growth, which is consistent with the second quarter and improved from the 3% underlying growth we reported in the first quarter. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 6% in the third quarter, which is up from a 4% currency impact in the first and second quarters. Previously, our expectation was the currency to hold at/or around 4%. Our U.S. team posted a 4% sales increase in the third quarter which is improved from the 3% growth we reported for the first and second quarters. Our international businesses which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand reported another quarter of mid-single digit growth and local currency. We are encouraged by the positive trends we are experiencing in our U.S. results and the steady growth across our international markets. We expect that these trends continue in the periods ahead. In the U.S. we are pleased with the progress and we are seeing in our field operations across the country. While result vary by geographical reason, our teams are executing on our key initiatives and again we are pleased with the progress The Atlantic, North East, Central and Southern Region showed the strongest growth in the quarter. Likewise, our sales in the mid-western region of the country rebounded nicely in the quarter. This pay group reported solid growth following flat sales in the second quarter, which was directly related to the wet weather patterns experienced in this spring and early summer. The number of our stores throughout the South West including Texas and Oklahoma, as well as a number of our stores in the mountain division which includes Montana and the Dakotas continue to feel the effects of the downturn in the oil and gas business. So now let\u2019s take a look at our same store sales for Q3.We are pleased to report our U.S. Company own store group. Group stores sales grew comps store sales in the third quarter by 5%. This is an improvement over 3% comp store increases we reported for both the first and second quarters. This 5% increase is on top of the 6% increase generated in the third quarter of 2014 giving us a two year stack of 11%. Our 5% increase in the third quarter was driven by a combination of increases on both our commercial wholesale side of the business and by our retail business. Let's start with that retail results. As mentioned in previous calls, we continue to expand our revamp DIY initiatives across our company owned store group. We\u2019re pleased to report these initiatives are having a positive impact on the results as evidenced by an 8% increase in our retail business. This increase is being driven by both transaction and basket size increases, and is up from a 7% increase in the second quarter and on top of the 5% increase one year ago. As mentioned earlier, our retail initiatives have had a positive impact on both the size our average ticket and the numbers of tickets moving through our stores. In the third quarter we experienced an increase on our average retail ticket and a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. While we are still on the early dates of our rolling out our retail strategy, we are pleased with the initial returns. We have a great deal of heavy lifting in front of us but our team both in the stores and here at headquarters is truly energized. Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business, this is the dominant segment of our automotive business and in Q3 we turned in a 4% increase. This is a nice improvement from the 2% increase we reported in the second quarter and is on top of the 6% increase in the third quarter of 2014. The centerpiece of our commercial and wholesale business remains our major account alliances, as well as our NAPA AutoCare business. Our NAPA AutoCare business surpassed another milestone in the quarter, as our membership count has now gone over the 16,000 mark in the U.S., this Group generated high single digit sales increases in the quarter. And we can also report our major account partners delivered steady and solid growth in the quarter. Our fleet business bounced back after moderating somewhat in Q2. Sales to our fleet account showed a low mid-single digit sales increase in the third quarter which is in line with the overall growth of our U.S. commercial wholesale business. Our wholesale ticket trend was consistent with what we experienced in the second quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was up mid-single digit with no benefit from inflation, while we saw a slight decline in the average number of tickets. Let's take a look at a few of our key product categories and review the trends we experienced in the third quarter. Our brakes category was a highlight again in the third quarter and it has been a strong category for us all year. And as mentioned in last quarter's update, we experienced a strong selling season with our heating and cooling categories. The warm summer temperatures we experienced across many parts of the country drove strong air conditioning sales well into September. We also saw a resurgence with our battery sales in the quarter. This category was off its historical growth rates in the first half of the year, but we are pleased to see a rebound in the third quarter. And finally, our NAPA import parts business continues to expand as we registered another quarter of low double-digit growth. So looking ahead to the fourth quarter of the year, we expect the significant foreign currency headwinds impacting our reported results to continue. That aside, we'll be working hard to further improve on our 4% underlying automotive growth achieved thus far in 2015. Turning to the trends we are seeing across the automotive aftermarket, the fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. US driving topped 1.8 trillion miles over the first 7 months of the year, which is a new record. In addition, the latest month with reported figures is July, which was up 4.2% year-over-year, also a new record. This makes 17 consecutive months of increases in miles driven. As we look ahead, strategic M&A will continue to be a growth lever for our automotive business. We mentioned in our Q2 conference call that we entered into an agreement to acquire Covs Parts, a 25 branch distribution company in Western Australia. Covs will serve as a nice complement to our existing Repco business as they are focused on original equipment and aftermarket automotive parts, truck products and mining and industrial consumable. We had hoped to close this acquisition on October 1, but are currently awaiting regulatory approval and are targeting a close date no later than December 1. The addition of Covs Parts further expands our presence and scale in Western Australia and is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $90 million in US dollars. Based on - back on August 1, we closed on a smaller store acquisition in Australasia, and although the revenues for this business are less than $10 million annually, these types of bolt-on acquisitions throughout North America and Australasia will continue to be a key focus for our teams. So in closing, we are pleased to show progress in our third quarter automotive results and we're working hard to continue these positive trends. We would like to thank our teams both in North America, as well as Australasia for their efforts and appreciate all that they do for the GPC automotive business. So that completes our overview of the GPC automotive business and at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul and good morning. We'll begin with a review of our income statement and segment information and then we'll review some key balance sheet and other financial items. Our total revenues for the quarter were $3.9 billion, consisting of underlying sales growth of 1.4%, seven tenths of 1% contribution from acquisitions. These items were offset by a strong currency pressures of 3.7%, which was somewhat stronger than we had anticipated. For the nine months through September, our total revenues of $11.6 billion, a 1% increase, consists of 2.4% core growth and 1.2% from acquisitions, offset by a 3% currency headwind. Our gross profit for the third quarter was 29.8%, up slightly from the 29.7% gross margin last year. For the nine months, our gross margin of 29.8% compares to the 29.9% reported last year. The progress we made in the third quarter is encouraging and primarily reflects the improvement in our automotive margins, although the office and electrical businesses also increased. The improvement in these businesses was partially offset by the continued pressure we're experiencing in our industrial business, which is due to the sluggish sales environment and lower inventory purchases, which ultimately negatively impacts supplier incentives earned. Executing on our gross margin initiatives is a key priority for our management team and we're committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long-term. We would also add that our gross margin initiatives are critical in offsetting the low inflationary environment that has persisted across our businesses for several years now, especially in automotive. Cumulative supplier price changes through September are negative three tenths of 1% for automotive, positive seven tenths of 1% for industrial, positive six tenths of 1% for office products, and a negative 1.5% for electrical. Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses were $869 million in the third quarter, which is a 2% improvement from the third quarter in 2014 and at 22.1% of sales compared to 22.2% last year. For the nine months, our total expenses are $2.6 billion, which is a slight increase from 2014, but improved as a percentage of sales to 22.4% compared to 22.5% last year. Our teams remain focused on controlling expenses in this environment and we continue to take actions to further improve our productivity and streamline our operations to enhance performance. Although we would expect to see more progress on this line in the periods ahead, it's also important to note that our SG&A as a percentage of revenue traditionally trends upward in the fourth quarter relative to the first nine months of the year and we are planning for that. Now let's talk about our segment results. Our automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.1 billion, which is down 1.7% from the prior year and 52% of sales. Our operating profit of $202 million is up 4.5% and their margin improved just strong 60 basis points to 9.8%, which was due to improved gross margins and also expense controls. For the year, automotive sales of $6.1 billion are down seven tenths of 1% and our operating profit of $560 million is up 1.8% and our margin is improved year-to-date by 20 basis points to 9.2. Our industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the third quarter, a 4% decrease in 2014 and 30% of our revenues. Our operating profit of $90 million is down 5.4% and our margin was down slightly 10 basis points to 7.7. For the year, industrial sales of $3.5 billion represent 30% of our total revenues and are down 1% from 2014. Our operating profit of $267 million is down 2.6% and our margin is 7.5%, which is down 20 basis points from last year and this relates to the loss of leverage and lower incentives that have pressured this group for most of the year. Office products revenues were $511 million for the quarter, up 2.9% and representing 13% of our revenues. Our operating profit of $36 million is up 9.3% and their margins showed nice improvement up 40 basis points to 7.1%. This increase was driven by progress on both the gross margin and expense lines and it was partially related to the Office Depot, OfficeMax business, which we anniversaried July 1 of this year. For the year, office product revenues were $1.5 billion, up 10.9% from 2014. Our operating profit of $107 million is up 9% and our margin is down 10 basis points from last year to 7.3%. So we're pleased to see our margin for this business stabilize. The electrical electronic group had sales in the third quarter of $197 million, a 2% increase and 5% of total revenues. Our operating profit of $20 million is up 12.5%, so the margin for this group showed strong growth of 100 basis points to 10.2% which is a new record high. For the year, sales for this group are $574 million, up 2%. Their operating profit of $54 million is up 8.6% and the margin has improved to 9.4 from 8.9 last year. So a very solid 50 basis point improvement. So for the third quarter, our total operating profit was up 3% from last year and our operating margin improved by 40 basis points to 8.9% from 8.5%. For the year, operating profit grew 2% and our margin is 8.5%, which is up 10 basis points from the prior year. Our margin expansion in the third quarter was driven by improvement in gross profit and also solid progress in managing our expenses. We're very pleased with this expansion given our current sales environment. We had net interest expense of just over $5 million in the third quarter, and our year-to-date interest now stands at $16 million. We expect net interest expense of approximately $21 million to $22 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense was $8.5 million for the third quarter and is $26 million through nine months, which is consistent with last year. We currently estimate total amortization expense to be approximately at $35 million for the full year. The other line which reflects our corporate expense was $34.3 million for the quarter, which compares to $26.1 million last year. Through September corporate expense was $84.2 million compared to $74.5 million for the first nine months of last year. Primarily unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustments of $5 million and $7 million for the quarter and the nine months account for the increases. In addition, we've experienced slight increases in cost such as legal and professional and IT related investment. Looking ahead we will expect that corporate expense line to be in the $100 million for the full year. Our tax rate was 37.45% for the third quarter and 36.85% for the nine months. These rates are up from 2014 due to the changes in our mix of foreign income and the related foreign tax rate, as well as the unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustment that was recorded in the last two quarters. With these factors in mind, we currently expect our tax rate to be approximately 37% for the full year. Our net income for the quarter of $188 million compared to $190.5 million in the third quarter last year and our EPS at $1.24 was equal to last year. For the nine months, our EPS at $3.56 is up 1% from the same period last year. Now let's turn to our balance sheet, which we were able to further strengthen again in the third quarter. Specifically this speaks to our ability to effectively manage our working capital and drive increased cash flows. Our cash at September 30 was $199 million, an increase from $136 million at September of last year. We continue to use our cash to support the growth initiatives across our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable was $2 billion at September 30 is down 1% from the prior year and relatively in line with our 2% increase in sales for the third quarter. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3 billion or down 1.5% from September and a decrease of approximately 2.5% from year end. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we\u2019ll remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels in the periods ahead. Our accounts payable at September 30 was $2.9 billion, up 12% from last year, which reflects the positive impact of our improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We're pleased with our continued improvement in this area and we're encouraged by the positive impact it has on our working capital and days and payables. Our working capital was $1.9 billion at September 30, an improvement of 5% from last year. Effectively managing our working capital and in particular our accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable, remains a high priority for our company and we're pleased with our ongoing progress in this area. Our total debt at September 30 was $625 million, which is a decrease from the $835 million last year and a decrease from $850 million at June 30. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 16.5% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe it provides the company both the financial capacity and flexibility necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength for the company. We also continue to generate solid cash flows driven by the significant improvement in our working capital. We\u2019re raising our 2015 cash flow projections for the full year. We're now planning on approximately $950 million in cash from operations. Additionally we currently expect free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be approximately $450 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our first priority for cash is the dividend, which we've raised for 59 consecutive years. The 2015 annual dividend of $2.46 per share represents a 7% increase from the $2.30 per share paid in 2014 and its well within our goal of 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our four businesses, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. Our investment in capital expenditures was $25 million for the third quarter and through the nine months capital spending is $62 million. We expect our expenditures in the fourth quarter for the full year to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. The vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in technology. Our depreciation and amortization was $34 million in the third quarter and its $106 million through nine months, which is down slightly from 2014. Looking ahead, we're projecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $140 million to $150 million for the full year in 2015. Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of our cash for us and they're integral to our growth plans. For the nine months through September, we've invested approximately $115 million for the acquisition of several new distribution businesses, including the two in the third quarter previously covered by Tom and Paul. Also as previously mentioned, we closed on an acquisition on the office products business, small industries and we expect to acquire Covs, as Paul mentioned, later this quarter. So as you can see, acquisitions are important to our growth plans and we'll continue to seek new acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although many of these opportunities will be smaller sized companies with annual revenues in the $25 million $150 million range, we're open minded to new complimentary distribution business of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investments. Finally, during the quarter we used our cash to repurchase approximately 950,000 shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. For the nine months, we've repurchased 2.5 million shares and today we have seven million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we've been slightly more aggressive with our repurchases given the value of our price during those for this year. We expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. That concludes our financial update for the third quarter and nine months. So in summary, we've growth plans in place and are intensely focused on showing progress in periods ahead. Despite our recent challenges and the relative uncertainty in the global economy over the near term, we're encouraged by the fundamental opportunities we see across our distribution businesses. In closing, we would like to thank all of our GPC associates for their hard work and commitment to their jobs. Our people truly are our greatest asset. Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Tom. Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Carol, and thanks to you and Paul for the comprehensive updates. So that will conclude our prepared remarks and clearly it was another challenging quarter for us. However, underneath the headline numbers, there were a number of positives as well. Few examples, the 4% constant currency increase in automotive and 5% company store same-store sales growth shows steady progress as does our mid single digit local currency increases in Australasia, Canada and Mexico. Also in Automotive, the continued strong results coming from the NAPA Auto Care and major account initiatives are two primary and commercial programs and the solid 8% increase in our retail business show good progress on both the commercial and retail sides of the business. The completion of two key acquisitions in the quarter, one in office products and one in industrial and we expect to announce a few others of similar size before yearend and all this will give us a bit of a sales lift going into 2016. Gross margin improved 12 basis points in the quarter and SG&A decreased six basis points enabling us to show operating margin improvement in three of our four businesses and an overall GPC operating margin improvement of 40 basis points. On the balance sheet, good work was done in the areas of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, enabling us to show a nice reduction in working capital as well as a nice increase in cash generation and there are ongoing progress being made by GPC team in a number of key areas as well, which will all serve as well in the quarters ahead. However, the one area that continues to give a significant challenge is revenue growth across all of our businesses. Currency is having an effect on each of the businesses to one degree or another both directly and indirectly, and specific economic issues are impacting us especially in industrial and electrical. Although both of these issues are transitory, we don\u2019t expect them to moderate in the near term. Additionally as mentioned, we saw deceleration in our growth rates in three of our four businesses as the quarter progressed and the early October results are bit softer than planned. At this point, we don\u2019t see any evidence of share loss across the businesses and our sense is that we are seeing further softening and overall in market demand. With all of that said considering current market circumstances and trends, we feel that's appropriate to revise our year-end guidance downward. Prior we gave you guidance on automotive of being up 1% to 2% and currently we would say that automotive will be flat to up just slightly with a 5% headwind from currency exchange. Industrial, our prior guidance was flat to up 1 and now we would say down 2% to down 3% with a 1% currency impact. Office Products will remain the same, prior it was up 7% and 8% and currently we say it will be 7% and 8%. And electrical prior guidance was to be up 3% to 4%, and we would say now up 2% to 3%. So for total GPC prior guidance was up 2% to 2.5% and right now we would say flat to up slightly with little bit more than a 3% impact from currency exchange. And with revenues at these levels, our prior guidance per earnings per share was to be $4.65 to $4.70, but we would say now $4.55 to $4.60 with a $0.15 to $0.16 per share currency exchange impact and on a comparable basis that would put us at $4.70 to $4.76, which will be up 2% to 3%. So that will conclude our prepared comments. And at this time, we will turn the call back to Victoria to take your questions. Victoria? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth Suzuki : Good morning, guys. Can you parse out the foreign exchange impact between Australia and Canada, et cetera? And do you think the headwinds should start to ease in maybe not the next quarter, but starting 2016? Tom Gallagher : I'll try to answer that Elizabeth. We can't give you the specifics right now on the impact by country, but I can\u2019t tell you that currency exchange quarter-end-over-quarter-end we were down about 20% in Mexican Pesos, about 18% in both Canadian and Australian Dollars. If that helps, we will be happy to follow up with you. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay, thanks. In the industrial segment, are there cost-cutting measures or price cuts that you can execute to try to offset the demand headwinds? Are you noticing any market share shifts among your competitors at all? Tom Gallagher : We are adjusting our cost structure as we go forward. What normally happens is when we get in the periods like this and we have seen prior periods similar to this. Revenue declines a bit more quickly than we can get to cost structure down, but eventually, we will catch up with it. And then at least based upon prior experiences what we have seen is that, when revenue does start to come back, the earnings come back fairly quickly and at a bit stronger pace because of the good work that the team does on the cost side of the business. As far as share shifts, we don't see anything right now that would indicate to us that we are losing business. I had mentioned in my comments that good work is going on in landing new agreements with specific customers, which might suggest that we are at least holding our own, perhaps picking up a little bit, but as being overshadowed by the declines we are seeing in certain categories right now. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay. Thank you. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Becks with JPMorgan. Mark Becks : Hi, thanks. On the sales guidance, I just wanted to sharpen the pencil on automotive and industrial. So it looks like it's implying kind of 5% to 9% declines in industrial and then in automotive, it seems like 4Q is like 2% to 6%. So I was just hoping you can - obviously, with 4Q being a little bit of a smaller quarter, it gives a wide range, so I'm hoping you can drill that down a little bit. Tom Gallagher : You're going to have to help me on that. I get a little confused when you referenced second quarter. Mark Becks : Yes, so if we use the guidance for down 2% to 3% in industrial, it seems to imply a down 5% to 9% decline in industrial. So I want to see if that seems appropriate. And then similarly with automotive, if we should be thinking about kind of 2% to 6% sales growth in that category for the fourth quarter. Carol Yancey : I think on the industrial, you are probably a ted high. What you saw as Tom mentioned, the later part of the quarter got worse in the industrial segment. So we are guiding for a little bit worse in Q4 so it\u2019s probably more at the lower end of the range that you talked about. And then I think as you look out for what automotive would be Q4, I think you are in line with what we are using. Part of that is the currency. If currency won\u2019t be quite as strong of an impact in Q4, it's going to be more back to where it was like Q2. Mark Becks : All right, that's helpful. And then within industrial more specifically, if I look at your 4% sales decline, it looks like it was a little bit more severe than some of the competitors out there. I was just curious who you see the major competitors being, whether it be an Interline or perhaps maybe a Grainger or Fastenal who looked like their top line was a little bit stronger? Tom Gallagher : Yes. We would not say that they are direct competitors. The best comparison I think would be with Applied Industrial Technologies with Kaman and with DXP. They would be the ones that we would encounter most frequently and would have the cost with the clearest overlap in product offering. If we look at Interline or if you like at Grainger or Fastenal, we really don\u2019t overlap with them as much on the product categories that we sell. Mark Becks : Understood. And then just last question, you operated a distribution business essentially with four distinct segments. I know some of the facilities are shared warehouses, but I was just hoping you can kind of tease out what benefits you derive from operating the multiple segments and then the potential synergies you gain, whether it be from fleet or transportation or shared services from the various segments? Thank you. Tom Gallagher : You mentioned three of the areas where we do get some leverage, certainly on transportation both inbound and two to three outbound. We certainly get it in the area of shared services without question. We don't share facilities to a large degree today. Each business runs independent facilities. That\u2019s something that we think potentially we could do as we go forward. We are looking at it now between the couple of the businesses. But we share technology enhancements and capabilities. We generally pilot something new in one of the business, prove the concept and then start to roll it into other businesses. There are several things that we do across all of the businesses once we prove that the concept gives us a kind of returns that we are looking for. Carol Yancey : And Mark I just want to be clear on automotive guidance that we talked about. What we were talking about is probably flat up slightly for Q4 that\u2019s what implies, but the FX would be about 4%. So that is kind of what you are talking about. Mark Becks : Okay. So with kind of the 4% core automotive growth rate, it seems like that's a good number to think about for fourth quarter as well. Carol Yancey : Yes, it is. And last year Q4 our automotive comp was at 6%. So that\u2019s a good number. Mark Becks : Okay, great. Best of luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. Tom, I think in your final comments, you mentioned that revenue decelerated across the business through the quarter. Could you help, I guess give a little bit more color then into October and specifically in auto what you saw. Does that mean that auto had a really strong beginning of the quarter and now it's just at that lower level that you just inferred or what do you think is going on there? Tom Gallagher : We saw the quarter was softer. The underlying business as Paul mentioned was pretty good. But we did see deceleration in our U.S. based business, as well as in the international businesses. The delta is not as significant in automotive as it is in industrial - and to a degree in office products. The only business that we did not see deceleration across the quarter was in our electrical business. The other three all declined. If we look at the early results in October, it\u2019s pretty much in line with what we saw in the back half of the quarter is softer than what it had been. We think right now based upon what we can gather from talking with our customer base and with our supplier base is we think end market demands have pulled back a bit from what we had seen earlier in the quarter and certainly through first half. Greg Melich : If I could follow up on the gross margin, what drove the expansion there, again, especially in auto? Was it the stronger dollar helping, price optimization, vendor leverage? What are you seeing there? Carol Yancey : Actually Greg, it\u2019s all those things. We were pleased - this has been our second quarter, our gross margin improved with automotive and some of the things that we put in place earlier in the year and certainly you talked about it with our foreign operations. We had to put some things in place on both the buy side and the sell side to combat the currency issues. Those are working quite nicely for us in Q2 and Q3. And then really on the U.S. business too, their gross profit is up as well and that\u2019s really just strong focus on both the buy side and the sell side. It\u2019s just really all across the board. So we\u2019ve been pleased to see their improvements. I'd tell you going into Q4, the only headwind is going to be coming with industrial and just a further softening in their top line. So if we can maintain where we were at be flat or slightly up, through the rest of the year, but we\u2019ve got a little bit of headwind with industrial. Greg Melich : That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot and good morning to you. The first question I want to ask is about the cadence of cost control. The Company responded quite well to the revenue slowdown in the quarter, both in SG&A and in working capital. And the deceleration in SG&A growth or I guess the move to a decline was a real step change from where you had been. The guidance that you gave as best I can tell suggests a trend in SG&A much closer to the year-to-date number than what you saw in the third quarter. So can you talk about what enabled you to cut costs so substantially in Q3 and why you don't expect that same pace of expense reduction to persist into Q4? Carol Yancey : What we talk about is, look we were extremely pleased with the progress in Q3 and I'd tell you from an SG&A standpoint, again our team suggesting our cost structure to where we saw the topline to be and it\u2019s in a lot of different areas on SG&A and we\u2019ve seen improvement that\u2019s come in automotive really all year with SG&A. It\u2019s really hard with industrial and their lack of top line for them to have. And they are going to have continued pressure on their SG&A line. When you look at the full year, I\u2019d really point you to look at our operating margins through the nine months where each of our businesses except industrial have improvements through the nine months and where we are at 10 basis points operating margins, that\u2019s really probably more of what we expect to be for the full year.  We had sequential better sales in Q3, especially in automotive. So we leverage better on the SG&A. Q4, you just have a lower sales volumes, their seasonality. You won't get as much SG&A leverage. And then we are guiding on the corporate expense. You see a change there for the end of the year. We had some favorable onetime items in corporate expense at the end of the year and we called those out last year and there was a swing of almost \u2013 there will be a swing of almost $10 million in that retirement plan adjustment. So some of those things are factoring into our full year guidance to get us more to the year-to-date number you\u2019re looking at. Matthew Fassler : Okay. Secondly, and very briefly, I know you announced a couple of new acquisitions. Is it possible just to sum up I guess the annualized revenue that you acquired and just how we think about that factoring into the full-year guidance? I suspect that the numbers are going to be reasonably small contributors, but anything we need to factor in as we build up our organic versus acquisition model for Q4? Carol Yancey : Well, we have contemplated those acquisitions in our guidance. The one that Paul mentioned, the Covs acquisition doesn't close to December 1. So there is a very small amount that would go in there. But if you look at the ones we've already exposed on, you\u2019re talking about something around 140 million on an annual basis and that excludes the Covs deal but hasn't closed yet. Matthew Fassler : And these are acquisitions -- the $140 million are for acquisitions you announced today? Carol Yancey : They are the ones going back to January 1. Matthew Fassler : Okay, got it. Carol Yancey : We have had about 7. But those are in our 2015 guidance already. Matthew Fassler : So the new news we would have to add to our models is kind of immaterial for the rest of the year? Carol Yancey : That's correct. Matthew Fassler : And then finally interesting commentary on office products and I guess wondering for your insights on the independents sort of bearing the brunt of the slowdown. When do you typically see that in a cycle? I know that there can be some volatility by channel, so I don't want to make too much of it, but you did call it out. So curious for your read from the field on what that typically means. A \u2013 Tom Gallagher : Well, the independence this is two consecutive quarters at the independent side of the business that has been down and we see further consolidation happening in that customer segment currently. We see more of that continuing honestly as we work away through year end but our expectation would be that the independent side of the business would be positive for us in 2016, probably have another quarter or two were to be negative ahead of us yet. Matthew Fassler : It sounds like you have visibility, Tom, to some consolidation by actual deals that have happened that are changing the landscape a bit and then those run their course. A \u2013 Tom Gallagher : Well there are some of that, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. And we have visibility to some that we think are going to happen. Matthew Fassler : Fair enough. Got it. Okay, thank you so much, guys. A \u2013 Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the industrial side looking at the margin performance there, which was very good all things considered. Can you help us understand a little bit more on the gross margin side versus SG&A side where you saw more pressure and how you expect that to play out in the fourth quarter? Carol Yancey : So on the industrial side and their growth margin is actually down and then their SG&A is not improved either. That\u2019s the one area that I mentioned that - look the size the top line, it's also the volume incentive, so their volume incentives are down similar to their sales decrease in the quarter and we would expect those to be down for the full year as well. So they are just not getting the same level and so that\u2019s going to be, I think both pressure on gross margin and SG&A. So where their margins down 10 basis points through the nine months given where we have guided to for the full year we could see a little more pressure on that operating margin for the rest of the year. Seth Basham : Got it. So only a little bit more than 10 basis points. Does that mean 2030 or even more severe than that? Carol Yancey : Well, we\u2019d hope that will not be more severe than that. Look we are really hopeful that - right now we just don\u2019t know but hopefully it\u2019s something what you described. Seth Basham : Got it, okay. Moving on, on the auto side, looking at the core business on the wholesale side in the U.S., this is the second quarter in a row that you've talked about ticket counts being negative, not dramatically so, but any more color there why that's happening, Paul? Paul Donahue : Yes, and I think you and I talked about that last quarter. Look there is a couple of things happening here, one certainly vehicles, vehicle quality is a heck of lot of better today and I think we\u2019re seeing some of that impact on the number of cars coming into the bays. But what you do see when they do come in that the repair is at a higher price which were seeing and we\u2019re pleased to see as our average ticket value continues to - continues to go up in the right direction. So, it's something that we\u2019re watching a bit Seth you are correct it is two consecutive quarters and we\u2019re going to continue to monitor it but we would expect that to bounce back in 2016. Seth Basham : Got it. Is there one segment of your wholesale business that is showing more weakness? Is it the up and down the street garage customer? Tom Gallagher : No, not really, Seth. I mean if you - the numbers that we shared with you, our auto care business continues to be strong and that's, that\u2019s all different sizes of shops. Our major account business continues to be solid, so there is no one area jumping out. Paul Donahue : It maybe reflective but what\u2019s happening with the car counts in the bays and I think there is some inconsistency across the board in the industry with car counts I think some are experiencing increased car counts and others are flat to may be down just slightly. Seth Basham : Understood. Okay, thank you very much and good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Management. Tony Cristello : Thanks, good morning. Tom, can you sort of maybe categorize a little bit how this slowdown feels versus other slowdowns you've experienced? The severity doesn't seem like it's as bad in any way, but the beginning stages here I guess give pause and I think you even alluded to watching some things to maybe give you an indication how this may play out. Tom Gallagher : It\u2019s an interesting question Tony. On the one hand we looked at a set of data points that would indicate that things are going along, okay. On the other hand you look at a different set and they suggest to you that it\u2019s in consistent what the first set of data might indicate. Right now it feels like we\u2019re in a grind-it-out mode in several of our businesses and there seems to be quite a bit of caution on the part of a number of our customers primarily in the non-automotive businesses in terms of CapEx and investing for future growth. And I think people are being very careful about how they\u2019re spending their money right now on investing for the future. So, right now from at least from my perspective we still have a couple of quarters I think to work our way through this and I think it\u2019s going to be a gradual path forward not anything that\u2019s going to be a hockey stick type recovery. I think it\u2019s going to be slow for another quarter or two and then hopefully we\u2019ll start to see the evidence of that. And if you look at the disconnect, on the industrial side the disconnect between industrial production and capacity utilization, they seem to be going in different directions right now and historically they tend to move in line with one another. So again, just they\u2019re conflicting sources of information currently. Tony Cristello : Okay. And was there something in particular on the office side as well, which seems to be holding up better that gives you a little bit of a pause in a different manner than what you've seen in industrial? Tom Gallagher : On the office products side, we thought like the team together a pretty darn good quarter having anniversaried the two significant impacts. Being up 3% in the current environment I think is reflective of some good work being done by the office products team. The thing that gives us a little bit of pause though is, we actually thought we might be just a slightly better as we went into the quarter, we thought it might be a little bit stronger than the way it turned out and we saw some deceleration as the quarter progressed as I mentioned and that\u2019s continued on into the first half of October. So we don\u2019t have the sense right now as to what the real cause but what we do know and talking with our primary vendors is that this is not unique to S.P. Richards or Genuine Parts, they're seeing this across most of their customer base and it just seems to be a temporary slowdown that hopefully we will reverse itself as we work our way through the quarter. Tony Cristello : Okay, that's great color. Maybe if I can ask one more, on the automotive side, you are having very good success in terms of the DIY and gaining some traction with various initiatives. Maybe if you could just add a little color to that in terms of is it simply you're a much higher percentage commercial business and so adding that emphasis on DIY is easy to gain that share? Is there something you are doing perhaps differently than what your traditional DIY-focused retailers would? Or is it a situation where even your affiliates are seeing an increased appetite for that type of product and maybe they are gaining some share from what seems to be a competitive marketplace with some disruption over the last couple of years? Paul Donahue : Yes, Tony this is Paul, I would tell you that and we\u2019ve talked about it a bit in previous calls. We have put a renewed focus on our DIY business. We've addressed many of the fundamentals expanding our store hours, additional training for our folks, we\u2019ve added some personnel in the stores, and we\u2019ve also are testing out a new retail store format Tony that we've began to roll-out in 2015. And it\u2019s very early yet, but we\u2019re pleased with the results and we'll be reviewing that the balance of this year and make a decision as we go into 2016. Generally what takes place, you mentioned our affiliates are independent owners, they will many times let us pioneer some new ideas and certainly new approaches. I think they will get on board when they see the kind of success that we're driving in the retail side. Many of our independent owners do a heck of a job today on the retail side of the business anyway. So it's early yet, Tony, but I would tell you we're pleased with the results that we are seeing. Tony Cristello : Okay. Now that's great. I appreciate the time. Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Tom Gallagher : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carolina Jolly with Gabelli & Company. Carolina Jolly : Thanks, good morning. So looking at your results, you've got some challenged end-market promotions. Has this distress made any potential acquisition targets, maybe something similar to Lake Erie, more willing to discuss a potential sale? Tom Gallagher : Well, as you know, it takes a willing seller and a willing buyer. We are a willing buyer. We just have to find more willing sellers that are willing to sell at prices that we think are favorable to the shareholders of Genuine Parts Company. I mentioned in my comments that we have a couple more that we think we'll announce prior to year end, none of which will have any material influence on Q4. But will help us as we go into the first quarter of next year. So there are a number of conversations that are going on. A couple are further along and we feel confident that we'll get a few closed by year end and hopefully we can generate some additional interest from some others. Carolina Jolly : Okay. Great. Thanks. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Morning. A good question. I guess as we talk about Mexico, and it was about a year ago that you began to go to Mexico with the NAPA brand as opposed to Auto Todo. Could you give us any color on how the traction is building there as you are rebranding? Tom Gallagher : You bet, Bret. It was - you've got a good memory, it was just about exactly one year ago that we launched our initiative in Mexico and bringing the NAPA brand down to Mexico. We - where we are currently, we're on track, we're on target. We expect to end the year with 20 to 25 NAPA stores in the region. I would also tell you that probably since we last talked, we're in the process of recruiting a couple of strong entrepreneurial independent owners who are opening stores down in the region as well. So - so far we're on track. Bret Jordan : Okay, and then one other regional question. You mentioned some of the energy states were a little softer than the average in performance in the quarter. How about the West ex the energy states? If you go all the way out to the coast, how was the regional performance there? Tom Gallagher : Yes. So the west - and I did mention our team out West, but they are holding their own, Bret. They were right at the overall growth number for the commercial business and our overall business. So West is holding up okay. We're seeing, as I mentioned solid growth up and down the East Coast, all the way down into the southern and Florida groups, most of our softness or where our softness is, it's almost directly tied to some of those oil and gas markets. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then one last question, as you were talking about M&A, is there any thought about increasing the Company-owned store base within NAPA, either just buying in independents as they retire or doing something more structural there? I mean, obviously, as you are getting a retail operation, you get maybe a better return on the average store. Is there a thought about upping the Company-owned store count? Tom Gallagher : I think you'll see that happen as time goes on, Bret. Our basic philosophy is we'll own the stores in and around the major metropolitan areas and we'll have good independent owners in the outlying areas. And I don't think that will change materially going forward. But as a percentage of our total automotive volume going out a few years, you'll probably see the corporate stores represent a little bit higher percentage of the total volume than the independent stores do today. Bret Jordan : All right. Great, thank you. Tom Gallagher : All right, Bret. Operator : Your next question \u2013 your final question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me in under the wire here. Couple of things, first of all, I guess, obviously, we did see at least a slight deceleration in auto despite what seemed to be pretty favorable weather for most of the quarter. So for the sake of focusing on an admittedly short-term issue, I guess the question is probably for Paul. Do you have concerns that we could start to see a little bit of incremental softening if the mild weather we've seen for most of the fall here continue deeper into the quarter? Paul Donahue : Scot, you hit it. Our - we did see slight deceleration as the quarter progressed. We had a really strong both June and July saw a little bit of a downtick, slight downtick in August and September. It's early yet, but we're certainly optimistic that the quarter will come in as we projected. But I think as Tom mentioned in his comments, in the overall environment that we're in, we are in a - we are definitely in a grind it out kind of mode right now as we go into the fourth quarter. Scot Ciccarelli : So would you attribute the little bit of deceleration that we saw in auto to weather or was it something else, just so it's kind of clear for everyone? Paul Donahue : No, I don't think it's tied to weather, Scot. Actually the weather throughout the summer and even into September we had I think a warmer than normal summer, which resulted in some good numbers for us and categories like air conditioning was strong, batteries were solid in the quarter. So no, I don't think it attributable to weather at all. Scot Ciccarelli : Well, you've mentioned before that you guys are exposed to more industrial related to stuff in NAPA than maybe some of your competitors are. Is that where you are seeing it, some of the items that you've mentioned before on that front? Paul Donahue : No, as I mentioned in a previous question, where we are seeing softness, it is directly in some of the more dominant oil and gas markets, Southwest for sure, some of the mountain areas, which includes some of the fracking country up in the Dakotas and Montana. We do - do a lot of business in the fleet, Scot. We do a lot of heavy duty business. We do a lot of heavy duty filter business and we are seeing some fairly significant declines in those categories in those markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay, I knew you mentioned the geography. I was just trying to clarify on the product. That's helpful. And then previously, I think, as Carol mentioned, you guys are comfortable with the receivables. Can you help us understand how much exposure you have to some of these troubled end markets? You've referenced mining, oil, gas, etc. and is there a point where you start to consider changes to terms to some of these customers as you try and protect against potential losses, just given the strain on some of their own balance sheets? Carol Yancey : Actually, we very closely monitor accounts receivable and certainly what you are speaking about in the industrial area, right now, we're not taking steps, additional steps to modify anything. But I can tell you its just a constant focus on our receivables. We feel like we're in pretty good shape. We actually already have an outlook and an estimate for what our full year bad debt expense will be and we don't have anything that we're concerned about. I think our customers and the terms that we have, we have a pretty close insight as to what's going on. So I wouldn't see anything there. Scot Ciccarelli : Got you. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Carol Yancey : All right. Tom Gallagher : I've got just one last point. Keep in mind that I think across the enterprise our team has done a very good job in accounts receivable management. Carol pointed out earlier that we are down 1% in receivables year-over-year, which I think is a pretty good job. Scot Ciccarelli : Thanks, Tom. I appreciate that. Carol Yancey : We'd like to thank everybody for participating in this quarter's conference call. And if you have any further questions, let us know. But we appreciate your interest in and support of the company and we look forward to talking to you again after our fourth quarter earnings in February. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sidney G. Jones - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company fourth quarter 2015 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2016. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Sid, and I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, GPC's President, along with Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and I will each handle a portion of today's call. And once we've completed our individual comments, we'll look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have. Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and year-end results, and hopefully you've all had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.682 billion, which was down 4% with negative currency impact accounting for 3% of this decrease. Net income was $161.3 million, which was down 3%. Earnings per share were $1.07 this year, which was even with last year, and currency negatively impacted the EPS by $0.03 per share in the quarter. For the full year, sales were $15.280 billion, which was down four-tenths of 1%, with currency costing us 3 points of revenue growth. Net income was $706 million, which was down just under 1%, and earnings per share were $4.63 this year, compared to $4.61 in 2014. And for the full year, the currency impact was $0.14. After several years of solid performances, 2015 proved to be a more challenging year for us, largely attributable to the combination of the significant slowdown experienced in our Industrial and Electrical businesses, and the impact of unfavorable currency exchange, primarily on our Automotive business. Fortunately, as you'll hear from, Paul, in a few minutes, the underlying fundamentals remain positive for the Automotive segment, and each of our Automotive businesses are turning in solid local currency results. The Industrial Operations are our second-largest business segment, representing 30% of total company sales in this past year, and at the end of the year down 3%. And as we reported, over the course of the year, we saw a sequential revenue deceleration as the year progressed. After being up 3% in the first quarter, the Industrial Operations were down 2% in Q2, down 4% in Q3, and down 8% in the fourth quarter, and these results are reflective of the sluggish end-market conditions encountered by many of our Industrial customers. Customers in the oil and gas, original equipment manufacturing, iron and steel and heavy equipment rental were all down double-digits with us for a year. And as a point of information, the fourth quarter decreases were even more significant than the full-year declines, indicating the ongoing challenges faced by customers in each of these segments. Conversely, customers in aggregate in cements, food products, Automotive, lumber and wood products all generated positive results for us this past year. And then looking ahead, we would expect positive results from each of these customer categories in 2016 as well. At the same time, however, our expectation is for continued declines from customers in the oil and gas, original equipment manufacturing, iron and steel, and heavy equipment rental categories for several more quarters, which will certainly be a headwind to our overall sales results. In an effort to offset this, our Industrial team remains focused on key elements of their sales strategy including share of wallet initiatives with existing customers, expansion of our customer base, product line extensions, and expanding our geographic footprint and product capabilities through acquisitions. And on this last point, we're pleased to report two acquisitions that are scheduled to close on March 1 with combined revenue of approximately $50 million, and both companies nicely complement Motion's existing business, and they would help our growth rates over the remainder of the year. Moving on to our Electrical segment, EIS ended the year with sales of $751 million, which was up 2% and represents 5% of total company revenues. As with Motion, EIS had mixed results among their segments. Customers in the wire and cable and fabrication sides of the business generated nice increases, while customers in the Electrical side had decreases. The Electrical segment represents about 40% of EIS's total revenue, and similar to Motion, we are probably a few quarters away from seeing stabilization in this segment. In the meantime, they're employing many of the same growth strategies as Motion including acquisitions, and our expectation is to be in a position to announce a $50-million-plus acquisition in the weeks ahead, which will certainly have a nice positive impact on the EIS results in 2016. And a few comments on our Office Products Group, which represents 13% of total company sales in 2015. They ended the year with sales of just over $1.9 billion, and this was up 7.5%. The Office Products growth was fueled by incremental acquisition revenue and strong double-digit growth from the mega channel. Our independent reseller business was down low-single digits for the year, with most of this decrease coming in the second half of the year. On the product side, we had double-digit growth for the year in furniture and facility and breakroom supplies, and mid-single-digit growth in our core Office Product supplies. And we are pleased with the progress made in each of these categories. Technology products were flat for the year. And looking at our Office Products results over the course of the year, it was really a tale of two halves, with first half revenues being up 16% and second half revenues being up just slightly. The outsized first half increases were driven by the aforementioned incremental acquisition volume and increased revenue from the mega channel that was anniversaried early in Q3. And then we feel our second half results are more reflective of the ongoing underlying sluggish conditions in the Office Products industry. Many of the ongoing issues within the industry are secular in nature, and as a result, our team continues to work on market share and share of wallet initiatives, product line additions and extensions, product and channel diversification, as well as strategic acquisitions. You will recall that we completed the acquisition of Malt Industries late in 2015. Malt is a distributor of safety supplies and protective apparel with annual sales of about $20 million. We are pleased with their progress to date. This acquisition helped to further diversify our product and channel portfolios, and we will pursue additional acquisition opportunities to continue the strategy in the quarters ahead. So that's a quick overview of the non-Automotive segments, and Paul will now give you an update on the Automotive results. Paul? Paul D. Donahue - President: Thank you, Tom. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you here today and to have an opportunity to provide you an update on our fourth quarter performance of our Automotive business. For the quarter ending December 31, our global Automotive sales were down 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 2.5% in core Automotive growth and a slight benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 5% in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with the impact of currency we saw throughout 2015. Our U.S. team posted a 2% sales increase in the fourth quarter, compared with 3% growth experienced through the first nine months of 2015. Our international businesses, which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, reported another quarter of mid-single-digit growth in local currency. Despite challenging local economies, we remain encouraged by the steady and consistent growth we are experiencing across all of our international markets. We see no reason for this not to continue in 2016. In the U.S., our results varied by geographical region. Our business in the Northeast, Florida, Central and Western regions of the country continue to deliver solid results. The Midwest, Mountain and Southwest regions of the country all came in below our expectations. Given our strong commercial presence with fleets, including many in the battered oil and gas sector, we felt the effects across many of our stores throughout the Mountain and Southwest regions. Particularly hard-hit were stores in Texas, Oklahoma, Montana and the Dakotas. We also are seeing the effects across many of our stores in Western Canada. We would also add the above-average temperatures experienced in the fourth quarter across the Midwest and Mountain regions, negatively impacted our winter goods sales. So now let's turn to our same-store sales for the fourth quarter. Our U.S. company-owned store grew comp store sales in the fourth quarter by 2%. This compares to the 3% comp store increase we reported through nine months. Cadence of the quarter saw our team post solid results in both October and December. In fact, we were encouraged as we entered the fourth quarter as October same-stores sales were our second-best results of the year. The month of November proved to be the outlier, and we believe warmer-than-normal temps in the month caused this downturn. This quarter's 2% increase is on top of the 7% increase generated in the fourth quarter of 2014, giving us a two-year stack of 9%. This increase was driven by a combination of gains on both our commercial side of our business, as well as by our retail business. So let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in our Q3 call, we continue to expand or revamp DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. These initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extended store hours, increased training for our store associates, and the nationwide launch of our NAPA Rewards Program to name just a few. And while we are in the early days of rolling out these initiatives, we are pleased with the initial results. Our plans call for us to expand our 20-store impact pilot in 2016 to include an additional 150 company-owned stores. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results. And for the fourth quarter, we can report a total increase of 5% in our retail business. Coupling this 5% increase with the 11% increase we posted in Q4 of 2014, gives us a two-year stack of 16%. For the full year, our retail business was up 6%. These gains are being driven by both transaction and basket size increases. In Q4, we experienced a mid-single-digit increase in our average retail ticket, and a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our Automotive business posted a 2% increase in the fourth quarter and a two-year stack of 8%. So, for the year, we can report a 3% increase in our commercial business. The core elements of this segment continue to center around our Major Account business and our NAPA AutoCare business. In 2015, we expanded our AutoCare membership count, which now totals 16,300-plus across the U.S. Both our AutoCare and Major Account businesses generated mid-single-digit growth for the year. We believe the slowdown in the Industrial sector had a material impact on our fleet business in the quarter. This business was up just 1% after delivering 3-plus percent increases in the previous three quarters. Our Q4 two-year stack on our fleet business now stands at 6%. Our wholesale ticket trend was consistent with what we experienced in the third quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was up mid-single digits, with little or no benefit from inflation, while we saw a slight decline in the number of tickets moving through our stores. So, now, let's take a look at a few of our key product categories and review the trends we experienced in the fourth quarter. Our brakes category was a highlight again in the quarter, and it has been a strong category for us all year. The brakes category grew low-double digits for us in the fourth quarter. And we also saw experienced \u2013 we also experienced solid growth in our tool and equipment business. An area of concern would be in our battery business, which was off slightly in the quarter. We believe this is attributable to the warmer winter temperatures. And we can report this business has now bounced back in the month of January, and our team drove a double-digit increase in the month of January. We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA import parts business. This business was up high-single digits in the quarter and posted double-digit growth for the year. On February 1, we announced the acquisition of Olympus Imported Parts. Olympus is a 30-year business specializing in professional-grade import auto parts. They currently operate out of six locations in the Northern Virginia and Greater D.C. area and generate approximately $25 million in annualized revenues. This business will be a nice complement to our growing NAPA import business, as well as our Altrom import parts business. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to Mike Brown and the entire Olympus team to Genuine Parts Company. We'd also like to provide you with an update on a previously discussed acquisition target. During our third quarter call, we reviewed with you the pending acquisition of Covs Parts, a 25-branch distribution company based in Western Australia. While we had hoped to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, we encountered regulatory approval delays, moving the expected close of this transaction to no later than April 1 of this year. With approval for 21 branches, the addition of Covs Parts further expands our market presence and scale in Western Australia, and is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $70 million. This acquisition will expand our industry-leading presence in Australia and New Zealand and puts us over the 500-store mark. We are proud of our team in Asia Pacific and look forward to another solid year from this business in 2016. As we look to the immediate future, strategic M&A will continue to be a growth lever for our Automotive businesses both in the U.S. and abroad. Turning to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow, lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer, and miles driven continues to post substantial gain. Miles driven actually increased 3.5% through the first 11 months of the year, which is a new record. In addition, the latest month with reported figures is November, which was up 4.3% year-over-year, also a new record. This now makes 21 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, and it certainly is driving \u2013 these key metrics are driven by lower fuel cost. The natural \u2013 the national average price of gas in 2015 was $2.40 per gallon, which was the second lowest annual average in the past 10 years. Gas prices continue to move downward, and in the most part of the U.S. today, they average less than $2 a gallon. These low gas prices should bode well for future increases in both miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. In closing, we are pleased to show positive underlying Automotive growth for both the quarter and the year in a challenging economic environment. And we are encouraged with the start of the New Year, as our sales in January were more in line with our historical run rates. We remain hopeful we can carry this momentum through to the end of the quarter and the balance of 2016. As we move into 2016, our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing our retail strategy, and driving global expansion via new store openings, as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. I want to thank our teams of both in North America as well as Australasia for their efforts, and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business. So that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. And at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We will begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full-year income statements and the segment information, and then we'll review some key balance sheet and other financial items. As Tom mentioned, our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the fourth quarter were down 4%, and consist of a decrease in underlying sales of 2%, a currency headwind of 3%, and acquisitions contributed 1%. For the year, total revenues of $15.3 billion consisted of core sales growth of 1.5% and a 1% contribution from acquisitions, offset by a 3% currency headwind. Our gross profit for the fourth quarter was 29.75% down from 30.0% gross margin last year. And for the year, gross margin of 29.8%, compared to 29.9% reported last year. Primarily, our gross margins for the fourth quarter and the full-year benefited from improved margins in our Automotive, Office, and Electrical businesses, but our growth in these segments was offset by the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our Industrial business. This directly related to the sluggish sales environment and lower inventory purchases for this group. We recognize the need for additional progress on this line and the importance of executing on our gross margin initiatives. This is a key priority for our management team, and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term. Our gross margin initiatives are critical to offset the low inflationary environment that has persisted across our businesses for several years now, especially in Automotives. Our cumulative supplier price changes in 2015 were negative two-tenths \u2013 20 basis points, two-tenths of 1% for Automotive, positive 90 basis points for Industrial, positive 60 basis points for Office Products, and negative 1.75% for Electrical. Turning to SG&A, our total expenses for the fourth quarter were $834 million, or 22.65% of sales, which is a 40-basis-point improvement from the prior year. For the full year, our total expenses of $3.4 billion, at 22.46% of sales, or a 20-basis-point improvement. The improvement in our SG&A expenses reflects the positive impact of our cost control measures across all of our businesses. Additionally, we had added savings of lower incentive compensation in the fourth quarter relative to 2014. Overall, our cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by the deleveraging of expenses in our Industrial business, as well as the increases in expenses across the company in areas such as employee benefits and retirement plans and healthcare. Our teams remain focused on controlling expenses, and we continue to take actions to further improve our productivity and streamline our operations. We expect to show continued progress on this line in the periods ahead. If we look at our results for the segment, our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, down 2% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $169 million is up 12.5%, and their margin improved a strong 110 basis points due to the improved gross margins and expense control. For the year, Automotive sales of $8 billion are down 1%. Our operating profit of $729 million is up 4%, and our margin has improved by 40 basis points to 9.1%, so a solid margin expansion for Automotive in 2015. Our Industrial sales of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 8%. Our operating profit of $72 million is down 24.8%, and our operating margin was down 150 basis points to 6.5%. For the year, Industrial sales of $4.6 billion are down 2.6% from the prior year, and our operating profit of $339 million is down 8.3%, and our margin was 7.3%, which is down 50 basis points from last year. This is driven by a lower incentives and expense deleverage, which pressured this group throughout the year but at a greater amount in the fourth quarter. Our Office Products revenues were $459 million in the quarter, down 2%. Our operating profit of $33 million is down 5%, and their operating margin of 7.3% is down 20 basis points. For the year, Office revenues of $1.9 billion are up 7.5% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $141 million is up 5%, and our margin of 7.3% is down 10 basis points from last year. The Electrical Group had sales in the quarter of $177 million, which is basically flat with the prior year. Our operating profit of $16 million is up 6.7%, so the margin for this group showed strong growth of 60 basis points to 9.1%. For the year, sales for this group of $751 million are up 1.6%, and their operating profit of $70 million is up 9%, and their margin improved to 9.3%, which is a solid 50-basis-point increase from the prior year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, our total operating margin improved by 10 basis points. For the quarter, the margin was 7.9% compared to 7.8%; and for the year, 8.4% compared to 8.3%. This improvement in 2015 follows our 30-basis-point expansion in 2014, and given this current sales environment, we're very pleased with our continued progress in this area. Looking ahead, further margin expansion remains a key goal for the company. We had net interest expense of $4.3 million in the quarter, and for the 12 months, interest expense was $20.4 million, which compares to $24.2 million in 2014. For 2016, we currently estimate net interest expense to approximate $21 million to $22 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense of $9 million for the fourth quarter and $35 million for the full year is down slightly from 2014. We currently estimate total amortization expense of $36 million to $38 million for the full year in 2016. Our depreciation of $27 million for the fourth quarter and $107 million for the full year, and for 2016, we're projecting this to be approximately $120 million to $130 million. So, combined, depreciation and amortization looking ahead would be in the range of $155 million to $170 million. The other line which primarily reflects our corporate expense was $16.3 million for the quarter, which is up slightly from the prior-year quarter. For the full year, our corporate expense is $100.4 million, which is consistent with our expectations and up from the $90 million in the prior year. Primarily unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustments of $7 million and planned IT-related investments accounted for the increase on this line. Turning to 2016, we expect the corporate expense line to be in the $110 million to $120 million range for the full year. Our tax rate was 38.35% for the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the full year. These rates are up from 2014 due to the changes in mix of our foreign income and the related foreign tax rates, as well as the unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustments recorded through the first nine months of 2015. We currently expect our tax rates to approximate 37% for the full year in 2016. Our net income for the quarter of $161.3 million and our EPS of $1.07 was equal to the prior year. And for the year, our EPS of $4.63 was up slightly from the $4.61 for last year. Now let's talk about the balance sheet which we strengthened in the fourth quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at December was $212 million, which is an increase from the $138 million at December 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support our growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of $1.8 billion at December 31 is down 3% from the prior year on a 4% decrease in sales in the fourth quarter. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3 billion, down 1% from the prior year. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we will remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward in 2016. Accounts payable at December 31 was $2.8 billion, up 10%, and this is due to the positive impact of our improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're pleased with our continued improvement in this area, and we're encouraged by the positive impact on our working capital and days and payables. Our working capital of $1.6 billion at December 31 has significantly improved from the prior year in both absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues. Our progress in this area contributed significantly to our record cash flows for the year. Effectively managing our working capital and in particular, accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company. Our total debt of $625 million at December 31 is down approximately $140 million from the $765 million in the prior year. Our debt includes two $250 million term notes as well as another $125 million in borrowings under our multicurrency revolving line of credit. Our debt-to-capitalization is at 16.5%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe it provides our company with both the financial capacity and the flexibility, necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We generated record cash flows in 2015, driven in part by our improvement in working capital. Cash from operations was $1.2 billion and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, was $682 million. This is a meaningful accomplishment for us. And for 2016, we're currently planning for another strong year of cash flows. We would expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range and free cash flow of approximately $400 million to $450 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash includes strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us, and they're integral to the growth plans of our company. In 2015, we made a number of strategic acquisitions to expand our distribution footprint, and in total, these new businesses are expected to contribute $180 million in annual revenues. Thus far in 2016, we've added the Olympus Imported Parts distribution business, as covered by Paul. And looking forward in 2016, we will continue to seek new acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on-type companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are still open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large and small, assuming the appropriate returns on investment. Turning to our share repurchases in 2015, we used our cash to repurchase 3.3 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program. Through today, we have also purchased another 570,000 shares of stock, and today we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we have been slightly more aggressive with our repurchases given the value of our stock price over the last 12 months to 14 months. We expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best returns to our shareholders. Our investment and capital expenditures was $48 million for the fourth quarter, which is an increase from the $34 million in the prior year. For the year, our capital spending was $110 million, up slightly from the prior year. We are currently planning for capital expenditures to increase further in 2016 to approximately $140 million to $160 million with the vast majority of our investments weighted towards productivity enhancing projects, primarily in technology. Effective yesterday, the board approved a $2.63 per share annual dividend for 2016, marking our 60th consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. This represents a 7% increase from the $2.46 per share and is approximately 57% of our prior year earnings. This was slightly above our stated goal of a payout ratio of 50% to 55%, but we're comfortable going beyond this range from time to time due to our strong cash flows. So this concludes our financial update for the fourth quarter and the full year. And in summary, we operated in 2015 with relatively mixed results. That said, we improved the strength of our balance sheet with excellent working capital management, and effective cost control measures helped us produce an expanded operating profit margin. Additionally, we generated record cash flows and a record earnings per share for 2015. These are meaningful accomplishments and our progress in these areas supports our investment and growth opportunities such as acquisitions, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders with the dividend and share repurchases. We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the periods ahead. And I'd like to thank all of our GPC associates for their hardwork and their commitment to their jobs. I'll turn it now back over to Tom. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Carol. So that will conclude our prepared comments on 2015. And in closing, we would say as mentioned earlier, that it was a challenging year in many ways but a gratifying year in other ways. Our revenue production in local currencies was solid across our Automotive businesses as it was in Office Products, but Industrial and Electrical found it more difficult. We were pleased to see strong operating margin improvements in Automotive and Electrical, but we had operating margin declines in Office Products and Industrial. We were, however, able to show a 10-basis-point improvement for GPC overall despite the Office Products and Industrial challenges. Gross profit was down 12 basis points for the year, but good work was done on the SG&A side, and SG&A was down 20 basis points. As a result, pre-tax income was up slightly, but due to the higher tax rate that Carol explained, net income was down slightly. On the balance sheet side, the progress was more consistent, with cash from operations and free cash, both setting new records and working capital was reduced once again in 2015. And we returned well over $600 million back to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. And we reinvested over $225 million back into the business through a combination of capital expenditures and acquisitions, and we expect to invest an additional $125 million in acquisitions over the next few months. And these CapEx and acquisition investments are intended to drive revenue and profit growth in the quarters ahead. Now, turning to the year ahead, as a general statement, we would say that we remain quite cautious in our outlook. The general economic conditions look a bit fragile and perhaps tenuous both domestically and globally. And as mentioned earlier, this is already having a significant impact on certain segments of our customer base, primarily in Industrial and Electrical. Conversely, we think that the outlook for our Automotive segment is generally favorable, but the currency impact will once again be a headwind to our Automotive growth in 2015. With all of that said, at this point, we would expect our 2016 revenues to be up 2% to 3% in Automotive with a currency headwind of 3%; Industrial, up 1% to 2%; Electrical, up 1% to 2%; Office Products, down 1% to up 1%; giving us a total GPC revenue expectation of being up 1% to 2% and up 3% to 4% before the currency impact. And with revenue growth at these levels, we would suggest an EPS range of $4.70 to $4.80, which will be up 1.5% to 3.5% after currency exchange impact of approximately $0.08 per share, and before the currency exchange impact, would be up 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis. At this point, we'd like to address your questions, and we'll turn the call back to Chris. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our first question from Elizabeth Suzuki of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Just wondering how much of the SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter was the result of lower stock compensation? And what other cost reductions were made in order to generate the impressive operating margins in the quarter? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Elizabeth, we would talk about that. I guess I would say primarily it's more coming in the areas of productivity improvements, and we've talked a lot about the investments we've made in technology and productivity things, and that would be both on our warehouses and our stores. Also I would point out additional leverage in our shared services and areas we're doing there. Even in our freight, we look at freight and optimization of our routes, fuel prices, we had improvement there. And then even bringing on some of the acquisitions. We're able to bring them on and put them on what we call the GPC programs, and we get the benefit of better pricing for those folks. So to a lesser extent, you'd have the impact of lower bonuses and commissions, and then kind of a tightening up that we do, like on travel and some areas such as that. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. So stock comp wasn't really a material benefit? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's really a combination of all those things. That was certainly not the primary. It's more in the productivity and some of the things that we're doing in improving our cost overall. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. And for the Automotive segment, you noted that there was a weather impact in the fourth quarter since it was relatively warm through December. Do you think that should reverse in the first quarter, so that the average of 4Q and 1Q would be about the same year-over-year from a weather perspective? Paul D. Donahue - President: Yeah. Elizabeth, this is Paul. We'd certainly hope to see it. What we're seeing in the early part of the year is encouraging. And certainly the folks up in the Northeast, Boston, New York are feeling the impact of colder temps returning, and we're seeing a bit of it in the Midwest as well. So, absolutely, we are encouraged with some of the weather changes we're seeing. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Paul D. Donahue - President: You're welcome. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : We go next to Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Seth. Paul D. Donahue - President: Good morning, Seth. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: My first question is on auto, just trying to understand a little bit better your expectations for 2016. You're looking for a growth of 2% to 3% on revenues, with a 3% FX headwind. So looking for core growth in the mid-single digit range, is that correct? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : That's right. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. In terms of the drivers of that core growth, weather might normalize a little bit, but are there any other initiatives that you can speak to that could help improve your business in 2016 relative to 2015? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, Paul and I might double team this. But in his comments, he highlighted several things that we think are going to give us some good production in the year ahead. He talked about the top store initiative, and we'll add 150 of those this coming year and that will certainly be a benefit to us. So we've got other new distribution initiatives that will also help us. Paul mentioned some of the growth we're experiencing with NAPA AutoCare and with Major Accounts; we would expect that to continue in the year ahead. Our import program is performing well and we did add Olympus, the recent acquisition, so that will fuel growth there. So just a number of different things that we expect to have a positive impact as we go ahead. Paul D. Donahue - President: Yeah. I would add to that, Tom. We \u2013 Seth, we'll continue to be opportunistic and fairly aggressive on the acquisition front, both in the U.S. as well as international as evident by our Covs acquisition. We do hope to close that here very soon in Australia. And we continue to expand our presence in Mexico as well, and, as you know, we launched our NAPA initiative down there in late 2014. It's early yet, but we remain encouraged by what we see in those markets as well. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. Just to quantify it, approximately how much do you expect acquisitions to contribute to auto revenues in 2016? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : The only one we've included in our guidance is Olympus. And just as a general statement, we normally will not include anything that we've not got a very, very high degree of confidence. And we've got a letter of intent and we've got a closing date, so we included Olympus. On the Industrial side, we included the two acquisitions that will close on March 1. But beyond that, we've not included any of the others in the guidance that we've given you. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it, thank you. And then my second question, really good performance on cash flow in 2015. As you look forward, it seems like you're expecting much higher at least percentage increase in CapEx and may not see as much payables leverage. Can you help us understand those two moving pieces to your cash flow expectations? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Talk about CapEx first. I mean, some of the CapEx, and you saw that we were lower than what our guidance was for 2015, some of that is the timing of projects. But I would specifically call out, we have a couple distribution center refreshes, relocations where we're enhancing again the productivity. And so that's built into there. And then some of our IT investments that we've talked about, and certainly in the warehouse management area. But again, some of it is the timing on projects. But we're certainly comfortable with the range we've given. And then you mentioned on the improvements for cash flow, I mean, one of our sources of cash from operations was in the decrease in accounts receivable. We had almost a $200 million source from accounts receivable, more related to our decrease in sales. So that's why we're guiding to a little bit lower number because we think that receivables won't be as much of a help to us in 2016. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you very much and good luck. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Seth. Paul D. Donahue - President: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Thanks. I had a quick follow-up for Carol, and then I wanted to ask Paul and Tom a couple, one thing. Carol, on the working capital, the AP-to-inventory ratio also improved a lot. Was there something there in timing, or do you think that could get to 100% from I guess what's now a little over 90%? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We were pleased to see that be at 94% at the end of the year, and as you mentioned, improvements from the 84% the prior year. We don't have a set target for 2016, but I would tell you that we certainly would expect continued improvement. And there wasn't anything that drove that in particular in the fourth quarter. We continue to see improvement across all of our businesses. And that was really done despite lower inventory purchases in the Industrial sector, too Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Good. So that still has room to go, it sounds like? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It does. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Great. And then I'm not sure, Paul or Tom, who wants it, but if you think about this year and the guidance and some of the history of weather, if I go back to 2012, which I think is the last time we had a winter that was kind of mild to start, your comps decelerate, I think, maybe 400 basis points over a couple of quarters. Help us understand why this time could be different, or why we expect that auto should hold in there for the next couple of quarters? And I also wanted to make sure, Tom, you said Industrial would be up 1% to 2% this year. What accounts for that inflection from at least the second half of 2015's trend? Thanks a lot. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. We'll take the Automotive first. I think we're basing our guidance more on some of the underlying strategies than we are on any weather impact. And the issues that \u2013 or the initiatives that Paul and I detailed just a moment ago, I think, are the primary reasons that we've guided to the levels we've guided at. So I think we're pretty comfortable at those levels as we work our way through 2016. In terms of the inflection in Industrial, there are two things. Again, the comment I made about we'll be adding $50 million of annualized revenue as of March 1 with the two acquisitions that we're making, that's one thing. And then the second thing, it's \u2013 six weeks does not a trend make by any stretch. But what we saw on a per day basis in January and what we've seen through mid-month February is a little bit better than what we experienced certainly in Q4 of this past year. And the other thing is not included in the guidance would be an expectation that we might be able to make another acquisition or two over the course of the year in Industrial. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Great. And that bit better on a per-day basis, was that more in the oil and gas and some of the areas that have been weak? Or is it already there? Has it already been positively improved? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : No, I think it's more across those segments that have held up reasonably well. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks a lot. Good luck. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Right. Thank you. Paul D. Donahue - President: Thank you. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question relates to capital allocation, and you're use of free cash. I think I detected a change at least in the rhetoric and prioritization. Historically you've always cited the dividend first, and today you cited strategic acquisitions and went into some depth in that. So is that my imagination, or is there some intent? Obviously, you've been raising the dividend for many, many decades, and that I know is not expected to change, but does that speak to an increased focus on strategic deals for you? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I don't know that it necessarily signals an increased focus, but there's a heavy emphasis and focus on strategic acquisitions right now, and we've actually got more discussions going than we had at certain points in the past. So, we're encouraged by the number of conversations that we're engaged in, and we would expect a certain number of those to come to fruition. And quite frankly, I think if we had 2015 to play over, we might have been even more aggressive on the acquisition front, but we just didn't find \u2013 we're unable to engage in enough discussions. But I think we've gotten that sorted out, and we're pleased with the level of activity we see there right now. So I don't think it at all indicates reduced interest in increasing the dividend, lower reduced interest in appropriate levels of share repurchase or CapEx expenditures across the businesses, but we're bit more optimistic about our opportunities on the acquisition right now than it might have been this time last year. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And Tom, would you expect most of your deals to be of similar size to the kinds of transactions that we have noted over the past several years in terms of general range? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yes. I would say that's right. However, as Carol mentioned, if we would have find something larger that made sense for the shareholders then we would certainly like the opportunity to engage in that discussion. And the nice thing about our balance sheet is that we've got the wherewithal to fund acquisitions that are larger. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then shifting gears, just digging a little bit deeper into the Automotive P&L, you had quite a move in the profitability of that business in the absence of any kind of sales momentum. I understand that last year's margin compare in Automotive was somewhat depressed, so that might help the year-on-year compare, but can you just give us a little more color on what helped you generate that Automotive profitability? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I would call out \u2013 so in the quarter, I would say that of the 110 basis point improvement, a third of that came from gross margin and two-thirds was from SG&A. So our core gross profit and we've called this out before, we've seen continued quarterly improvement in our core gross profits for Automotive. And that's both in the U.S. and our international businesses and there has been specific things done in our foreign businesses to really take control of gross profit, especially with the headwinds that they've had on the strong U.S. dollar. And then two-thirds of the improvement came from SG&A, and it's some of the things that we called out earlier. So, again, Automotive has done a terrific job on the productivity side. And again, calling out some specific things they've done with investments in technology and systems and the warehouses and the stores. And then also, again, the freight, we've talked about route optimizations in some of those areas. And then, to a lesser extent, you had lower bonuses and incentives that impacted that in the quarter as well. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And were there reversals of any accruals in that business of year-to-date numbers that perhaps went the other way in Q4? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : There weren't anything else that we haven't already called out. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you very much. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Matthew. Operator : From JPMorgan, next we turn to Mark Becks. Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. The sales outlook of plus 1% to 2% in earnings, that seems to imply kind of flat to up slightly EBIT margins. Is that, in fact, accurate? And then, how does that parse out between Automotive and Industrial? Presumably Automotive would be expected to be up a little, and then on the other side Industrial, I guess, would be expected to be down slightly? Is that the way to think about it? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Mark, I guess, we are probably implying \u2013 what we would imply is that we'd have some slight improvement in our operating margins. And I think what you called out is we would expect probably to see that, depending on the top line, more in the other sectors than the Industrial ones. But we're more implying for a slight improvement on the operating margin. I mean, we've called out we still have our corporate expense numbers a little higher. But again, I think we can be up slightly with what we're targeting. Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, I guess, the other side of the ledger with Matt's question, you guys have been steadfastly committed to the dividend. I think you have a targeted payout ratio of 50% to 55%. And with your dividend announcement today it takes you slightly outside. Given your proven ability with strong cash flows, why is the 50% to 55% the right number? And then would you have any considerations for taking that up? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : I'll try to answer that, Mark. This is Tom. First of all, the 50% to 55% is somewhat of an informal stated objective, and over time, we've come to conclude that a payout at that level is a reward and return back to the shareholder, while at the same time leaving us adequate funding to do the other things that we want to get done. So, yes, we're slightly above that. I think we're 57% of prior-year earnings with the recent dividend increase. I don't think you'll see us take that up materially from there. I think we'll take that, the capital that we're generating, the cash we're generating and invest it in some of these other areas. Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. And then last quick clarification for Carol. You have that $250 million in November due. Any initial thoughts on that? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's still premature, but our thoughts on that, is that we'll probably do some type of a renewal as we get close to the end of the year. Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Up next, we go to Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning. Paul D. Donahue - President: Hey. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : A quick question on the top store rollout, you're adding 150. If that were successful, how many of your stores do you think are applicable here? I mean, how big could that concept get? Paul D. Donahue - President: So, Bret, we're planning on 150 this year of our company-owned stores. We could go a bit greater in that number. We're going to see kind of how the first half plays out. When we've got stores that are in not exactly prime retail locations, so backstreets, more Industrial areas, we will certainly refresh those stores, but we will not go to the full top-store formats. But right now, we feel very good about our ability to roll out the 150, could expand it. We will also \u2013 any new stores and/or any new relocations this year, we will move to the new store format. And then at the appropriate time, we'll also bring in our independent owners who are ready to make that kind of a commitment as well. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then a question on Olympus. I mean, it's a $25 million revenue business. Is that something that you're getting a catalog you can roll out across the rest of the network that it will contribute in that import parts category more quickly? Or is that just something you're going to grow off of a relatively small base more slowly? Paul D. Donahue - President: So, Bret, we are already and have had an import business inside of the NAPA network for a number of years that's Altrom. So we've been in that space. Olympus will be a nice bolt-on addition to that business, and we'll certainly bring with it increased expertise. They've got a great management team, an experienced management team. We've got expansion opportunities up there in that marketplace, but we're excited to bring those guys on board. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay, but there was nothing special about their catalog that you acquired that is leverageable? Paul D. Donahue - President: No. No. No. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Paul D. Donahue - President: All right. You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Tony Cristello of BB&T Capital Markets. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Thank you. Good morning. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Tony. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : I wanted to ask a follow-up on some of the discussion with M&A. It sounds as if there is certainly an acceleration, and perhaps you had an appetite to maybe even have done more in 2015. Is that a result of more willing sellers or multiples have come in? Or are there some distressed businesses out there that you feel like you can pick up and gain some market share from right now? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Tony, I think it's more of the former two than the last point. We're not really bottom-fishing. We're not looking for distressed businesses. We're looking for businesses that give us an opportunity to expand geographically, or give us product diversification, and that fit us strategically for the long haul. I think, as I mentioned earlier to a prior question, I think we're just seeing right now the opportunity to at least engage in more discussions with certain sellers than perhaps we had seen a year ago. And certainly we're interested in following not just the discussions we're in now through to completion, but also identifying some additional opportunities that we could add to the organization. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Has the marketplace afforded more reasonable valuations for you as well? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, yeah, and I think you probably know at least we consider ourselves to be a fairly disciplined buyer, and there have been times in the past where we've engaged in discussions and we couldn't chin to the valuations and feel it was appropriate for our shareholders. But right now, we seem to have a number of folks that fit in the ranges that we would use for valuation purposes. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And switching gears a little bit, if you look across your competitive landscape and each of your segments, you've done an excellent job of keeping your inventory appropriate. Do you feel your competitors are also reacting accordingly to what appears to be at least in the non-auto segments a bit more of a sluggish or challenging environment? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Tony, if we could \u2013 something happened where you broke up a little bit there. Would you mind repeating the question? Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Sure, I'm sorry. Across the categories, I was wondering from a competitive standpoint, you've done a very good job on managing your inventory levels and keeping things somewhat appropriate. When you look across some of your competitive segments, and more so in the Industrial side, do you believe your peers are also reacting accordingly? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I don't know that I'd be in a position to address that honestly. The thing that I would say is that having the right amount of inventory and the right mix of inventory is a high priority for us across all of the businesses. And I think it's played out reasonably well for us and I expect that it'll be a heavy initiative for us going forward as well. I can't address what the competitors are doing. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. Okay. Very good. Thank you for your time. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Tony. Paul D. Donahue - President: Thank you Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, guys. Paul D. Donahue - President: Good morning, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. So I know you don't break out CapEx by division, but even as I look at the entire company, your CapEx is somewhere between a half and a quarter of your biggest Automotive competitors. And I know your model is, obviously, a bit different with the wholesale component, but I guess the question is do you believe those levels of CapEx are sustainable, number one? And number two, it does appear that some of those competitors are actually accelerating their own capital investments. So I guess in a nutshell the question is, do you think you're going to need to accelerate your capital investments at some point? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : I would take a first stab at that and Carol may jump in. But in the guidance that Carol provided, she said $140 million to $160 million in 2016, which is up a bit from where we have been historically. And I think for modeling purposes, you could probably use that for the years after 2016. So it is a little bit heavier. We're investing a bit heavier. And as Carol mentioned, it's for facility refreshments to enable us to be more productive in the throughput. It's for technology investments that enable us to either have better management information or enable us to be more productive in what we do. And at least as we look out over the next couple of years, it appears that that's an appropriate level for the next several years. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I guess, I think the only other two things I'd add is one is our maintenance level of CapEx, if you will, the amount we need to do each year is probably more in the $100 million range. And the other thing is we have our distribution footprint out there. I mean, we're really in all the areas we need to be. So, if anything, it's \u2013 we have a lighter level of investments on real estate. So more of ours is in the technology, productivity areas with systems. And so if we have investments in real estate, it's more due to a relocation or refresh. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then you guys did talk about there's quite a bit of regional variability in the auto business, obviously weather had an impact. I'm assuming part of that is also the, let's call it, stores in the oil patch or energy patch. Can you give us some more color around the magnitude of the differences experienced market by market? Paul D. Donahue - President: Yes. Scot, this is Paul. What we saw in those markets that performed well, and I think I called out the East, certainly the Northeast, Florida, Central, out West, those businesses in Q4 all grew mid-single digits, good solid growth. The other end of the spectrum, and I believe I called out the Southwest and the Mountains, certainly impacted by oil and gas and Midwest, which we believe was more weather-related, were down low-single digits. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. All right. Thanks, guys. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks, Scot. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Carolina Jolly of Gabelli. A. Carolina Jolly - Gabelli & Co.: Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. A. Carolina Jolly - Gabelli & Co.: Good morning. In regards to the Industrial side of the business or Motion, what is your sense of inventory at your customers? And do you expect, I guess, any destocking going forward into 2016? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Carolina, I'll try to answer that one. Most of what we sell on the Industrial side is not for customer inventory. It's for something that they need right now. So inventory fluctuations are not that big of a factor for us honestly. So what we do see is we do have some customers that would hold some inventory. And if they're a multi-location customer, we do see them employing what we might call a buy \u2013 or use what we own already. So we do see some inventory transfer among plants under the same ownership, but I don't think inventory fluctuations are going to have a material effect on our demand patterns over the next year. A. Carolina Jolly - Gabelli & Co.: Great. Thanks. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And with no further questions in the phone queue, I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We thank all of you for participating in today's call, and we appreciate all of your support, and we look forward to reporting out to you with our first quarter results in April. Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude today's presentation. Thank you all for your participation.",

Welcome to the Genuine Parts Company First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Sid Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company first quarter 2016 conference call to discuss our earnings results and he outlook for the full year. Before we begin, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom? Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Sid, and I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer are both on the call as well. And each of has a few prepared comments and once completed, we'll look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have. Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2016 results, and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.718 billion, which was down one half of 1%. Net income was $158 million, which was down 1.9% and earnings per share were $1.05 this year, which was even with the $1.05 reported in the first quarter of last year. Once again this quarter, currency exchange was a headwind to all of our results. The impact of the strength of the US dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Mexican currencies was 1.6% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share in earnings per share. Stated another way in constant currency sales were up 1.1% and EPS was up 1%. While a bit better than the reported results, we still find ourselves revenue challenged primarily in our non-Automotive businesses and this is clearly pointed out if we look at the results by segment without currency impact. In constant currency our Automotive business was up 4.4%, industrial was down 1.7%, Office Products was down 2.5% and Electrical was down 3.4%. So the difference between our Automotive operations and our remaining three segments is quite pronounced and Paul will cover the Automotive segment in a few minutes. At first I\u2019ll make a few comments on the non-Automotive businesses starting with industrial. Motion industries ended the quarter down 2.5% on a reported basis and down 1.7% in constant currency. And although we continued to run decreases in this segment, we are just a bit encouraged by these results for two reasons. First, the first quarter of 2015 was our strongest quarter of the year at plus 3% and secondly, our Q1 2016 decrease was a smallest decrease that we\u2019ve seen in several quarters. Additionally our mid mine [ph] paper results are modestly positive and hopefully this is something that we can maintain as we move forward in the month and in the quarters ahead. However, it is important to point out that if you look at our performance by industry segment, by tough customers and by tough product categories, it shows just how uneven and choppy our business continues to be. If we look at our top 12 industry segments, first we have six that are up and six that are down. On the positive side in no order our lumber and wood products, boot products, cement, chemicals and automotive. On the down side we have, oil and gas, equipment and machinery, iron and steel and equipment rental and leasing. Our top 20 customers are actually up low single digit, with 15 of these customers running positive results thus far, but five are down. In our top 12 product categories, six are up and six are down. So as you can see, it\u2019s a real mixture with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results in other areas. And all of this in our opinion is reflected of the tepid state of the economy both domestically and globally. But this is the environment that we\u2019ll face for a bit longer and we\u2019ll try to offset this with a combination of specific market share initiatives and acquisitions. Moving on to EIS, our Electrical distribution segment, this group ended the quarter down 3% and some of the same factors that impacted our industrial business were headwinds for the Electrical segment as well. Things like the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment, lower defense spending, lower corporate pricing again in the quarter which caused just over 1% in sales growth. The impact of the stronger dollar on our export oriented customers and the overall sluggish economic climate. And these factors we think will persist for a bit longer, but it\u2019s interesting to look at the individual performances of the three segments that comprise EIS. You may recall that the Electrical segment is our largest representing about 40% of the total company revenue, fabrication and wire and cable each represent about 30% and in general fabrication and wire and cable both had positive results in the quarter, but Electrical was down mid-teens. So our challenges are primarily concentrated in the Electrical portion of the business and our folks are working hard to turn this segment around, while at the same time working to maintain the positive results in the fabrication and wire and cable segments. And finally a few comments on Office Products. As reported earlier this segment was down 3% in the quarter with mid single digit growth in the mega channel being offset by high single digit decline with our independent resellers. On the product side, the facility breakroom supply category turned in the strongest results ending the quarter with a high single digit increase and we continue to be pleased with our growth in this segment. The furniture category was even followed by a slight decline in Office Products and a low double digit decrease in technology products. Putting it all together, we\u2019re making good progress in areas like facility and breakroom, overall end market conditions remain challenging for our Office Products team and they\u2019re working hard on share of wallet and market share initiatives across their product categories and their customer base. Additionally, they\u2019re continuing to work on diversifying their business through new product additions and the opening of new sales channels. And we hope to report in the next call that we were able to close on a strategic acquisition later this quarter that will further bolster their diversification efforts. So that\u2019s a quick overview of our non-Automotive businesses and at this moment we\u2019ll ask Paul to cover the Automotive operations. Paul? Paul Donahue : Thank you, Tom. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our Automotive business. For the quarter ending March 31, our global Automotive sales were up 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 4.5% in total Automotive growth which includes an approximately 1% benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 2.5% in the first quarter. Our U.S. team posted a 4% sales increase in the first quarter, an improved performance from the 2% growth we reported in the fourth quarter and the 3% growth we experienced for the full year of 2015. Turning to our international business, which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, this group once again reported another quarter of mid single digit growth in their local currency. Despite challenging local economies, especially in Australia and Canada, we remain encouraged by the consistent mid single digit growth we are experiencing across all of these international markets. In the U.S., our results varied widely by geographical region and product category. Geographically our business in the Florida, Atlantic and Western regions of the country all out performed in the quarter. On the other hand the Central, the Eastern, Midwestern regions of the country all under performed. We would attribute the warmer than average temperatures experienced across the Northern states in February and March is having a negative impact on our business in that region of the country. And as we look at our winter related goods, we saw a similar trend in sales. After experiencing double digit growth in January, our battery business was flat in both February and March. Again we believe warmer than normal weather patterns impacted this segment of our business. So now let's turn to our same-store sales for the first. Our U.S. company-owned store grew same-store sales in the first quarter by 3.6% The cadence of the quarter saw our team post solid results in January with sales moderating somewhat in February and March. is compares to the 3% comp store increase we reported through nine months. Again we would attribute a good bit of this slowdown to the weather as well as the impact from Easter week moving from April in \u201815 to March in 2016. This quarter's 3.6% same-store sales increase compared to a plus 2% in the fourth quarter and was driven by a combination of increases on both our commercial wholesale side of the business as well as by our retail business. So let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in previous calls, we continue to expand or revamp DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. As a reminder these initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extending our store hours, increased training for our store associates, and the nationwide launch of our NAPA Rewards Program to name just a few. We are still early in the process, but we can report the results we\u2019ve seen thus far outpacing our expectations. As previously announced, we\u2019re expanding our initial 20-store pilot which we tested in 2015 to include an additional 150 company-owned stores in 2016. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results. And for the first quarter, we can report a total increase of 3% in our retail business. And we couple this 3% increase with the 6% increase we posted in the first quarter of 2015, it gets us to two-year stack of plus 9%. Our retail initiatives are driving increased transaction accounts and in quarter one, we again saw a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. We can also report a low single digit increase in our average basket size for the quarter. Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business, this segment of our Automotive business posted a 4% increase in the first quarter, an improvement over the 2% increase we generated in the fourth quarter of 2015. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continued to center around our Major Account business as well as our NAPA AutoCare centers. We had a strong quarter with our 16,000 plus AutoCare customers as this business trended up mid to high single digit. On the Major Account front, our team drove sales increases in line with our overall Automotive growth for the quarter. We were also encouraged by the slight improvement in our fleet business, which was up 2% for the quarter and an improvement over the 1% increase we posted in Q4 of 2015. And voluntarily we are working really hard to gain some positive momentum with this important customer group. Our average wholesale ticket value was up low single digit with no benefits from inflation. We were flat in the average number of tickets, although our first quarter performance was improved over a downward trend we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters. So, earlier in my comments, I mentioned our battery business, so now let\u2019s take a look at a few of other product categories and review the trends we experienced in the first quarter. Our brakes business was a highlight again in the first quarter. This category grew low double digits in the quarter and we can also report solid growth in both our tool and equipment business, as well as our filtration business. We are especially pleased to see the growth in our big filter [ph] business. This key product category came under pressure last year as our industrial, energy and our fleet business softened. We hope to continue this trend as the year progresses. We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA Import Parts business. Our underlying Import Parts business was up high single digits in the quarter before the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts, a $25 million business we acquired just past February. We can report good progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we will continue to search for additional acquisitions in this growing segment of the aftermarket. We would also like to update you on the closing of our Covs Parts acquisition on March 1st. As you may recall, we announced in February that we received approval to acquire 21 of their 25 branches. This allows our Asia-Pac business to further expand its market presence and scale in Western Australia. This is an important strategic acquisition for the Asia-Pac team and we expect Covs to generate additional annual revenues of approximately 70 million in US dollars. On the acquisition front, we are encouraged by the ever increasing level of activity in all geographical regions and in all segments of our Automotive business. We are pleased to report today, we will be closing on May 1st on Atlanta, Georgia based heavy duty truck parts business. We would like to welcome the team from Global Parts Incorporated. Global operates six branches in three states and generates sales of approximately 20 million plus on an annualized basis. This business will serve as a nice complement to our growing business in this segment of the Automotive aftermarket. And as we look ahead, strategic acquisitions will continue to be a growth lever for Automotive businesses both in the U.S. and abroad. Now, turning to the trends we\u2019re seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continued to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gain, Miles driven increased 2% January following a strong 3.5% increase in 2015. January marks 23 consecutive months of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gas was $2 in the first quarter, which is down from 240 per gallon in 2015, the second cheapest annual average in the past 10 years. And although gas prices appear to be moving upward in the recent weeks in most parts of the U.S., the current cost of gasoline remains well below last year and these low gas prices should bode well for future increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchase. In closing, we were pleased to show positive sales growth in the first quarter and look forward to building on our growth plans over the balance of the year. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing on our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings, as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. We want to thank our teams both in North America, as well as Australasia for their efforts and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business. So, that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. And at this time, I will hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we will get started with looking at our first quarter income statement and segment information and then we will review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the first quarter were down a 0.5% or up 1% excluding the impact of FX. Our gross profit for the first quarter was 29.7%, compared to 29.8% last year. The slight change in gross profit margin primarily reflects the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our Industrial business. Excluding this factor, we\u2019re pleased with the positive impact of our gross margin initiatives across all of our businesses. On SG&A, the impact of SG&A in the quarter was flat and we had some impact from our cost saving initiatives and just the loss of leverage. So, our efforts to enhance gross margin are especially important in our low inflationary environment. I want to mention what our cumulative supplier price changes are for 2015. We\u2019re down six-tenths of 1% in Automotive. We\u2019re up two-tenths of 1% in Industrial. We\u2019re up one-tenth of 1% in Office and we\u2019re down 1.25% in Electrical. The talking about SG&A, again, I\u2019m sorry about that, our SG&A was $850 million or 23.07% of sales, which is in line with first quarter of last year. So, our cost control measures continued to positively impact our results and they are driving our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. For the first quarter, however, the benefits of our overall cost savings were somewhat offset by the deleveraging of our expenses in our non-Automotive businesses. As we look ahead, our teams remain committed to controlling our expenses and enhancing our productivity and streamlining our operations. We expect to show continued progress on these initiatives as we may have had. Now, let\u2019s discuss our results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the first quarter was $1.9 billion or up 2% from the prior year and 52% of our total sales. Our operating profit of 154 million is up 2% and their margin improved 10 basis points to 8.0. Our Industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 2.5% decrease from the prior year and 31% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $82 million is down 6.8% and our operating margin was down 30 basis points to 7.1%, primarily driven by lower supplier incentives, as well as expense deleverage. Our Office Product revenues were 477 million in the first quarter, down 2.8% and representing 13% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of 34 million is down 6.4% and our operating margin of 7.2% is down 20 basis points. The Electrical and Electronic Group had sales in the quarter of 176 million, down 3.4% and that\u2019s 4% of our total revenues. Their operating profit of 15 million is down 4% and the margin for this group was down 10 basis points to 8.4. For the first quarter, our total operating profit margin was 7.7% compared to 7.8% in the first quarter of last year. This follows a 10 basis point margin improvement in the fourth quarter and for the full-year of 2015 and basically reflects the lack of leverage associated with the sales environment in our non-Automotive businesses. We are intensely focused on continued progress in this area with further margin expansion being a key goal for the company. We had net interest expense of 4.8 million in the quarter and for the full-year, we continue to look for net interest expense to be $21 million to $22 million. Our amortization expense was 8.8 million for the first quarter and we continue to expect total amortization expense to be $36 million to $38 million for the full-year. Our depreciation expense of 26 million for the quarter, we are now projecting for depreciation to remain at 120 million to 130 million for the full year. So, combined depreciation and amortization of 34.7 million for the first quarter and we would expect this to be in the range of 155 million to 170 million for the full year. The other line which primarily reflects our corporate expense was 24.4 million for the quarter compared to 25.1 million last year. For the full-year we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range. Our tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36% which is in line with the first quarter of last year. We expect this rate to increase over the balance of the year and continue to project at 37% tax rate for the full-year. Our net income for the quarter of 158 million compared to 161 million for the last year and our EPS was $1.05 which is flat with last year. Now let\u2019s turn to the discussion of the balance sheet which we continue to further strengthen with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at March 31 was 205 million which is in line with our cash position at year-end and up a bit from 166 million at March 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of 2 billion at March 31 is flat with the prior year and relatively in line with our sales. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with their quality at this time. The inventory at the end of the quarter was 3.1 billion, a 2% overall increase although this is flat excluding the impact of acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels and will continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate level as we move forward. Accounts Payable at March 31 was 3 billion up approximately 14% from last year due to improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We are encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and days in payable. Our working capital of 1.6 billion at March 31 is improved from the prior year and down 67 million on a comparable basis which excludes the reclassification of the 250 million in term debt from long-term to current. Effectively managing our working capital and in particular key items such as account receivable, inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company. Our total debt of 700 million at March 31 is 194 million less than the 894 in March of last year. Our debt includes two 250 million term notes as well as another 200 million in borrowings under our multicurrency credit facility. We would also add that one of the term notes is due this November 30 and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date. Our total debt-to-capitalization is approximately 18% and we are comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe it provides the company both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We continue to generate strong cash flows and following a record year in 2015, we appear well-positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the 900 million to 1 billion range for the full-year and free cash flow which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash includes strategic acquisition, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses and the dividends which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and have increased for 60 consecutive years. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and they\u2019re integral to our growth plans. Thus far in 2016, we have added the Olympus automotive import parts business as well as three additional acquisitions which closed on March 1. As previously covered by Tom and Paul, our Asia-Pac business also acquired Covs Parts with expected annual revenues of US$70 million and Motion added Epperson and Company and Missouri Power Transmission with combined annual revenue of $50 million. For the balance of 2016, we\u2019ll continue to seek acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although, many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on types companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are open minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small assuming the appropriate returns on the investment. Turning to share repurchases, we have purchased 576,000 shares thus far in 2016 and we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best returns to our shareholders. Our investment in capital expenditure was 12 million in the first quarter which is down slightly from last year. For the year however, we continue to plan for capital expenditures to be in the range of 140 million to 160 million, so you will see CapEx picking up over the balance of the year due primarily to the timing of several large projects. Turning to our dividend, our 2016 dividend of $2.63 per share approved by the board in February was a 7% increase from the prior year and is approximately 57% of our 2015 earnings. Was slightly above our stated goal of 50% to 55% payout ratio, we are very comfortable going beyond the stage from time to time due to our strong cash flows. Now that concludes our financial update for the first quarter of 2016. And in summary we operated relatively in line with our expectations, let\u2019s assume fairly steady underlying growth for the Automotive business but in another quarter of challenging economic conditions across our nonautomotive businesses. We manage to offset some of the challenges with key sales initiatives and cost controls and also further improve the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports ongoing investments and opportunities such as acquisitions as well as return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the period ahead. At this point I will turn it back over to Tom. Tom Gallagher : Thank you Carol and thanks to you and Paul for your comprehensive updates. So that\u2019s an overview of the financial and operating performance for the first quarter. And in looking back, our feeling is that our teams did a reasonably good job of operating with the Automotive group turning in the best performance. A lack of revenue growth in the non-automotive businesses did not enable us to gain any operating average unfortunately. Turning to the balance sheet we feel that folks did a pretty good job overall and we look for another strong year in cash generation and asset management. The one area that we continue to be challenged in is sales growth and across all of our businesses, organic growth initiatives and strategic bolt on type acquisitions are getting a lot of attention. And on the acquisition front based upon what we see right now, we think that we\u2019ll have a bit more to talk about in the second and third quarters. Now as far as the reminder of the year is concerned, we feel that previously provided guidance remains appropriate at this time. You may recall that we guided for Automotive revenues to be up 2% to 3% for the full-year against the current 1.8% increase. We said Industrial would be up 1% to 2% compared to 2.5% decrease for the first quarter. Office Products down 1 to up 2 compared to 2.8% decrease in the quarter and Electrical will be up 1 to 2 compared to the 3.4% decrease in Q1. So for the total company we feel that 1% to 2% increase is appropriate compared to the half of 1% decrease through the first quarter. And then on the earnings side, we feel that an expectation of $4.70 to $4.80 per share remains appropriate and this should be up 2% to 4% over the prior year. At this point we would like to address your questions and we will turn the call back to Catherine. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. Tom Gallagher : Good morning, Seth. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Seth Basham : My first question is just on the guidance Tom, could you tell us what your expectations are for FX impact this year and any additional revenue you\u2019re assuming in your guidance from acquisitions? Tom Gallagher : Well, the FX is pretty difficult quite honestly, Seth as you know, we think back to January of this year currency exchange was an even heavier factor, we were down mid to upper double digits in the exchange rates between the Canadian, Mexican and Australian rates. We did see some moderation, some strengthening of the dollar in February and March, but at this point for the quarter it was still double-digit impact and we really don\u2019t have a clear look at what we think is going to happen as we go forward. I think perhaps this thing to say would be that, for the whole company we\u2019ve guided to being up 1 to 2 and perhaps for the whole company FX is going to be a headwind of 1.5% to 2% at this point. As far as the acquisitions, the only ones that we have included in our guidance are the ones that have been completed. So, Paul covered a couple of them. Carol covered a few more. They are the only ones we have included and our practice is not to include anything until we actually close on it. And at that point, we\u2019ll incorporate it into our future guidance if that answers your question. Seth Basham : That\u2019s helpful. Just to confirm relative to your guidance you provided initially for 2016 in February, you assumed at that point in time 3% or 4% sales growth for entire company ex FX and now you are now looking for 1% to 2%? Tom Gallagher : Well, no, we\u2019re looking at 1% to 2% including FX and then 1.5% to 2% headwind from FX, so on a constant currency basis, you would have to add that 1.5% to 2% back in. Seth Basham : Got it. Okay. Helpful. All right, and then my other questions on the auto business, looking at U.S. comps, it seems like they slowed down to your stack basis. Also it seems like your Major Accounts business growth slowed a little bit. I understand I think weather is a drag. Any other factors you can point to that might be impacting your business relative to the industry? Paul Donahue : Seth, this is Paul. No, it just - I touched on many of the factors. Seth, we hate to play the weather card, because at the end of the day we still need to execute on our initiatives. Look, I think our team is doing a pretty good job. But when you look at the delta between our big divisions up in the northern states versus some of our business in the southern states, it certainly had an impact. Our NAPA AutoCare business continues to be solid, very solid. Our Major Account business is good. It\u2019s not growing at the double digit rate perhaps that we saw a couple of years ago, but it\u2019s still growing at a good pace overall. So now, I think, Seth, there is just a bit of sluggishness out there right now, but we\u2019ve got some great initiatives. We just need to continue to execute and I have no doubt that business will bounce back quickly. Seth Basham : Got it. Tom Gallagher : Seth, I\u2019d add to that. If you look at across the spectrum of our larger accounts, the major accounts and the AutoCare customers, those in the northern tier, as Paul pointed out, are having a more difficult time than those in the southern tier. But also those that are more heavily oriented toward tires, are a bit more challenged than those that are more heavily oriented towards the service side. So we will see all that reverse at some point, but we just don\u2019t know when. Seth Basham : Got it. Since you brought up weather as an important point here, if you think about warmer winter weather and the impact on parts stress, would you expect heading into the summer season there to be fewer part failures and more limited parts sales as a result of that? Tom Gallagher : It depends upon how warm and how hot it gets in the summer. That\u2019s going to put the second round of stress and that\u2019s a key determinant. So if we have a hot summer, I think we will see some of the summer related products, heating and cooling as an example, I think we\u2019ll see some pick up there, if we have a modest summer, we won\u2019t get that increased demand. Seth Basham : Got it. Thanks a lot and good luck. Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Seth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thank you for taking my call. My first question is, can you talk about your plan for enhanced store openings and you\u2019re trying to pick it up for the company-owned store group. This is primarily in the U.S. So, is it going to be focused abroad and then ultimately how many stores do you think you could have in the US? Paul Donahue : Yeah, Chris, this is Paul. So, our store expansion program includes all of our markets, so Australia, New Zealand, where we will continue to grow via acquisition as well as organic growth and we believe we have opportunities to continue to grow in both Australia and New Zealand markets. In Canada same thing as well as Mexico, in Mexico, as you may recall, we\u2019ve rolled out our NAPA Mexico initiative, which we have 20 plus stores in Mexico today branded under the NAPA brand both company-owned and independently-owned. We believe and we\u2019re not going to put a targeted number out there, Chris, but we believe we\u2019ve got significant opportunities to continue to grow our store footprint in Mexico. And then in the US, again, same type of initiatives both acquisition, bolt-on type acquisitions as we announced already do this year, but in addition, organic new distribution as well across the U.S. and we think again there is many open markets across the U.S., so we can continue to expand the NAPA brand. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you, then I have one quick follow-up. As I understand it historically more [Indiscernible] facilitator of independents when I look to exit the business, you sell from one independent to the other. Is there any change in philosophy if the company acquires some of these independents or how do you see that playing out? Tom Gallagher : Chris, this is Tom. Our attitude is exactly what it has been and that is if it\u2019s an independently-owned store in an outline market, if there is another independent owner that\u2019s ready to step in and make that acquisition, we\u2019ll help them do that. If there isn\u2019t someone ready to step in, but the current owner has a desire to get out and we\u2019ll buy the store and we\u2019ll run it for a period of time until we find a good independent owner. If it\u2019s in a metro market, we\u2019ll buy the store and we\u2019ll operate it for the long term as a company-owned store. So the attitude is essentially the same. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. Really helpful. Thank you for the comments. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now go to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra : Hi. This is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. Tom, I have a quick question on your Industrials business. So, I just want to understand about the performance in the Industrial segment. It appears that you guys outperformed versus how we saw your peers report in the last week or so. Could you perhaps throw some light in terms of what drove that performance and what was the cadence, because a lot of your peers talked about a very sharp decline in the second half of March. I just want to understand if you guys also saw a dip in March and you know how the quarter trended? Thank you. Tom Gallagher : Well, I\u2019ll take the latter part of the question first. We did see March being the weaker of the three months in the quarter, but still better than what we had been running. In terms of what\u2019s happening within our Industrial business, I think our teams have been working hard on some of their share of wallet and market share initiatives, as well as on the acquisitions we did and had the benefit of the two acquisitions that closed late in the quarter that Carol mentioned. But additionally our folks are finding additional opportunities with existing customers and they are also opening up some new customers. So as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we can look at about half of the business and see that it\u2019s performing pretty well and then we look at roughly the other half and we see that we\u2019re still challenged. So hopefully we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of a turn and maybe the quarters ahead will be a little bit more reflective of what we\u2019ve seen in Q1 and then also early in the month of April. Chandni Luthra : Got it. Thanks for the color. And quickly on the Office segment, so you guys had your business decline by about 3%. I just want to understand how should we think about go forward given that you\u2019ve maintained your guidance and in terms of what gives you confidence to kind of catch up with that guide given that cycling of the ODP, OMX [ph] businesses having some impact to you? Tom Gallagher : Well, in terms of maintaining the guidance, we did say that. We guided to down one to up one for the full year, having finished the first quarter down 3%, we would say may be closer to the mid to lower end of the range for the full year. I did comment in my prepared remarks that we think we have an opportunity to close on a pretty good size acquisition for the Office Products group yet in Q2. It will be late in Q2. That\u2019s not in our guidance at this point. But assuming that we are able to complete that, we\u2019ll give you an update on that as we make our comments at the end of the second quarter. Chandni Luthra : Great. Thank you so much. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will continue on to Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets. Tony Cristello : Thank you. Good morning Tom Gallagher : Good morning. Tony Cristello : My first question, I wanted to just touch on the import parts side of the business and better understand where you are in terms of parts coverage there. It\u2019s obviously growing at - I think you said, Paul, high single digit rate and I wanted to understand is that growth just because you are offering more and more parts. Are you seeing more and more demand from existing or you growing both with the new customer as well. Paul Donahue : Yeah so Tony, great question on our import parts business. So we - look, we have been in the import parts business for some time and we go to market under the Altrom brand we sell here in the U.S. direct through our NAPA network. And where we see continued growth is both existing customer expansion, but also capturing new customers. So our NAPA Auto Care centers are major accounts are servicing more and more import part vehicles therefore they need access to those parts and fortunately they are coming through us. When we look at the continued expansion of that segment we are excited of our core business, the Altrom business going through our NAPA network, but also with our recent acquisition of Olympus and what that group brings us and I think I talked about a bit in our last call is, we got a great team at Olympus they bring us years and years of import experience that is the value to us and this is the category that we think we can certainly continue to grow at the a greater rate than our overall business. Tony Cristello : And do you see the same lift of benefits as your companies stores as you all do or see at your independence when you put in new initiatives or focus on being able to sell through on imports or something, I\u2019m just trying to piece together sort of the success across your whole business versus company-owned versus independent. Paul Donahue : Yeah so Tony, we\u2019ve made a commitment in our company owned stores that we are going to be stocking in import parts and it is a classic parts business in general. If you have the part, you have good people and you\u2019re priced competitively, generally you are going to get the business and what we are finding as we upgrade our inventories across our NAPA company-owned store network business is growing as we upgrade those inventories. On the independent side Tony, it\u2019s been an initiative that we worked on for a number of years as our independent owners. Some have gotten into the business, do a terrific job, others have been a little slower to adapt to stocking in import parts. They may - certainly some of our independent owners are out in more rural markets were they may not be quite at much demand for import parts, but our initiative in growing that businesses both via our company-owned stores and via our independent owners as well. Tom Gallagher : Tony I might just add on, you may recall that our general approach to any new initiative is that we will test it, pilot it in the company store group will approve the concept and then at that point we will go to be independent owners. We want to make sure that what we are recommending to them work so after we approving the concept we will tell them what we did, how we did it, what it cost, what is the returns are and then our good progressive owners will step up and they will embrace the initiative and we go on from there. Tony Cristello : That\u2019s great color. I appreciate that and if I can ask just one more question, I think you mentioned CapEx acceleration and several projects that may be hitting in the second half of the year. Can you provide any were information, is that an IT type spend or there any strong store refreshers or something that we should consider? Carol Yancey : Yeah, it\u2019s both facility refreshes and also an IT project. So mentioning on facilities we have got in each of our segments and both here in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and Australia folks have DC refreshers. So a lot of it is in the area of productivity improvement and so it could be not necessarily a full relocation, but a refresh within the facility. So those are multi-months projects that we know we have started and there\u2019ll be slated for third quarter and fourth quarter and then IT as well we got again, most of our IT projects are going to be in productivity areas were health management, inventory optimization and we have several sights planned for the second half of the year. So those are all in the work, so we expect that to pick up over the balance of the year. Tony Cristello : Okay, thank you very much for your time. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And Mark Becks with JP Morgan have our next question. Mark Becks : Hi thanks for sharing the monthly detail in Auto. Understanding that there is a slowdown as far as the end of the quarter I just wanted to clarify what was the impact from the Easter shift and the labor - leap day shift and then does that help or hurt back half of the quarter. Paul Donahue : Well, Mark this is Paul, we think certainly it was not a help, we estimate and it is hard to put an exact number to it, but we estimates Easter holiday moving from April end of month of March cost us minimum half a point on our top line. Mark Becks : And then any impact from the leap day? Paul Donahue : For sure, the extra day, again estimating between a point of quarter to point half. Tom Gallagher : Ranging between 0.5% and 1% for the quarter at net. Mark Becks : Understood and then Paul you elevated to widening performance gap in the northern stores versus southern stores. Historically some of your peers is focusing gaps anywhere in the range of 500 to call it a 1000 basis points, is there any way you can kind of frame up the difference between say the north-east market which is more the kind of weather sensitive market versus like the South or the West. Paul Donahue : Yeah, I will put it this way Mark, when we look at across northern states and not just the north east because we really felt the impact in the Midwest, when we talk about the Central, Mark, that\u2019s Ohio, Pennsylvania but all the way into the north-east as well. That group and those are some of our larger operations that group grew low single digit, when we compare those to some of our southern division, so I mentioned Florida, I would throw the Southern group in there as well, the Atlantic which should be the Carolina South and then even West that group grew mid to high single digits across, so it was more of a significant delta that helps seen in some time. Mark Becks : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful and then last question for me Tom and Carol you mentioned you\u2019re open to more larger transformational type of acquisitions and historically [indiscernible] you\u2019ve opted for more than smaller bolt-on type acquisition. So just trying to get an idea of historically why that has been the route you have gone by that it is just there is more opportunities of that nature in the marketplace or culture or anything else there. Tom Gallagher : Mark, I will take a stab at that. You have hit on one key point and that is generally speaking there are many more opportunities in that $25 million to $250 million range. Secondly, our philosophy has been that any acquisition we do needs to be accretive and hit the minimum threshold within three years and it seems that we can get to some of the back office synergies more quickly and more easily in the 25 to 150 range than something well above that. And then the third thing is that, we got a general approach that we want to make multiple acquisitions across each of our businesses and spread the investments spread, the risk so to speak, but also to leverage the strong management teams that we have across our businesses. Now with all of that said if we were to find - I think you used the word transformational, if we would find something larger, we would be more than happy to look at it, but it has to meet the same general level of expectation within three years and we look for 15% ROIC no later than the third year, but if we found something large that met that threshold then we would absolutely have interest in doing it. The good point is that we have the balance sheet that will enable us to do whatever and it was set that kind of logic that led us to GPC Asia Pacific, the largest acquisition we have done and one that has turned out to be pretty darn good thanks for the shareholders at Genuine Parts. Mark Becks : Okay. So if you have more to talk about in 2Q and 3Q just it seems like it safe to assume that these will be more of those kind of bolt-on that you are talking about. Tom Gallagher : We just have to wait and see. Mark Becks : Okay, thanks. Tom Gallagher : All right thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go on to Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth Suzuki : Hey guys just a quick question for Paul, looking at the auto business in Texas and other oil related markets you guys mentioned that the broader region underperformed, but do you have data on those markets specifically in terms of their performance year over year in the quarter. Paul Donahue : Yeah, so Elizabeth if I look at our businesses down in the Southwest part of the country and that group was under some stress all last year and if I look at Q1 that group was up low single digits, so certainly on the lower end of our performance amongst our many divisions. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay, great thank you. Paul Donahue : Welcome. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. Carol Yancey : Hi Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : I apologize in advance for kind of stick on this weather things here, but couple of questions. What other categories outside of batteries would you attribute kind of whether gyration is the first question? And then second relate to that I guess winter of 2011 - 2012 is probably the closest comparable that we have to this year\u2019s warm winter weather. So I\u2019m not sure if you have that data in handy or not, but can you remind us of your sales cadence in these types of categories in 2012, how they kind of trended from February to March and into the spring - later spring and summer months. Paul Donahue : So, Scot I will take the first part first and then I\u2019ll let Carol handle the historical data, if she has it. But yes outside of batteries and certainly the entire electrical category Scott, when we look at starters, alternators and including batteries that entire category, which is the big category for us only, grew low single digits in the quarter. Heating and cooling, certainly heating is another area that was impacted, we saw slower than kind of our fleet average growth. And then all of our chemicals in commodities type products were another area that we saw slower than our typical growth or in our overall growth for the first quarter, so all of those categories really can be impacted one way or the other by the weather. Tom Gallagher : It goes even further Scot, if you think about up in your neck of the woods when you got that extreme cold weather, it tends to cause additional puddles up North and through the Central and Midwest parts of the country as well, which in fact potentially can impact some of your chassis product in the ensuing quarter or two so. It is pretty pervasive in terms of what it can do and I should say that we are pretty pleased with our chassis business right now, our chaste team is doing a really good job for us and we are getting some pretty good growth currently from that organization. Scot Ciccarelli : Got you. Carol Yancey : And Scot as far as the weather patterns back in 2011 and 2012 I mean I will have you afterwards, but we are not going to comment or do we have that product line specific cadence in those winter months on how that reacted, but we\u2019re happy to discuss that further. Scot Ciccarelli : I guess the question is just in general, so obviously you\u2019re not going to break all that out by category, but you kind of went from February to March, you already talked about some sluggishness in some of these categories and Paul just referenced them, did they continue to worsen as you go to the latest spring in summer months or did it kind of will get to a level and just kind of stay there and I just trying to figure out. Tom Gallagher : I would take a stab at that first, Scot. This is Tom and I would say that we\u2019ve somewhat stabilized in those categories at this point, but we wish we were stabilized at a slightly higher rate. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay thanks a lot guys. Tom Gallagher : Thank you. Paul Donahue : Thanks Scot. Operator : Thank you. And Bret Jordan with Jefferies has our next question. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning guys Paul Donahue : Good morning Bret. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Bret Jordan : On global project accusation could a give us a little color on what you\u2019re seeing in heavy-duty and maybe how that\u2019s comping relative to passenger vehicle parts and maybe sort of give us a feeling for after this deal how big that is going to be relative to your parts distribution . Paul Donahue : Yeah, so Bret, that\u2019s a business, we don\u2019t talk about a lot, but across North America so US and Canada and in Canada we have got very mature robust business on the heavy duty side it is in our standalone side in excess of $600 million in annual business. It\u2019s a good business, it\u2019s a growing business and there is roughly 8 million heavy duty trucks on the road here in the US and it\u2019s the category that we think we can continue to grow. The acquisition of Global which is Atlanta again much like Olympus acquisition that we did on the import side, brings us a great team, a knowledgeable team experienced team in the category, we believe we\u2019ve got well [indiscernible] synergies and again just bring in another experienced group into our business and we will complement our heavy-duty business here in the Southeast quite nicely. Tom Gallagher : Bret just to add on to that, by our estimation we would have 5% to 6% of the total available market for the heavy-duty industry and if we can grow that to 10%, we\u2019re talking upwards of $0.5 billion to $600 million more in revenue, so that\u2019s part of the strategy. Bret Jordan : How was this business is been comping is that comping ahead of your company average in auto. Tom Gallagher : No, it is actually been - the fleet business it is actually been little bit less than our total Automotive business, but the good news is it\u2019s come back a bit. I think Paul mentioned that we were up 2% in Q1 in our fleet business. So we\u2019re pleased with the fact that it has started to revert back to what is a more normal business. Bret Jordan : Okay and then one last question on comp, when you look at the NAPA core comp, how do you feel that rate was relative to the industry in Q1. Do you think you\u2019re a share gainer or just performing in line? Paul Donahue : Hard to say Bret, being the first guys out, I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re going to be where the market is. We certainly don\u2019t believe we are losing any market share across the country and our teams are executing on the initiatives we put out there for them so. We think we will be in line, hard to say though; we will have to wait and see. Bret Jordan : Okay and then one last question in Mexico are you going to convert the auto total stores to NAPA brand or do they standalone? Paul Donahue : Yeah, great question Bret, that\u2019s something that we are looking at. I was actually down there with the team last week, we have not made a final decision one way or the other, as you may know we have eight auto total stores down in the marketplace and we\u2019re evaluating that right now, but that absolutely could happen in the future and I would also comment Bret because I know you follow it quite closely, our overall business and sales in Mexico continue to grow each quarter, we are building out our team, we are building out our brand, we just added that talented executive to that group down there and we are still bullish with our opportunities down in that market. Bret Jordan : Okay, great thank you. Paul Donahue : Welcome. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Bret. Operator : Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I just want to follow-up on the Easter shift question, make sure I got the math right there and the second one on the margins. If we assume it was 50 or 75 perhaps, should we be thinking that our run rate would simply move that amount of sales in the second quarter from first and Tom when you describe stabilizing trend which number are we stabilizing I guess, is it adjusting for the shift or not or for leap day. And I have a follow-up on margin. Tom Gallagher : My understanding of the question on the trends was more product oriented and that\u2019s where I think we have stabilized in particular product categories. In terms of the impact of Easter we should see the benefit of that in April, we should pick up a little bit more in April that we gave back in March. Greg Melich : So [indiscernible] it would be fair to assume that it should be a little better in April so far than we saw in the first quarter. Tom Gallagher : Well, we will see how it all shapes out and will give you an update on it in our second quarter conference call. Greg Melich : Okay, so I\u2019ll switch to margins then. I think it was Carol, in your comments you talked about how the industrial was the main pressure on the overall gross margin rate, a lot of the other improvement across the business was still there, but Industrial hurt. So I guess my question is what level of sales do we need to get out of industrial so that we actually start to deleverage it on the gross margin side, thanks. Carol Yancey : Yes, so you are correct when we look at gross margin the other three segments are find the pressure on gross margin was through Industrial and so lot of our initiatives are in place and I just mentioned Industrial has done a really good job, therefore gross profit was up in Q4 and was also up in Q1. So they\u2019ve done a lot of things on the buy side and sell side to help get that up. So when the volume does come back and it probably needs to be more in the very low single digit range for us to get some of that OEM and center of that, that\u2019s going to really go straight to the margin, but the good thing is their SG&A improvements and their core gross profits, those things are already in place. And when we do get just a little bit of volume back and the top-line growth then we\u2019ll see that on their operating margin. Greg Melich : That\u2019s great. Thanks, good luck. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Tom Gallagher : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli. Brian Sponheimer : Last and least I get it. Carol Yancey : Hi, Brian. Brian Sponheimer : Hi, Carol. My compliments on the continued working capital improvements and I guess, if you just take APM inventory [ph], it\u2019s $280 year-over-year. Is that coming exclusively from NAPA or is that something that\u2019s really a kind of a holistic entire business approach to working capital. Carol Yancey : So all of our businesses have initiatives in the working capital and specifically focused in the payables area, so we\u2019ve - what I would say just the - more the majority of the dollars are coming from Automotive, we do have improvement coming from the others and I can tell you their teams, it\u2019s backed into our pay plans as part of everybody\u2019s performance, it\u2019s part of what everybody\u2019s pushing down is working capital initiatives and we are seeing some improvements in the non-automotive as well. So the ideas that we have just continued improvements each quarter, but again it\u2019s more coming from Automotive, but we\u2019re getting some from the others too. Brian Sponheimer : I understood and then Paul, just one question. You mentioned brakes being up low double digits in the quarter and some improvement on chassis, how much of that is more miles driven and is there any part of that just better supply from some of your larger on and important suppliers within those product offerings. Paul Donahue : Yeah, Brian, so I answer that two ways, on the brakes business we\u2019ve - our brakes business has been solid now for a number of quarters in a row and that\u2019s across all the brakes, [indiscernible], and Friction, and Caliper\u2019s have all been out pacing our overall growth and I think it\u2019s just a great job by our team out in the field grabbing some market share and we got a great partner on that side. If you recall Brian, a year ago on the chassis side we were having some significant service issues and please to report those are now behind us and we\u2019re seeing that business return back to more normal growth rates, but we were down quite a bit early last year as a result of some of the service problems. So again that\u2019s the business we had to do quite well throughout the first half of the year. Brian Sponheimer : Alright, terrific. Well, thank you very much. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Brian. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We thank you for participating on today's first quarter call, and we appreciate your support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to updating you in July on our second quarter result. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And again ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation.",

Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sidney G. Jones - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company second quarter 2016 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We'll begin this morning with comments from our Chairman, Tom Gallagher. Tom? Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman: Thank you, Sid, and let me add my welcome to all of you on the call this morning. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us. I would start by saying that I've anticipated this call with somewhat mixed emotions. On the one hand, I've been on every one of our calls since we started doing them in February of 2001, so today is my 63rd call, but it's also my last. As you know, Paul Donahue, he was named Chief Executive Officer on May 1, and Paul is only the fifth Chief Executive in our 88-year history, certainly indicative of the management's stability within our organization. I will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board, and as such, I will remain active around GPC. But going forward, Paul and Carol will be doing all of the work on these quarterly calls. And I just couldn't feel any better or more positive about the future of our company with Paul as our President, Chief Executive Officer; and Carol as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer leading the way. These are two very talented and capable executives, and they are highly regarded both inside our organization and externally as well. And they will do a fine job in leading our company and creating shareholder value in the years ahead. With that said, I want to thank each of you on the call for your past and ongoing support of Genuine Parts Company, and I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Thank you, Tom. I appreciate the kind remarks and the ongoing support. I'm both honored and humbled to follow you as CEO of this great company. You've had an admirable 46-year career at GPC, and the performance of the Company under your leadership for the last 12 years has been impressive. That said, working closely with you for the last nine years has been invaluable. And I feel well prepared for this new role, and importantly, the compensation of our management team remains in place to build upon our performance. So thank you, and I look forward to working with you in your role as the Chairman. GPC has a long and rich 88-year history of steady, consistent growth and sound financial, and has been an effective steward of capital. Under my leadership, we intend to build on these achievements over the many years to come. In my first 75 days as CEO, I've taken considerable time to visit with our operations, both around the globe and across our business segment. And I'm more encouraged than ever about the good work being done and the growth opportunities available in each of our businesses. As this quarter would indicate, we have our share of challenges to overcome, but I also believe we can reinvigorate our sales growth in the coming quarters. This is our most critical near-term objective, and I'm committed to making this happen. We will provide more details later on the call to this point. Now, turning to our second quarter, I'll make a few remarks on our overall result, and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full year. After that, we'll open the call to your questions. A quick recap of our second quarter results shows, sales for the quarter were $3.9 billion, which was down 1%. Net income was $191.4 million, down 2%. And earnings per share were $1.28 in line with the second quarter of last year. Total sales in the quarter included a 2% benefit from acquisitions spread across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you'll hear more on our acquisition activity as we review our business results. Currency exchange was still a headwind to our overall results with the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and Mexican currencies impacting our results by approximately 1% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share in EPS. Turning to our Automotive operations, for the quarter ended June 30, our global Automotive sales were down 0.7%, and included approximate 2% benefit from acquisitions, offset by currency headwind of approximately 1.5%. Our U.S. results were down 2% in the quarter which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter, and primarily due to the softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring. While we are not pleased with this deceleration, we would point out that our second quarter sales in 2012, the last year we had similar mild winter patterns, we were also down 600 basis points from the first quarter. So we have seen this pattern before and would expect to see a more normalized growth within the next few quarters as the impact of weather plays out and we execute on our growth initiatives. Our U.S. results varies widely by geographical region with our better performing markets in the Western, Southern and mountain regions of the country. The Central, Eastern, and Southwest regions of the country all underperformed. Again, we would attribute the soft results in the Central and Eastern regions till the mild winter temperatures, and this is evident in the failed transfer of weather-related goods such as batteries, heating and cooling, and ride control products, which were weak through most of the second quarter. We are pleased to report however that our batteries and air conditioning sales recovered significantly with the hot June temperatures, with both up double-digits. In the Southwest, we remain challenged by the ongoing negative impact of the oil and gas sector on fleet and general installer (06:38) business. Same-store sales for our U.S. company-owned store group were flat in the second quarter, and this compares to a 3.6% increase in the first quarter. The cadence of the quarter saw our team post a low single-digit increase in April, likely bolstered by the shift in the timing of Easter, followed by a low to mid single-digit decline in May, and flat results in June. So a mixed cadence with the month of May being our most challenging month. Taking a deeper look into our same-store sales for the quarter, our commercial wholesale side of the business slightly outperformed the retail, DIY business, driving the overall flat same-store sales results. Despite the ongoing DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group, fairly weak market conditions resulted in a slight sales decrease for our company-owned retail sales. We believe however that the current market conditions will prove to be short-lived, and we remain confident in the long-term positive benefits of our retail initiatives. As a reminder, these broad initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extended store hours, increased training for our store associates, and the nationwide launch of our NAPA Rewards program to name just a few. Furthermore, we continue to expand on our retail impact initiative, which was initially piloted at 20 stores in 2015, with plans to implement this concept in 150 company-owned stores in 2016. We are encouraged by the positive impact of these initiatives at our updated stores, with early results exceeding our expectations on both the retail and commercial sides of the business. For the second quarter, our retail transaction counts were down low single-digit, while our average basket size was up low single-digit. Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business, this segment of our Automotive business was basically flat in the second quarter, which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center (8:47) around our major accounts business, and our NAPA AutoCare Centers, and the results for these key customer groups are good measures for the weak market conditions we encountered this quarter. On the major accounts front, sales were down low single-digits, which we believe reflects the challenging sales environment these customers are seeing. Sales to our AutoCare Centers were up low-single digits, driven by the ongoing increase in memberships, now totaling over 16,400 members strong. As an additional point of reference, our fleet business was off slightly for the quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was down slightly with no benefit from inflation, and we are flat in the average number of tickets. Turning now to our import parts business in the U.S., we continue to be encouraged by the strong underlying growth for this business. And with the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts, a $25 million business acquired this past February. We have positive momentum in this category as we enter in the second half of the year. We continue to make solid progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we are excited about the growth prospects for our import parts business overall. Given the positive attributes of this product offering, we closed on another import parts acquisition in Canada on July 1, which we'll cover a little bit later in the call. Also on the acquisition front, we are pleased to report that we closed on an Atlanta-based heavy-duty truck parts business on May 1. Global Parts operates six branches in three states, and with the expected annual revenues of approximately $20 million, it serves as a nice complement to our growing business in the heavy-duty segment of the U.S. automotive aftermarket. Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket, the fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gain. After strong growth of 3.5% in 2015, miles driven increased 2.6% in April, the most recent data available, and is up 3.7% year-to-date. April marks 26th consecutive month of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.35 in the second quarter, well below last year, and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. Before closing out our Automotive review, we want to update you on our international businesses which includes Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand, our core Automotive business is performing well, and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs acquisition and its 21 branches in Western Australia. Likewise, we are excited by the June 1 acquisition of AMX, a Melbourne-based retailer of aftermarket, motorcycle accessories and parts, with four stores and approximate annual revenues of $12 million. Our team in Australia has a multi-year growth plan for this business, which further expands our growing product offering in the motorcycle category. With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has now grown to 527 locations, resulting in net new store growth of nearly 100 locations over the past three years. At NAPA Canada, we continue to produce low to mid single-digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada, and of course the devastating wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta back in May. On July 1, we closed on the acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of original equipment import parts in Canada. Auto-Camping, with 20 locations across Canada, specializes in original equipment automotive parts for the European vehicles, and they sell to foreign repair specialists as well as original equipment dealers. This business should generate approximately $50 million in annual revenues, and much like the Olympus acquisition in the U.S., complements our existing product offering and distribution capabilities for import parts in Canada. Finally, in Mexico, our sales growth continued to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We have 21 NAPA stores in Mexico today, and have plans for additional store growth in the future. We are encouraged by the long-term growth prospects we see for NAPA in Mexico. So in summary, the second quarter proved challenging for our U.S. Automotive business, although this was partially offset by the ongoing strength of our international operation. We believe the weakness in our U.S. sales relates to the impact of mild winter and early spring, and we expect to improve on this quarter's performance as we move ahead. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and major accounts, executing our retail strategy, and driving global expansion via new store openings, as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. Let's turn now to our Industrial business. Motion Industries ended the quarter, down approximately 2% which compares to a 2.5% increase in the first quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions and currency, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 3%, basically unchanged from their adjusted sales decrease in the first quarter. So for the second quarter overall, our Industrial business seems to have stabilized, which is consistent with the industrial indicators we tend to follow such as the industrial production and capacity utilization. With that said, a quick review of our business by industry segment, by top customers, and by top product category shows that the markets remain uneven and choppy. Among our top 12 industry segments, three generated sales increases, seven were down, and two were essentially flat. Looking at our top 20 customers, 15 of them increased sales, while five were down consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. And among our top 12 product categories, we saw six that increased and six that were down, also consistent with the first quarter. So the takeaway here is that our results were quite mixed among our customers and product lines, with solid results in a number of areas, being offset by weaker results and others. We have been operating in this type of difficult and choppy environment since the first quarter of 2015, and as mentioned before, believe we are seeing at least some early signs of a stabilized and industrial economy. This would certainly bode well for a stronger cycle ahead. Shifting to the third quarter and the balance of the year, we will be executing on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth. We remain active with strategic bolt-on acquisitions for this business, and expect to close on a few of these over the balance of the year. We can tell you that effective August 1, we will close on ATCO (16:18), a regional industrial safety product distributor, with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million. Moving on now to our Electrical business, EIS, Sales for this group were down 5%, and remaining challenged by many of the same factors that impacted our Industrial business. Things such as the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment, lower defense spending, lower copper pricing again in the quarter which cost us 1% of sales growth, the impact of the stronger dollar on our export-oriented customers, and just the overall sluggish economic climate. We're expecting to see these factors carry over to some degree for the balance of the year, but it's interesting to look at the individual performance of the three segments that comprised EIS. The Electrical segment is our largest, representing 40% of this group's revenues and sales were down low double-digits. Fabrication was down low single-digits and our wiring and cable business was up low single-digits with each representing another 30% of the EIS business. But certainly, there is room for improvement across the EIS segment and our greatest sales challenges are primarily concentrated in the electrical portion of the business. Looking ahead, our team is executing on its initiative to drive meaningful sales growth over the long-term. And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business which reported a 1% increase in sales for the second quarter, which was driven by a 5% contribution from acquisitions. Sales for the Safety Zone acquired on June 1 represents the majority of our acquisition revenues for the Office business, and we are pleased to report that the integration of this business is progressing very well. By customer group, our mid single-digit growth in the mega channel was partially offset by a mid single-digit decline with our independent resellers. On the Products side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category, or FBS, performed very well in the quarter, while the Office Products segment category was down low single-digits. Furniture was down mid single-digits and technology products were down low double-digits. We continue to make solid progress on our acquisition strategy and the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category. As previously announced, we acquired certain janitorial and sanitation business from Rochester Midland Corporation effective July 1. We expect this business to further enhance our FBS product offering and contribute approximately $20 million in annual revenues. Our Office team will continue to look for these types of strategic bolt-on acquisitions, as well as execute on our ongoing share of wallet and market share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry. We are confident in our growth strategy and look forward to showing more progress over the balance of the year. So that is an overview of our performance by business, and we want to thank our teams across all of our businesses for their efforts day-in and day-out. We appreciate all that they do to make GPC the great company that it is. So at this point, I'd also want to come back to my earlier comment that reinvigorating our sales growth is our number one priority. During this call, we talked a great deal about our sales environment and the execution of our initiatives to drive sales growth. And I thought it might be helpful to pull it all together and outline a few of the key action steps we are taking to achieve this goal. The four building blocks of our growth strategy are comprised of the following : the execution of fundamental initiatives to drive a greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused both on geographical as well as product line expansion; the building out of our digital capabilities across all four of our businesses; and the further expansion of our U.S. and international store footprint. We are confident that our intense focus in these four key areas will positively impact our sales and support the steady and consistent growth we strive to achieve at Genuine Parts Company. Now, I'll hand it over to Carol who will provide a financial update and a full year guidance. Carol? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Paul, and congratulations on your promotion to CEO. It is certainly well deserved and we look forward to the execution of your key sales strategies. And, Tom, I would also like to thank you for your tremendous leadership of the company and, on a more personal level, your guidance and counsel over the years. We will begin this morning with a review of our financials and look at the second quarter income statement and segment information, and then, we'll finish up with a review of a few key balance sheet items. Our total revenues of $3.9 billion for the second quarter were down 1%. Our gross profit for the second quarter was 29.9%, which was equal to the prior year. Our management teams are focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives, and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term. The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively steady, with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through six months in 2016 were Automotive down 0.7%, Industrial up 0.2%, Office up 0.2% and Electrical down 1.3%. Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses for the second quarter were $865 million or 22.2% of sales, which is up slightly from last year, primarily due to this lower sales levels for the quarter. This was partially offset by our tight cost control measures which continue to positively impact our results and drive our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. Now, if we look at the results by segment, our Automotive revenue for the second quarter of $2.1 billion was down 1% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Our operating profit of $204 million is down 2% and the operating margin for this group is 9.7% compared to 9.9% in the second quarter last year. Our Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter were a decrease of 1.7% and 30% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $88 million is down 0.7% and our operating margin is up 10 basis points to 7.6% which is driven by a nice gross margin improvement (23:07). Office Products revenues were $482 million in the second quarter, up 1% and 12% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $33 million is down 5% and our operating margin is 6.8% compared to 7.2% last year. For the Electrical Group, our sales were $185 million in the quarter, down 5% in the prior year and also 5% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $16 million is down 14% and the margin for this group is 8.7% compared to 9.5% last year or down 80 basis points. So for the second quarter, our total operating profit margin was 8.7% compared to 8.9% in the second quarter last year. This basically reflects the lack of leverage as mentioned earlier. With that said, we are intensely focused on showing progress in this area in the periods ahead. We had net interest expense of $4.7 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we currently expect net interest of $20 million to $21 million. Our total amortization expense of $9.2 million for the second quarter, and we would expect our total amortization expense for the full year to be $36 million to $38 million. Our depreciation expense was $26.7 million for the quarter and for the full year, we project total depreciation to approximate $110 million to $120 million. So our combined depreciation and amortization was $36 million for the second quarter, and we would expect the combined number to be in the range of $145 million to $160 million for the full year. The other line which primarily reflects our corporate expense was $26.5 million for the quarter compared to $24.8 million last year. For the full year, we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range. Our tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 36.2% compared to 37% in the second quarter last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings as well as a favorable non-taxable retirement plan valuation adjustment compared to last year. We expect this rate to show a slight increase in the last half of the year, but we are projecting our full year rate to be 36.3% to 36.8%. Our net income for the quarter, as Paul mentioned, was $191.4 million compared to $195.4 million last year, and our EPS of $1.28 was equal to last year. Now, turning to the balance sheet, we continue to further strengthen our balance sheet with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at June 30 was $234 million, up slightly from June of last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our businesses. Accounts receivable of $2 billion at June 30 was up 1% from the prior year, and we continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with our quality at this time. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion, which is actually down 3% when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels and will continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Our accounts payable at June 30 was $3.1 billion, up 12% from last year, due to improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and also our days in payables, and we would add that our AP to inventory ratio at June 30 reached 100% for the first time. Our working capital of $1.5 billion at June 30 continues to show steady improvement from quarter to quarter and is down nicely from the prior year. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, key items such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable remain a high priority for our company. Our total debt is $775 million at June 30 compares to $850 million in total debt last year, and this includes two $250 million term notes, as well as another $275 million in borrowings, under our revolving line of credit. We would also add that one of our term notes is due November 30 of this year, and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 19%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe that it provides the company with both the flexibility and financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may want to pursue. So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of our company. We continue to generate strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we remain well-positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year, and our free cash flow which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash includes strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses, and the dividend. Our strategic acquisitions remained an ongoing and important use of cash for us, and they're integral to our growth plans. Through July 1 of this year, we've added a number of new businesses across our Automotive, Industrial, and Office operations. These are excellent strategic fit for us and collectively, we expect these acquisitions to generate approximately $450 million in annual revenues. Looking forward, we will continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We'll continue to target those bolt-on acquisitions of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range. But we're also open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investments. Turning to share repurchases, we purchased 765,000 shares in the second quarter and 1.3 million shares for the six months. To-date, we have 4.9 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program and the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. Our investment in capital expenditures was $38 million in the second quarter and is $50 million through June. For the year, we're currently planning for capital expenditures to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million, so we expect CapEx to increase slightly over the balance of the year due to the timing of several large projects. Turning to our dividend, our 2016 dividend is $2.63 per share or a 7% increase in the prior year dividend of $2.46. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. So that concludes our financial update for the second quarter 2016 and, in summary, our non-Automotive businesses continue to operate in a challenging sales environment. And in the second quarter, our U.S. Automotive sales were impacted by rather weak conditions. Fortunately, we see these as transitory issues and we look forward to improving conditions as we move ahead. Additionally, we continue to benefit from strong performances in our international automotive operations. For the quarter, we offset some of the market headwinds with key sales initiatives, steady gross margins, and tight expense cost controls. In addition, we further improved the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. Now, turning to our guidance for the full year. On the revenue side, we are maintaining our guidance for total sales to be at plus 1% to plus 2% for the full year. Among our business segments, we are maintaining our Automotive sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3% for the full year, and we're increasing our Office guidance for sales to be plus 2% to plus 3% from the original amount of down 1% to up 1%. We are lowering our Industrial sales to flat to up 1% from the previous plus 1% to plus 2%, and we're reducing the Electrical sales outlook to down 2% to down 3% from the previous up 1% to up 2%. This sales outlook includes all acquisitions that have closed through July 1 as well as the ATCO (32:39) Industrial acquisition that Paul mentioned earlier. On the earnings side, we are updating our earnings guidance to be $4.70 to $4.75 from the previous range of $4.70 to $4.80 for the full year. So this completes our prepared remarks, and we would just close by saying thank you to all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work and commitment to the success of GPC. Paul, I'll turn it back over to you. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Thank you, Carol. A good update on the quarter. So without a doubt, we are experiencing a challenging quarter, and frankly, it has been a challenging six months. But as you can tell from our guidance, we are planning for an improved second half to the year, and our teams are energized to execute on the action steps we outlined earlier. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead. So now, we'll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks a lot. Good morning. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And Tom, all the best to you as you continue to move forward. I have two sets of questions. The first relates to the Automotive business. It was interesting that you talked about June being flat compared to April up slightly even as some of the weather-sensitive businesses really popped with some of the heat that we saw in parts of the country. So can you talk about what's transpiring with other categories and how weather-related softness away from the areas like batteries might be, just sort of how we got to flat rather than an increase with some of the weather businesses surging late in the quarter? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : And are you referencing specifically the month of June, Matt? Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I believe so. I'm talking about the cadence that you... Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Yes. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: ...spelled out where I think April was up low singles, May down low to mid singles, and June flat. I believe that related to your same-store sales number, though I'm not sure. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Yes. So product-related movement we're seeing is, certainly, batteries were soft in the quarter. Ride control was soft in the quarter. However, we saw a slowing in our brakes business in the quarter, which we attribute some of that, we believe, to some of our brakes business probably moved into the first quarter given the warmer temps. On the plus side, we're continuing to see nice growth out of our import lines. We're seeing nice growth out of our tool and equipment categories, but unfortunately, they weren't enough to offset some of the softness we saw in the other categories. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And as we're 20 or so days into a new quarter, any sense of how the current run rate compares to what you saw in June? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Yeah. I would have to tell you July \u2013 Matt, even though we're only a couple of weeks in and it's looking a lot like June. It's choppy is the best way I think I could describe it. The hot weather has to be a benefit to us and we believe with the continuing warm temps we're seeing across the country will be a benefit to us. And related to that, we are seeing those products that are related to the hot temps, products like batteries, products like rotating electrical, and our AC is picking up. So that's why we're cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then, my second question relates to Industrial, and specifically to the margin trends within that business. Historically, the gross was within Industrial, I believe were largely volume-driven and tied closely to volume rebates. You had a quarter where I think the volumes were not quite up to your expectations. The margins was quite good. And, Carol, on the call, you cited gross margins within that business. So any sense of the margin dynamics beneath the surface in Industrial, please. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I guess, and you're exactly right, we certainly have headwinds on the volume incentives in that business. What we've been pleased to see is for the first six months of the year, Industrial's core gross margin has improved, and that's due to a lot of things that they put in place over the last 18 months or so, and it's both on the buy side and the sell side. And those things have been put in place, and it helped (37:19) their gross profit. We had, for the six months, a slight decrease in their volume incentives, but they were flat in the quarter. And additionally, on the SG&A side, they've adjusted their cost structure to be more in line with the revenues. So it's the combination of those things. So I would say that we're really pleased to see what they did in Q2. And we are expecting a slightly better second half for the Industrial business on the top-line. So hopefully, we can maintain that slight margin improvement as we finish out the year. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it and understood. Thank you so much, guys. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks a lot and good morning and best of luck, Tom. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Seth. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman: Thank you, Seth. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: First question is just on the difference regionally between \u2013 well, within the Auto Parts business. If you could provide some color as to how the regions performed through the quarters, the delta between the Central and Eastern, as well as the rest of the business, say from April, May relative to June. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Yeah. It's a bit like we saw in the previous quarter, Seth, the cold weather in the Northern division. So I called out specifically the Central and the Northeast. The delta between those businesses and some of our Southern businesses, our Southeastern, even down into Florida Atlantic, even out West, was a significant gap, we're talking close to 400 basis points, 500 basis points gap between those that are performing well and those that are continuing to be challenged. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. So that's 400-basis-point to 500-basis-point gap. Was that for the full quarter? Or do you see that gap narrow as you moved into June with the weather improvement? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : No. That was full quarter. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. And did the gap narrow in June? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Not \u2013 it's not much. We're pretty consistent throughout the quarter in both the Northern divisions as well as those warmer weather divisions. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, second question is just on major accounts, a slowdown there in major accounts. Can you provide any color on that maybe like you have done for the Industrial large customers, how many up or down or what's driving the slowdown in major accounts, do you lose customers? Just any other color will be helpful there. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Yeah. We stay close to our major customers, as you would imagine, Seth, and have a lot of conversations. Not all of them are down, but I would tell you that we have seen a drop in their business. We discussed with them often how their business is trending. Their tire sales have been challenged and those big tire guys that we do business with. So again, I don't think boy, I can tell you we haven't lost any of our big major customers, and I don't believe we're losing share in any of our major customers. I would tell you that I think our business is the reflection of their business. And I would also share, Seth, that as we look at the Automotive aftermarket, in general, we have had many top-to-top meetings with many of our big suppliers here in recent weeks and months. We do have constant dialogue with our major accounts at our NAPA AutoCare Centers. And again, that sluggishness that we experienced in our numbers, what we hear is all of those parties that we're discussing with it are seeing similar results. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Understood. Best of luck for improvement in the second half. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Thanks, Seth. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Seth. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Hey. Thanks. I want to follow up a little bit on the Industrial business and then SG&A. Paul, you mentioned some signs of stability in the Industrial business, although if you think about the number of categories that were up or down being the same as last quarter and Industrial production seems to be a little bit better than your actual sales growth or organic. What are those specific signs of stability that you're pointing to? Then I wanted to follow up with Carol. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Yeah. So if I look at the numbers, Greg, that we've seen quarter-to-quarter since back in early 2015 where our sales were declining dramatically from one quarter to the next, culminating in an 8% drop in Q4, we rebounded, if you want to call it that, to a low single-digit increase in Q1 and we've seen that again in Q2. So when I say stabilizing, it has stabilized from really the drop that we were seeing \u2013 significant drops that we were seeing in 2015. In talking to our team, our Motion business in Canada has seemed to stabilize and even is showing some slight improvement. We watch very closely our project work. And our project work \u2013 well, the projects are smaller than we would like. They're steady. And the number of projects that we see out there are steady. So we're hopeful and we're starting to see it play out in the numbers a bit at our Industrial business, which also impacts our Electrical that has bottomed out. And hopefully, we'll see a better second half. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Great. And Carol, what was the thing helping you to actually take down SG&A dollars? I mean you did it in the first quarter and in the second quarter. Can we assume that SG&A dollars are down in the back half as well? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I guess there's a lot of activities going on across all of our businesses. We said that each business, a lot of our investments are in technology and productivity. So as we can put in some of these efficiencies, we would be improving our volume per employee, so certainly, looking at efficiencies in distribution centers. Also, you're just adjusting your cost structure to a different level of revenue. So on the Industrial side, and looking at some of their facilities, and looking at their operations, and making adjustments to, say, where we're not going to have business in certain areas and possibly we need to go from three branches to two branches. And so, I think it's a number of projects going on. Our Automotive folks have done a very good job on SG&A, and even with a little softer Q2, they still have some SG&A improvement. So we would expect it to continue. We need to have a little bit better second half, which we're forecasting on the revenue and we would expect these things to stay in place, yes. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : That's great. Good luck. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Thank you. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Greg. Operator. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I had a couple of questions on Industrial. A few of your competitors seem to have referenced furloughs and plant shutdown. Have you seen anything similar or any reason why your customer mix might not be feeling the same headwinds? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : We have, Chris. We're seeing certainly some of the same things I think our competitors and other folks in the industrial world are seeing. If we look at specifically some of the big oil and gas producers which has a big impact on not just our Industrial business, but our Automotive as well. The thought is that and it appears that some of the large oil producers are set to weather their storm. But many of the small oil producers are going under, and I don't know that that's going to change much going forward. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Got you. And then, taking all the context, I mean a 3% organic decline really isn't that bad. Do you think relative to your performance to peers, like what do you think is driving that right now? Is it your maintenance mix versus new equipment? Are there any current growth drivers that you've added that are allowing to take share right now? Like, what are you seeing in that business? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Well, certainly, Chris, some of the new focus product category that we have gotten into in recent years, products like industrial supply, safety supply, material handling equipment, those products and product lines are performing well, and actually, are generating increases year-over-year. Where we're seeing some of the pressure is on the traditional industrial products, hydraulics, bearings, power transmission. But I think that much like our strategy in our Office Products business, as we segue into new categories, growth categories, that's certainly helping our numbers. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Got you. Then, actually, one last follow-up related to that. In terms of Office, I mean obviously, you've done a nice job of diversifying into jan/san and some other growth categories. But what are your core, like, technology office products? How are those performing right now? And is there a point in time where you see that business becomes less of a headwind to your consolidated Office number? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Yeah. Our tech products \u2013 our tech categories were down in the quarter, Chris. And our team is, certainly, focused on getting that back in the plus column, but for now, that is a \u2013 our tech business is a bit of a headwind. Our strategy is I think we've articulated in the past is continuing to drive our overall Office Products business more into the facility, breakroom safety product categories. You're seeing that with most of the acquisitions that we've completed of late, certainly, the most recent being the Safety Zone and the division of Rochester Midland. So we believe that that tech headwind will become less and less of a factor as we move forward. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Got you. Okay, cool. Thank you for the help (48:01). Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : You're welcome. Thank you. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys. If we look at organic revenue growth backing out the FX impact and positive contribution from acquisitions, every business segment was down year-over-year and for Auto, it sounds like you attributed that to weather specifically. Is there anyway to quantify what that growth would have been if weather had been consistent year-over-year and is mid-single-digit growth for the second half of the year achievable for that business? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : I'm sorry, Elizabeth. Are you referring specifically to Automotive or across all four? Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : To Auto specifically. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Okay. So Auto, in the first half of the year, our core Automotive business was actually up 1% and our expectation is that in the second half of the year that we are going to generate low to mid-single-digit growth in our core Automotive business and that does not include the potential assistance we'll get from acquisitions. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : And Elizabeth, if you were to ask me as a follow-up, so how do you intend to do that, I would tell you that we're still very focused on our core initiatives in Automotive. While the quarter was certainly not up to our expectations, by no means are we in a panic mode and going to shift our focus, we have terrific opportunities to continue to grow our retail sales. We are rolling out our top store initiative which will, as mentioned in my comments, will total 150 stores in 2016. We'll reinvigorate our business in our NAPA AutoCare Center, and then, new distribution will be a factor as well. So we're confident we'll drive the kind of numbers that we talked about in the second half. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And do you think without the weather impact, the second quarter might have seen that kind of low single-digit growth in core for Auto? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : One can only assume, Elizabeth. If you look at our first quarter, certainly, we were there. If you look at our previous number of quarters, certainly, we were there. So Q2, we believe, is an outlier, and again, I think that the key initiatives that our team is focused on will get our business back on track in the second half of the year. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks very much. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Thanks for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now move on to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning and congrats, Tom, on all your success as a CEO over the year and Paul, congrats to you and good fortune to you as you move forward as CEO as well. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Thank you, Chris. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : A couple of follow-up questions at this point. So you talked about June flat, July choppy, like June flattish. What's still soft, if you're seeing some of the weather-sensitive business pop, what categories continue to be a drag in performance? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Yeah. As we saw in the second quarter, Chris, it's still some of those same core lines. It's ride control. It's brake business. Our brake business, we have been on a tremendous run over the last six quarters to eight quarters in our brake business, and we're seeing that tail off just a bit. Again, there is nothing that we have fundamentally changed. We haven't raised prices. We haven't changed product categories. So those big categories, ride control, brakes, that's where we're seeing some of the softness which we're certainly trying to outrun with the growth that we're seeing in tool and equipment, imports, and in our temp related businesses. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And so as you \u2013 I guess, do we have to wait around for \u2013 because it sounds like some of that's like, it's corrosion from the winter that didn't happen, it's potholes that didn't happen. And so do we have to wait around for the winter to see improvements like \u2013 forget your initiatives, but maybe just the industry growth rates, do you have to wait around for the winter to see improvements in those categories or is it \u2013 does 2012 suggest that, well, the further you get away, that drag mitigates and you can start to see growth, and maybe later in the third quarter in those businesses? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : I think you're spot on, Chris, with that comment. I referenced in my prepared remarks, what we saw back in 2012, and I do believe that will be the case. But I can assure you our team is not sitting on the sideline, they have a tremendous sense of urgency. No panic, but a tremendous sense of urgency working with our good customers out in the field, certainly working closely with our AutoCare Centers to understanding where they need our support, how we can help them grow their business. So we are intensely focused on getting our growth curve back going in the right direction in Q3, Q4. And as we have projected on our numbers, we do believe that that will be the case. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just to clarify, you mean, as the further you get away from the winter, you can start to see growth as you proceed through the year. You don't have to wait for winter weather to reinvigorate those businesses. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : That's correct. That's correct. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then on July, someone asked about the regional differences in June, is the July acceleration in some of those weather-sensitive categories more focused in the Northern tier of the country? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : I think it's maybe just a bit early to go there, Chris. You had the July 4 holiday where we lost essentially a week. I think it might be a bit early to go there, but I will tell you that the hot temps that we're seeing, heck, I heard St. Louis is supposed to be 100 degrees-plus. That goes across the Northeast. That's going to drive business, and it's going to drive certainly those temp-related products. There's just no two ways about it. We've seen it in the past, and I don't think 2016 will be any different. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then one last clarifying question to your response. When you say, sort of July looks like June, there's no negative calendar impact in there. You're sourcing on the days adjusted business, (54:55) business looks similar, right? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Correct. Yes, sir. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : All right. Thanks, Chris. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Thank you. Congrats, Tom and Paul. Welcome and look forward to working with you as we move forward. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Thank you, Tony. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : I wanted to talk a little bit more about the initiatives you have in place to sort of drive the sales growth, and you laid out some of those related to auto. But if you look across your four segments, and then identify the four sort of buckets that you attempt, whether it's (54:35) or acquisition, or digital, or expansion of footprint, can you sort of maybe give some more color of how you would align each one, and where the most opportunity along those four buckets would be for each one? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Well, certainly, we're looking at strategic acquisitions, Tony, in every single one of our businesses, and I think that in 2016 we've had impactful acquisitions in three of our four businesses. We have activity going in, in all four, but we have closed on deals in Industrial, Office, and of course Automotive. As it relates to specifically expanding footprint, both domestically and internationally, that's really targeted at our Automotive businesses. And as you know, we have new distribution initiatives in place both in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. I mentioned earlier we've had terrific success in our GPC Asia-Pac business, and that's a business we'll continue to grow. As we look at our digital capability, that goes across all four businesses, and we're driving e-commerce initiatives across every one of our businesses. And then, of course, a greater share of wallet which really, that underpins all of our efforts. Again, that growth goes across all four businesses (57:13), and really is that what we need to drive our core growth. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : And then, especially on the distribution side, are you \u2013 as you continue to cross-sell and leverage across each of the segments, some of the SG&A savings, is that perhaps coming from your ability to be more effective across your distribution at all your locations? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : We believe so, Tony. Certainly, as we look at some of the recent acquisitions, the bolt-on acquisitions that we've done, The Safety Zone would fit that category, Rochester Midland, that Jan/San acquisition, we believe we have opportunities to cross-sell and take full advantage of the structure or the infrastructure we have in place. And I would say the same as it relates to acquisitions that we've done in the automotive space, whether it'd be on our import business or our heavy-duty business. We're leveraging that structure that we've had in place for many, many years across all of our businesses. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And I think one thing I may add \u2013 Tony, one thing I may add and you said on just SG&A, we also see opportunities that come on the cost of goods sold side as well. So on these acquisitions \u2013 and we look at the product categories, we're able to take that and leverage across the organization, our total spend. So we'll see that coming from the gross margin side and the SG&A side. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : So it's just a 2016 (58:47) this continue for a period of time beyond as a result of integration and efficiency gain? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Correct. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then last one question. I just want to clarify, what was your revised guidance on the Industrial? Did you say down to flat, is that correct (59:06)? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Our Industrial is going to be flat to up 1% for our new guidance. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Flat to up. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Flat to up 1%. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : All right. Thanks, Tony. Operator : We will now take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. How are you? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Hey, Scot. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Specifically asking about auto at this point, any change in the competitive environment worth noting? There's obviously been a lot of changes in the industry over the last, let's call it, 12 months or so. I think we also kind of generally get the weather impact given the industry's experience in 2012. But there was also a period in 2008 and 2009 where your Auto business started to significantly lag the performance of a bunch of your peers. And if I remember right, it was a function of uncompetitive pricing in a couple of categories. In fact, it may have even been ride control, now that I think about it. So any change overall in the competitive environment? And then also specifically on your pricing relative to the market. Thanks. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Yes. So I would say this, Scot, on the first question as it relates to our competition, we have not seen any major shift in the competitive landscape. I think pricing remains sane across all of our competitors. Look, everybody is scratching and clawing for market share in a challenging environment, but we've not seen any major shift across our key competitors. As it relates to our pricing by product or pricing by product category, I recall quite well your reference to 2008 and 2009, and that did occur and we did adjust, and I think we certainly benefited from it. We don't see anywhere, at this point, where we're an outlier in a particular product category. Our guys do price jobs on a very regular basis. We get input from the field on a daily and weekly basis, both from our stores as well as our independent owners. And there is always the occasional tweak we make here and there based on the competitive landscape, but now I would say, generally we are not seeing any significant change in the competitive landscape. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And Paul, can you remind us how you did wind up in the pricing quandary that you did back in 2008, 2009 because I thought you guys were doing kind of a price scans and competitive pricing general check, if you will, back then as well. I'm just wondering how it wound up gaining (01:01:56) so skewed relative to the market. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Yeah. So I joined the Automotive Parts Group, Scot, in 2009. And if I recall, the shift that occurred, and maybe we were a bit slow on the trigger, was our competitors dropped the prices, and certainly, our retail competitors dropped their prices specifically. We ultimately regrouped, reacted and the business bounced right back, but when I joined in 2009, we were on our way out of that. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got you. Okay. Very helpful, guys. Thanks a lot. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : All right. Thank you. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Scot. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Hey, Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Congratulations to Tom and Paul also. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Thank you Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : You called out the energy market as another region that had some softness, and is that specifically Texas and Oklahoma? Does it spread any further around that range? And then maybe could you compare, you said maybe 400 basis points or 500 basis points spread between the north and the central in the Northeastern markets, versus a strong market comp, could you tell us maybe how the energy market comp compared to the average also? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Yes. So when we look at our energy-related market, Bret, certainly, the first place everybody goes is Texas, Oklahoma and I get that. And certainly, that has been impacted, no doubt, and continues to be. And that's not just in Automotive, we see that in Industrial as well. But we also see it in the fracking regions. So we see it in portions of the Mountain Division. We see it in Montana, Dakotas a bit. We see it in Pennsylvania where fracking was blowing and going here a couple of years ago. And in addition, we also see it up in the oil sands in Canada, certainly Alberta has been a headwind for both our Automotive business in Canada as well as our Industrial business. So yes, not just Oklahoma and Texas, I wish it was. And then \u2013 I'm sorry, Bret, your second question related to the Northern division gap between their numbers and our warmer weather? Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : I was just going to ask you to compare your energy weakness to the rest of the market. You said that the Northern and Northeastern was 400 basis points or 500 basis points spread. I was wondering, if you could sort of give us a feeling for how bad the energy market was relative to average also. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : It's actually \u2013 if we focus in on your opening comments there, Texas, Oklahoma are very similar. It's that 400-basis point or 500-basis point gap. I mentioned Mountain as one of our better performing divisions. So we're able to overcome some of the shortfall in the Dakotas with some strong performance in the Denver area, for instance, that have made up for that. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then a final question, you talked a couple of times about air conditioning or temperature-related products being up double-digits. Are in-stock levels fine there, is demand exceeding supply, or is everything okay in the inventory? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Yes. I will tell you, Bret, on the inventory comment, we are looking at our inventories across our entire business. We have a new predictive modeling engine that we've put into place, and we're looking at our inventories, and especially in some of the categories where we're challenged, and we are pumping up our inventories in some of those categories. Our AC products, we have not had an issue at least that I'm aware of at this point. I think we're well-positioned as we race head long into the back half of the summer. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : All right. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our final question from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli. Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Hi, Tom. Hi, Paul. Congratulations to you both. Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman: Thank you, Brian. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Thank you, Brian. Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Two real quick ones. Carol, another great job on working capital. Was any portion of that attributable to changes in currency? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. Well, there was \u2013 our currency-neutral numbers were smaller this quarter than they have been in the past. But the bulk of that working capital improvement is just coming from accounts payable, and it's broadly all of the segments quite honestly. And then, really, where we saw a nice improvement this quarter was inventory. We had about $85 million source of cash from our inventories this quarter, and that was \u2013 a lot of that came from Automotive. So we were pleased to see additional improvement coming out of inventory, and we feel like we'll have some more in the back half. Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Okay. That's great and encouraging. And then just on getting my numbers right for the NAPA comps, company-owned stores were down 2% in the U.S. Were they down international? Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : They were actually up international. Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Okay. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We had said they were up. So I think Canada was low single-digits, and Australia, New Zealand was mid single-digits. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : And Brian just to clarify one point, you mentioned our company-owned stores, our company-owned stores same-store sales were flat in the quarter. Overall, our Automotive was down 2%, U.S. automotive. Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: That's why I asked. Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much and good luck in the coming months. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Thanks very much, Brian. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Brian. Operator : And we'll now take our follow-up question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Sorry to prolong the call, but I just had felt the need to follow up on Brian's last question. If we think about that delta between the flat comp in the U.S. and the total down 2%, is that lower sell in to the franchise stores or to the network, or some other factor driving that decline? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : No, you've got it. That's exactly it, Matt. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Any sense of their sell-through relative to that decline, or was it that tough to depot back an inventory because that's a bit of a different pace of business from what you're seeing at the company-owned stores? Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : It is. Our independent owners are competing just fine in the marketplace. I don't think there's anything specific to our big independent owners. They did do a little bit of an inventory build towards the end of Q1, which may have had an impact. But no, we don't see, we certainly don't see anything different happening on the independent side from our company-owned stores. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thank you so much. Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President : Thank you, Matt. Operator : And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for additional and closing remarks. Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we would like to thank everyone for participating in today's call, and we look forward to reporting out with our third quarter results. And once again, we like to thank Tom Gallagher for all of his leadership over the last 46 years, and wish Paul all the best. So thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc. Elizabeth Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Operator : Good day and welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sidney Jones : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company third quarter 2016 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full-year. Before we begin this morning please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses. The Company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the Company\u2019s latest SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We\u2019ll begin this morning with comments from our President and CEO, Paul Donahue. Paul? Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and let me add my welcome to all of you on the call this morning. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us. Before we begin our commentary on the quarter, we want to update you on Hurricane Matthew, a powerful and deadly storm which recently hit the coast of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas as well as the Caribbean. This storm inflicted damages in excess of $5 billion and impacted the lives and businesses of countless GPC personnel and our good customer partners. There are many GPC associates, too many to call out today, who were mobilized around the clock before, during and after the storm, providing aid and assistance for those affected. We want to take this opportunity to publicly thank them for their selfless efforts. From an operations perspective, we\u2019ve had a number of facilities and stores closed and/or without power for long periods of time. While most operations are now back up and running, we still have stores in the Carolinas struggling with power outages and floodwaters. So now the real work begins, and our team will continue to support the cleanup efforts and provide assistance wherever and whenever needed. Now earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2016 results. I\u2019ll make a few remarks on our overall results and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full-year. After that, we will open up the call to your questions. So a quick recap of our third quarter results shows; sales for the quarter were $3.94 billion, which was up 0.5%. Net income was $185.3 million compared to $188 million last year, and earnings per share were $1.24 which is unchanged from last year\u2019s third quarter. Our third quarter performance fell short of our expectations. Despite the challenging sales environment, we had planned for improved results for the second half of the year, and we came up short in the third quarter. As we will discuss throughout this call, we are intensely focused on our action plans to drive sales and reduce costs in the quarters ahead. Total sales in the quarter included a 3.5% benefit from acquisitions spread across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you will hear more on our successful acquisition strategy as we review our business results. Currency exchange was neutral to our overall results for the first time in a number of quarters with the slightly favorable Canadian and Australian currencies offsetting the ongoing weakness in the Mexican peso. Turning to our Automotive operations. For the quarter ending September 30, our global Automotive sales were up 1.5%, which has improved from the 0.7% decrease in the second quarter. This quarter\u2019s increase includes an approximate 2.5% benefit from acquisitions and a currency tailwind of 0.5%. Our total U.S. results were off 1% in the quarter and this follows a 2% decrease in the second quarter. This sequential improvement follows a fairly steep deceleration from a solid start to the year when U.S. sales were up 4%. And we would add that September was the strongest month in an otherwise challenging quarter. With that said, we continue to operate in a generally sluggish sales environment, which we believe relates to the ongoing softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring seasons. As we noted on our last call, we had a similar weather pattern back in 2012 and experienced the same type of sluggish demand we are seeing today. What is different is that we had a hot summer across much of the U.S. this year, and we could see that having a positive impact on demand in the quarters ahead. And one final comment here would be that our Eastern, Central and Midwest regions, which benefit the most from the normal winter weather patterns, represent more than 40% of our U.S. revenues and continue to significantly underperform the balance of the country. We continue to analyze multitudes of data and scenarios including the impact of online competition, general competitive and pricing dynamics, trends and transportation, the number of vehicles entering our sweet spot and OE dealer warranties and services, among others. We do not believe that any one of these factors is having a material impact on our business. We have concluded that while it is important to consider each of these factors as we plan for the future. The challenges we are facing today are in fact, transitory. As we anniversary last winter\u2019s mild weather and execute on our growth initiatives in the quarters ahead, we expect to further improve our sales results and ultimately return to our historical mid single-digit growth rates. Turning now to a look at our U.S. company-owned store group. Same-store sales were down 2% in the third quarter, which is in line with our total U.S. sales before the positive impact of acquisitions. This follows flat year-over-year comps in the second quarter and plus 3% to begin the year. DIY and retail sales at our company stores were down mid-single digits, driven by a decrease in transaction counts, while the average basket size was flat for the quarter. While disappointing overall, sales at the stores updated for our retail impact initiative are bucking this trend with double-digit retail sales increases. And while not in enough stores yet to make a mark on our total retail comps, we are confident in the long-term positive benefits of these initiatives. We are on plan to rollout this new retail concept in 150 company-owned stores this year and will accelerate the project to add an additional 300 stores in 2017. The commercial wholesale business at our company stores was down low single digits in the third quarter, driven by low to mid single-digit declines at our Major Accounts and fleet business. Sales to our AutoCare Centers were down slightly, although on a more positive note, we added nearly 500 new AutoCare memberships thus far in 2016 and stand at over 16,000 members today. This is a testament to the overall value of this program to our independent installer base, and we look to this program to be a significant growth driver for us in the periods ahead. Our average wholesale transaction counts as well as ticket value were both down for the quarter. Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers for all our business remain sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11.5 years, lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. Miles driven increased 3.4% in August, the most recent data available and is up 3.1% year-to-date. August now marks 30 consecutive months of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.32 in the third quarter, well below last year and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. We want to also update you on our international businesses which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand and Australia, our core Automotive business is performing well with sales consistently up mid to high single digits. In addition, we continue to see solid contributions from our recent acquisitions and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs and AMX businesses acquired earlier this year. Likewise, we are pleased to report that on September 1, we closed on the acquisition of ASL, a New Zealand-based automotive aftermarket distributor to the commercial side of the industry. ASL operates 15 branches with approximate annual revenues of US$15 million. With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has grown now to 546 locations. This represents an increase of more than 100 net new stores over the past three years. Our leadership team in Asia Pacific continues to operate at a high level, and we see continued expansion opportunities in the quarters ahead. At NAPA Canada, we continue to produce low single-digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada. The July 1 acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of OEM parts in Canada with annual revenues of approximately US$50 million, has been a great addition to our Canadian business. Finally, in Mexico, our sales continue to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We now have 28 stores in Mexico today, up from 21 on June 30, and we have plans for additional store growth in the periods ahead. We continue to be encouraged by the long-term growth prospects for NAPA in Mexico. We have built a solid foundation of international operations, which currently account for approximately 30% of our total Automotive revenues. As we look to the future, we are well positioned for future growth opportunities across these markets. In summary, we faced a challenging sales environment in the U.S. during the third quarter, with these headwinds somewhat offset by the ongoing strength of our international operations as well as the positive impact of acquisitions and new distribution expansion. We look to improve on this quarter\u2019s performance in the periods ahead by expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new-store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. Turning now to our Industrial business, Motion Industries ended the quarter down 0.7%, which has slightly improved from the 2% decrease we experienced in the second quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 2.5% and again, a slight improvement on a sequential basis. As a reminder, this quarter\u2019s results include the August 1 acquisition of OBBCO, a regional industrial safety products distributor with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million. As we have said in recent quarters, our Industrial business has seemed to stabilize, although any signs of a meaningful recovery will most likely occur in 2017. The industrial indices we track, such as industrial production, capacity utilization and the PMI, simply remain too choppy to indicate otherwise. What we do know, however, is that we have seen these cycles before, and we are confident in our sales strategies and ability to generate strong growth in this business when the market begins to strengthen. The question right now is one of timing. A review of our business by industry segment, top customers and top product categories further supports the choppy markets. Among our top 12 Industry segments, our results were consistent with the second quarter, with three sectors up, seven down and two unchanged from last year. And among our top 12 product categories, six were up and six were down, also consistent with last quarter. And finally, among our top 20 customers, 13 were up and seven were down, which compares to 15 up and five down in the second quarter. So the takeaway again this quarter is that our results were relatively consistent with the most recent quarters and remain mixed among our customers and products. With that said, we would add that September was our strongest daily sales month of the year and we are seeing growth across all regions of the U.S. other than in the oil and gas region of the Southwest. The encouraging news out of the Southwest is, while still running negative numbers, they are closing the gap. Additional positive news for the Southwest is the move of oil prices back to the $50 range. We are also encouraged to see the level of exported goods improving from the 6% to 7% declines we experienced in the first half of the year. These trends bode well for the industrial markets. Likewise, we recently announced the October 3 acquisition of Braas Company, a multiregional distributor of products and distribution services for industrial automation and control with estimated annual revenues of $90 million. The growth prospects for this segment of the industry including robotics, motion control and industrial networking are compelling, and the addition of such a well-positioned business will substantially enhance our automation capabilities. So despite our cautionary stance on a near-term recovery, we continue to position this business for strong sales and earnings growth upon a recovery. You can also look for us to execute on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth in the fourth quarter. Moving on to EIS, our Electrical distribution segment. Sales for this group were down 9% due to several factors, some of which are also impacting our Industrial business. A few of the more impactful challenges this quarter include further weakness in our electrical markets, driven primarily by our business with the energy sector including oil, gas as well as coal. We\u2019re also seeing lower copper pricing and the overall effects on demand. It appears these headwinds will persist into the fourth quarter. So as we work through this cycle, we\u2019ll be intensely focused on making the proper cost reductions and improving our efficiencies while also executing on our initiatives to drive meaningful sales growth over the long-term. To that end, on the 1st of this month, we acquired Communications Products and Services, a leading distributor of plant product solutions for both aerial and underground broadband cable and wireless network infrastructure. CPS further strengthens our cable operations in the Western U.S. and should generate approximately $12 million in annual revenues. And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business, which reported a 5% increase in sales for the third quarter. This is improved from a 1% increase in the second quarter, driven by an 11% contribution from recent acquisitions. Our acquisitions including Safety Zone are performing well and contributing nicely to our growth strategy for the facilities and breakroom supplies category. Core sales for the Office business were down 6% in the third quarter, a decrease from the 4% core sales decrease in the second quarter. Primarily, this was driven by weaker sales through the mega channel, which was down low single-digits following mid single-digit growth through the first half of the year. Sales through the independent reseller channel were down mid-single digits, consistent with the declines we have seen all year. From the product side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category, or FBS, posted strong growth in the quarter, while traditional office supplies, furniture and technology products each posted sales declines. This quarter was difficult for us and as you can see in the numbers, but we are confident in our abilities to show more progress in the quarters ahead. Moving forward, we are focused on the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category. Our growth strategy involves strategic bolt-on acquisitions to further enhance our capabilities in this category as well as the execution of our ongoing share-of-wallet and market share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry. So that is an overview of our performance by business. We continue to operate in a tough sales environment, but our teams are working hard in all aspects of our business to overcome these challenges and generate growth in the quarters ahead. Now I\u2019ll hand it over to Carol, who will provide a financial update and full-year guidance. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. We\u2019ll begin with our financial review with a look at our third quarter income statement and the segment information and then we\u2019ll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. As Paul mentioned, total revenues of $3.94 billion for the third quarter was an increase of 0.5%. Gross profit for the third quarter was 30.4% of sales, which is an increase from the 29.8% in the prior year quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by a favorable supplier incentive, product mix shift into higher-margin categories and the benefit of our more recent higher margin acquisitions. Looking forward, we remain focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long-term. The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively unchanged from where we\u2019ve been for some time with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through nine months in 2016 were down 0.7% in Automotive, up 0.4% in Industrial, up 0.2% in Office and down 1.3% in Electrical. Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses for the third quarter were $907 million, up 4% from last year and 23% of sales. Our increase in expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the weak sales environment across all of our businesses. In addition, as we initially integrate our acquisitions into our existing operations, we can experience an uptick in costs. Ultimately, we\u2019re able to eliminate these excess costs and actually reduce our overall cost as we build on the synergies that we create with the combined businesses. We would also add that, with certain acquisitions, their models show higher gross margins, as mentioned earlier, but also a higher operating cost as well, so that\u2019s a factor in the current quarter. In the current sales environment, it\u2019s imperative that we review in detail any expense that we have to ensure we are operating with the lowest possible cost structure. Managing our expenses with tight cost control measures is ongoing at GPC but especially critical today, and we recognize that there\u2019s always need for improvement. Probably the most impactful initiative for us over the long-term is that our businesses are rationalizing their facilities to streamline their cost structure wherever appropriate. This serves to reduce our distribution cost as well as our headcount and payroll-related costs, which are significant expenses for us. Thus far, in 2016, we have closed or consolidated a number of distribution centers and branches, and we reduced our headcount by approximately 1%. Although these steps are meaningful, not all of the savings are in our numbers yet, and importantly, you\u2019ll see many more opportunities for further consolidations. Our ongoing investments in technology, which we\u2019ve talked about for a long time now, are allowing us to do more and more of this type of rationalization while also maintaining our excellent customer service standards. So going forward, you can look for us to continue building a lower cost but highly effective distribution infrastructure across our businesses. Now we\u2019ll discuss the results by segment. Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.1 billion, up 1.5% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Operating profit of $198 million is down 2%, with the operating margin for this group at 9.4% compared to 9.8% in the third quarter last year. This primarily reflects the pressure on our operating expenses due to the decline in our core Automotive sales. Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, 0.7% decrease from the prior year and 29% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $86 million is down 5%, and our operating margin is 7.4% compared to the 7.7% last year. Similar to our Automotive margins, the pressure on the margin for this business relates to the lack of sales growth and its impact on our operating expenses despite good progress with our ongoing cost reductions and facility rationalizations. Office Products revenues were $535 million and 14% of our total sales, up 5% overall but down 6% excluding acquisitions. Our operating profit of $30 million is down 17%, and our operating margin is 5.7%. This group experienced significant pressure on their operating expenses this quarter due to three primary factors, the decrease in their organic sales; the rising cost associated with serving a growing number of sales channels; and incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. The Office team is taking immediate measures to address these areas and drive cost savings in the quarters ahead. The Electrical Group sales were $178 million in the quarter, down 9% from 2015 and 4% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $14 million is down 29%, and the operating margin for this group is 8.0% compared to a 10.2% margin last year. The decline in revenues was difficult to overcome this quarter, but this team is also working fast to reduce their cost and to show improvement in the quarters ahead. So our total operating profit margin for the third quarter was 8.3% compared to 8.9% last year, disappointing but essentially a function of the weak sales environment, which we have discussed, and we\u2019re intensely focused on reducing our cost to drive margin expansion. We had net interest expense of $5.2 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we currently expect net interest expense of approximately $20 million. Our total amortization expense was $10.3 million for the third quarter, and we would estimate total amortization expense of approximately $39 million for the full year. Our depreciation expense is $27.3 million for the quarter and we would expect the full-year to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million. So the combined depreciation and amortization number would be approximately $145 million to $160 million for the full-year. The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $21.1 million in the quarter compared to $34.3 million last year. The decrease in corporate expense primarily reflects the benefit of gains on the sale of certain real estate as well as the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments. For the full-year, we currently expect corporate expense to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. Our tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 36.4% compared to 37.4% last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, and the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment we just discussed, which is nontaxable. For the full year, we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.5%. Net income for the quarter of $185.3 million and EPS of $1.24, which was equal to the third quarter last year. Now we\u2019ll turn to a discussion of the balance sheet, which we further strengthened in the third quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at September 30 was $225 million, a $26 million increase from last year, even as we\u2019ve increased our spending for acquisitions. So our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across each of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of $2 billion at September 30, is up 3.5% from the prior year, and adjusted for the impact of currency translation is up 2%. We continue to closely manage our receivables, and we remain satisfied with our quality at this time. Our inventory at quarter end was $3.1 billion, which is up 6% from the prior year, although it\u2019s actually down slightly when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions as well as currency. Our teams are doing a very good job of effectively managing our inventory levels, and we\u2019ll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable at September 30 was $3.1 billion, up 9% from last year, including a slight benefit of currency. Our ongoing progress in growing our accounts payable reflects improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. This has had a positive impact on our working capital and days in payables, and we would add that our AP-to-inventory ratio stands at 98.5% at September 30. Our working capital of $1.5 billion at September 30 is down from last year and showing steady improvement over multiple periods. Effectively managing our working capital remains a high priority for the Company and we continue to expect further improvement in the quarters ahead. Our total debt of $775 million is unchanged from June 30 and it compares to a $625 million in total debt last year. Our debt includes two $250 million term notes and a new five-year 2.39% $50 million term note that closed in July. We have another $225 million in borrowings under our multicurrency revolving line of credit. One of our two $250 million term notes is due this November and we\u2019ve recently entered into an agreement for a new 10-year note with a favorable interest rate of 2.99%, down from the current rate of 3.35%. Our total debt capitalization is approximately 19% and we are comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We continue to believe that our current structure provides the Company with both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may have. In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We have consistently generated strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we are well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect our cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full-year and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and are integral to the growth plans for our Company. Thus far in 2016, we have added a number of new businesses across each of the four business segments. These are excellent strategic fits for us and collectively, we expect them to generate over $600 million in annual revenues going forward. As we move forward, we\u2019ll continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We\u2019ll continue to target those bolt-on types of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, but we are open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investment. Turning to share repurchases. We\u2019ve purchased 249,000 shares in the third quarter and 1.6 million shares for the nine months. Today, we have 4.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. Our investment in capital expenditures was $37 million for the third quarter and $87 million through September. For the year, we are continuing to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $120 million to $140 million for the full-year. Turning to our dividend. The 2016 dividend is $2.63 a share, which is a 7% increase from the $2.46 per share paid in 2015. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. Now this concludes our financial update for the third quarter of 2016. In summary, our businesses are operating in a difficult sales environment, but our teams are hard at work to overcome these challenges and to generate growth. From top to bottom, we are evaluating the cost structures to drive greater efficiencies and cost savings. We believe these efforts will position the company well for future sales and earnings growth. Now we\u2019ll turn to our guidance for the full-year. Based on our current performance and the outlook for the balance of the year, we\u2019re updating our full-year guidance for total sales to flat to up 1% from the previous up 1% to up 2%. Among our business segments, we\u2019re lowering Automotive sales guidance to up 1% to up 2% from the previous up 2% to up 3%. We\u2019re reducing our Industrial sales guidance to flat to down 1% from a previous flat to up 1%. We\u2019re reducing our Electrical sales to down 5% to down 6% from a previous down 2% to down 3%. We are maintaining our Office sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3%. This sales outlook includes those acquisitions included in our nine-month results as well as the Braas and CPS acquisitions that closed this month. On the earnings side, we\u2019re lowering our earnings per share guidance to $4.55 to $4.60 from the previous $4.70 to $4.75 for the full-year. So this completes our prepared remarks, and I\u2019ll turn it back over to Paul at this time. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. Before we go to questions, I just wanted to add a few additional remarks we feel are important. First, we want to remind you of the action steps we outlined in our last call which are the four building blocks of our growth strategy. These are : one, executing our key initiatives to capture greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; two, an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused on both geographical as well as product line expansions; three, building out our digital capabilities across all four of our businesses; and four, further expanding our U.S. and international store footprint. We are confident that over time, our intense focus in these four key areas will positively impact our sales performance and drive the ongoing steady and consistent growth we look to achieve and our stakeholders expect. Second, we want to assure you that our current performance was not up to our expectations. As we speak, we continue to evaluate our cost structure in all areas of the business to drive immediate savings and longer-term efficiencies. Our goal is to show improved results in the quarters ahead and better position the company for sustainable growth well into the future. As Carol shared earlier, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows to support our efforts. So in closing as we look ahead, we\u2019re excited with the many opportunities we have at GPC and can point to many positive factors fueling our optimism. We operate in four large and fragmented industries with less than 10% market share in each. The outlook for the automotive aftermarket continues to be positive. The industrial sector is showing early signs of a recovery. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, supporting effective capital allocation strategy, our steady track record of increased dividends for 60 consecutive years and, last, but certainly not least, our team of 40,000 dedicated GPC Associates around the globe committed to delivering exceptional customer service. So despite our current challenges, we feel very good about the long-term prospects for growth at GPC. We\u2019ve been operating now for 88-plus years and we\u2019ve been through challenging times before. And as we move forward, we\u2019ll make the necessary adjustments and we will emerge as a stronger company. We look forward to reporting to you on our progress. So with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll now take our first question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning everybody. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Horvers : So wanted to follow-up, start with the September commentary around the U.S. NAPA business and also on the Motion Industries side. Can you put some brackets around that? Is it back to flat? Is it - turn positive? Or was it just simply less negative? Paul Donahue : The Automotive, well, I\u2019ll give you, Chris, the kind of the cadence for the quarter, as I\u2019m sure that will come up. What we saw in our overall Automotive business was predominantly flat in July and August, and then we saw a low to mid single - low single-digit increase in the month of September. So we did see some improvement in September. And while it\u2019s early yet in October, that\u2019s holding a bit. So it gives us a bit of renewed optimism as we head into the all-important fourth quarter. And hopefully, if we get a little winter weather headed our way in November, December that can only further help things. And in Industrial, we\u2019re seeing some green shoots as well. If you look at the indices that we follow, the ISM September numbers were positive, which rebounded from a negative number in August. So we\u2019re starting to see a bit of an uptick in our Industrial business as well. Christopher Horvers : So just to clarify that, that flat in July and August and up low single digits in the month of September, that\u2019s the U.S. business or I thought the U.S. is actually down during the quarter. Paul Donahue : That\u2019s our global Automotive business, Chris. Christopher Horvers : Okay, any particulars around the U.S. business? Did it follow that similar trend? Paul Donahue : Our overall trend in Automotive was if you go - because you had a lot of calendar movement in the quarter with a couple less days in July, a couple of extra days in August. So it was kind of all over the board, but the positive is we did see a more positive trend in September than what we saw in July and August in our U.S. business, so similar trend to our global business. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then as you think about NAPA, I think I was curious at the product category level, was the improvement sort of a lag hot weather repair and maintenance on hot weather-sensitive products? Or did you see more broad-based improvement in some of the more core less weather-sensitive categories? Paul Donahue : No. You hit it right on the head, Chris. The growth that we saw in the quarter was temp-related products. So our Electrical business obviously led by batteries was up mid-single digits. We saw a nice increase in our AC type products. We also saw decent business in our tool and equipment side. Where we\u2019re still seeing a bit of a struggle is some of our under car lines, some of our ride control, heavy duty. And we don\u2019t often talk about it on this call, but our capital equipment business, so things like tire changers, wheel balancers, lifts, that business has been off as well. So to your point, we did see some of the benefits of the hot temps coming out of the summer, and it drove business in our Electrical and AC business. Christopher Horvers : And then last question, as you think about just - as you look into the fourth quarter, do you have concern that the business could actually ebb from here given the improvement? It sounds like it was the hot weather side. Or is it just simply in the comparisons dropped off so much in the fourth quarter that would neutralize that? Thank you. Paul Donahue : Well, you heard the guidance, Chris, and we did take the guidance down a little bit in Q4. We\u2019re comfortable in the range that we told you folks, which is Automotive being up one to up two. Certainly, we\u2019re taking a cautious outlook, and we would hope to outperform. But again, a bit of that is out of our control, so we\u2019ll hope for a little bit of a stronger core business. Christopher Horvers : Understood. Thanks very much. Good luck. Paul Donahue : You are welcome. Thanks, Chris. Operator : And we\u2019ll now go to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Paul Donahue : Hey. Good morning, Seth. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Seth Basham : My first question is just making sure I understand some of the trends in the auto business in the U.S. for the quarter. As I heard you correctly, I think you spoke to 0% comps for company-owned stores, but the total U.S. business that was in the second quarter a negative 2% in 3Q, and total U.S. business was down 2% in the second quarter and up 1% in the third quarter, is that correct? Paul Donahue : Let me see if I\u2019m correct with you, Seth. The 2% same-store sales decline in Q3 in U.S. was accurate. Our overall - let me just pull the numbers, our overall business in the U.S., was down 1% and plus - and then, when you add in acquisitions, acquisitions actually added in a point for us. Seth Basham : Got it. Okay. So if you look at the U.S. business, then you saw company-owned stores doing all that work in the independently owned stores on a sort of daily sales basis. Paul Donahue : No. I think the actual - our store sales in our company-owned stores and our independent owners were actually right on cue with one another. On the same-store sales were both down about 2%, and then you add back in the strength of acquisitions, gets us to your down 1. Seth Basham : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, if you think about the dynamic between ticket and traffic, particularly on the DIFM side of the business, it\u2019s the second quarter in a row that we\u2019re seeing a decline in ticket on the DIFM side. Is that simply due to deflation? Or is there something else going on from a mix standpoint that\u2019s driving that? Paul Donahue : No. I think that - I mean it could be a bit, Seth, but we\u2019re not seeing anything dramatic. Look, we\u2019re in constant touch with our key customers, whether they be the Major Accounts of which we have a real focus on our top five Major Accounts. We\u2019re very close to our - obviously to our NAPA AutoCare centers. Their business is soft, and I think our business is trending with theirs, and the bay counts, as we do our survey throughout the marketplace, bay counts are down a bit on both sides, Major Accounts and AutoCare. So it\u2019s just kind of a soft environment out there right now. Seth Basham : Okay. Now last question for me is just on gross margins. If you could tease out the drivers of benefit a little bit more, which were the biggest drivers of improvement between supplier incentives and the product mix shifts and the acquisitions that would be helpful. We\u2019re just trying to understand the sustainability of that improvement. Paul Donahue : Yes, okay. I\u2019ll let Carol take that. Carol Yancey : Yes. I would point you more, if you think about where we are through the nine months, so we\u2019re up 17 basis points through the nine months. And that\u2019s probably a more normalized where we would expect to be. But in the quarter, what we had is a combination of the factors mentioned. So there was some - definitely, the customer and product mix would be probably a part of it and that\u2019s coming from areas, if you think about what Paul mentioned on the product side and Automotive on the product side, some of the application parts and you\u2019ve got higher margins there, even when you move over to the Office side and the categories you talked about, you have a definite product mix shift there that was positive. And then on the acquisitions, we mentioned that they come with a higher gross margin but they also have higher SG&A and then the increased rebates. I think if you look at the quarter, you would probably say that they\u2019re pretty evenly safe of how they contributed, but I would also point you to more than nine months number to say that, that\u2019s you know hopefully, where we can continue to hold. Seth Basham : Very good. Thanks a lot and good luck. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll now go to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Paul Donahue : Hey, good morning, Scot. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi, just one more sales cadence question and I\u2019m sure the horse is grow at this point, but in the U.S., same-store sales, was September positive? Carol Yancey : Yes, it was. Scot Ciccarelli : Gotcha. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And another housekeeping item. How big were the real estate gain that you booked in the quarter? Carol Yancey : So the fluctuation between the corporate experience - or the other expense, half of the increases related to the real estate gains on several pieces of property and half was related to the retirement plan valuation adjustment. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it, so 50/50. Okay, and then the third question, I guess this is really an opinion at this point, but Paul, you\u2019ve been involved with the NAPA for many years at this point, would you expect better performance from NAPA just given how warm this year\u2019s summer weather was? Paul Donahue : As I said in my prepared comments, Scot, we\u2019re not pleased with where we find ourselves. If there was anything that was a bit of a surprise for me personally this quarter was our core business and you could almost go to all of our business. But certainly, Automotive and Office, the softness that we saw in our core business certainly is concerning and we always expect more out of our teams. So yes, I think that\u2019s a safe comment. We did expect better. Scot Ciccarelli : So do you think there\u2019s any kind of share shift occurring? Paul Donahue : I expected that question, Scot, and I have to tell you that again, as we talk to our key customers, as I was mentioned in an earlier question, we see what their business and how their business is trending, whether it would be with a big national account or with our almost 17,000 AutoCares, and the business climate and the bay count is soft. If we were looking out and seeing a robust business environment with those key customers and key AutoCare centers, I would be more concerned than I am. I do believe what we\u2019re seeing right now in Automotive is transitory. I think we saw it a bit when we came out of 2012 in similar weather patterns. So our expectation, Scot, is that when we get back to - if we get back to a normal winter weather patterns that we will see the rebound in our Automotive business. But no, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re losing share. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. All right. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it. Paul Donahue : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll now go to Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning, guys. Paul Donahue : Hi, good morning, Bret. Carol Yancey : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Hi, can we talk a little bit more about the U.S. trends in the quarter? Really sort of regional dispersion and maybe how we started that out the quarter I guess northern performance versus South and West. And I think you commented that the North was still the weakest, but did the back half close as the quarter progressed? Paul Donahue : It did close, Bret, but I would tell you the trend that we saw in Q3 was much the same as we saw in Q2, which is those big northern divisions which, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, is a large portion of our overall business, so the Northeast, the Central, and I compare those two divisions that are performing well and I have to separate out the West. The West for us is an outlier and it\u2019s an outlier in a good way. Our Western Division business is performing quite well and outperforming all of our other divisions. But if I take the Florida, Southern Atlantic, there\u2019s still - we\u2019re still seeing that 400 basis point to 500 basis point gap between the guys up north and the guys in the warmer climates and - but we did see that begin to close a bit in September, which is encouraging. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then one question on the DIY comp. I think you said it was down mid single-digits, and you said you were sort of examining some - the emerging online competition. Obviously, it\u2019s pretty early for Amazon to be having any real impact given their recent entry in the space. But are you analyzing anything like conversion rates? Or is there any feeling that there\u2019s a competitive shift going on in the DIY market that\u2019s explaining mid single-digit decline? Paul Donahue : Again, Bret, we\u2019re looking at everything, as we always do, in our business, whether it\u2019d be ticket counts and basket size, and we are not pleased with where we find our core retail business. I would tell you that I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re losing share to the online players. That is - I mean clearly, they\u2019re growing their business, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s at the expense of our retail business. But I would mention that where we\u2019re encouraged is where we see growth with our impact stores, the stores that we have relayed and retrofitted to the new look. We\u2019ll have a 150 of those by year-end. We\u2019re seeing double-digit growth there. So it tells me that the retail business is there to be had. We\u2019ve got another 300 stores queued up for 2017 to go to that new look. So we\u2019ll have, hopefully, north of 450 stores in the new format of our - which would be almost half of our company-owned stores by the end of 2017. And our plan then would be we will be able to move the overall needle. Right now with just 150 stores with the new format, it\u2019s tough for us to move the overall retail needle. And I would also mention, Bret, I think that - look, I think the consumer is under a little bit of stress which could be impacting retail across the board. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Paul Donahue : You are welcome Bret. Operator : We\u2019ll now take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Thanks for taking my question. Quick follow-up. Why was California so good? Is that your retail initiative? Or is there something else driving that? Paul Donahue : Our California business I should\u2026 Chris Bottiglieri : West Coast. Paul Donahue : Yes. West Coast, it\u2019s really West Coast. Obviously California is a big, big part of our West Coast business. We\u2019ve been aggressive. Our team has been aggressive out there in conversions, bringing some competitive stores over to the NAPA banner. We\u2019ve done a few bolt-on - small bolt-on acquisitions, but our core business is healthier out there as well, which goes back to - and kind of reinforces the comments that you have to be led to believe that the impact that we\u2019re seeing on the Automotive business is being largely driven by weather patterns because in those warm climates, certainly out west is reflective - the business is okay. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. And then unrelated follow-up. Let me get a sense for as much as you can give us, you kind of answered this on gross margins, what is the inverse of that on the SG&A rate. Can you maybe bifurcate a little bit, tell us how much is kind of integration, one-time costs, that you kind of lap, what are some of the other drivers? I imagine its mix shifting again? And then if you could give us any direction overall, like how much of your - by segment, what your fixed cost structure looks like, trying to get a sense of incremental margins as your sales kind of fluctuates? Carol Yancey : Yes, so I would tell you, the gross margin improvement that we had were across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses. And then at the same time, the SG&A deterioration was in all four of our segments. And when you look at the core sales, the majority of what you\u2019re seeing there is related to the core sales. And where we modeled, where we thought we would be second half of the year, we weren\u2019t quite there. We thought we would be. So we\u2019ve got just - it takes us longer to get those cost out and we\u2019re really adjusting to a lower level of core sales growth. And then I think the other big part of this is the acquisitions that certainly - I mean we\u2019ve made 16 or so acquisitions this year, and all those acquisitions come in, many of them come in with a different cost structure, but certainly accretive on the margin side, but they\u2019re coming in with higher SG&A. And in some, you have some incremental costs when you first have these acquisitions, and it takes up a couple of quarters to get those costs out. So I think all-in-all, the weak sales factor is the biggest thing that\u2019s impacting the SG&A, but I can tell you, our teams are working very, very hard right now to address all of our costs and we\u2019ve done a lot of work on our headcount. We\u2019ve done a lot of work on our facilities. And then you will see the improvements we\u2019ve done, it just hasn\u2019t been enough to offset the decline in the core sales. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. Then I promise one small last one, I hope it\u2019s a small one. The other revenue count seemed to kind of get a little worse this quarter. What\u2019s driving that? Looks like the implication I think to the story. Carol Yancey : Yes. So the other revenue line, that is where we have the impact of our additional sales discounts and incentives. And so when we have the acquisitions that have flowed into the segment sales, with those acquisitions come their additional sales, customer discounts, and so a lot of that increase is related to the acquisitions coming in. So it\u2019s really the growth number is up above in the segments and that\u2019s the net adjustment. Yes, we\u2019ll have a more normalized. If you use the Q3 number, that\u2019s probably going to be our more normal go-forward amount. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. Great. Thanks again for all the questions. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I had a couple of questions. Paul, I\u2019d like to start on some of the breakdowns of what\u2019s been strong or weak. I think you mentioned that fleet in Major Accounts were negative. Were they more negative than the Company? And just remind us what percentage of your sales are in that bucket. Paul Donahue : Well, yes. Thanks, Greg. Those were two challenged businesses for us this past quarter, both down low single-digits. Our Major Accounts business is approaching $2 billion in sales, so it\u2019s a significant part of our overall wholesale business. Our AutoCare center business, which was down slightly year-over-year and I mean very slightly, represents well over $1 billion as well. And fleet, a comment on the fleet. It was down more than the overall business. And again, not surprised, not a total surprise because we have a significant business in the heavy-duty class 6, 7, 8 truck business and we\u2019re seeing softness across that element of our business as well. Greg Melich : Could you speak on that in particular because I think you mentioned ride control and heavy-duty. Are there any shared shifts going on there that could explain that? Or do you think this is just overall demand and I have another question. Paul Donahue : No. I honestly don\u2019t think so. We just spent a day with our heavy-duty team earlier this week, Greg, and we did an acquisition in that space earlier this year. So we\u2019re getting more and more broader in our scope and in our footprint, in our heavy-duty business. And honestly, we think that business is under pressure across the entire heavy-duty industry. Greg Melich : Okay, great. And Carol, I think in your prepared comments, I heard in SG&A there was a real estate sale and a pension valuation adjustment. Could you quantify those? Carol Yancey : Yes, I did earlier. That\u2019s in the other line of corporate expense line. So the delta between last year Q3 and this year Q3, the delta is half related to real estate gains and half related to the pension retirement valuation adjustment, and that is not in the segment margin. That\u2019s in other. Greg Melich : Got it. And the real estate is any of that - is that all just one-off? Or is there any of that, that might occur on, say the pension side if it\u2019s an accrual? Carol Yancey : It\u2019s largely one-off. I mean we have transactions all the time, but there are some more significant ones this quarter, so that\u2019s largely one-off. Therefore, when we gave our guidance for corporate expense for the full-year, you\u2019re going to be back to a more normal run rate. Greg Melich : Got it. And then I guess this is sort of one last question whoever wants to take it. If you think about the change in your guidance for the year, what was the main driver of that? Was it just the business being weaker than expected in the third quarter or what you\u2019re expecting for the fourth quarter? Carol Yancey : Yes. So Greg, it\u2019s a combination of what you said, but the Q3, the weaker sales is the primary driver, which we had that in Q3 and we\u2019re expecting that in Q4, but we certainly factored in what occurred in Q3, but the primary driver is the weak sales, but we took into account the incremental one-time things that we had in Q3 as well. Greg Melich : So you factored in also something lower in the fourth quarter, obviously, but the bulk of it is in the third quarter miss basically. Carol Yancey : Correct. Greg Melich : Got it. Okay. Thanks good luck. Paul Donahue : Thanks Greg. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll now go to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot and good afternoon. Paul Donahue : Hi, good afternoon, Matt. Matthew Fassler : Hi, how are you? I want to slice and dice the Automotive discussion, I guess, one other way. We\u2019ve talked about competition, we\u2019ve talked about weather, we\u2019ve talked about regions. If we think about the Northeast and that part of the country that we thought about as being particularly weather-sensitive, it seems to have been challenged for almost everyone who plays in that part of the country for more than the past year. So for a longer period of time, do you think there\u2019s anything from a demand perspective transpiring in that part of the country that\u2019s impacting the aftermarket relative to the rest of the U.S? Paul Donahue : From a demand perspective, Matt, certainly, it\u2019s interesting to listen to our peer groups and the other players in our industry. And if there is one consistent theme, it is that softness up in that part of the country. I would also - in addition to potentially softer overall demand, I would tell you that in terms of the competitive nature of that part of the country, it\u2019s as tough as any market that we compete in. There\u2019s a lot of players. There\u2019s a lot of strong players, a lot of strong regional players. It\u2019s a competitive market and again we don\u2019t believe we\u2019re losing market share, but it is a challenging market no doubt. Matthew Fassler : If I can ask a second question. If you could recap your disclosure of the pieces of your same-store sales numbers, I want to make sure I heard some of the numbers right. Because I think you talked about a negative two decline overall for company-owned stores in the U.S. and I just want to make sure I understand the components of that to reconcile those to the total. Paul Donahue : Well, Matt, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to want to get into all of that detail, but I would suffice to say that our overall same-store sales, as mentioned, was down two. We had a point that - a positive point through acquisitions which led to our overall U.S. business decline of 1%. Matthew Fassler : I guess I was thinking about the comments you made on DIY and commercial. I think you said commercial down low singles and DIY down a bit more. And I was trying to solve that with a minus two that you discussed. And those might not be apples-to-apples numbers. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get my arms around. Paul Donahue : No, the - and obviously, you know our DIFM business is our bread and butter, and our DIFM business is really what drives our overall same-store sales number. Retail is still an overall smaller percentage, but our DIFM business was down in that very low single-digit number. Matthew Fassler : Got it. And then one final question, very brief one, Carol, you spoke about the international mix of business and the impact on the of tax rate. It sounds like that was only one part of what drove the tax rate lower this quarter. But as we think out to subsequent years given the deals that you\u2019ve done outside the U.S., should that tax rate now be below 37% on a secular basis? Do you see that in your future? Carol Yancey : We probably - to your point, we probably are more in a steady state of probably assuming that there is nothing beyond this point and no tax law changes, we probably are in a 36% to 36.5% rate and that would just assume the same mix that we have today, but it would be dependent on future acquisitions or any tax law changes, but I think you\u2019re right. Matthew Fassler : Great. Thank you so much guys. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Matt. Carol Yancey : Thanks, Matt. Operator : And we\u2019ll go now to Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli. Brian Sponheimer : Good afternoon. Paul Donahue : Hey, good afternoon, Brian. Brian Sponheimer : Just one question and may lead to a follow-up about the balance sheet. You had almost a $200 million increase in inventories on a year-over-year basis and $80 million quarter-to-quarter. Some of that\u2019s obviously coming from your acquisitions, but is any - just a lag from a sluggish sales environment? And how do you see that trending throughout the balance of the year? Carol Yancey : Yes. Actually our inventories are flat when you take out the acquisitions and currency. So we don\u2019t think - I mean the acquisition was a pretty significant number in inventory, so we don\u2019t think there is anything there. But having said that, and certainly if you say we\u2019re pleased with flat, but we also know we have further opportunities with some of this facility rationalizations and some of our productivity improvements to further tighten down the inventory. So that maybe a further source of working capital for us going forward. Brian Sponheimer : Okay. So if I\u2019m just thinking about this, if your total sales were flat and acquisitions contributed 350 basis points there, in an ideal world, your flat year-over-year for inventory, is that 3% number a potential working capital source target as we kind of move forward? Or are these inventory initiatives going to require at least some safety stock as you\u2019d handle them? Carol Yancey : I don\u2019t think they will. And I think, like I said, there\u2019s a lot of initiatives going across all of our businesses, but I don\u2019t think we really have that going forward. Brian Sponheimer : Okay. Thank you very much. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Brian. Carol Yancey : Thanks, Brian. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our last question from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth Suzuki : Hey, guys. Paul Donahue : Hey, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Suzuki : Hi. I just wanted to start with one question about acquisition opportunities, and you mentioned that you\u2019re open to some larger acquisitions in that typical $25 million to $150 million annualized revenue target. How many such larger businesses are there out there that might actually make sense to incorporate into your business? In other words, how fragmented is this industry? Paul Donahue : Well, if you think about our global footprint now, Elizabeth, and you think about four different industries that we conduct business in, there are multiple acquisition opportunities. So when you take into account Asia Pacific, you take into account Canada, Mexico, U.S., and then our Office business, our Industrial business, our Automotive, we look at - as well as Electrical, we look at all of our businesses. And we\u2019ve actually now - we\u2019ve completed 16, 17 acquisitions already this year, and they\u2019ve impacted all four businesses and have been in most every geographical region that we conduct business in. So there is no shortage of opportunities out there. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great, that\u2019s really helpful. And sort of on the reverse side, have you entertained at all the idea of divesting any of the four business segments? Or do you view them all as core and yielding synergies for the total business? Paul Donahue : Yes. So we get asked that question often, Elizabeth. As of today, we\u2019re quite pleased to be in the four businesses that we\u2019re in. We\u2019ve got strategies in the works in all four. We do believe the four; you mentioned the synergies that they bring to Genuine Parts Company. So as of today, we are committed to all four. That\u2019s not to say at any point in time in the future, if we get to a point where we don\u2019t believe either we\u2019re the best owner of the business or that we can grow a business, we would consider divesting that business. We\u2019ve done it in the past. But at this point, we have no plans to do that. Elizabeth Suzuki : All right. Thanks very much. Paul Donahue : All right. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We\u2019d like to thank you for your support and your interest in Genuine Parts Company. Thank you for your participation today, and we look forward to reporting back out with our year-end earnings in February. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

Analysts: Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research LLC Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sidney G. Jones - Genuine Parts Co.: Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2017. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We'll begin today with comments from our President and CEO, Paul Donahue. Paul? Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Thank you, Sid, and let me add my welcome to all of you on the call this morning. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and year end 2016 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance, and then cover the highlights by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for 2017. After that, we'll open the call to your questions. For some perspective on our performance, total sales in the fourth quarter were up 2.7% to $3.78 billion, while net income was $152.5 million and earnings per share was $1.02 compared to $1.07 in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year, total sales were $15.34 billion, which is up slightly, with net income at $687 million and earnings per share at $4.59 compared to $4.63 in 2015. These results represent the total sales and earnings across our Automotive, Industrial, Office and Electrical operations, which we'll discuss in more detail throughout this call. We executed on many of our initiatives in 2016, and we believe we entered the new year as a stronger, more diversified global distributor. And while there is no question the U.S. sales environment was challenging throughout the year, our international operations in Canada, Mexico and Australasia, outperformed the stronger, more positive results. In addition, we continue to build on the revenue and cost benefits derived from the growing scale associated with our portfolio of distribution operations, and we remain committed to further optimizing our enhanced buying power for indirect and direct spend. Together with the shared talent, best practices, transportation, technology, systems and common distribution processes, we expect to derive improved efficiencies, productivity and lower overall cost structure, which would ultimately drive profitability and add value to our end customers. During the past year, we utilized our strong balance sheet to further strengthen the company and generate cash flow. Although we cannot control the weather or the ongoing downturn in the energy sector, we remain focused on our long-term growth targets. This included ongoing investment in our core business and targeted complementary acquisitions that contributed to our performance in 2016 and will continue to enhance our results as we move forward. We have a proven track record as a disciplined and successful acquirer, and acquisitions remain an important element of our growth strategy. In 2016, we invested more than $400 million of capital for 19 new businesses, with estimated annual revenues of more than $600 million. Turning now to more details on our performance by six business segments. We'll begin with our Automotive operations, which were 53% of our total revenues in 2016. For the fourth quarter ending December 31, our global Automotive sales were up 2.4%, improved from the 1.5% increase in the third quarter and our strongest quarterly performance of the year. Comparable sales were up approximately 1%, which has improved from the prior two quarters. For the full year, global Automotive sales were up 1.2%. In the U.S., which represents over 70% of our total Automotive revenues, sales were up slightly in the fourth quarter and improved from the low single-digit declines we experienced in the second and third quarters. This includes essentially flat comparable sales, which we believe is the most meaningful metric in measuring our core U.S. Automotive sales performance. This metric covers 100% of our revenue stream, and over time it will replace any reference to just our U.S. company-owned stores, which represent only one-third of our total U.S. Automotive sales and just over one-quarter of global Automotive sales. With that said, as we make this transition, we also want to be consistent in our quarterly reporting for 2016. So for your reference, U.S. company-owned same-store sales increased 0.5%, and for the full year we're slightly positive. Now turning back to our total U.S. result, the slight increase in fourth quarter sales was driven by a stronger December, and equally positive contributions from our commercial and retail platforms. Our commercial growth in the fourth quarter was driven by sales to our NAPA AutoCare Center customers, which grew to 17,200 members in 2016, an increase of nearly 500 members from 2015. This growth area was offset by slight sales declines to our major accounts and fleet customers, which experienced weaker demand patterns throughout most of 2016. We believe our DIY or retail sales growth in the fourth quarter was at least partially due to December's turn in the weather, which drove increased demand for cold weather parts, like batteries, starters, and heating and cooling products. Our nationwide NAPA Rewards program has now grown to more than 3 million members, and we believe we are seeing the benefit of that as well. Lastly, as part of our retail impact initiative, we rolled out 166 updated retail concept stores in 2016, exceeding our goal of 150. As a reminder, this initiative includes things like installing all-new interior layouts and graphics, extending store hours, and increasing training for our store associates. Although small on the overall scheme of total sales today, these updated stores continue to produce low double-digit retail sales growth. This steady uptick in sales gives us confidence in the long-term positive benefits of this initiative and we are on plan to accelerate the project with an additional 300 stores in 2017. Now moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers for our business remain sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11.5 years. Lower fuel prices remained favorable for the consumer, and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. Miles driven increased 4.3% in November, the most recent data available, and is up 3% for the 11 months. November marked 33 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.34 in the fourth quarter and just $2.25 for the full year; positive indicators for further increases in miles driven, and ultimately driving additional parts purchases in 2017. So now let's turn to our international Automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada and Mexico. Combined, these operations account for nearly 30% of our global Automotive revenues and, as we mentioned earlier, these operations outperformed with an 8% local currency increase in the fourth quarter and for the year. In Australia and New Zealand, fourth quarter sales improved by low double digit, driven by solid comparable sales growth, as well as the benefit of acquisitions. In total, the Asia-Pac business expanded their footprint with 52 new stores in 2016, and we see opportunities for further expansion in the future. We are also encouraged by the generally favorable economic conditions in this region, as well as solid fundamentals, such as a growing car park driven by record car sales, relatively low gas prices, and upward trends in miles driven. At NAPA Canada, sales held steady with low single-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. This team performed fairly well, given the tough conditions in 2016, and we anticipate a more favorable overall sales environment in 2017. Similar to the U.S. and Australasia, the total vehicle fleet is growing due to the record new vehicle sales and gas prices remaining at historically low levels. These fundamentals bode well for NAPA Canada's continued growth prospects in 2017. Finally, in Mexico, our sales grew low double digits as well, as we expanded our NAPA Mexico footprint to 33 total stores during 2016. We have plans to add additional stores in the periods ahead and are encouraged by the long-term growth prospects we see for NAPA in Mexico. We were pleased to close the year with improved Automotive sales results in the fourth quarter. While we made progress in the U.S., we intend to build on these results and we are encouraged as we move ahead in 2017. Furthermore, we expect continued strong results in our international Automotive operations, which have performed well for us. For 2017, we remain focused on expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and major accounts, executing on our retail strategy, and continuing to drive global expansion via new store openings, as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. So now let's turn to our Industrial business, Motion Industries, which represents 30% of our total revenues in 2016. Industrial was up 4% in the fourth quarter, which has significantly improved from the 1% decrease in the third quarter and also our strongest quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, comparable sales were up slightly, which has much improved from the decrease in comparable sales in each of the prior six quarters. For the full year, Motion sales are essentially unchanged from 2015. We are encouraged by the early signs of strengthening market conditions for our Industrial business, as evidenced by the year-end uptick in indices, such as the Industrial Production and the PMI numbers. In addition, the energy sector is making progress in its recovery, with the increase in rig counts translating into much improved sales to this sector. Lastly, the level of exported goods continued to improve from the 6% to 8% declines we experienced in 2015 and the first half of 2016, an especially positive sign for our equipment and machinery customers in the OE sector. Each of these trends bodes well for the overall industrial marketplace. Today the question is more of the sustainability, as these indicators have been quite choppy over the last several periods. That said, we entered 2017 encouraged by the prospects for stronger industrial sales. A review of our Motion business by industry segment, product category, and top customers further supports our fourth quarter improvement. We saw an increase in the number of sectors generating positive sales gains, with food processing, aggregate and cement, pulp and paper, and oil and gas, all out performing. It's worth pointing out that oil and gas improved from a double-digit decline in the third quarter to a double-digit increase in the sales in the fourth quarter, so solid improvement for this sector in just one quarter. And we had more of our product categories and top 20 customers generating sales increases in the fourth quarter, so positive trends across the business, which we expect to build upon in the quarters ahead, both organically and via strategic acquisitions. Moving on now to EIS, our electrical distribution segment. Sales for this group were basically flat in the fourth quarter and much improved relative to our results in the first three quarters of 2016. Total EIS sales were down 5% for the year and were 4% of the company's total revenue. The market served by EIS closely follow those at Motion, so our fourth quarter included a sequential improvement in comparable sales, as well as the accretive benefit of the CPS acquisition in October. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our initiatives to drive meaningful sales growth at EIS over the long-term. And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business, which represents 13% of the company's 2016 revenues. The Office group reported a 4% increase in sales for the fourth quarter, driven by a 12% sales contribution from acquisitions in the facilities, breakroom, and safety supply category. Total sales for the year were up 2%. Excluding acquisitions, comparable sales were down in the fourth quarter due to the decline in sales through our independent reseller and mega account customers. Sales to these customers were partially offset by the increase in sales to e-tailers, as well as our growing FBS distribution channel. On the product side, sales in the traditional office supplies, furniture and tech products, each posted sales decreases. Offsetting these declines was a substantial growth in our FBS category sales, which we have expanded to diversify our overall products and service offering. FBS sales were 31% of our total office sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus just 20% in 2015. As we move ahead to 2017, we remain focused on the continued expansion of our FBS business, including strategic acquisitions, as well as key initiatives to grow our overall share of wallet and market share across our product categories and sales channels. So that recaps our consolidated and business segment sales results. And in summary, we're pleased that the fourth quarter was our strongest quarterly sales performance of the year, with improved comparable sales trends in the Automotive, Industrial and Electrical businesses, relative to the second and third quarters of 2016. Generally, we believe that we operated in more favorable market conditions as the fourth quarter progressed and our teams were in position to capitalize and post improved results. In 2016, we executed on several of our initiatives to overcome the challenging sales environment and position the company for sustainable long-term growth. A few of the highlights include, strong growth in our international Automotive operations, 19 strategic acquisitions that enhanced our product and services offering, effective asset management that further strengthen our balance sheet, key capital expenditures and IT investments, including digital, to support future growth and distribution efficiencies, and finally, return of capital to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. So with that, I'll hand it over to Carol, who will provide a financial update and our outlook for 2017. Carol? Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with a financial review of our fourth quarter income statement and the segment information. And then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items, and finally I'll provide our outlook for 2017. As Paul mentioned, total sales in the fourth quarter of $3.78 billion were up 2.7%, including a 1% decrease in comparable revenues. For the full year, total revenues of $15.34 billion were up slightly and also include a 1% decrease in comparable sales. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 29.9%, up 17 basis points from the fourth quarter in 2015. For the year, gross margin is 30%, up 16 basis points from 2015. This improvement was primarily driven by the combination of product mix shifts to higher margin categories and also the benefit of our higher margin acquisitions, which is partially offset by lower supplier incentives. Overall, we were encouraged by our gross margin expansion in 2016 and, as we look ahead to 2017, we remain focused on further enhancing our gross margin for the long-term. The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively unchanged from the prior quarter, with deflation in the Automotive and Electrical segments, and just slight inflation in Industrial and Office. Our supplier price changes in 2016 were negative 0.7% in Automotive, positive 0.4% in Industrial, positive 0.3% in Office, and negative 1.2% in Electrical. Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses for the fourth quarter were $895 million, up 7% from last year and 23.7% of sales. For the year, total expenses of $3.5 billion were up 3% from 2015 and 23% of sales. The increase in operating expenses as a percent of sales primarily relates to the deleveraging of expenses across our businesses for most of the year. We also increased our spending for planned IT investments and experienced cost increases in areas such as insurance, legal and professional. Lastly, we had increased cost in 2016 related to those 19 acquisitions, which we would expect to eliminate as we further integrate these businesses into our existing operations. As we mentioned earlier, several of these acquisitions also operate with higher gross margin and higher operating cost model, so this impacts our SG&A comparison as well. To offset these increases, we've implemented enhanced cost control measures and we're focused on assessing the optimal cost structure for our businesses. As we mentioned in our last call, our businesses are rationalizing their facilities to streamline their cost structure, where appropriate, which serves to reduce our distribution costs, as well as our head count and payroll related costs, which are significant expenses for us. In 2016, we consolidated or closed several DCs and branches, and we expect to see these savings in our future results. We also see more opportunities for further consolidation ahead. Our investments in technology, which we noted earlier were stepped up in 2016, are allowing us to do more and more of this type of rationalization, while also maintaining our excellent customer service standard. So you can look for us to continue making progress towards a lower cost and highly effective distribution infrastructure across our businesses in 2017 and beyond. And looking at our results by segment, our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $2 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $160 million is down 5%, with the operating margin for this group at 8% compared to 8.7% in the fourth quarter last year. And this is primarily due to the deleveraged expenses due to our U.S. sales results. Our Industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 4% increase from 2015. Operating profit of $81 million is up a strong 12%, and their operating margin has improved to 7.0% compared to 6.5% last year. This segment benefited from a favorable product mix shift, as well as progress with their ongoing cost reductions and facility rationalization. Our Office Products revenues were $476 million, up 4%, including the benefit of acquisitions, which contributed nearly 12% to sales. Operating profit of $20 million is down 40% and their operating margin is 4.2% due to a variety of factors, including the decrease in organic sales, as well as rising costs associated with serving a growing number of sales channels, including e-tailers. The Office team is working hard to drive significant cost savings in this business, which we realize needs to happen soon. The Electrical/Electronic group sales were $177 million in the quarter, which is flat from the prior year. Our operating profit of $15 million is down 4% and the margin for this group is a solid 8.7% compared to 9.1% last year. This team has also been working fast to reduce their facilities and related costs, and we believe these savings will begin to flow through their results in 2017, so we're encouraged by that. So our total operating profit for the fourth quarter was 7.3% compared to 7.9% last year, and for the full year is 8% compared to 8.4% in 2015. Not the margin expansion we look to achieve each year, but we recognize the need for improvement and we're focused on driving cost savings and improved margins across our businesses in the future. We had net interest expense of $4.8 million in the quarter and $19.5 million for the full year. We currently expect net interest expense to increase slightly in 2017 in the range of $21 million to $22 million. Our total amortization expense of $12.5 million for the fourth quarter was $41 million for the full year. We estimate total amortization expense of approximately $43 million in 2017. Our depreciation expense of $27 million for the quarter was $107 million for the full year. For 2017, we expect total depreciation to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million. So our total depreciation and amortization combined would be approximately $160 million to $170 million for 2017. The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $23 million for the quarter and $95 million for the full year. In 2017, we expect corporate expense to increase slightly to the $100 million to $110 million range. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 35.5% compared to 38.4% last year. For the full year, our tax rate was 36% compared to 37.2% in 2015. The reduction in the rate for the quarter as well the year is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, and also more favorable non-taxable retirement plan valuation adjustment. In 2017, we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 36.0% to 36.5%. Net income for the quarter of $152.5 million and EPS was $1.02 for the quarter, and for the full year our net income was $687 million and earnings per share of $4.59. Now I'll turn and discuss the balance sheet, which we further strengthened in the fourth quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at December 31 was $243 million, a $31 million increase from 2015, even as we increased our spending for capital expenditures and acquisitions. Our cash position remains strong and it continues to support our growth initiatives across each of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of $1.9 billion at December 31 is up 6% from the prior year, and this reflects our stronger sales in the month of December. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion, which is up 7% from the prior year, primarily due to acquisitions. Our teams effectively managed our inventory levels, and we'll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable at December 31 was $3.1 billion, up 9% from 2015, due to the ongoing benefit of improved payment terms and acquisitions, as well as other payables initiatives. At December 31 of 2016, our AP to inventory ratio was 96% compared to 94% at December 31 of 2015. Our working capital of $1.7 billion at December 31 was a slight increase from the $1.6 billion in the prior year. Effectively managing our working capital remains a high priority for the company and we expect to show continued improvement in the quarters ahead. Total debt of $875 million at December 31 compares to $625 million in total debt in 2015. The increase is primarily related to the 19 acquisitions we made during 2016. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 21%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We continue to believe that our current structure provides the company with both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may choose to pursue in the future. So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We generated strong cash flows in 2016, with cash from operations at $946 million and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, at $399 million. In 2017, we're planning for another strong year of cash flow and we would expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range, and our free cash flow would be approximately $400 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. These includes strategic acquisitions, which Paul covered earlier, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses, as well as the dividend. We purchased 420,000 shares of stock in the fourth quarter and 2 million shares for the full year. We've also purchased another 60,000 shares thus far in 2017, and today we have 4.2 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead, as we believe our stock still represents an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. Capital expenditures were $74 million in the fourth quarter and $161 million for the full year. For 2017, we're planning for capital expenditures in the range of $145 million to $165 million. Turning to the dividend, yesterday our board of directors approved a $2.70 per share annual dividend for 2017, which marks our 61st consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. This is a 3% increase from the $2.63 per share paid in 2016, and it's approximately 57% of our 2016 earnings. So this concludes our financial update for the fourth quarter and the full year, and in summary, we operated an overall challenging sales environment throughout most of the year. But our teams worked hard to overcome these challenges and we were in a position to take advantage of the improving marketing conditions in the fourth quarter. Moving forward, in 2017, we're focused on driving greater efficiencies and cost savings, and this is a critical objective for us across our businesses and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress. Now turning to our guidance for 2017. Based on our current performance and our growth plans for 2017, as well as the market conditions we see for the foreseeable future, we are establishing our full year 2017 guidance as follows. Total sales would be in the plus 3% to plus 4% range, including the carryover benefit of our 2016 acquisitions, but no future acquisitions, and net of a slight headwind from currency translation. Comparable sales growth is projected to be plus 2% to plus 3%. By business, we would expect Automotive and Industrial to be up 3% to up 4% in total sales growth, Office to be up 2% to up 3% sales growth, and Electrical to be up 1% to up 2% sales growth. On the earnings side, we would expect our earnings per share to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.80 for 2017, which represents a low to mid-single-digit increase from the prior year. We would also add that this full year earnings growth will likely be weighted towards the third and fourth quarters of 2017. So with that, we would just close by thanking all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work and commitment to the future growth of the company. And at this time, I'll turn it back over to Paul. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Thank you, Carol. As we enter 2017, we remain committed to our global growth initiatives, which include the execution of fundamental initiatives to drive greater share of wallet with our existing customer base, an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused on both geographical as well as product line expansions, the building out of our digital capabilities across all four of our businesses, and the further expansion of our U.S. and international store footprint. We remain confident that our ongoing focus in these four key areas, along with our initiatives to drive significant cost savings, will positively impact our future results and produce the steady and consistent growth we look to achieve each year. So with that, we'll turn it back to Dana, and Carol and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Good morning. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Hey. Good morning, Chris. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So why don't you \u2013 a couple of questions. So you mentioned the cadence of sales are weighted to the back half. Thinking about NAPA and Motion in particular, do you think they build up relatively evenly from the fourth quarter of this year into the back half or do you expect some bumps along the road and specifically around NAPA? I mean, obviously, you talked about a good December. Weather hasn't been as great here in the first quarter, and then you've got the tax refunds that others have talked about. So trying to get some understanding on how to think about those two divisions. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Yeah, so two things, Chris. One is our comments about the back half of the year were more specific to the earnings. So we were more commenting on the plus 2% to plus 5% in earnings, we would expect to see more of that in the back half of the year. Then the second thing is, you spoke to (32:34) sales, Q1 last year was our strongest quarter. So as you think about that, I would just take that into account, but then knowing that quarters two, three, and four were more similar. And then you specifically called out Industrial, and I would just mention with the Industrial, again, we saw great improvement in their sales in the fourth quarter. So the guidance that we gave you for them, those sales increases would be pretty even across the quarters in 2017, unless we see something outside of our control in the economy that we're not anticipating. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: And, Chris, just staying on Industrial for a minute. If you look at all the macro numbers, as we look at them, whether it be the ISM number, rig counts, we're seeing significant improvement. We've been through these cycles in the downturns in Industrial before. And it does feel \u2013 and we see it in both Motion and our Electrical business, that these two businesses are now poised for much better growth in 2017. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. And just to clarify that, that 1Q strongest quarter, that was a reference to NAPA, correct? Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Yes. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So a segue to Motion. So as you've consolidated facilities, you've invested in technology, how should we think about the long-term margin potential of the business? After the crisis, you got back to an 8.1% operating margin. Before the crisis, the prior peak, I believe, was 8.4%. So how do you think about what's the potential earnings power sort of in a peak state, and then the time to get back to that? Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Yeah. So a couple of things there is, you're right, they've closed over 50 branches and a couple of distribution centers. They've done a terrific job on the cost side. And as we have mentioned before, they had an impact of lower volume incentives as it related to this business. So as this business picks up, you do see the margins coming back and we've seen some nice improvement in their core gross profit, and then they've got some acquisitions coming in. So I would just mention, we always have a stated goal of improvement each year in operating margins. As far as the bounce back and the range, I mean, for all of our businesses, we still target the 8.5% to 9% for operating margin. I wouldn't necessarily expect that within 12 months, but I think you're going to see a nice bounce from them. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I guess asked another way, between the acquisitions and the costs that you've taken out of the business, did you create a structural potential that's higher than you've seen in prior peaks? Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: I wouldn't say higher than what we've seen in prior peaks. I mean, remember, they're just at 7.3% right now. So, I mean, we've got a ways to go. But 8.5% would be a really nice margin for them. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, very nice. Understood. Thanks very much. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Thanks, Chris. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks a lot and good morning. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Good morning, Matt. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'd like to get a little more. I know you've probably covered this in kind of a fragmented way as to why you'd expect the earnings to be second half weighted more so than the sales, if sales are fairly even. Just talk about what it is moving the margins around that will work more to your benefit in the second half of the year? Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Well, really, if you look at from the cost structure, I mean, we've said it takes a bit of time for us to get those costs out, and look, we're not happy with where we ended up the year in fourth quarter. We've got more work to do in SG&A. I mean, when we look at what we've done in terms of facility rationalization, when we look at our head count, when we look at our cost structure, freight, legal and professional, insurance, I mean, there is wage pressures. So we've just got to work hard at continuing to get those costs out, and that's not a quick thing that happens in just a quarter. So that's why we're giving a little bit of the earnings to say it will probably be more back half loaded. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then the second question, obviously, tuck-in acquisitions and some bigger ones have been a pretty consistent part of the story over the past several years. Can you just clarify, other than the dividend, what kind of free cash flow deployment you have baked into the guide? Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: So, our \u2013 what we have assumed in our cash flow guidance that we gave was very similar to what we had this year. So we would have an amount set aside, if you will, for of course the dividend, the CapEx number we gave you, share repurchases of a similar amount, and then for acquisition. So you can count on the 1% to 2%-ish on acquisitions in terms of revenue, so that's modeled into our cash flow guidance. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Matt, we were very active in 2016 with 19 acquisitions and $600 million in annualized revenue, quite a bit more active than we were in prior years. It's difficult to say, this is generally a long process, when we look at businesses and partnering with businesses. So you just \u2013 it's hard to gauge, because you just never know when they're going to come along, when the right one is going to come along. But I will tell you that we will remain active, not only across all four of our businesses, but across all of our geographical regions as well. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just to be clear, does that $4.70 to $4.80 include any buyback or any acquisition that is new buyback or new acquisition in 2017? Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: No, it would just be the normal ranges that we've discussed. So we have not \u2013 the acquisitions that have already taken place in our numbers in 2016, and then roll into 2017 is what's contemplated in our guidance. But in the earnings guidance, it would just be a normal buyback. So that's usually around 1%, 1.5% of our shares. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you so much, guys. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Thank you, Matt. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Thanks. I \u2013 two questions. First, I'd start with the business and particularly the inflation/deflation trends and, Carol, you give us a nice update for last year on each of the businesses. What are you thinking \u2013 or seeing this year when you plan your guidance for inflation or deflation by business? Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Well, so we just finished our fifth year of deflation on the automotive business. And I can't say we're planning for anything much different than that. In the other businesses, this was definitely much lighter than normal year. So we're not really planning for much. But, look, there are so many unknowns out there in the economy right now and certainly with new legislation, some of the trade and tax issues that are being thrown about, we don't know what will come. But right now we're contemplating a similar number in 2017 for inflation, which would not be much. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Okay, great. And then second one is a little more big picture. If you just take your guidance this year, that sort of low to mid-single-digit EPS growth, I think now it's a couple of years where you've been at slower growth than the normal objective, which is high single digits. And I guess the question is, has something changed in the business or what \u2013 do you think this is cyclical or secular or how should we think about that? Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Well, I think in the \u2013 one of the things that we've assumed for this year is core growth of 2% to 3%. So, as you know, in distribution business, core growth of 2% to 3% makes it very difficult for us to leverage or to have margin improvement. So that's why we're giving kind of an earnings number of plus 2% to plus 5%. But certainly know that we're not happy there and we've got a lot of work we're doing. So I don't think it's anything more than just probably a lower level of sales growth, but we would still expect \u2013 and again, our long-term objectives are still to have a much higher core growth, and more like a 4% to 6% going forward. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Got it. So if the top-line was mid-single-digit, you'd still see the earnings at the high single-digit? Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Yes. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Right. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Yes, we would. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Yeah, we haven't \u2013 Greg, we haven't come off our long-term objectives on the number side. But based on what we see today, we believe that the guidance that we provided is achievable, but I can also tell you that our team is focused on not only reaching that guidance, but absolutely exceeding it this year. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Great. Good luck. Thanks. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Thank you, Greg. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Thank you, Greg. Operator : We'll go next to Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Hey, Bret. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Good morning. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : A question on the fourth quarter. I guess, if we look regionally, I mean, obviously, some of those northern markets that were soft got better. But could you talk maybe sort of southern, western and northern markets and maybe what the dispersion of results was, like what the spread between the strongest and the weakest markets were? And then maybe a little bit on product category strength, anything that was a particular outlier. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Yeah. Let me \u2013 I'll take the regional question first, Bret. First and foremost, I'm very pleased to tell you that every one of our regions we saw improved sales results in the fourth quarter and we also saw that gap narrow from what we had seen in Q3, and even a little bit into Q2 we saw that gap narrow by about 100 basis points. So we're still \u2013 our strong regions are still in the South, but I can tell you we see improved results in the Midwest and we saw improved results in the Central part of the country as well. So that December blast of cold definitely helped. This January warm temps are not helping us a whole lot, but that is what it is. Your second question, Bret, regarding product performance, our best performing categories, and probably not surprising, in Q4 were anything related to engine and electrical systems, so battery, starters, alternators, all performed well in Q4, filtration performed well. Some of the \u2013 where we saw a little bit of downturn within some of our T&E, tool and equipment, especially on some of the large equipment and some of our paint categories were off just a bit. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Anything \u2013 I mean, I guess, as you think about the larger tool category, is that sort of a real shift in the consumer side there or any thoughts about that? Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: No, I don't think so. Bret, I think it's timing. We have a robust tool and equipment business, and I think it's more one of timing. I don't think there is anything that changed dramatically in Q4 that would have impacted those sales. I think we'll see that rebound in Q1 going forward. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then one question on your 2017 outlook for Auto growth of 3% to 4%, how does that stack up U.S. versus international? Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: We would be stronger on the international side than the U.S. That assumes core growth of 3% to 4% as well. We've got a little bit of a currency headwind built-in and a little bit of acquisitions. But I think you're going to see similar, with a little stronger growth internationally, similar to what we had this year, little stronger internationally than the U.S. side. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Yeah, I would just reinforce Carol's comments, Bret. We continue to be very bullish on our international operations, and that's really all of them, Australia, New Zealand. We think we have expansion potential in those markets. Mexico, we will continue to expand our footprint there. In Canada, despite a challenging environment out West, our team up there had a good year. Where we need to turn it up is here in the U.S. and absolutely our team is focused on getting that done this year. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay, great. And then one last question. On Motion, you called out oil and gas as having double-digit improvement in the fourth quarter. Are we seeing some structural change you think in that space or just the bar got low enough that we had a good quarter? Are we calling a turn in oil and gas? Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: I'm sorry? Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Are we calling a turn in the oil and gas? Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Well, I'm not sure I'm ready to go there. All I know is, where we were a year ago in the depth, Bret, where \u2013 we're double the price of a barrel of oil today than we were a year ago. Rigs are coming back online and we're seeing a lift in that Southwest \u2013 we do a big business down in the Southwest and we're seeing a nice lift across that part of the country really in all of our businesses. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: All right. Thank you, Bret. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Thanks, Bret. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one \u2013 first clerical one and a clarification. Do you have any currency movements and M&A activity for the non-Office segments? I don't think you gave it out this quarter. And then two, just wanted to confirm what your definition of a comp is for your non-Automotive. Are you measuring it by branch, like maybe just talk high level what your comp number means for your business? Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Well, I'll take comp first, and then let Carol address your first question. So as we're identifying and defining comps, Chris, we're excluding new stores, new branches, or new stores, branches closed over the past 12 months, and we're also excluding acquisitions. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Got you. Okay. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: And you specifically asked about FX in the quarter for the non-Automotive? Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Well, I mean, like I say, if you have \u2013 I think in the past you've given out the FX impacts and you've given out... Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Yeah, there... Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : ...the M&A impacts for each segment. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Yeah, there was virtually no FX impact in the quarter. It was just negligible. And the acquisition impact in the quarter, it was around 2% for Automotive, and it was around 4% for Industrial, and it was around 11% for Office, and then Electrical was 1%, so in total we were about 4%. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, very helpful. And then just quick high-level question. Given the improving \u2013 I mean, you were extremely acquisitive in 2016, which was nice to see. How do you think about the backlog right now that industrial sentiment's improving and probably just global sentiment around the markets right now, are you having a harder time kind of building the acquisition pipeline? Have you seen any changes in your conversations, anything to think that your pace of M&A might slow near term? Thank you. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Yeah. It's a great question, Chris. I will tell you that we have a robust acquisition pipeline in really across all four of our businesses and, as I think I've mentioned earlier, in all of our geographical regions. I think what we're seeing is that in some parts of our business, when we do an acquisition, and I'd point out one that we did in Industrial with the acquisition of Braas in Q3 of last year, what that brings us is additional players in that space. When they see that GPC is, one, that we're acquisitive, and two, that we're a good partner, we have more and more some of these folks coming to us as opposed to us tracking them down. So we feel good about our prospects for 2017. I mentioned earlier, we did 19 acquisitions last year. I don't know that we'll be at that level of activity, but we certainly expect to be active again in 2017. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thanks for your time. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: You're welcome. Thank you. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli. Brian C. Sponheimer - G. research LLC : Hi, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in here. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: You bet, Brian. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Good morning, Brian. Brian C. Sponheimer - G. research LLC : Just a question on NAPA. You're not the only one today who reported some margin degradation there and you're not getting the comp leverage, but I'm just curious about the pricing environment relative from a competitive standpoint and then also any pressure or pushback from the manufacturers themselves. Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: No, what we're seeing has been fairly typical of recent years, Brian. The pricing across the marketplace is rational and we're not seeing \u2013 and our supplier partners are partnering with us as they always have. We're not seeing any significant shifts there either. Brian C. Sponheimer - G. research LLC : Okay. All right. Terrific. Just conversations with suppliers, if we were to have a situation where there is some sort of border adjustment tax that was really draconian for the industry by nature, any talks with them about potential onshoring or areas that you could speak to? Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Well, I would say it's probably premature. We have \u2013 it's early to have discussions with suppliers about what changes they are going to be making, what changes we're going to making. I think we're all taking a bit of wait and see to see what ultimately happens. I think, as we think about this, what amount is going to be borne by the supplier, what amount is borne by us, what amount passes onto the customer, I think in theory, a lot of this is probably going to end up being passed onto the consumer and in terms of inflation and what we see in the cost of products. But we have not started. Again, it's early to be having discussion with what changes may happen in the supply chain. But know that we will work with our suppliers and hopefully come up with the best solution that we can. Brian C. Sponheimer - G. research LLC : All right, terrific. Much appreciate it and good luck in 2017 Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.: Thank you, Brian. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: Thank you, Brian. I appreciate it. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the conference back over for any additional or closing remarks. Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.: We want to thank you for your participation in the call today. As always, we thank you for your support of Genuine Parts Company and we look forward to reporting to you in Q1. Thank you. Operator : Again, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sidney Jones : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company first quarter 2017 conference call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We'll begin this morning with comments from our President and CEO, Paul Donahue. Paul? Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and welcome to our 2017 first quarter conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today we released our first quarter 2017 results. I will make a few remarks on our overall performance, and then cover the highlights by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2017. After that, we'll open the call to your questions. So to recap our first quarter performance, total sales were up 5% to $3.91 billion. Net income was up 1% to $158.9 million and earnings per share increased 3% to $1.08 compared to $1.05 in the first quarter last year. These results represent the total sales and earnings across our global Automotive, Industrial, Office and Electrical operations, which we will discuss in more detail throughout this call. We entered 2017 a stronger, more diversified global distributor, and to that point, our diversification continues to provide complementary benefits as we are not only able to share and implement best practices on the operating side and leverage our infrastructure, but our diversity allows us to better insulate across the board -- across a broad platform. This supports our ability to drive sustained growth and generate strong cash flow even when faced with challenges in certain businesses. A recent example is the solid progress we have made the last few quarters in our industrial distribution business and in our international auto business. This quarter, we drove strong sales growth in these operations while working to overcome the headwinds at our U.S. auto business. As part of our comprehensive strategy, we remain committed to four key growth initiatives including the execution of fundamental initiatives to drive greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused on both the geographical as well as product line expansion; the building out of our digital capabilities across all four of our businesses; and lastly, the further expansion of our U.S. and international store footprint. Our progress in these areas drove sales increases across all four of our business segments, and our 5% total sales growth was the strongest quarterly sales increase since the fourth quarter in 2014. And while we made progress, we are even more encouraged by the prospects for further improvement in our sales performance for the balance of the year, both organically and with ongoing complementary acquisitions. With that said, thus far in 2017, we have acquired businesses with approximately $140 million in annual revenues that will contribute to our results to the balance of this year. We'll share more on this initiative as we cover each of our segments. So let's begin with our automotive operations which were 51% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2017. For the quarter, our global automotive sales were up 3.4% from last year and improved from the 2.4% increase in the fourth quarter of 2016. Comparable sales on a global business were up approximately 1.5% or 1% with our international businesses delivering 4% comparable sales growth. Total sales for our U.S. operations which continue to represent over 70% of our total automotive revenues, were up 1% in the first quarter including a 1% decrease in comparable sales. Both the commercial and retail platforms were down slightly, reflecting the headwinds of another mild winter season and overall challenging sales environment that persisted through the first three months of the year. On the commercial side of the U.S. business, sales to our NAPA AutoCare Centers were up 2%, driven by the growth in new members, while sales to major accounts and fleet customers remained under pressure. Sales were most challenged in the heating and cooling and under car categories which correlate to the warmer-than-average winter weather across much of the country during the quarter. This was especially true in January and February with the exception of pockets of more normal winter temperatures in the northern Rockies and Northwest. These regions outperformed the balance of the country. We remain energized by the many opportunities we have to strengthen our retail business. These include leveraging the long-term growth potential for our NAPA Rewards Program, now at 4 million members and growing; continuing the roll out of our retail impact initiative which includes installing all-new interior layouts and in-store graphics; extended store hours; and increased training for our store associates. We are planning for more than 450 of these stores by the end of 2017 and although small in the overall scheme of total sales, the stores updated for this initiative continue to produce low double-digit retail sales growth. Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket; the fundamental drivers for our business remain sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow, the average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11.6 years. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continue to post substantial gains. Miles driven increased 1.9% in February, marking 36 consecutive months of increases in miles driven and is up 2% year-to-date with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.48 in March, and although up from last year remains relatively low compared to gas prices in 2010 through 2014. As a result, we expect to see further increases in miles driven and, ultimately, additional parts purchases in 2017. The first quarter was our most difficult compare of the year in the U.S. and we expect to see improving sales trends as we move through the quarters ahead and, in particular, the second half of the year. This was generally our thinking going into 2017, and to this point, we see this playing out accordingly. We remain focused on expanding our business with our key commercial programs, NAPA AutoCare and major accounts, executing on our retail strategy and driving footprint expansion via new store openings and strategic acquisitions. We continue to pursue accretive additions to our business, and to that end, we announced earlier this morning the acquisition of Merle's Automotive, a 15-location Automotive Group based in Tucson, Arizona with approximately annual revenues of $45 million. Merle's is a dominant player in this market and enhances our store footprint and competitiveness in the Arizona marketplace. We are excited to welcome the Merle's team in NAPA and look forward to their positive contributions to our overall growth. Now let's turn to our International Automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada and Mexico. These operations account for nearly 30% of our global Automotive revenues and delivered combined total sales that were up 8% including a 4% comparable sales increase in local currency, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016. In Australia and New Zealand, first quarter sales grew by high-single digits, driven by solid comparable sales growth and the ongoing benefit of our 2016 acquisitions in this region. The Asia Pac business operated with 56 additional stores in the first quarter of '17 relative to the same period last year and we see opportunities for further expansion in the future. In addition, the underlying fundamentals for the aftermarket remains solid including a growing car part driven by record car sales, relatively low gas prices and upward trends in miles driven. At NAPA Canada, total and comparable sales increased in the mid-single digits range which was slightly stronger than in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe this reflects a positive impact of a more favorable overall sales environment across Canada relative to 2016 due at least in part to the improving energy sector in Western Canada. In addition, positive industry fundamentals such as a growing vehicle fleet and historically low gas prices bode well for the future of the Canadian aftermarket. All in, our growth prospects at NAPA Canada remain positive over the balance of 2017. And finally, in Mexico, our sales grew by low double digits for the second consecutive quarter. We continue to expand our NAPA Mexico footprint and today have 33 total stores with plans to add additional stores in the quarters ahead. So looking back on the quarter, we are pleased with our International Automotive sales performance and expect continued strong results from these operations over the balance of the year. Now let's turn to our industrial business. Motion Industries represented 31% of our first quarter total revenues and was up 6.9% in the quarter. This has improved from the 4% increase in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is also our strongest quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2014. Comparable sales were also much improved, up 3% from last year and also up from the slight increase reported in the fourth quarter. Our strength in industrial sales appear to reflect the positive impact of more favorable market conditions. Broad-based industrial indicators such as the industrial production numbers as well as the purchasing managers index continued to improve during the quarter, and the energy sector made further progress in its recovery. Rig counts are now up nearly two times the count in March of last year which is a real positive for our customers depending on the oil and gas sector. Likewise, the level of exported goods continues to improve, a positive sign for equipment and machinery customers in the OE sector. A review of our Motion business by industry sector, product category and top customers further supports our first quarter growth. We saw an increase in the number of sectors generating positive sales gains with food products, aggregate and cement, iron and steel, and oil and gas, among others, all outperforming. In addition, each of our primary product categories generated positive sales growth in the first quarter and our Top 20 customers improved their collective sales from mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 to high single-digit growth this quarter. So on a product, customer and market basis, the industrial business had a solid first quarter and we look to build on this sales performance as we move forward in the year. I'd like to take this opportunity to update all of you on a recent investment in the Inenco Group which we announced back on March 30. Inenco, a Sydney, Australia-based industrial distributor was founded in 1954 and today is one of Australasia's leading industrial distributors of bearings, power transmission, fasteners and seals. Inenco currently has 161 locations across Australia and New Zealand, as well as an emerging presence in Asia, specifically Indonesia and in Singapore. For perspective, Inenco is currently generating annual revenues of more than AUD400 million. Effective April 3, we purchased 35% of this company much like we did in 2012 with our original investment in Exego, the automotive business we now refer to as GPC Asia Pacific. And in the same vein as our Asia Pac acquisition, we expect to eventually acquire the remaining stake in Inenco. The Inenco investment was attractive to us on many levels. It offers us significant growth opportunities at our core industrial segment, as well as the potential for significant synergies with our existing industrial business in North America and our Australasian automotive operations. It offers us the opportunity to build on our presence in Australasia while also serving as an entry point to Southeast Asia which has been of interest to us for some time. It allows us to expand outside of North America, enjoying with the leading industrial distributor in the large very fragmented and growing Australasian marketplace. And finally, it allows us to align with an experienced and talented management team led by Kevin Clark and Roger Jowett in a business with a long and successful history, world-class supplier partners and extensive and diverse customer base. But we're excited for the future of the industrial business in Australasia and are confident this investment will serve to benefit our shareholders over the long-term. Now moving on to EIS, our electrical distribution segment; sales for this group were up 5% in the first quarter and much improved from the flat sales results in the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, comparable sales at EIS grew 2.5%, our first quarter with positive comparable sales since the fourth quarter of 2014. We are encouraged that the positive momentum in the industrial business is beginning to carry over to the core of electrical business at EIS, which should positively impact sales in the periods ahead. In addition, last October's CPS acquisition continues to perform well and bolstered sales in the wire and cable segment in EIS. Effective April 1, we announced the acquisition of Empire Wire and Supply, which will also complement EIS' wiring cable business. Empire is a provider of custom cable assemblies and a distributor of network, electrical, automation and safety products with three locations in the U.S. and one location in Canada. This business which should add $65 million in annual revenues to our operations further strengthens our overall capabilities to serve the industrial robotic and automation markets. We look forward to growing this business further as part of the EIS team. And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business which is 13% of the company's first quarter revenues. The Office Products Group reported a 9% increase in sales, driven by an 11% sales contribution from acquisitions in the facilities, breakroom and safety supplies category. Excluding acquisitions, comparable sales were down 2% in the first quarter as the continued decline in demand for traditional office supplies continues to pressure sales through our independent retailer customer base. Sales to our national accounts, e-tailers and FBS distribution customers were up in the quarter, and all-in, the 2% comparable sales decrease is improved from the declines we experienced throughout 2016. In particular, we would point to our new FBS business with one of the national accounts as driving the majority of this improvement, and we look for further growth in this channel in the quarters ahead. On the product side, sales in the traditional office supplies, furniture and technology product categories each posted sales decreases while the FBS category posted solid sales growth. The ongoing expansion of our SBS products and services offering is a key element of our growth strategy at SPR, and for the first quarter, FBS sales were 32% of total sales for this segment which is up from 25% from a year ago. We have plans for the continued expansion of our FBS business including strategic acquisitions as we move ahead. Likewise, we also have key initiatives to grow our overall share of wallet and market share across our product categories and sales channels. So that recaps our consolidated and business segments sales results and the initiatives underway to generate sustainable sales growth in both the near and long term. We were pleased to produce a 5% sales increase in the first quarter of 2017 and build on the 3% sales increase for the fourth quarter of 2016. It is also encouraging that our overall growth was driven by sales increases across our four businesses with positive comparable sales across all but one segment. So with that, I'll hand it over to Carol who will provide a financial update and our updated outlook for the year. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul, and we'll begin with a review of our key financial information and then we'll provide our updated outlook for 2017. As Paul mentioned, total sales in the first quarter of $3.9 billion, up 5% included a 1% increase in comparable revenues. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29.6% compared to 29.7% in the first quarter last year with the slight decrease primarily related to lower supplier incentives. We expect these incentives to improve over the balance of the year, and combined with our ongoing initiatives to enhance gross margins, we expect better compares in the quarters ahead. The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively unchanged from the prior quarter with slight deflation in Automotive segment which is offset by a slight inflation in Industrial, Office and Electrical businesses. Our supplier price changes in the first quarter of 2017 were down 0.2% in Automotive, up 0.3% in Industrial and up 0.4% in Office as well as Electrical. Turning to our SG&A our total expenses for the first quarter were $912 million, up 6% from last year and 23.3% of sales. While we're not pleased with the 28 basis points increase year-over-year, this has improved from the fourth quarter of 2016 as a percent of sales and we're working hard to drive further cost savings. Primarily, our increase in SG&A relates to the deleveraging of expenses in our U.S. Automotive and Office businesses, as well as rising labor and delivery costs and ongoing spending for planned IT and digital investments. As expected, our costs related to our recent acquisitions were also up year-over-year but we're gradually eliminating these as we integrate these new businesses. Among our cost saving initiatives, we're also monitoring our costs and reducing any unnecessary expenses as we further rationalize our facilities to streamline our cost structure as appropriate. This process serves to reduce the overall distribution cost across all our businesses, and combined with our ongoing investments in technology, we would expect to make further progress towards lower cost and yet increase efficiency in our highly effective distribution infrastructure in the quarters and years ahead. Now moving to our results by segment; our Automotive revenue for the first quarter of $2 billion was up 3% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $152 million is down 1% with the operating margin of 7.6% compared to 8.0% in the first quarter last year, which is primarily due to the deleveraged expenses in our U.S. operations. Our Industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 7% increase from the prior year. Operating profit of $90 million is up a solid 10% and our operating margin improved to 7.3% compared to 7.1% last year. This segment benefited from stronger overall sales growth, favorable product mix shifts and a positive impact of their cost savings. Office Products revenues were $519 million, up 9% from last year. Their operating profit of $31 million was down 9% and operating margin is 6.0%. While this has improved from the fourth quarter, the margin for Office remains under pressure due to the decrease in organic sales as well as increased costs associated with growing -- with serving a growing number of sales channels including the e-tailers. To address these concerns, we've implemented several cost initiatives to drive significant savings in this business in the quarters ahead. The Electrical/Electronic Group sales were $184 million in the quarter, up 5% from 2016. Operating profit of $14 million is down 8%, so the margin for this group is 7.4% compared to 8.4% last year. So we're encouraged by the sales growth in the quarter but we were pressured by customer and product mix shifts which offset the positive impact of the cost-saving initiatives in this business. So our total operating profit in the first quarter increased by 1% and our operating profit margin was 7.3% compared to 7.7% last year. As we mentioned in our last call, we had anticipated a challenging first quarter from a margin perspective and we're very focused on driving cost savings to improve our margins across our businesses over the balance of the year. We had net interest expense of $6.2 million in the quarter, up $1.4 million from last year due to the increase in debt levels and certain variable interest rates. With these factors in mind, we're updating our net interest expense to be in the range of $23 million to $24 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense was $10.8 million for the first quarter, up from $8.8 million last year. And as a result of our recent acquisitions, we're updating our estimate for full year amortization to approximately $45 million. Depreciation expense was $27 million for the quarter, up slightly from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect total depreciation to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million. On a combined basis, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $160 million to $170 million. The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $26 million for the quarter, up from $24 million last year due mainly to higher costs for personnel and IT security. For 2017, we continue to expect corporate expense to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million which is in line with our previous guidance. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 34.3% compared to 35.9% last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings which are taxed at lower rates. The recently adopted change in accounting for stock-based compensation which positively impacted the first quarter rate as well a more favorable nontaxable retirement plan valuation adjustment. For the full year, we're updating our expected income tax rate to a range of 35.5% to 36%. Our net income for the quarter of $160.2 million was up 1% from last year and our EPS of $1.08 was up 3%. So now we'll discuss our balance sheet which remains strong and in excellent condition. Our cash of $178 million at March 31 is down from $27 million from last year but our cash position continues to support our growth initiatives across each of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of $2.1 billion is up 5% from the prior year which is in line with our first quarter sales growth of 5%. Our inventory at quarter-end was $3.3 billion, up 7% from March of last year. Before acquisitions, our inventory is up 3% and we'll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable at $3.2 billion at March 31 is up 9% from the prior year due to the increased level of purchases, the ongoing benefit of improved payment terms as well as acquisitions. At March 31, 2017, our AP inventory ratio was 98% which is up two points from 96% at March 31 a year ago, as well as December 31, 2016. Our working capital of $1.6 billion at March 31 is up slightly from last year. We continue to effectively manage our working capital which is a top priority for the company. Our total debt of $1 billion at March 31 compares to $700 million in debt March of last year, and our total debt to capitalization is approximately 24%. We're comfortable with our capital structure at this time and we continue to believe that our current structure provides the company with the flexibility and financial capacity necessary to take advantage of any growth opportunities that we may choose to pursue. So in summary, our balance sheet remains a key strength of the company. In the first quarter, we generated cash from operations of $102 million and we continue to expect strong cash flows for the full year. For our initial guidance, we are still forecasting cash from operations of approximately $950 million and free cash flow which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend to be approximately $400 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. These include strategic acquisitions, which Paul covered earlier, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. We purchased 1 million shares of stock in the first quarter, and today, we have 3.2 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases but we expect to remain active in the program and the period ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best returns to our shareholders. Our investment in capital expenditures was $25 million in the first quarter, an increase from the $12 million last year. For the year, we are now planning for capital expenditures in the range of $145 million to $160 million. Turning to our dividends; 2017 marks our 61st consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. Our annual dividend of $2.70 represents a 3% increase from 2016 and is approximately 57% of our 2016 earnings. So that concludes our financial update for the first quarter of 2017. And in summary, while our top line growth is encouraging, there are still many opportunities to both enhance our gross margins and to better manage the expenses in our businesses. These areas have our full attention and we're very focused on driving improved gross margins, greater efficiencies and cost savings as we move through the year, and we look forward to reporting to you on that progress. Now turning to our guidance for 2017; based on our current performance, our growth plans and the market conditions that we see for the foreseeable future, we're updating our full year 2017 guidance as follows; we continue to expect total sales to be in the up 3% to up 4% range which is unchanged from our initial guidance. This outlook includes the benefit of our year-to-date acquisitions including the Merle's acquisitions that is effective May 1 but no other future acquisitions. We also expect a slight headwind from currency translation for the full year. Our comparable sales growth is still projected to be in the range of up 2% to up 3%. By business, we are maintaining our initial sales outlook at up 3% to up 4% for Automotive and Industrial; and up 2% to up 3% for office. In the Electrical segment, we're raising our sales outlook to up 7% to up 8% from our initial guidance of up 1% to up 2% to account for the addition of Empire which was effective April 1, 2017. On the earnings side, we're raising our full year outlook for earnings per share to $4.75 to $4.85, which is an increase from our initial guidance of $4.70 to $4.80 for 2017. Our updated EPS range accounts for the acquisitions we discussed today including the Inenco investment as well as our expectations for a lower tax rate. This represents a 3.5% to 6% increase in EPS for 2016 -- from 2016 while our earnings growth progressively improved over the balance of the year.  And with that, we would just close by saying thank you to all of our GPC Associates for their continued hard work and commitment to the future growth of the company, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. So we are pleased to raise our 2017 earnings outlook and we move forward with the goal of building on our current sales momentum. We are focused on further strengthening the core sales across our businesses as well as maximizing the benefit of our recent acquisitions. We are also committed to executing on our plans to enhance our gross margins and secure cost savings leading to stronger earnings growth.  So in closing, I'd like to add my sincere thanks to our GPC Associates across the globe for a really solid start to 2017. And with that, we'll turn it back to Kayla, and Carol and I will be happy to take your questions. Kayla. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Jerry Sullivan : This is Jerry Sullivan on for Chris. Question around tax refunds. Were tax refunds a significant impact in, I guess, late January and February. And did you see, I guess, an uptick in sales in March as the refund flow started to come to consumers. Paul Donahue : No. Jerry, so look, it may have had a small impact but it's really difficult to quantify. And if you look at our business with the majority of our business being driven by the commercial sector, I'm not sure that we would've been impacted like perhaps one of our peer groups is a bit more reliant on the DIY customers. Jerry Sullivan : So I take it whether was a bigger impact in February and January and then kind of impacted March. Or how should we think about that. Paul Donahue : No. You would be correct. January, we got off to a slow start in January, and February got a little better and March similar to February. And look, we hate to play the weather card, but the fact is weather had a significant impact. We had a very warm January, a warm February across the country with the exception of our business out West, which was basically cold and wet, and then winter returned in March in the North East. And for a lot of you folks who live in the Northeast, you know we had a foot of snow up there in some markets in Northeast had rolled in, and that cost us business. We had stores that were closed and we had DCs that were closed in the month of March. So look, it's a fact of life. We all deal with it, but it absolutely had an impact on our U.S Automotive business. Jerry Sullivan : Got it, thank you. Paul Donahue : You are welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Two questions, Paul, I guess to follow up on that one. You hate to go to weather but you were already there. I guess given your history experience, when you do see a late winter come with that late kind of storm, understand that it can hurt sales at those actual days or weeks, are you seeing any signs that, that late part of the winter that came in has actually helped some of the spring demand. Or are we still at that trend that we've been sort of running through the first quarter. Paul Donahue : The trend is similar, Greg. And look, so not that we're into April. Of course, we got the Easter holiday hitting us in the middle part of the month. So it's early yet to really make a call as to what the impact was. Look, if there's anything good, the snow and the cold that returned in March in the Northeast, it probably blew out some winter goods that we have stocked up on and had hoped to sell in both January and February. So if there was any benefit, we probably blew out some of those winter goods in late March. Greg Melich : And on the comps, remind us are there any -- are the selling days the same in the first quarter this year as the year ago. I know we had a leap year last year and an Easter shift. Was it a true comparison this year. Paul Donahue : It was, yes, absolutely. The number of days in the quarter were consistent, 2016 to 2017. Greg Melich : Great, and then Carol, I just want to follow up on the guidance to make sure I got it right. The $0.05 change was basically driven by 2 things, the acquisitions you've done since the guidance in the early part of the year and then the lower tax rate. Was that -- those are the two things that changed that? Carol Yancey : Well, yes, Greg, we considered all the factors. So the acquisitions, which would be the 35% investment in Inenco as well as Empire and Merle's. And then the lower tax rate. But we also consider, we had slight increases in our interest expense and our amortization expense as well. And then look, just the additional headwinds, if you will, in keeping our core sales consistent throughout the year with Automotive and Industrial, so we consider all those factors in $0.05. Greg Melich : Okay, and you mentioned a lower tax rate. Is that the accounting change on some of the stock comp. Is that what drove that. And is that something we should model out in perpetuity. Is that just a this year issue? Carol Yancey : So that is one of the reasons for the lower tax rate. We traditionally have a lower rate in the first quarter, but there were 3 things that drove the lower rate. One was the mix of foreign earnings because they were stronger Q1 because of the stronger sales results. Two was that the impact of the stock option change and then three was we had a favorable nontaxable retirement plan adjustment in Q1. So that was about a third, a third, a third, if you will. We have modeled our stock option change into our lower rate guidance for the rest of the year, and that faced that way. But I can tell you, that's an extremely hard to predict number because it depends what stock options are exercised in the future depending what your market price is. So we've modeled a similar number for the rest of the year as Q1 but that's in our guidance. Greg Melich : Okay, that is great, thanks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Next is Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot, good morning. I'll come back to the second question to give everyone a break from it, but I want to start off by asking a question that's relevant, primarily to the Industrial business though it can be -- should remain across the board. So we've heard from a couple of your industrial peers about pricing actions and, in essence, the impact of increased price transparency on their pricing models and in some instances on margin. Can you talk about your pricing approach. And are you seeing a dynamic -- a different dynamic in the market as it relates to pricing in the Industrial business, or do you feel that's more idiosyncratic to some of your peers and the world you see is as it's been. Paul Donahue : Yes. Matt, I'll give it a shot, and Carol, you jump in here if you have a comment. But certainly, I'm assuming you're referencing a business that released yesterday, Matt. And the fact is that our business is different. And while we're watching what's going on in their world, it's really not impacting us. And if you look at our business and our model, it's certainly more of a contractual business and the business that you're referencing is a very small portion of our overall. Carol Yancey : And Matt, I would just add that motion, and you can see it in our operating margin, both their gross margin, their core gross profit as well as their G&A were improved in the quarter. So we're not really seeing that impact and we're not really expecting that. I mean I think for Motion, it is unique to the company that was discussed. Matthew Fassler : So back to Automotive for a moment. Obviously, the weather had an impact on the business in the quarter. If we think back to 2016 which was a sluggish year for the industry, one of the factors that was cited within that was the warm winter that we had last year. And I know that this year was not quite as unique, but by some measure, it was rather similar. How does the winter that we've had which is essentially over -- impact your thinking on the revenue line for Automotive in the rest of 2017. Paul Donahue : Well we're for the U.S, Matt, and I'm assuming you're referencing in the U.S, we're staying with our guidelines. We expect to see improved sales, as I mentioned in my comments. Certainly, Q1 was our toughest comps that we had that we went up against -- that we'll go up against all year. So we're expecting many of the initiatives that we have in play to kick in. And once we get beyond some of these weather headwinds, we really expect to see improved business the balance of the year on our U.S Automotive business. Matthew Fassler : And then finally, on Automotive. Sorry, Carol, go ahead. Carol Yancey : Matt, I just want to reiterate on our core growth for Automotive, our guidance remains at plus 3% to plus 4%. So that's offset by acquisitions and FX. But implied in there is probably plus 2% to plus 3% for U.S and slightly stronger for international. Matthew Fassler : For U.S. Carol Yancey : Yes. Matthew Fassler : I think in the recent quarters as you've given us quarter on the components of the business, you've broken out commercial and DIY in a little more detail. I might have missed that today, but is that color that you can give us on Q1. Paul Donahue : Well, the DIY and commercial were both down slightly in the quarter, Matt. Matthew Fassler : Got it, alright, thank you so much guys. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Christopher Bottiglieri : Thank you for taking my question. Quick question for you. How does the margin structure -- I know company-owned store I presume a higher margin, but how does the operating margin structure of Asia Pac compare to the U.S and I guess firstly for auto and then maybe just for Industrial. Carol Yancey : Yes, and so our margin structure for both Australian businesses and Automotive and Industrial would be comparable. Asia Pac, when we bought them at very comparable margins, what we've seen there is really nice improvement in their top line growth. So then that kind of drives more of an upsized margin improvement but similar margins. And then the Inenco business would be similar margin to our Motion business as well. Paul Donahue : What excites us, Chris, on our acquisition of Inenco is the synergies that we believe we can drive both with our Motion business, our Industrial business sharing many of the same key suppliers, global suppliers and some of the best practices potentially adding additional new product lines to our Inenco business but also taking advantage of the infrastructure and footprint that we have on the ground now in Australia and New Zealand to drive improved indirect cost as well. So look, it's early and we're still at just a 35% owner but we see a template very similar to the path we went down with the Revco business four years ago and that's certainly what we intend to replicate. Christopher Bottiglieri : Got you. And just the indirect, I mean what are you sharing, is it a corporate office space? Is it oversight corporate? Like what are some of the indirect synergies between, I guess, Automotive Australia and Inenco. Carol Yancey : So it can be anything from freight to ocean cargo to technology to digital. I mean there's just a vast array -- warehouse management systems. There's just a vast array of indirect programs, if you will, that we put in place immediately on all our acquisitions. Paul Donahue : Chris, we will -- in terms of facilities, we don't intend to share facilities in Australia and New Zealand at this point, but we certainly will take advantage of our global sourcing offices that we have on the ground in China for both -- well, for all of our businesses but certainly for both of our businesses in Australia as well. Christopher Bottiglieri : That's helpful. And then overall, your Automotive revenue is fairly strongly, a little bit weak in the U.S but margins kind of gave in a little bit. So I was just trying to figure out kind of what drove the margin weakness in Q1 in Automotive. Carol Yancey : Yes, look, the comparable sales growth for U.S Automotive was down 1. So it's a loss of leverage on the U.S Automotive side that drove that margin. And so what we're expecting is that second half of the year is a bit better. Christopher Bottiglieri : That makes a lot of sense. Paul, just one housekeeping. Could you just give us the compares for the U.S from last year. I think you gave us 0% in Q4 that might come to fill out '16 just to get a sense of the cadence. Paul Donahue : Chris, I don't have that number in front of me right now. I would -- well, hold on. So as we went across 2016, our U.S comps -- the first quarter was our strongest. Our comps in the first quarter last year as I mentioned was the strongest, we're up 4%. We were then down 2-plus percent in Q2, down 2% in Q3 and basically flat in Q4. Christopher Bottiglieri : That's helpful, thank you, thank you so much I will pass the line, thank you. Operator : Next is Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Elizabeth Suzuki : Good morning. Historically, what impact, if any, has declining make up pricing had on your business. And do you think there's any credence to the idea that used vehicle values declined and scrap rate may actually go up since the value proposition of fixing up a car versus replacing it becomes a little less compelling. Paul Donahue : Well, let me take a shot at that, Elizabeth. The scrap rate has -- and certainly, the scrap rate is a key metric that we look at to measure the overall Automotive business and the health of our Automotive business, that has remained fairly consistent. And I think I for one, and it would just be one man's opinion, but a drop in used car pricing, I just don't think it's going to have a huge impact. The size of the fleet that we're talking about here in the U.S is massive and it takes really a significant shift to really move the market, and so we don't anticipate any real shift. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay, that's helpful. And looking at DIY versus DIFM, what percentage of your auto business is currently DIY. And how has that trended over the last several years. Paul Donahue : Yes, so it's remained fairly consistent, Elizabeth. It's been right around 75-25 mark, 75 being DIFM commercial and 25% being DIY. And it remains pretty consistent. We have -- as we mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have a number of initiatives in play right now to continue to drive additional retail business through our stores. We've got 1,000 company-owned stores, 5,000 independent stores. And one of the things that we have taken from our brethren in Australia is they've got a very strong retail business. So one of the initiatives for us is we've been upgrading our stores, extending our store hours and really just improving the overall retail shop-ability of our stores. And as mentioned, we're seeing a nice impact in those stores that we have to our new to that you look. But to size it up, Elizabeth, the industry is growing on the DIFM side and that's where we -- that's where our heritage is, that's where we intend to stay that's where we intend -- we certainly believe the continued growth will come from us on the DIFM side. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay, great. And just a quick one on acquisitions. Looks like in the last -- in just the last month, you've made a couple of smaller and then one larger acquisition in the Industrial and auto and Electrical segments. Is there any -- what are the multiples looking like for the various segments versus -- this year versus last year? And have there been any real shifts where you're starting to see some really compelling opportunities in one particular segment or a couple of segments versus the others? Paul Donahue : Yes. Well, our stated objective in terms of our M&A, we -- if you go back to my growth pillars, Elizabeth, I talked about aggressive but disciplined acquisition strategy and we do stay disciplined in our approach. We shoot for between 6 to 8x multiples. But occasionally, for the right strategic acquisition, we may exceed the outer boundaries of that. But historically, and I can tell you that the majority of the times we do stay within our range and that would be our intention going forward as well. Elizabeth Suzuki : Alright, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. The last few quarters, you guys have given us gap between the performance in your auto business in your southern and northern regions. Can you provide that for this quarter. Paul Donahue : Yes. So Seth, it's narrowing significantly, and what I would tell you is that a number of our divisions, we've got eight divisions across the country that are all in various geographical regions. Most of them this quarter were pretty tightly bunched together. We had a couple of outliers. And in the outliers, one on the positive side, which posted some pretty good strong single-digit growth was up in the mountain part of the U.S I referenced in my comments that that's the one part of the country that saw a tough winter, a more normal winter. And so if we ever really want to truly get a handle on does weather impact the business, we see it very clearly in the growth. And look, our teams did a good job up there as well, so it's not all weather. But we saw nice growth on the positive side of the mountain. On the flip side to that, we saw a decline, a greater decline than we saw in our normal -- our regular divisions down in the northeastern part of the country. And again, the Northeast in Q1 had the warmest winter, I think, in 25 years with the exception of that northeastern that blew in, in March. So those would be the two outliers, but the balance were pretty tightly bunched together. Seth Basham : Got it. So the range you're talking about for most of 2016, the 400 to 500 basis points gap between the North and South is much more narrow than that, would you say, 100, 200 basis points in that type of range. Paul Donahue : In the 200 basis point range. Seth Basham : Got it, thanks for that. And then secondly, regarding the fleet business, you talked about some improvement in the oil economy and the benefits to the Industrial segment. But what about in the auto segment. Why aren't we seeing any improvement in the fleet business that is somewhat oil economy-centric? Paul Donahue : Seth, it's a great question and one that we've discussed internally. We really think there's a bit of a lag effect in terms of the growth we're seeing because if you look at our business in the Southwest, whether it's our Industrial business or in our Automotive business, our Southwest business is bouncing back. And we just think there's a bit of a lag effect that is yet to kick in, but we do believe that's coming and one of the reasons why we feel pretty good about the balance of the year. Seth Basham : Got it, okay. And last thing, in terms of the cadence really our business through the year. In the second quarter you talked about comparisons easing substantially but it also sounds like you're not planning for much of an improvement in comps here in the second quarter, so it's really back half that you're looking for. What is it about the second quarter besides Easter that gives you a bit of pause? Paul Donahue : Well, it's still a bit early, Seth. And look, Easter absolutely has an impact and we've seen it in the month. So look, I think that as I mentioned to Chris earlier, the comps get a good bit easier here in Q2 and Q3. And our expectation, Carol walked you through what we still expect in our U.S. comps and that's where we expect to be. Seth Basham : Alright, very good, thank you guys. Operator : We'll go next to Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Good morning guys. On the Merle's deal, and I'm just sort of thinking about that consolidation of the auto distribution in the U.S. and they were I guess a parts plus member and back at the end of the year one of your alliance members. Do you see that is there more of a strategy of owning the retail distribution auto. And do you think this is a result of further consolidation of the buying group members. Paul Donahue : Well, look, I would tell you this, Bret. We've known Steve and the team out there at Merle's for a number of years, and this happens to be -- Tucson is a market that Merle's dominated in, and we have a few stores but I would tell you they're the strongest player out there and it's a perfect fit for our Phoenix team in our Western Division and just fits very nicely. That's not always the case. When we look at some of these groups and these players that are out there, many times, we have a number of conflicts in those markets and it's difficult to go in and bolt one on just because of the number of conflicts that it would present to us. But I would tell you that we're really excited to have Steve and the Merle's team join NAPA, and we feel really good about the nice fit that that's going to have on our -- with our Phoenix group. Bret Jordan : Did you talk about what you paid for on a multiple basis? Paul Donahue : No, we did not. Bret Jordan : Okay. Ballpark? Carol Yancey : Ballpark and our ranges that we discussed. Bret Jordan : Okay. And you talked about the margin and I think you talked about lower supplier incentives. Was that lower supplier incentive on the auto side just because the negative comp you weren't getting as much supplier participation. Or is that supplier incentives in other businesses as well. Carol Yancey : So actually, it was Automotive, Industrial and office, a little bit more in Automotive and more driven by the lower comps. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you, it was great. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli. Brian Sponheimer : Hi everyone, good morning. Carol Yancey : Hi, Brian. Brian Sponheimer : Want to talk about Inenco. And can you just discuss the purchasing mechanics for the remainder of the business, and is there an agreed-upon price right now? Or is that something that is up for negotiation down the road. Carol Yancey : So Brian, it's similar to what we did with Asia Pac is there is a future earnings target that's been set and there's a period of time that we expect that to happen, and again, it would operate -- that remains to be seen when the time period is. But as we saw with Asia Pac, we ended up doing a little bit quicker than what we thought. So it's structured very similar to our previous ones, so an earnings target in a period of time out. So whether it's two years, three years, it remains to be seen. Paul Donahue : Brian, I would just add that our hope and what we anticipate is that it will be sooner rather than later much like we saw with our acquisition on the Revco business and it's a good business and one that -- again, we've known the family. It was a family-owned business. We've known them for a number of years. There was always a good relationship between the Inenco team and our Motion team. It's one that I -- honestly, we're pretty excited about. Brian Sponheimer : It seems like a great opportunity. Just within Motion, so you talked a little bit about channel inventory and what you're seeing from your own customers and whether some of this is restocking ahead of optimism about the market or just simply meeting demand with purchases. Carol Yancey : I think it's more of a meeting demand with purchases. I think and, look, that's why we were kind of we want to give a little bit more time to know that this growth is sustainable. So there's definitely signs there's new business, but I don't think it's as much as you described at the beginning. I think it's just more of the normal sales that's going on right now. Brian Sponheimer : Alright, terrific, well, good luck. Carol Yancey : Thanks, Brian. Operator : And we have time for one more question from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is Mike [ph] for Scott, thanks for taking my question. Maybe talk a little bit about efforts you're making to improve margins in the coming year. And was just wondering if you could provide some context on the cadence of when you expect those improvement to show through, particularly maybe with some more color around the recent pressure in Office Products and Electrical. Carol Yancey : Okay, sure. So we're probably -- and our guidance kind of implies a plus 3.5% to plus 6% in earnings per share, and we would say that, that's probably more of a second half of the year and, specifically, how are we getting there, what are we doing. So we had said kind of originally kind of a flat margin for those -- for the business in the year, but we're getting some improvement obviously out of the tax line. But what we're doing specifically on the EIS side, they have done significant reductions in facilities as well as headcount and then also working on the gross margin side right now. So this was a quarter we had a nice core growth of 2.5%. So it takes that to start flowing through later in the year with continued growth core growth. On the office side, they took some steps last year in Q4 and there were some additional steps taken in Q1 which pertain to headcount reductions, changes in freight, some of our pricing, looking at facilities. And so I would say it would be more in the SG&A line and more second half of the year. But in total, I think for those businesses, we're speaking towards -- when you put Automotive, Industrial with office and Electrical, that's where you may -- it's going to but beach other out depending where the growth is. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Operator : I'd like to turn it back to our presenters for closing remarks. Carol Yancey : Well, we'd like to thank you for participating in today's call and we thank you for your support and interest in Genuine Parts Company and we look forward to talking to you in July with our second quarter results. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead Sir. Sid Jones : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company second quarter 2017 conference call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses. The Company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. We'll begin this morning with comments from our President and CEO, Paul Donahue. Paul? Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and welcome to our second quarter 2017 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our second quarter 2017 results. I will make a few remarks on our overall performance, and then cover the highlights by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2017. After that, we'll open up the call to your questions. So to recap our second quarter performance, total sales were up 5% to a record setting $4.1 billion with net income coming in at $190 million and earnings per share increasing 1% to $1.29 compared to $1.28 in the second quarter last year. These results represent the total sales and earnings across our global Automotive, Industrial, Office and Electrical operations, which we will discuss in more detail throughout this call. As a diversified global distributor, we continue to benefit from the balance of serving a broad range of markets. The diversity in our operations combined with an ongoing strategy to drive both organic and acquisitive growth produced a second consecutive quarter of 5% total sales growth. Each of our four distribution businesses produced improved total sales with our strongest performances in the Industrial and Electrical segments. Our teams are committed to generating sustainable sales growth, while also streamlining our cost structure to improve profitability. Thus far in 2017, we have acquired businesses with approximately $180 million in annual revenues and made a minority investment in a market leading industrial distributor in Australia. We anticipate that each of these new businesses will positively contribute to our future results. Turning to organic growth, total comp sales were up 2% in the second quarter and improved result relative to the last several quarters. And we stand at plus 1% for the first six months of 2017. And while improved from the first quarter, the low single digit comp sales growth continues to pressure our net margins. Looking ahead, we are confident that our sales and cost initiatives will drive stronger growth and improve margins over the long term. Turning to our Automotive operations, Automotive remains our largest business segment representing 53% of our total revenues in the second quarter of 2017. For the quarter global Automotive sales were up 3.6% from last year and improved from the 3.4% increase in the first quarter. Comp sales on a global basis were up approximately 1.5%, which has improved from a 0.5% in the first quarter. In our U.S. operations, which continued to represent just over 70% of our Automotive revenues, total sales were up 4% in the second quarter including a 1% increase in comp sales which has improved from the first quarter. Across our customer segment sales to retail DIY customer outperformed our sales to commercial DIFM accounts although both groups improved sequentially. On the commercial side of the U.S. business, sales to our NAPA AutoCare Centers were up 1%, while sales to major accounts and fleet customers remained under pressure and were down low-single digits. Byproduct group batteries, rotating electrical, brakes, chassis, filtration and heavy-duty sales outperformed while categories such as Ride Control, exhaust and heating and cooling remained soft. These sales trends co-relate to the warmer than average winter weather and cooler summer temps in May and June. By geography our Northern divisions outperformed our Southern divisions although both showed positive sales growth. In the Northern division the Mountain, which experienced the harshest winter conditions in the country continued to outperform while the Northeast and the Midwest divisions also had solid results in the second quarter. Our Western division, which experienced warmer than normal summer temps in the quarter outperformed the solid growth as well. On the retail ride of the U.S. business we continue to expand our NAPA Rewards Program, which has now grown to nearly five million members. This loyalty program is available in-store and online and is an important initiative for us in the broader scope of our continued retail growth. We continue to experience higher retail tickets and more frequent visits from our NAPA Rewards members and we\u2019ll continue to enhance this program into 2018. We are also making progress with our retail impact initiative, which includes installing all new interior layouts and in-store graphics, extended store hours and increase training for our store associates. The 275 stores updated for this initiative through June continue to produce very high single-digit retail sales growth. This program continues to exceed our expectations and we have a plans to have more than 500 of these retail impact stores completed by the end of 2017. This is an increase from our previous plan for 450 stores by year-end. The retail-end customer has more choices today than ever before, so it's encouraging to see our initiatives driving growth in our retail segment. Our ongoing acquisitions will also positively contribute to our commercial and retail segments as we move forward. Thus far in 2017 we have acquired three automotive store groups adding 25 new stores to our U.S. network. On June, first we announced the acquisition of Stone Truck Parts a significant regional distributor with four locations distributing heavy-duty truck parts and accessories in North Carolina. Combined we expect these new businesses to further strengthen our Automotive and heavy-duty network and contribute approximately $100 million in annual revenues. Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket, the long-term fundamental drivers for our business remain sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow, the average age of the fleet is up to a 11.7 years. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continue to post steady gains. Total miles driven increased 1.2% in April, marking 38 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, and they are up 1.5% year-to-date with steady fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.46 in June, which was down slightly from last year. As a result, we expect to see further increases in miles driven and, ultimately, driving additional parts purchases. Overall our U.S. Automotive sales benefited from the combination of acquisitions and positive comp sales growth for the first time since Q1 of 2016. We believe this is an indication that our retail and commercial initiatives are gaining traction. And we plan to build on this momentum in the second half of the year. So now let's turn to our International Automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada and Mexico. These operations account for nearly 30% of our global Automotive revenues and as a group delivered a 4% total sales increase including a 3% comp sales increase in local currency. In Australia and New Zealand, second quarter sales were up low to mid-single digits, driven by low-single digits comp sales growth and the ongoing benefit of acquisitions. The Asia Pac business operated with 29 additional stores in the second quarter of 2017 relative to the same period last year. And that now brings our total store footprint in Australia and New Zealand to 555 locations with further store expansion opportunities in the future. In addition, the underlying fundamentals for the Australasian aftermarket remains solid with a growing car part driven by record car sales, relatively low gas prices and upward trends in miles driven. At NAPA Canada, both total sales and comp sales improved in the mid-single digit range, which is consistent with the first quarter results. Our Canadian team is performing at a high level and they've laid out an effective strategy to expand sales across Canada. In addition the industry is benefiting from a more favorable sales climate driven by an improving overall economy and positive industry fundamentals. These factors bode well for the future of the Canadian automotive aftermarket and we are optimistic for continued outsized growth at NAPA Canada over the second half of the year. And finally, in Mexico, our sales grew by low double digits for the third consecutive quarter as we continue to expand our NAPA Mexico footprint. Today we have 36 total stores with plans to accelerate additional store openings in the quarters ahead. So that wraps up our Automotive overview. We're pleased to report a 4% increase in our U.S. business despite continued industry wide headwinds. Going forward we'll continue to focus on accelerating our comp sales growth while continuing to search for opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions. Our international automotive business continues to post strong results as we expand our comp sales and add new locations across all of our markets. So let's turn to our industrial business. Motion Industries representing 30% of our second quarter total revenues and this group was up 7.3% in the quarter. This has an improved result from the 6.9% increase in the first quarter and includes a 5% comp sales increase up from a 3% comp increase last quarter. We are encouraged by the continued strength in our industrial sales thus far in 2017, which reflects both improving organic growth as well as the benefit of acquisitions. In addition the industry is benefiting from favorable market conditions as broad based industrial indicators such as industrial production and the purchasing managers index as well as rig count and the level of exported goods all continue to trend positively. These factors drive greater customer demand across the diverse markets we serve and we expect to see this continue over the balance of the year. A review of our Motion business by industry sector, product category and top customers supports the broad nature of our second quarter growth as well. Of our Top 12 industries nine sectors showed solid sales gains with the others down just slightly. Among the top performers would be sectors such as iron and steel, lumber and wood, equipment rental and leasing, big improvements in oil and gas and equipment and machinery. Along our primary product categories each generated positive sales growth for the second consecutive quarter and likewise our Top 20 customers outperformed with their second consecutive quarter of high-single digit growth. So from a market product and customer perspective, Industrial\u2019s solid second quarter and six month performance was very broad based. Finally acquisitions also remain an important element of our growth strategy. You may recall back in April we purchased 35% of the Inenco group one of Australasia\u2019s leading industrial distributors of bearings, power transmission, fasteners and seals. And Inenco is currently outperforming our expectation of generating annual revenues of more than $450 million in Australian dollars. Inenco was an attractive long-term investment for us, as it offers us the opportunity to build on our presence in Australasia as well as the potential for synergies with their existing industrial business in North America as well as our Australasian automotive operations. And in the same vein as our Asia Pac acquisition a few years back, we expect to eventually acquire the remaining stake in Inenco, which we believe will add significant value to our overall industrial operations. We remain excited about our investment in Inenco and we congratulate the team for their record sales performance in the month of June. On August 01, we'll further expand our industrial automation footprint with the acquisition of Numatic Engineering. Numatic brings over 60 years of experience in Numatic and electrical automation and will add approximately $20 million in annual revenues. This new business in addition to the Braas acquisition announced last September strengthens our distribution capabilities in the fast growing robotics, motion control and industrial network segment of the industry. We are pleased to welcome the Numatic team to the GPC family of companies. In summary we are encouraged by the first half performance in our Industrial business and remain optimistic for continued growth in the quarters ahead. Turning now to EIS, our electrical distribution segment; we took 5% of the Company's total second quarter revenues. Sales for this group, which were up 11% in the second quarter due primarily to the Empire Wire and Supply acquisition on April 01. Empire further expands the EIS\u2019s wire and cable business and in particular it strengthens our overall capabilities to serve the industrial, robotic and automation markets. This new business performed well in the quarter as did the overall wire and cable segment. EIS\u2019s core electrical business is also producing steady increases and overall we expect to see solid total sales growth at EIS over the balance of the year. So we'll wrap up with a few comments on our Office Products business which was 12% of the Company's second quarter revenue. The Office Products group reported a 5% increase in sales, driven by an 8% sales contribution from acquisitions in their facilities breakroom and safety supplies category. Excluding the acquisitions comp sales were down approximately 3% in the second quarter with the continued decline in demand for traditional Office Supplies pressuring sales across all of our channels. Our facilities and breakroom category however continues to produce strong sales increases across all channels and we expect to see further growth in the quarters ahead. On the product side sales in the traditional office supplies furniture and tech products categories each posted sales decline while the FBS category posted solid sales results. These results are consistent with recent sales trends and highlight the significant of our efforts to expand SPR\u2019s product and services offering in the large and growing facilities and breakroom market. This is a key element of our growth strategy and today FBS sales represent 36% of total sales for the Office segment, which is up from 25% last year. Looking ahead we have plans for the continued expansion of the FBS business as well as key initiatives to grow our overall share of wallet and market share across our other product categories and sales channels. So that recaps our consolidated and business segment sales results and the initiatives underway to generate sustainable sales growth over the long-term. Overall we produced our second consecutive quarter of 5% sales growth driven by the combination of both organic and acquisitive growth and total sales increases in each of our four business segments. We will look to build on these results over the second half of the year. So with that I'll hand it over to Carol who will provide a financial update and our updated outlook for the year. Carol. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul, and we'll begin with a review of our key financial information and then we'll provide more information on our updated outlook for 2017. Total sales in the second quarter set a new record our us of $4.1 billion, up 5% including a 2% increase in comparable revenues. Our gross margin for the quarter was 30.2% compared to 29.9% in the second quarter last year. The 30 basis point improvement is the result of our ongoing initiatives, to enhance gross margins across our businesses as well as higher supplier incentives. In addition, we continue to benefit from those acquisitions with higher gross margin and higher expense models as some of those have not anniversaried in this quarter. We're encouraged by our progress in improving our gross margin, and we look to produce an approximate 30% gross margin over the balance of the year. We saw somewhat of an inflationary pricing environment across our businesses in the second quarter with each of our business segments showing at least slight inflation through the first six months of the year. Our cumulative supplier price changes through June stand at one tenth of 1% for automotive positive, up 1.6% for Industrial, up 0.6% for Office and up 1.6% for Electrical. Turning to our at SG&A our total expenses for the second quarter were $943 million up 9% from last year and at 23% of sales. Rising labor, freight and delivery costs and addition to our ongoing spending for planned technology and digital investments, which are very critical to our long-term growth strategies are driving the increase in our operating expenses. And as mentioned before we've yet to anniversary certain higher gross margin and higher expense acquisitions. Finally we also continue to experience the deleveraging of expenses associated with the slow organic sales growth environment in several of our businesses. To offset these expense headwinds we remain focused on initiatives to streamline our cost structure while achieving a lower cost, highly effective distribution infrastructure for our businesses. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we expect to recognize some of these savings and improve on our year-over-year expense growth rate. Now, let's discuss the results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the second quarter was $2.2 billion up 4% for the prior year and operating profit at $207 million is up 2% with an operating margin of 9.6%, which is just shy of the 9.7% margin in the second quarter last year. We attribute this slight decline in margin to the deleveraging of expenses associated with our 1.5% comparable sales growth. Our Industrial sales of $1.3 billion in the quarter, were up 7% from the prior year and their operating profit of $96 million is up a solid 9%. And their operating margin improved to 7.7% compared to 7.6% last year as this segment continues to benefit from stronger overall sales growth, favorable product mix shift and the positive impact of cost savings. Our Office Products revenues were $504 million up 5% from last year, operating profit of $30 million is down 8% and their operating margin held steady with the first quarter at 6.0%. The margin for Office remains under pressure, due to the decrease in organic sales and the related deleveraging of expenses. Our teams are addressing these concerns with several pricing and cost initiatives to drive more sales and significant savings in this business in the quarters ahead. The electrical electronic group sales were $205 million in the quarter up 11% from the prior year. Operating profit at $15.5 million is down 3% and the margin for this group is 7.6%. We're encouraged by the overall sales growth again this quarter, although organic sales remained challenged. We continue to be pressured by customer and product mix shift, which are offsetting the positive impact of the cost saving initiatives in this business. So our total operating profit in the second quarter, increased by 3% and our operating margin was 8.5% compared to 8.7% last year. This has slightly improved from the first quarter on a year-over-year basis and our team enters the second half of the year focused on building on our positive momentum and improving the margins across our businesses. We had a net interest expense of $6.9 million in the quarter, which is up $2.2 million from last year due to the increase in debt levels primarily associated with acquisition and certain variable interest rates. With these factors in mind, we\u2019re updating our net interest expense to be in the range of $25 million to $26 million for the year. Total amortization expense of $11.4 million for the second quarter was up from $9.2 million last year due to acquisition. We continue to expect our full year amortization to be approximately $45 million. Depreciation expense was $27.8 million for the quarter up slightly from last year. And for the full year we expect total depreciation to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million. On a combined basis, we would expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $155 million to $165 million. The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense was $33.8 million for the quarter up from $26.5 million last year due mainly to higher overall costs in areas such as personnel, legal and professional, our digital initiatives as well as IT. For 2017, we expect corporate expense to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 36.1% compared to 36.2% last year. This slight reduction in the quarterly rate as well as our lower year-to-date tax rate is primarily due to a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at a lower rates. In addition their recently adopted change in accounting for stock based compensation has also positively impacted our 2017 rates. For the full-year we continue to expect our income tax rate to range from 35.5% to 36.0%. Net income for the quarter of a $190 million and EPS was a $1.29 up 1%. So now let's turn our discussion to the balance sheet, which remains strong and in excellent condition. Accounts receivable of $2.2 billion is up 7% from the prior year and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at quarter-end was $3.3 billion, which is consistent with last quarter's investment and up 9% from June of last year. Before acquisitions our inventory is up 6%, which is just slightly greater than the sales. We\u2019ll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable is $3.3 billion at June 30 and is up 7% from the prior year due to the increased level of purchases, the ongoing benefit of improved payment terms with our suppliers, as well as acquisitions. At June 30 our AP to inventory ratio was 99%, which compares to 96% at December 31. Our working capital of $1.5 billion at June 30 is down from last quarter and year-end but it is up slightly from June of last year. So overall, we continue to maintain a relatively steady level of working capital from quarter-to-quarter. Our total debt of $1.1 billion at June 30, compares to $1.025 billion at March 31 and $775 million in June of last year. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 25.5% and we remain comfortable with our capital structure at this time. Our average cost of debt is a low 2.49% and we continue to believe that our current structure provides the company with both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of future growth opportunities. In summary, our balance sheet remains the key strength of the Company. Thus far in 2017, we generated cash from operations of $345 million and we expect to produce stronger cash flows over the balance of the year. We're forecasting cash from operations of approximately $900 million to $950 million with free cash flow which excludes capital expenditure and the dividends to be in the $350 million to $400 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. These include strategic acquisitions, which Paul covered earlier, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. For the first six months of the year, we purchased 1.6 million shares of our stock, which includes 600,000 shares purchased in the second quarter. Today we have 2.6 million shares authorized and available for repurchase while we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. Our investment in capital expenditures was $29 million in the second quarter and $54 million for the six months, which is up slightly from last year. For the year, we're now planning for capital expenditures in the range of $140 million to $150 million. And lastly our 2017 annual dividend of $2.70 per share marks our 61st consecutive year of increased dividend paid to our shareholders. This represents approximately 57% of our prior year earnings and currently reflects an over 3% dividend yield. So this concludes our financial update for the second quarter of 2017. And in summary our overall top line growth is encouraging and we see further opportunities to enhance our gross margins and to streamline the cost structure across our businesses. These areas continue to have our full attention and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress. Now turning to our guidance for 2017 based on our current performance, our growth plans and the market conditions we see for the foreseeable future, we're updating our full year 2017 guidance as follows. We continue to expect total sales to be in the plus 3% to plus 4% range, which is unchanged from our initial guidance. This outlook includes the benefit of our year-to-date acquisitions, as well as the Numatic acquisition promotion that Paul discussed that is effective August 01, but assumes no other future acquisitions. We also continue to expect only a slight headwind from currency translation for the full year. By business, we're maintaining our sales outlook of plus 3% to plus 4% growth for the automotive segment. Plus 2% to plus 3% growth for the Office segment and plus 7% to plus 8% growth for the Electrical segment. In the Industrial segment, we're raising our sales outlook to plus 4% to plus 5% from our previous guidance of plus 3% to plus 4%. On the earnings side, we are revising our full year outlook for earnings per share to $4.70 to $4.75 from our previous guidance of $4.75 to $4.85. We had anticipated being further along with our cost saving initiatives, at this point in the year and with EPS up 1% for the six months, we've updated our EPS outlook to reflect a 4% to 6% improvement in the second half earnings. And a full year increase over 2016 EPS of 2.5% to 3.5%. So we continue to plan for improved profitability over the balance of the year and this will primarily come from the cost savings we mentioned before. These savings reflect the headcount reductions, and the facility rationalization and a broad range of productivity projects that are underway across our businesses. With that said we would close by thanking all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work day in and day out. Our people are our greatest asset, and we\u2019re excited about the future growth prospects and the long-term success of the company. Paul I\u2019ll turn it back over to you. Paul Donahue : Thank you Carol. We move forward with the goal of building on our six-month performance and remain focused on further strengthening the organic sales in our businesses, as well as maximizing the benefits of our recent acquisitions. We are also committed to executing on our plans to enhance gross margins and remove unproductive costs from our operations. As Carol mentioned, we have several initiatives in process to reduce expenses and improve our overall cost structure and we expect to recognize some of these savings over the balance of the year. Additionally, we believe our continued efforts in each of these areas along with a strong balance sheet, solid cash flows, and effective capital allocation will positively contribute to stronger long-term growth for the company and serve to maximize shareholder value. So with that we'll turn the call back over to Alisia, and Carol and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you Sir. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Thanks good morning everybody. Paul Donahue : Hey good morning Chris. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Christopher Horvers : Why don\u2019t you focus first on the U.S. NAPA division, on the heels of the O'Reilly pre-announcement, a couple of weeks ago, I think that the plus one in the U.S. probably comes off, certainly a bit better and it looks like you've actually closed the gap to O'Reilly in that regard. So can you talk about, they talked about a stronger April and then you know it sounded like May and June being disappointing. Can you talk about the monthly cadence in the U.S. NAPA division. Paul Donahue : Yeah, we were pretty consistent across the U.S. Chris. We were essentially up for each month, April, May and June. Globally, it was a little shift. Globally, we saw a little bit of a slide in April. But across the U.S., it was consistent across each month. Christopher Horvers : And then if you look at the, it was a lot easier comparison. And as you mentioned, it's been a cool summer so far, at least up until very recently. So we've been waiting to get further away from winter. Does the cooler summer sort of push out the rebound off the two consecutive warm winters? And then related to that, as you look forward, the compares do step up again in the fourth quarter. So are we sort of running out at two year? Or do you expect the business to continue to rebound into the end of the year? Paul Donahue : Well. Christopher Horvers : In U.S. NAPA? Paul Donahue : Yeah, let me take the first part of the question. I may ask you to repeat the second part of that, Chris. But look, if you look across our business, what's encouraging for us is that our Northern divisions, so we're talking about the Northeast, the Midwest, the Mountain divisions, are performing well. And I think I called out Mountain last quarter as our top performer. They just happen to have the most normalized winter in that part of the country. Where we're a little bit softer than we are in the Northern divisions is in the Southern divisions. And so Southeast, Southwest, Atlantic are a little bit softer, and there's a gap between the top performers and the others of about 300 basis points. We think that will close as the year progresses. The South has been, I think, impacted a bit by the cooler temps. And certainly, we have had a ton of precipitation down here in the South. So we think that, that gap will close a bit as we move through the course of the year. Christopher Horvers : And some have mentioned some pressure around the Hispanic customer. In fact, the Target CEO was quoted just this week talking about that. Are you seeing areas, Texas and along the border of Mexico, softer trends in those areas? And is that contributing to the softness in the South? Paul Donahue : Well, I'd answer that a couple of ways, Chris. As you heard me say, our DIY business was good in the quarter. And if you think about the consumer that you're referencing, I think that would probably show up a bit in our DIY retail numbers. So we're quite pleased with our retail business. As a matter of fact, we had a very good June in our retail business.  That said, I would tell you that our Southwest is down a bit or softer than our Northern Division. Whether I can attribute that to one specific demographic, it's hard to say. There's a lot of different factors at work. Christopher Horvers : Okay and just last question, I promise. So as it relates to the cooler summer, are you concerned that, that pushes out the recovery in the U.S. NAPA business? Paul Donahue : No, you saw our guidance for Automotive, Chris, and we've taken all those factors into account. And we're expecting 3% to 4% overall. And look, I think the good news for all of us, especially in the Midwest, is it's getting hot, and it's getting hot down here in the South. And we'll see business start to turn almost immediate as the temps go up. So we're feeling pretty good about the second half of the year, as I think was illustrated in our guidance. Christopher Horvers : Thanks very much Paul. Paul Donahue : You are welcome, good to talk to you Chris. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, and thank you for taking the question. A couple. One, I guess I just need to clarify I mean, so the comp gap did decelerate a little bit, I mean, sort of the tier comp stack. And then you're getting a lot of self-help initiatives and a little bit of inflation. So maybe I'll ask the question a little bit differently. What do you think the overall market has been doing? Do you think it is, are you nearing at the peers? Or do you think the market itself is a little bit weaker? Paul Donahue : Well I think, Chris, I have to mention it's a good question. I think that our business, and I can't speak for our public company peers. We'll hear their numbers here shortly. But I think it's an accurate assessment that the automotive aftermarket has slowed somewhat over the past number of quarters, and there's a lot of reasons that we all talk about. And certainly, back-to-back mild winters has been a big factor. You know that. I think one of you guys have referenced it as an air pocket that stepped down in that 7 to 9 year age group of vehicles.  So that sweet spot has been a little bit of a headwind, I think, for us and in the demand for repairs. And then if you look at some of the tailwinds that we've had in the past, and whether that be miles driven, cheaper gasoline, those tailwinds are still there, but they're lessening than what I think we saw perhaps a year or two ago. So those would be the reasons we'd point to for just a bit of slower growth. But again, we're cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year and as we distance ourselves from these mild winters. Chris Bottiglieri : Gotcha and then as you\u2019re seeing really strong performance in the DIY stores that you're doing a lot of self-help out and you're kind of closing the gap to peers. But can you maybe talk about the stores that are just you're chugging along with your kind of normal procedure? How are those stores performing on the DIY side? Paul Donahue : Well I\u2019d love to tell you they're performing as well as the stores that we have gone in and gone through our total refurb. But what we've done Chris, is our level of refurbs, if you will, in our stores varies. So it varies from a total overhaul of resetting fixtures to painting the stores to increasing hours to bringing in additional people. That would be on a major overhaul. And to a lesser degree, we're trying to impact all of our stores by increasing our store hours and adding more retail-focused personnel.  I mentioned our strong performance in June in our retail business. And in June, we saw both transaction and basket size go up for the first time in a couple of quarters. We're investing in business development managers in our retail stores, which I think are having a very positive impact on our business. So overall, we're positive about our retail business. And we're positive despite, I think, a bit of a hysteria out there around what the online players are going to do to DIY. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Yeah, that's helpful. And then just one final question on Industrial. Yes, extremely strong organic revenue growth. I wonder if you can give us a sense for why you think the incremental margins came a little bit lighter than maybe than I would have expected. Is it your investments, is that bifurcated between gross margin, SG&A, deleverage, like kind of what you're seeing in that segment and kind of your outlook for your outlook for margins in that segment? Carol Yancey : Look we did little bit lighter margin improvement in the quarter, but I would look to what we've done for the six months. And you've got a 20 basis point improvement in margin for the six months, sales being up 7%, profits up 10%. That is indicative of their gross margin initiatives, which they have been working on for two plus years. Their core gross profit has been up for a number of quarters. We also had higher supplier incentives, which again is tied to the improved growth and the increase in purchases.  The cost reductions that they made are actually, we\u2019re seeing improvement in their SG&A. But for us to move the needle, it takes some time. And again, showing through six months 20 basis point improvement is a nice job by that team. So we're going to expect that to continue as we move forward. But having said that, the guidance is really more of a factor in the lower comparable sales and the leverage issues that are in the other segments, not Industrial. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. That's helpful. So it sounds like the margins have held up pretty well in that segment? Is that the takeaway there? Carol Yancey : Yes they have. Chris Bottiglieri : Very great, thank you very much for your time I appreciate it. Paul Donahue : Thank you Chris. Carol Yancey : Thank you Chris. Operator : We'll go next to Elizabeth Suzuki of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth Lane : Hi guys. Paul Donahue : Hi Elizabeth. Elizabeth Lane : Good morning, can you just remind us what percentage of the Auto business is DIY versus to do-it-for-me? And I know you mentioned that DIY outperformed the commercial business, but just curious how much of the Auto business is currently being sold to DIY customers. Paul Donahue : So it\u2019s good question Elizabeth. And it varies by country. But our U.S. NAPA business, our DIFM commercial business, which is our dominant part of our business, is 75 plus percent, which leaves our DIY business at 25% approximately of the overall. It's different in Australasia, where we have a more stronger retail presence. And Canada is very similar. Mexico is very similar as well. Elizabeth Lane : Great thanks that is really helpful and within the Auto segment, you mentioned that pricing was up about a 0.10%. And which product categories within that are showing the most strength? And which are under some pressure? And how would you expect pricing overall to trend going forward for the rest of the year? Carol Yancey : Well look we are coming off of five years of either deflation or no inflation in Automotive. So the fact that we ticked positive even though it was 10 basis points, we're encouraged to see that. As far as what we're estimating for the full year, it could be 0.5 point. I'm not sure it'll be a full point. But the categories we're probably seeing it in would be commodities. But again, we're not modeling for a significant uptick in that inflation between now and the end of the year. It's pretty modest, but it was encouraging to see a bit of improvement this quarter. Elizabeth Lane : Yes, definitely. And just one more quick one on Auto, is that if used vehicle pricing really starts to come under some significant pressure as supply goes up, do you think that, that would impact the auto aftermarket at all? I mean, does it make the consumer any more likely to scrap their older vehicle than fix it up? Or is the average consumer just not even really looking at that? Paul Donahue : Well, Elizabeth I don't think that's going to be a significant factor for us going forward. I think the \u2013 everything I read, some of your peers that follow the dealer segment, it appears the used vehicle market is pretty strong right now. That's always a good thing for us. So we don't expect to see any significant shift going forward. Elizabeth Lane : Alright great thank you. Paul Donahue : You are welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. Paul Donahue : Hi, good morning Seth. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Seth Basham : My questions would fit in the Auto business. If you could maybe fare it out for us a little bit the difference in growth trajectory for the wholesale business versus the company-owned stores on the do-it-for-me inside? Paul Donahue : I am sorry Seth can you repeat that. Seth Basham : The wholesale business independents relative to the strength to growth at the company-owned stores, specifically on the do-it-for-me side of the equation, if you can get to that level of granularity. Paul Donahue : The total sales that we're reporting, we're talking about for the quarter only. Our comps were up 1% overall, and that's all of our business. So that's independents, that's company stores, that's inclusive of all of our stores. And as we saw \u2013 as I think I mentioned earlier, our trend throughout the quarter was very steady, and we were basically plus 4% across the way. DIY, I mentioned, was a bit stronger. But both, I think the other important takeaway, Seth, is that both DIFM and DIY improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter. I am not sure I answered your questions, Seth, but\u2026 Seth Basham : Yeah, that\u2019s helpful but I was just wondering if the wholesale business grew any more or less than the company-owned stores business? Carol Yancey : We would say that we had similar results in both the company-owned stores and the independent stores. And again, pointing to the sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2. So it would be similar. Seth Basham : Got it helpful. And then secondly, just in terms of what's happening with fleet and major accounts. Any more color on what you think the drivers are of that persistent weakness? Paul Donahue : Yeah, I think look think our major account business, Seth, which is a significant part of our overall DIFM business, I think our business continues to track with our customers' business. I don't believe we're losing market share. Matter of fact, I would contend that perhaps we've gained a bit of market share overall. But I believe our numbers overall reflect their business. The fleet business, again, sequentially improved. And I would tell you also, in our major account business, we saw sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter. We also saw sequential improvement in our fleet business quarter-over-quarter. The fleet business, Seth, I think that we're going to continue to see that improve. If I look across \u2013 I mean, you follow the Motion business and how strong our Industrial business is as a whole. Ultimately, and we've always said this, is that fleet tends to lag a bit behind the market. So we're still confident that we'll continue to see sequential improvement in the fleet business going forward. Seth Basham : Thank you very much. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome Seth. Carol Yancey : Thanks Seth. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Sponheimer of Gabelli. Brian Sponheimer : Hi good morning everyone. Paul Donahue : Hi Brian. Carol Yancey : Hi Brian. Brian Sponheimer : Want to talk about Motion. You've handled the NAPA business very well. I was a little surprised, given the comp store increase, to see margins expand just to 10 bps. So can you talk a little bit about if there are any friction costs there that would lead to maybe a little bit less leverage than you would normally expect? Carol Yancey : I can\u2019t say it is any one thing, Brian. I think what \u2013 look with that group, they are being very cautious on when they're adding back expenses and the payroll that we took out, and we think about the facilities that we rationalized. And as businesses come back, they've had to weigh that in, in bringing back in some of those costs. Some of the gross margin improvements, and you know 50% of that business is with major accounts, national accounts, there continues to be a significant amount of competitive pricing pressures.  In some of those contracts, you're under pricing agreements, and so you may not be able to pass through. There may be some kind of lag there. So I can't say it's anything in particular. I mean, sometimes, you get subtle changes between the quarters. But still, we like what we're seeing with the 20 basis points through six months.  I mean, one thing to remember, too, is their core growth \u2013 I mean, the core growth is a function, it's lower than what the total number is. So you got some acquisition costs that are still weighing in there. The other thing I'll just mention, we've kept their inventory down through the six months. And with that, we're not ramping up the level of incentives as quickly as you might expect. So we're trying to work hard on focusing on the balance sheet as well. Paul Donahue : Hey Brian, I would just add to Carol's comments. First off, thank you for the question on our Industrial business. It gives us an opportunity to brag a bit on our Motion team. We've been, in past quarters, a little bit cautious to go out and say we think that, that business is now coming back full speed. But what we're seeing and continue to see is very encouraging.  When we look at products like industrial hose and pneumatics that were up double digits in the quarter industrial supplies, hydraulic hose, seals, accessories up high single digits in the quarter, it's very, very encouraging for us. And then you look across the various metrics, whether it be the PMI number in June, which was 57.8 or capacity utilization, industrial production, all with arrows going up. Rigs count, our rigs count was up 500 over a year ago, and it's our highest in two years. So a lot of things to be bullish on and optimistic when you look at our Industrial business. Brian Sponheimer : And just, Carol, one on AP-to-inventory. Slight slowdown in the three months versus a year ago. If you're looking apples-to- apples kind of on a comp store basis, I guess how much of the deceleration would have been from the acquisitions as opposed to just maybe a little bit larger inventory growth than you're expecting? Carol Yancey : The issues on the inventory, the comments on the inventory, I would say, and we mentioned that inventory was up 6% without acquisitions versus the 9%, and what you're speaking to is a little bit of change there. I would say certainly, a portion of it is acquisitions and a fair portion of it. And then the other increases are probably more coming from \u2013 on the Automotive side. And again, looking at \u2013 a lot of it is looking at our inventory analytics and some of our predictive modeling and all that. And so we're working hard to get that inventory down in Automotive, but some of that is coming from just the depth and breadth of inventory that you've got to have in really getting into your supply chain and all the data analytics. But acquisitions, probably half of it, and the other part is just probably coming from the Automotive side. Brian Sponheimer : Much appreciate, best of luck. Paul Donahue : Yeah, thank Brian. Carol Yancey : Okay Brian. Operator : We'll go next to Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot, good morning to you. Paul Donahue : Good morning Matt. Matthew Fassler : So a couple of questions. The first is on Automotive, and I guess it's sort of a big-picture backdrop question. As you think about the aging of the fleet and where the surge is and air pockets are, et cetera, what are the ages that you think, critical ages ranges that are most important for the different pieces of your business, most notably thinking about commercial and then thinking about DIY? Paul Donahue : Yeah, so that number, Matt, kind of has shifted through the years, right. We have historically looked at that 6 to 12 year age group as the sweet spot for our DIFM business. And I don't think that has really moved at all. I still think that's the key age group for our DIFM business. As we look at our DIY business, I think that number continues to move out, so anywhere from 12 to 17 and 18. When you look at the average vehicle on the road today at 11.7 years and how well built and constructed cars are today, that number continues to move out, and we're seeing more and more older vehicles, 15-plus-year vehicles, at our stores and shopping in our DIY counter. So I don't think it's changed dramatically but probably a bit more on the DIY side. Matthew Fassler : And just thinking about your perspective on when VIO trends may have started to weigh on this space because within that 6 to 12 year range, we obviously had this massive depth, and I would imagine that there's maybe a little more volatility, and the impact, maybe more of a bit of a cliff impact. Do you feel like this has been a headwind for a while or are we just seeing it now? Was there a headwind that was perhaps masked by cold weather a couple of years ago? What's your best sense as to when this may have churned and when do you think it might start to rebound in your favor again? Paul Donahue : Yes, it's a great question, Matt, and I think it was masked. I think that when you go back a couple of years ago, when we were collectively, as an industry, pounding out strong mid to even high single-digit comps kind of quarter after quarter, I think it got masked. We had a couple of really harsh winters that probably drove a higher level of increase than what we attributed to weather. So I don't want to say they snuck up on it, but. certainly, I think last year and this year is having an impact. When we see that trailing off, we'll be really, as we get into back half of 2018 and 2019, we think it will be less of a factor than what it perhaps has been in the last couple of years. Matthew Fassler : Appreciate it. And then I have very quick follow-ups on the financial front. I'll just ask them together. The first is just directional color on the gross margin assumption embedded in your guidance. It's still roughly flattish year-on-year. And then the second one, I believe that the operating cash flow and free cash flow guidance came down a little bit more than the implied net income guidance. And that's with, I think, a CapEx number that's slightly lower. So did you round it down to the nearest $50 million? Or is there some nuance related to working capital or something else that may have changed for the business? Thank you. Carol Yancey : Yes, so on the cash flow question, we would say that was more of a working capital change. And we gave you a range, so that was kind of our best thinking at this time, and it would be working capital. And then as far as gross margin, I mean, look, we had a nice improvement through the six months. The quarter looks good. We were just under 30% last year, so we would hope to be right around 30%, which may give us a couple basis point improvement. So we should see it be a little bit better than the prior year. Matthew Fassler : Great. Thank you so much. Paul Donahue : Thanks Matt. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Bret Jordan of Jefferies. David Kelly : Hey good morning It's David Kelly on for Bret. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick follow-up on your DIY e-tail comments earlier and thinking about your out-performance in the category. Are you seeing any change in the DIY pricing environment, either a strategy shift from any of the traditional peers out there or anything notable from e-tailers trying to enter the market? Paul Donahue : No, it's been relatively the same, David. We're bullish on our retail business only because I think of the initiatives that we've put into play. And the initiatives, so the bar would settle fairly low for us. And when you look at what we focused on, the retail basics, it's store hours. It's having retail-focused personnel on the floor. It's having the right products on the counters.  So, I mean, really just an attention to the retail basics. And as that store count that we've gone through, what we call our Retail Impact initiative, we'll have 500 stores now at the end of the year. We started that a couple of years back. It's been a slow ramp-up, but it's now beginning to be a fairly significant chunk of our overall stores. So those stores are impacting our business. And as I've said, we had a good month of June now with both basket and ticket size going up for the first time in a few quarters. So it's good. But I think largely, it's the initiatives that we've put into play. David Kelly : Okay, great. Thanks Appreciate the color. And last one, a quick follow-up from me. We've long discussed and weighed in on some price inflation in Autos as well. Do you think that's skewed, just thinking out over the next 2 to 3 years, would that be skewed more towards commercial? Or could we also see some price inflation in DIY as well? Paul Donahue : Well, I think if we see inflation, David, which we're not opposed to as a distributor, I think you'll see it play out on the DIFM side, but I think you'll also perhaps see a bit on DIY. DIY would most likely be more in the chemicals and oil, which we've seen some increases in. So I honestly think you will, and if, and that's a big if because we have not seen inflation, as Carol pointed out, in a number of years. But if we get a bit more, I think, primarily on the DIFM side, but I think some of that will leak over into the DIY as well David Kelly : Alright great, thanks again. Paul Donahue : Yes you\u2019re welcome. Thank you David. Operator : We'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey guys, how are you doing? Paul Donahue : Hey good. Scot Ciccarelli : Great. Paul, I wanted to clarify some of your prior comments about the DIY outperforming commercial. Did that apply to the U.S.? Or was that on, just on a global basis? Paul Donahue : That's U.S., Scot. When we get into specific segments of the business, DIY, DIFM, we are really pulling those numbers from our U.S. business. The comments I was making earlier about our global business is the mix, like the mix in Australia, DIFM to DIY, is significantly different than it is in the U.S. But when we talk specific DIY increase or DIFM increase, we're referencing U.S. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. I just want to clarify because I think those two statements had blended into one another. So with that being said, obviously DIY performs better than commercial in the U.S. I know you talked about softer growth in fleet and major accounts. Obviously, that would act as a drag on the commercial business. But what is it that would impact, in your opinion, the commercial segment more than retail? Like if the drag is things like weather, the car park, et cetera, why wouldn't both segments be impacted about the same? Paul Donahue : Yes. So I want to just repeat something I just said a few minutes ago to David. When we see an increase on our DIY business, as we did in the quarter, and saw a nice increase in June, I think that is more indicative of the initiatives that we've put into play, Scot, versus the overall DIY segment of the automotive aftermarket. I made that comment in a bit tongue in cheek. The bar was set fairly low for us on the retail side. So when we embark on improving the retail basics in our store, we're bound to get a bit of a lift, and that's what we're now seeing. And part of it is also due to our Retail Impact initiative that we embarked on a couple of years ago to upgrade a number of our stores. Scot Ciccarelli : I got it. And yes, I've heard that commentary before. So you really think the reason DIY outperformed for you is the things you have done, not necessarily a change in the marketplace? Do you have any feel for a change in the marketplace? Do you think both segments performed about the same? Do you have any feel for that? Paul Donahue : Absolutely. Hard to say, I'll be anxious to hear the other public companies when they report, Scot. But look, I think that on the DIFM side, again, if I go back to some of the comments I made earlier with consecutive mild winters, the step-down in that or as referenced, that air pocket and our sweet spot of vehicles, that's impacting, that\u2019s certainly is impacting the DIFM side. But again, I think it's transitory, and I think we'll begin to move away from that as we move into 2018 and beyond. Scot Ciccarelli : Got you. And just a housekeeping item. Was there anything else to note on the corporate expense? Was there a pension adjustment? I didn't hear that mentioned. Or is it just the labor and IT investments that were already highlighted? Carol Yancey : Yes. there was no pension or non-recurring adjustments. What we would really point to is the investments that we're making, be it in our digital initiatives, which are global across all of our businesses, IT investments, which could be in warehouse management, productivity, inventory modeling to IT security, and then payroll and then legal and professional, which is somewhat related to acquisitions.  So, and look, when you look at it, that's the majority of it. We gave you a little bit higher guidance in that area, but that's, we gave you a range. We hope to do better in there, but you certainly sometimes get non-recurring, onetime items in there but hopefully, we've covered that in our range. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay, thanks guys. Paul Donahue : Alright Scot. Thank you. Operator : At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing or additional remarks. Carol Yancey : We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's conference call. We appreciate your interest and support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to talking to you after our third quarter results. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead Sir. Sid Jones : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company third quarter 2017 conference call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses. The Company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. We'll begin today with comments from our President and CEO, Paul Donahue. Paul? Paul Donahue : Thank you Sid, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. As always we appreciate you taking the time to be with it. Earlier today we released our third quarter results. I\u2019ll make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2017. After that we will open the call to your question. To get us started, let's recap our third quarter sales and earnings performance across our global automotive, industrial, office and electrical operations.  Total GPC sales were up 4% to $4.1 billion with net income at 158 million and earnings per share at $1.08. These results include approximately $18.5 million in pretax transaction cost primarily related to the previously announced acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group in Europe or AAG which we look to close in November. The $0.48 per share impact of these cost, adjusted earnings per share were $1.16 compared to $1.24 in the third quarter last year. As a diversified global distributor we continue to benefit from the balance of serving a broad range of geographies and end markets. While our US automotive, office and electrical businesses are operating in challenging end markets today, our industrial and international automotive businesses are operating in a more favorable market conditions and generating stronger growth. To that end, our investment in AAG, a leading European based automotive parts distributor, which we'll discuss later in our remarks underscores the growth opportunities we see internationally.  In total, the diversity in our operations combined with an ongoing strategy to drive both organic and acquisitive growth enabled us to deliver a 4% total sales increase despite the challenging operating environment, one less billing day in the third quarter relative to last year and the disruption caused by three hurricanes and an earthquake in Mexico. Total comparable sales were up 1% in the third quarter and we stand at plus 1% for the nine months through September. While positive this was below our expectation for 2% organic growth in the second half, which we were targeting to our share of wallet and digital initiatives as well as the ongoing expansion of our products and service offering. As a result, our net margins continue to be pressured in the third quarter. As we will discuss, in addition to organic growth we are looking at opportunities to capture cost saving and enhance productivity which will enable us to increase margins despite pressures on the topline.  Turning to our acquisition strategy, we believe the ongoing headwinds in key markets and geographies continue to provide opportunities for accretive transactions. The acquisitions we have made to-date knows we may execute going forward are intended to grow our businesses and further enhance our footprint so that we may capitalize on the upturn in our markets and create additional shareholder value.  Through the third quarter we have acquired businesses with approximately $215 million in annual revenues and made a minority investment in Inenco, a market leading industrial distributor in Australia. Acquisitions added 2% to sales in the third quarter and we anticipate that each of these new businesses will positively contribute to our further results. For the fourth quarter we have announced plans to add three additional businesses AGG and Monroe Motor Products in the automotive group and Apache Hose & Belting Company in the industrial segment with total estimated annual revenues of $2 billion.  We are excited to expand our global platform with these new businesses and look forward to their future contributions in both the quarters and years ahead. Turning to our global automotive operations, automotive was 52% of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2017. For the quarter, our total automotive sales were up 3.6% from last year consistent with the second quarter and with comparable sales on a global basis up approximately 1%. In our US operations total sales were up 2% in the third quarter, with flat comparable sales. Across our customer segments, comparable sales to retail/DIY customers continue to outperform our sales to commercial accounts. On the commercial side of the business, sales remain pressured by slow demand across our customer base with sales to NAPA AutoCare centers and major accounts down just slightly. Our major account business fluctuated by customer and we see a number of major accounts where we performed quite well but we also have a number of other accounts where we are off year-over-year.  We're pleased to report a slight uptick in our fleet business in September especially in the energy and ag markets. This is the segment of our commercial business that has been challenged most of the year. We look at our product groups, batteries, rotating electrical, tools and equipment, and heavy duty sales all posted positive gains while categories such as ride control, exhaust, and heating and cooling remained soft consistent with the second quarter. These sales trends correlate to the warmer than average winter weather and milder summer temps both of which extended the pressure on demand. By geographical region, the mountain region which experienced the harshest 2016 weather conditions in the country continue to outperform. And the northeast and the western division also had solid results in the quarter. Likewise despite the impact of Hurricane Harvey, the southwest division generated a slight Q3 sales increase. The southeast division had a more difficult quarter as it dealt with Hurricane Irma, but we would expect our business in both of these regions to snap back in the fourth quarter. The Atlantic, Central and Midwest regions all underperformed. Turning to retail, we continue to produce solid mid-single digit sales comps via several initiatives. Our growing NAPA rewards program is available in-store and online and now has more than 5.5 million members. This program has helped drive consistent retail growth and we continue to experience higher retail tickers and more frequent visits from our NAPA rewards members underscoring the program success. We continue to look at ways to further expand and enhance NAPA rewards in 2018.  We're also making progress with our retail impact initiative, the 350 stores updated for this initiative through September which is up from 275 in June continue to outperform our overall retail growth with high-single digit retail sales comps. We are very pleased with these results which exceeded our expectations and we remain on track to have approximately 500 of these retail impact stores completed by the end of 2017. The retail end customer has more choices today than ever before, so it is encouraging to see our initiatives driving sustained growth in the NAPA retail segment. We also expect our ongoing acquisitions to positively contribute to both our commercial and retail sales. In addition to the three automotive store group acquisitions and Stone Truck Parts added to our US network earlier this year. We announced this morning the addition of Monroe Motor Products through our automotive parts business effective November 1 of this year. Monroe a 100-year old auto parts chain is based in Rochester, New York. This leading regional player with $25 million in revenues, 17 stores and a large hub, filled the significant void for our US automotive parts business in the Rochester trading area. We are pleased to welcome Michael Gordon and Monroe team to GPC family and look forward to working with them to expand our market share in the Rochester market. Across our US automotive aftermarket, the long-term fundamental drivers for our business remains sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow, the average age of the fleet is up 11.7 years. Field prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post steady gains. Total miles driven increased 0.8% in July and are up 1.5% year-to-date. The national average price of gasoline was $2.76 in September, up $0.30 from June and more than $0.40 from last year. We can expect to see further increases in miles driven albeit at a slower rate.  Despite these sound fundamentals and the benefit of our US automotive acquisitions, which are meeting our expectations and driving sales growth, our organic growth has been below expectations. Cyclical factors such as two consecutive mild winters and vehicle age demographics has created a challenging environment. While we expect these industry conditions to improve in the quarters and year ahead, we are also focused on pulling the levers we do have control over to ensure we are well positioned as market conditions improve. To that end we're taking a close look at cost and productivity measures across this business and will be implementing initiatives to enable us to more quickly respond to market changes and ensure we are achieving an improved productivity and efficiency wherever possible. So now let's turn to our international automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada and Mexico. These operations account for nearly one-third of our global automotive revenues and as a group delivered a 5% total sales increase including a 3% comparable sales increase in local currency. In Australia and New Zealand, third quarter sales were up low-to-mid single digits driven by a slight increase in comparable sales and the ongoing benefit of acquisitions. The Asia Pac business operated with 559 total stores across Australasia in the third quarter and has plans for further store expansion in the future. We were pleased to bulk on strategically important tool and equipment distributor to our New Zealand operation in Q3. The combination of so called tool and equipment and Repco positions our team as the number one player in the equipment market as well as giving us access to a new range of customers. Further, the underlying fundamentals for the Australasian aftermarket remains solid with a growing car part driven by record car sales, relatively low gas prices, and upward trends in miles driven. Turning to NAPA Canada, both total sales and comparable sales strengthened further in the third quarter increasing in the mid to high single digit range from last year. We achieved this growth was strong execution of our strategy along with the favorable Canadian aftermarket sales climate. Areas of outsized growth continue to be our heavy duty truck parts business, our paint business, and our overall business in Western Canada. Finally in Mexico, our sales remains strong growing by high-single digits and reflecting our continued expansion of the NAPA Mexico footprint. Today, we have 39 total stores with plans to open additional stores in the quarters ahead. Before concluding our review of the automotive segment, we want to spend a few minutes on our pending acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group. This acquisition is valued at $2 billion and is expected to generate an estimated annual revenues of US$1.7 billion while also delivering accretive margins and positive net cash flows. As a reminder, we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings in the first year after closing. For 2018, incremental diluted earnings per share is estimated at $0.45 to $0.50 and adjusted earnings per share which excludes the amortization of acquisition-related intangible is estimated at $0.65 to $0.70.  With this acquisition we\u2019ll enter the European markets with critical scale in a leading market position and we are looking forward to working with the very talented AAG team to build on this strength and drive continued outperformance. AAG is poised to contribute significant sales growth and earnings accretion to GPC and also tariffs to enhance the GPC platform for long-term sustainable expansion across the global automotive parts industry. We have received all applicable regulatory approvals to proceed with this acquisition and expect to close in November. We can also report that just last week AAG received final regulatory approval and closed down their acquisition of Group Auto Poland. So we entered the fourth quarter with a continued focus on accelerating our comp sales growth, while also focusing - while also looking forward to the opportunities presented by our pending acquisitions and longer term acquisition strategy. Turning now to our industrial business, motion industries represented 30% of our third quarter total GPC revenues and was up 7.1% in the quarter. This is consistent with the strong growth we saw in the first and second quarters and includes a 4% comparable sales increase which is also consistent with the first half of 2017.  We remain encouraged by the continued strength in our industrial sales thus far in 2017 which reflects both improving organic growth and acquisitions. In addition, the industry has benefited from favorable market conditions as broad-based industrial indicators such as industrial production and the PMI index as well as rig counts and the level of exported goods have all trended positive. These factors drive greater customer demand across the diverse markets we serve and we expect to see this continue in the quarters ahead. A review of our motion business by industry sector, product category and top customers shows that we are performing well across all operations. Of our top 12 industries, ten sectors showed solid sales including top performing areas such as iron and steel, lumber and wood, equipment rental and leasing, oil and gas equipment, equipment and machinery, and aggregate and cement. So industrial solid third quarter and nine month performance was broad based. Finally, as announced this morning we expect motion to close on the caution of Apache Hose & Belting Company on November 1.  Apache is based Cedar Rapids, Iowa and is the premier distributor specializing in the value added fabrication of belts, hoses, and cut and molded products used in a wide array of industries and applications. Apache servers both the industrial and ag markets, and combined with motion creates a market leading value added offering in the belting and hose business. We expect Apache to generate estimated annual revenues of $100 million and we look forward to working with Tom Pientok the Apache team to further build on this business. In summary, we are encouraged by the solid results in our industrial business thus in 2017 and see no slowdown in sight for the quarters ahead. Turning now to EIS, electrical distribution segment which was 5% of the company\u2019s total third quarter revenue. Sales for this group were up 11.6% in the third quarter due primarily to the Empire Wire and Supply acquisition on April 1. The addition of Empire further expanded EIS\u2019 wire and cable business and in particular it strengthens our overall capabilities to serve the industrial robotics and automation market. This new business continues to perform well as does the overall wire and cable segment. Our core electrical business including fabrication operations have softened slightly from the first half of the year.  We expect these trends to stabilize and overall we continue to look for solid total sales growth at EIS in the quarters ahead. And now a few comments on our office products business, which was 12% of the company's Q3 revenue. The office products group reported a 4.7% decrease in both total sales and comparable sales as the ongoing decline in demand for traditional office supplies continue to pressure sales across all our channels. The exception to our decline in comp sales trend would be other facilities, break room and safety supplies category which is growing significantly and now stands at approximately 35% of total sales for the office group. Unfortunately the sales increase for this important product group was not enough to offset the decrease in sales of traditional office supplies, furniture and tech products. Our third quarter results are consistent with recent sales trends and highlights significance of our efforts to expand SVR\u2019s products and services offering in the large and growing FBS market. While our team has done a solid job of executing our strategy to diversify the segment with deteriorating trends and the changing landscape of the industry including the strategic shift inside our customer base we are reviewing whether the current plan is adequate for sustained growth and profitability in accordance with our long-term objectives.  So that recaps our consolidated and business segment sales results for the third quarter. Overall total sales of plus 4% were relatively consistent with the first six months of 2017. Given our margin profile however our challenge is to overcome the industry wide headwinds in the US automotive, office and electrical segments of our business and produce stronger organic growth. This is essential as we look to build on the opportunities presented by our acquisition strategy and improve our profitability. So with that I'll hand it over to Carol who will provide you a financial update and our updated outlook for the year. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you Paul, we\u2019ll begin with the review of our key financial information and then we will provide our updated outlook for 2017. Our total sales in the third quarter were at 3.9% including 1% increase in comparable revenues. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29.95% compared to 30.4% last year. The decrease is due primarily to lower supplier incentives recorded in the quarter associated with lower than expected purchasing volume. In addition, we experienced product mix shift in several of our businesses, US automotive, office and electric which also pressured our margins.  For the nine months gross margin of 29.9% remains fairly steady with the prior year as the more favorable gross margin trends in the first six months mostly offset this quarter's decline. With that said we remain focused on enhancing our gross margin through several key initiatives including continued supplier negotiations, the ongoing investment in a more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies as well as improved analytic capabilities around SKU profitability. We continue to see a somewhat inflationary pricing environment across our businesses in the third quarter with each of our businesses showing at least slight inflation through the nine months of the year. Our cumulative supplier price changes through September stand at 0.3% increase for automotive, 1.8% increase for industrial, 0.6% increase for our office and increase of 1.3% for electrical.  Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses for the third quarter were 981 million or 962 million before the 18.5 million in transaction costs, primarily related to our pending European acquisition. On an adjusted basis, our total expenses were up 6% from last year and at 23.5% of sales and we continue to experience the de-leveraging of expenses associated with the slower organic sales environment in several of our businesses. In addition rising labor, freight and delivery, IT and digital investments as well as continued acquisition costs are also driving our increase in operating expenses. These items are offsetting our previously planned cost savings initiatives as Paul mentioned before, but we have another round of plans and initiatives underway to further capture additional cost savings and enhance our productivity. Streamlining our cost structure is essential to improve our profitability and we have several action plans underway to accomplish this goal. Some specific examples include further consolidation or closing of select facilities including distribution centers, branches and underperforming stores.  Our past efforts in this area are positively impacting our operations and they serve to maintain our total headcount at relatively flat, despite the addition of several acquisitions during the year. With that said, we recognized the need as well as the opportunities for even greater operational efficiencies as well as more significant cost savings. Additionally, we're piloting a variety of cost savings programs to improve our exposure to the increasing freight and delivery costs.  While some of these initiatives will take some time to produce meaningful benefits, the expected savings will position us for improved profitability in the quarter and years ahead. So although we have much work ahead of us, we\u2019re excited for the opportunity to achieve a lower cost highly effective distribution infrastructure for our businesses. Now we\u2019ll discuss the results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the third quarter at 2.2 billion was up 3.6% from the prior year and our operating profit at 178 million is down 10%, with an operating margin of 8.2% compared to 9.4% margin in the third quarter of last year. We're very disappointed with the margin decline in automotive, which we attribute to several factors including lower supplier incentives and a product mix shift to lower margin products including more commodities, which impacted our gross margins as well as the deleveraging of expenses and a rise in expenses such as freight and delivery, legal and professional, insurance and ongoing wage pressures.  These headwinds were especially extreme in the quarter given our expectations for somewhat stronger comparable sales growth especially in the US automotive group. Our industrial sales of 1.2 billion in the quarter were 7% increase from the prior year. Operating profit of 95 million is up a strong 10.5% and our operating margin has improved to 7.6% compared to 7.4% last year as this segment continues to benefit from both organic and acquisitive sales growth as well as improved gross margins and SG&A leverage. Office products revenues of 510 million were down 5% from last year and their operating profit of 24 million is down 21% with an operating margin of 4.7%. The margin for office remains under pressure due to the accelerated decline in organic sales and deleveraging of expenses. In addition this segment had a fairly significant decrease in supplier incentives in the quarter. As Paul commented earlier we're currently reviewing our plans to address those trends in this business.  The electrical electronic group sales were 199 million in the quarter, up 12% from 2016. Operating profit of 13.5 million is down 5% and the margin for this group is 6.8%. so despite strong total sales growth, organic sales remains challenged for EIS and it continues to pressure our margins. We\u2019re also impacted by going customer and product mix shifts which are offsetting the positive impact of their cost savings initiatives in this business. So our total operating profit in the third quarter was down 5% and our operating profit margin of 7.6% compared to 8.3% last year. So a challenging quarter which we expect to correct in the quarters ahead through gross margin and operating expense initiatives that we discussed earlier. We had net interest at 8.2 million in the quarter, up 3 million from the prior year due to an increase in our debt levels and certain variable interest rates. With these factors in mind, we\u2019re updating our net interest expense to be in the range of 26 to 27 million for the year excluding any financing costs for the pending AAG acquisition. Our total amortization expense was 11.8 million for the third quarter as compared to 10.3 million last year. We currently expect our full-year amortization to be approximately 46 million, which excludes the amortization associated with the pending AAG acquisition.  Our depreciation expense of 28.4 million for the quarter is up slightly from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect total depreciation to be in the range of 110 to 120 million and on a combined basis, we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately 155 to 165 million. The other line which primarily reflects corporate expense was 43.9 million for the quarter. This includes 18.5 million in transaction costs primarily related to the pending AAG acquisition. Excluding these costs, this line is up 4 million from the 21 million last year essentially due to the $7 million gain recorded in the prior year for a sale of real estate last year. So overall our corporate expenses are trending down slightly from 2016 despite higher costs associated with personnel, legal and professional, IT, security and digital which we\u2019re managing very carefully. For 2017, we continue to expect corporate expense to be in the range of 105 to 115 million range. This excludes the transaction cost as noted above.  Our tax rate for the third quarter was 35.7 compared to 36.4 last year. The decrease in the quarterly and year-to-date rates primarily relates to a higher mix of foreign earnings which are taxed at lower rates. And in addition the recently adopted change in accounting for stock-based compensation has also positively impacted our 2017 rates. For the full year we expect our tax rate to be approximately 35.5%. So now let's turn to a discussion of the balance sheet which remains strong and in excellent condition. Account receivable of 2.2 billion is up 6% from the prior year. This is in line with our average daily sales growth for September. We also remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at quarter end was 3.4 billion, up 7% from last year and this has improved from the 9% year-over-year increase reported in June. In addition, excluding acquisitions and FX, our inventory is up 4% year-over-year and up just less than 1% from the year end.  We're very focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable of 3.3 billion at September 30 is up 6% despite slower purchasing activity across several of our businesses, most notably in the US automotive group. Offsetting these lower purchases is the ongoing benefit of improved payment terms with our suppliers as well as acquisitions. At September 30 of 2017, AP to inventory ratio was 98%. Our working capital of 1.5 billion at September 30 is consistent with the prior year and down from year end. Overall we continue to maintain a relatively steady level of working capital from quarter to quarter but we're certainly not satisfied at our current levels. We're currently looking for opportunities to further improve on our working capital management.  Our total debt of 1.1 billion at September 30 has remained fairly steady over the last several quarters although it's up from September a year ago from 775 million. Our average cost of the debt is a low 2.49% and in today's low rate environment we're comfortably using our strong balance sheet and financial capacity to finance our pending European acquisition, which will add approximately 2 billion in debt to our balance sheet. AAG represents an excellent growth opportunity for GPC and we're comfortable with our anticipated capital structure with debt at approximately two times EBITDA. So in summary, our balance sheet will remain a key strength of the company. Thus far, in 2017, we\u2019ve generated cash from operations of 542 million and we're updating our full year cash from operations to approximately 750 million to 800 million and free cash flow, which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend, in the $200 million to $250 million range. While lower than previously estimated, our cash flow remains solid and it supports our ongoing priorities for the use of cash, which we believe starts to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities remain the dividend, reinvestment in our businesses, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. Our 2017 annual dividend of $2.70 per share marks our 61st consecutive year of increased dividend paid to our shareholders. This represents approximately 57% of our prior year earnings and a 3% dividend yield. We look forward to recommending our 62nd consecutive dividend increase in 2018. Our investment in capital expenditures was 43 million in the third quarter and stands at 97 million for the nine months. For the year, we continue to plan for capital expenditures in the range of 140 million to 150 million. Over the first nine months of the year, we purchased approximately 1.9 million shares of our stock and today, we have 17.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. This includes the 15 million share authorization that was approved by our board of directors at their August board meeting. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with a dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. So that concludes our financial update for the third quarter of 2017. And in summary, we are not satisfied with our current results and we're taking further action to enhance our gross margins and streamline our cost structure across all of our businesses. We're absolutely focused in these areas and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress. So now, let's turn to our guidance for 2017. Based on our current performance, our growth plans and initiatives and the current market conditions, we\u2019re updating our full-year 2017 guidance as follows. We're increasing our total sales guidance to the plus 4% to plus 4.5% range from our previous guidance of plus 3% to plus 4%. This outlook includes the benefit of our acquisitions closed through September 30 as well as the Apache and Monroe acquisitions announced today, which will close on November 1, but no other future acquisitions.  We currently expect the slight benefit from currency translation for the full year. By business, we're updating our sales outlook for the automotive side to approximately 3.5% from the previous plus 3% to plus 4%. We're updating sales for industrial to plus 5.5% to plus 6% from our previous plus 4% to plus 5%. We're updating sales for the office segment to approximately 2% from the previous plus 2% to plus 3%. And finally, we\u2019re updating sales for the Electrical segment to plus 8% to plus 9% from our prior guidance of plus 7% to plus 8%. On the earnings side, we\u2019re updating our guidance for the full year earnings per share to $4.47 to $4.52 per share. We're also guiding to an adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.55 to $4.60, which compares to our prior outlook of $4.70 to $4.75.  Our adjusted earnings per share excludes any fourth quarter 2017 revenue, earnings or expenses, including transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of AAG as well as the transaction costs reported in the third quarter of 2017 as noted in our press release and today's call. We would add that our outlook for adjusted earnings per share reflects our expectation for a slight increase in fourth quarter earnings relative to fourth quarter of 2016. So while we underperformed in the third quarter, we're taking the corrective action necessary to improve our profitability in the quarter and years ahead. With that said, we close by saying thank you to all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work day in and day out. At this point, I'll turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. We enter the fourth quarter focused on generating stronger organic sales growth as well as maximizing the benefits of our acquisitions. Next month, we expect to close on the Alliance Automotive Group in Europe as well as the Apache and Monroe Motor Parts acquisitions announced earlier today. We believe in the long term benefits of our acquisition strategy and are excited to add these businesses to our operations.  As mentioned before, we also move forward intensely focused on the plans and initiatives underway to reduce costs and improve our profitability, with the objective of enhancing gross margins and building a highly productive, cost effective infrastructure. While this has always been our focus, we understand we need to take steps now to be more nimble in challenging environments and ensuring we are positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the market begins to recover.  We have consistently stated that our business is fit best under the GPC umbrella, we also continually assess the contribution of each business to our long term financial objectives for sustained revenue growth, cash flow generation and profitability. Although we are not satisfied with this quarter\u2019s results, we are optimistic with the opportunities that lie ahead and we move forward with a heightened sense of urgency as we focus on maximizing shareholder value and positioning the company for long term success. So with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to the operator and Carol and I will take your questions. Operator : And we'll go first to Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Could you talk a little about the cadence in auto as the quarter went, were there any particularly weak or strong months in the period? Paul Donahue : Yeah. The good news, Bret, is that the month of September was, for the US group, was our best month of the quarter. August was a little softer, but as I said, September, we rebounded nicely on an average daily sales basis. If we look across our total automotive business, similar pattern. September was the strongest of the three months for global automotive business. Bret Jordan : Okay. And how do you think you did relative to the underlying market, as you sort of look across the board and I guess it's hard to see everybody is POS, but do you think you\u2019re relatively keeping pace or were there any supply issues? Paul Donahue : No. Look, I would -- being the first one now, Bret, we haven't had the advantage of seeing our competitors\u2019 numbers, but with flat comp numbers in the US, I'm guessing we're within range of most. I don't believe we're giving up market share as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We saw nice growth in our DIY business. Again, I think that\u2019s directly related to the things that we're doing and the initiatives we have in play. We saw a little bit of softness in the DIFM business, but again, we've got, I think, initiatives to get that turned as we head into the homestretch here. Bret Jordan : Okay. On the margins in auto, you talked about the supplier incentive being down as well as the negative mix. Could you kind of bucket those and I guess from a supplier standpoint, I'm hearing a lot across the board, people trying to get their inventory levels down, have you taken within your total inventories, the auto content down and maybe if you could just sort of, within the margin, talk about how much is lower incentive versus lower margin mix? Carol Yancey : Yeah. Bret, I\u2019ll answer that in two ways. One is specifically to automotive margins, which were down 120 basis points in the quarter. I would say three predominant factors that have equal weight. One would be the lower rebates. The other would be the lower organic sales that we had planned for better organic sales. And then the other would be the SG&A, which is not only the leverage issue, but it\u2019s some of the costs we pointed out, be it IT, digital, wage pressures.  I mean, look, automotive headcount is flat, but when you layer in the wage pressures, the cost of insurance benefits, that\u2019s weighing on there and the other thing in SG&A that we\u2019ve called out is the delivery, the freight, the diesel feel. That really wasn't anticipated. There was definitely some spikes up related to some supply issues and the hurricanes and for us, the cost of delivery was a factor and so that\u2019s the automotive margins. And then just when you look at the total gross profit in the quarter, we were down 46 basis points. 20 of that was related to the volume incentive in rebates and that's a combination of automotive and office. Bret Jordan : Was there any AAG expense in the auto and the SG&A in the quarter? Carol Yancey : No, the cost that we called out, the 18.5 million is all in the corporate expense, other line and none of it flowed through the operating margins. Bret Jordan : Okay. And since you said the word hurricane, what do you think you lost to the hurricanes in the quarter? Carol Yancey : Well, from a sales standpoint, it\u2019s half a point. And that\u2019s pretty representative across all four of our segments. It was a little bit higher in industrial and there is an impact on the profit side as well. So, we believe that was probably a penny or two in the quarter as it relates to that, but definitely a half a point on the sales. Paul Donahue : But, Bret, we haven't been through these before our expectations and especially in the Southwest and our guys in the Southwest were obviously overwhelmed with Hurricane Harvey, the guys in the Southeast were -- we think we lost a couple of points in the Southeast with Irma. We do expect we'll see a snapback. Now, how quickly that comes, exactly when that comes, we think it will be in the fourth quarter, but we do expect there will be a little bit of a snapback. We sold a lot of generators, supplies, mops, brooms, buckets, bottled water, et cetera, but we would hope to see some hard parts bouncing back in Q4 as folks recover. Carol Yancey : And Bret, I don\u2019t think I answered your inventory question for automotive. Primarily, our industrial business has made the improvement in inventory, but I would tell you sequentially from Q2 to Q3, automotive did take some inventory out of the system. So, there is more work to be done there, but we are keeping a mindful eye on the level of inventory and as it relates to these volume incentives. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Another couple of auto margin questions actually. You guys just talked about roughly equal impacts from rebates and spending and deleverage, would you expect all those pressures to kind of continue on a go forward basis or why wouldn\u2019t they continue, number one. Number two, are you guys starting to see a more competitive environment on the pricing front. Historically, this industry hasn\u2019t experienced that, but just given the magnitude of margin swing, which is bigger than what we've seen in the last decade pretty much, just trying to figure out if there's something else that we need to be aware of. Thanks. Carol Yancey : Yeah. I'll start with this and then I\u2019ll let Paul comment on the pricing side. As it relates specifically to some of the things we\u2019ve called out, factored into our guidance, the $0.15 lowering guidance, we have contemplated some similar numbers as it relates to the volume incentives for the rest of the year as well as some of this SG&A pressure, because I don't think that's going to alleviate too quickly.  Having said that, and Paul mentioned this, we're now moving to some further steps that need to be taken. So, while we had made changes related on having a level of comparable sales, since we're not there, we're going to kind of the next set of changes. So it takes us a couple of quarters to come out, but I think the volume incentives, certainly that would be assumed to recur and that's what factored into our guidance adjustments. Paul Donahue : Scot, relative to market pricing pressures, I can tell you that, as it has been in recent years, the pricing atmosphere across the automotive aftermarket is pretty stable and pretty famed fortunately. As we look at our primary competitors, there has not been folks out there trying to lead with price. With that said, I will tell you that internally, we are reviewing our pricing approach, our approach to pricing in the market. One of the things that we've -- our team has begun to implement is looking at zone pricing, which is not new for most retailers, but it is new perhaps for NAPA. So that is something that we are in the process of implementing and we believe will have a positive impact on our overall margins. Scot Ciccarelli : I appreciate that. I guess what I was just trying to think through is, one of the concerns industry, you guys are aware of this, is pricing transparency, given kind of the online competition. I know you guys effectively sell a private label product. Are there any concerns that pricing transparency where you do see stuff, margins maybe 15% to 20% less at an online competitor as opposed to an automotive specialist could wind up creating that price pressure, just broadly for the environment? Paul Donahue : Yeah. Listen, I've Scot, am I -- are we concerned? Sure, we're concerned and it's something that we pay very, very close attention to. I will tell you I had the privilege of sitting through a session last week, we had eight of our largest and best NAPA auto care centers here in the building and so our folks coming in and talking to these folks about online pricing and what they see in the marketplace, sure, they are. Is it driving their decision making in terms of how they're pricing their job? They're not. And so, is it a concern? It is. But, do we believe that the pricing transparency is having a negative impact on our margins? We don't think so at this point. Carol Yancey : And Scot, one other thing I\u2019d mention that we didn\u2019t really talk about, the product mix in the quarter for automotive, Paul mentioned the categories that performed well, be it tools and equipment, batteries, rotating electrical, those are typically at lower gross margin. The ones that didn't perform as well under car heating and cooling that relates to weather the mild winters or the mild summers, those are more the higher gross margins. So we did have some mix shift in our gross margin for automotive in the quarter. Hard to say what that\u2019s going to be in Q4, but that's not necessarily indicative of online issues. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Just wanted to talk about the difference between DIFM and DIY, can you maybe just provide a little commentary on, because I know obviously a lot of it\u2019s a self help, you\u2019re kind of just low base, but you\u2019re also kind of resetting the stores, so can you maybe talk about the DIY performance of the stores you aren\u2019t resetting and kind of where you think industry trends are in DIY? And then I have a related follow-up. Paul Donahue : Yeah. So you hit on it exactly, Chris. We certainly think that we are outpacing the rest of the industry and that's largely due to the initiatives that we've spoken to over the last number of quarters on these calls. Our team has improved the look in 350 stores. We have another 150 slated for the balance of the year. The stores that we have reset, we are seeing high single digit increases in our retail business. Those stores, we have not reset, we are seeing mid-single digit to lower single digit increases. But the good news in our DIY business, our ticket count is up, our traffic count, so the number of tickets is up and again, I give credit to our team and the good job that they're doing in the field. We\u2019re getting folks into our stores today that perhaps were not our shoppers in previous years. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. And then kind of like more of an industry question. I would think DIFM is selling a younger car, the DIY, so wondering just like air pockets and lapping troughs are, is there, I guess, what is there a chance, like we\u2019re seeing this first in DIFM, maybe that\u2019s one reason why DIFM is slowing down a little bit harder quicker and then two, is it just something about DIY that\u2019s in general where some of the product sales are less tied to vehicle age, just any thoughts there would be appreciated. Paul Donahue : Well, I think your point is accurate. Chris. I think that trough that we've seen is absolutely impacting the DIFM. So, going back through the recession, \u201908, \u201909 and even believe into a little bit of \u201910, whereas we would normally be seeing 17 million, 18 million vehicle counts coming into our sweet spot. They're coming in at a much reduced rate. So I absolutely believe that is impacting the DIFM side. And then when you look at, as it relates to DIY, when you have an average vehicle now on the road at 11.7 years, we're seeing and a lot of cars coming in, 13, 14, 15 year old vehicles that to your point they\u2019re ending up coming into our stores and taking the DIY route more so than the DIFM route. So I think your point is valid. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. And so I\u2019m being highly greedy here, but just one critical question. For the Poland [ph] acquisition, was that included in your original estimate or is that going to be left technically now that you\u2019ve pulled with it? Carol Yancey : You\u2019re talking about the earnings per share number that we gave you for 2018? Chris Bottiglieri : Yeah. Carol Yancey : That assumed the Poland acquisition. Chris Bottiglieri : The Poland acquisition is in that [indiscernible]. Carol Yancey : It was. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : A couple of follow-up questions. First on automotive margins. One relates to whether you're seeing any trend between private label, which I think is the bulk of your volume at NAPA relative to brands, so whether that\u2019s having any impact on margin and mix? And then also we\u2019ve heard a lot about vendor incentives in industrial over the years, we\u2019ve heard less about it in auto. If you could just kind of talk to us, is this a new innovation or is it just frankly that delta in your sales versus expectations that's leading us to hear a bit more about it here in 2017? Paul Donahue : Yeah. Matt, I'll take the first part of that. I\u2019ll let Carol touch on vendor incentives. As it relates to private label versus brand and the impact on margin, 90% of what we sell in the US stores, Matt, is NAPA branded products. We do sell OE parts through our acquisition we did a number of years ago through our all term business, but 90% of what we sell is private brand and we haven't seen a significant shift away from private label, from our NAPA brand into the OE brand. And as it relates to the vendor incentives, I\u2019ll let Carol touch on that. Carol Yancey : Yeah. Look, I would say in general, it\u2019s a -- you're right, we talk more about it on the industrial side because it is a little bigger component of their margins. It\u2019s not as large of a component on the automotive margins, but having said that, it's something that we factor in to our profitability each year and we do it based on achieving certain volume levels and purchasing levels. And as we again contemplated through the first six months, we expected stronger comparable growth for the second half and as we got into third quarter, our purchases were actually down something like 6%. So -- and again, we could have made a decision to go out and buy that inventory regardless of needing it to get those volume levels, but we're working hard on keeping that inventory down. So we just felt it was appropriate to adjust our rebate assumptions. Having said that, that's not anything new. It's more of a function of the lower organic sales.  Now, I\u2019d point out on the motion side, look, having a core growth of 3% to 4% on the industrial side and we\u2019ve talked about their incentives over the years, all the improvements they\u2019ve done, and you see what it does with leverage and you\u2019re saying the 20 basis point improvement and that's not all just incentives and volume rebates. That's just the core business. Matt Fassler : Understood. If I could ask a quick follow-up, actually in the office business. It sounds like that business is somehow on a bit of a shorter leash at this point, are you \u2013 is this business still part of your long term plans, at what point do you think you'll decide on that question? Paul Donahue : Yeah. So Matt, as we've talked before in these calls and one on one meeting, look, we review every one of our businesses and we have four different businesses we go to market auto and industrial and of course office and electrical. And we review them all and we review all of our geographical regions as well and all need to meet the expectations that we have, both on the volume -- top line and bottom line. And in the past, we have -- as I think we've talked, we have moved away from businesses that failed to meet those expectations. All that said Matt, there is no intention at this point to move away from our office products business.  We're in the midst of a multi-year diversification strategy and honestly, the growth that we're seeing in facilities, breakroom and safety, which is now, gosh, it's 35 plus percent of our overall business, we're seeing good -- we're seeing good movement and we're seeing good trends. The challenge that we have, it\u2019s that core -- the core office supply business. And unfortunately, the growth we\u2019re seeing in FPS is not, right now, is not able to make up for the decline we're seeing in the core. But I will tell you, just like all of our businesses that we watch and monitor very closely and we certainly expect our office group to step up just like all of our businesses.  The last thing I would say Matt on office is, there has been a bit of a change in customer dynamics. So, one of the big, well, there is only two. So, one of the big players that went private is making certain procurement decisions, which has had an impact on the wholesalers as well. So yeah, we've got a number of challenges, but our team I believe is addressing them and I still am positive about the outlook going forward. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Seth Basham, Wedbush. Seth Basham : Sorry to return to the question around auto margins, but just a little bit more clarity. In terms of the 120 basis point decline in EBIT margins, can you give us a little bit more sense of how much of it was gross versus SG&A de-leverage. Carol Yancey : It was slightly more on the gross margin side than the SG&A side, because again what I mentioned was the rebates for them and then the lower organic growth and then we had some product mix shift. So a little bit more so on gross margin than SG&A. Seth Basham : Got it. That's helpful. And in terms of the performance of independent versus company-owned stores in the US, was there much difference? Paul Donahue : No, not really, Seth. Our flat comp that we saw across the business in the quarter was pretty consistent, both with our independence and our company-owned stores as well. So not a big variance there. Seth Basham : Got it. And then lastly, as it relates to your thought process around store and facility closures, how are you thinking about that if at all differently now in the auto segment based on the sluggishness that you've seen over a number of quarters? Paul Donahue : So, Seth, let me take that in two parts. From a distribution center standpoint, we've got a vast distribution network, 47 DCs here in the US. We've got, I\u2019m sorry, 57 DCs here in the US, sorry. I\u2019m thinking about one of the other businesses. We've got a number in our other markets as well. So one of the things that we're evaluating is our distribution center infrastructure. We've added a third-party that we're working with to really help us evaluate whether our go to market strategy today is the absolute most efficient for our business. So that's under review. As it relates to our stores, Seth, there's nothing new there. We are, I mean, through our history, we are constantly opening and closing stores, underperforming stores in markets throughout the US and that hasn't changed any and I don't see that changing going forward, but we close, gosh, we\u2019ll close 100 stores a year and we'll open 100 stores. Actually, this year, we\u2019ll surpass that number. So that\u2019s nothing new for us. Seth Basham : Got it. If I could sneak one last one in, just regarding service levels. So margins in auto were soft. You said, there wasn't any change in the pricing environment, but is there a change in the service level environment, in other words, are you adding more services, whether it be quicker deliveries, et cetera to try to drive sales in the past just leading to some SG&A pressure. Paul Donahue : No. There's been no major shift in our service proposition that we provide our customers, Seth. We think that going back to our vast distribution center network with our 6000 stores, we deliver to our stores every night and we'll hotshot to our stores and our independent owners during the course of the day. So we have not -- we certainly have not pared back on any of our services that we provide our customers and we don't see that in the cards going forward either. Operator : And with no additional questions, I'd like to turn the call back to management for additional comments or closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We like to thank you for your participation in today's call. We appreciate your support and your interest in Genuine Parts Company and we look forward to reporting out at our next quarter Thank you. Operator : That does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sid Jones : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company fourth quarter 2017 conference call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for 2018. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Carol Yancey our EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin this morning, please be advised this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reports under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today's call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses as well. The Company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this mornings' press release. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now, let me turn the call over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid and let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer will provide an update on our financial results and our outlook for 2018. After that we'll open the call to your questions. So, to recap our fourth quarter sales and earnings performance across our global platform total GPC sales were up 11.3% to $4.2 billion with net income at $108 million and earnings per share at $0.73. Alliance Automotive Group our European acquisition, which closed on November 2nd of 2017 performed in line with our initial projects and contributed approximately $250 million or 6.8% to sales and $0.07 in earnings per share. For the year, total sales were a record $16.3 billion, a 6.3% increase compared to 2016. Net income was $617 million and earnings per share were $4.18. AAG contributed 1.7% to sales and the same $0.07 earnings per share. During the fourth quarter, there were several events that impacted our reported results which are highlighted in our press release and which Carol will discuss further. In summary, in addition to AAG's two months of operations discussed above, we had transaction related costs associated with the acquisition and recorded a tax expense related to US tax reform. Before these items fourth quarter sales for our core operations were up 4.5%, net income was up 8.5% and earnings per share of $1.12 were up 10%. For the full year, our core operations were up 4.6% in sales, net income was flat and earnings per share of $4.64 were up 1%. When we combine these core results with AAG's two months of operations our earnings per share were $1.19 for the fourth quarter and $4.71 for the full year. So, an active fourth quarter for us and we are proud of our teams and the good results they delivered. The fourth quarter was marked by progress in several areas and our teams delivered our strongest comparable earnings growth since 2013. The diversity in our operations combined with an ongoing strategy to drive both organic and acquisitive growth enabled us to deliver the 11% total sales increase for the fourth quarter. The acquisitions we have made to-date and those we may execute going forward, are intended to expand our businesses and further enhance our global footprint and ultimately create additional shareholder value. In 2017, we acquired 15 businesses with proximally $2.1 billion in annual revenues including approximately $1.7 billion at AAG and another $150 million in sales at the three other businesses we acquired in the fourth quarter. In addition, in April of 2017, we made a minority investment in Inenco Group, a market leading industrial distributor in Australasia which we're planning to add to our industrial platform within the next 12 to 24 months. Overall, acquisitions added 8.5% to the sales in the fourth quarter and we anticipate that each of these new businesses will positively contribute to our future results. As we review our 2017 performance total fourth quarter sales were driven by increases across automotive, industrial and electrical groups. Turning to our global automotive group sales for this segment were up 16.7% in Q4, including an approximate 1% comp sales increase and a 4% total sales increase before the positive sales contribution from AAG. In our US automotive operations, total sales were up 2% in the fourth quarter with comp sales up 1%. And while 1% comp sales increased short of our long-term expectations, we did show sequential improvement from Q3 results. Comparable sales to retail customers outperformed our sales to commercial accounts. The sales results are consistent with the past several quarters, which we have attributed to challenging business conditions across many of our major accounts, fleet and now auto care customers. That said, we continue to see many of our major accounts performing well and our auto care customer group was improved from third quarter. We have several initiatives in place to further build the sales potential with our major accounts and fleet customers and we will be launching new and enhanced benefits for industry leading auto care program which is now grown to over 17,500 members. We expect these initiatives as well as the further expansion of other value-add services such as our auto tech training which impacts thousands of repair shops and even more automotive technician to drive stronger sales with our commercial customers in 2018. In retail, our sales growth stems from initiatives such as the NAPA rewards program which now has 6.5 million members and additional 1 million members from last quarter and our retail impact store initiative which now totals approximately 500 stores. Our retail sales at these stores continue to outperform our total network driven by strong increases in average ticket values or basket size. In 2018, we'll expand this retail initiative further with the conversion of another 200 to 300 stores comprised of both boat company owned stores and independent owned stores. In addition to these growth initiatives, we're optimistic for the gradual strengthening of the overall aftermarket industry as well as our US automotive sales for several reasons. We expect the demand for failure and maintenance parts to increase due to the impact of a more normalized winter season, something we haven't experienced for two years. We expect a number of vehicles in the aftermarket sweet spot stabilize in 2018 after falling for the past few years due to the historically low new car sales in the post-recession years of 2008 through 2011. And finally, the long-term fundamental drivers for the automotive aftermarket remains found with a growing total fleet relatively stable fuel prices which continue to drive more miles driven amongst consumers. Based on the most recent data available, total miles driven increased 1.1% in November and are up 1.3% for the 11 months. We also expect our ongoing acquisition to positively contribute to our future sales. During 2017, we added four automotive store groups including the fourth quarter acquisition of Monroe Motor Parts as well as Stone Truck Parts, the heavy-duty operation to our US network. These types of accretive tuck-in acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy and we expect additional opportunities in the future. Now let's turn to our international automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada, and Mexico. As a group, these operations delivered a 5% total sales increase in fourth quarter including a 3% comp sales increase in local currency, which is consistent with the third quarter. In Australia and New Zealand, total sales were up low to mid-single digits once again in Q4 driven by a slight increase in comp sales and the ongoing benefit of acquisitions. The Asia-Pac business finished 2017 with 560 stores across Australasia and like our other businesses has plans for further store expansion in the future. Further underlying fundamentals for the Australasian aftermarket remained solid as we enter 2018 with a growing car part driven by strong car sales relatively low gas prices and upward trends in miles driven. These positive trends are underpinned by an overall healthy Australian economy. At NAPA Canada, sales remained strong in the quarter with total sales up mid to high single-digit and comp sales up mid-single digits. These results include and are highlighted by a strong performance from our heavy-duty truck parts business as well as solid results across Western Canada. In addition, we announced on December 31 NAPA Canada added Universal Supply Group to its operations. Universal in a Kingston, Ontario based operation with 21 stores which sell auto parts, heavy duty truck parts and paint and body parts. The addition of Universal Supply strengthens our core presence in eastern Ontario market. So, our team in Canada is headed into 2018 with solid momentum and we look forward to another strong year from our Canadian team. Our automotive operations continue to expand in Mexico and this team finished 2017 with sales up mid-single digits. During 2017, we expanded our NAPA Mexico footprint with eight new auto parts stores and entered 2018 with 42 total stores. We have plans for further expansion of our store base and accelerate revenue growth in the quarters ahead. Finally, we want to add that the operating results at Alliance Automotive Group for November and December reflect a solid start to this group. As you might imagine there is an incredible amount of planning and other work associated with an acquisition of this size, but our teams both in Europe and the US are doing a terrific job of staying focused on the business throughout this process. So, looking back at our first 60 days in Europe things have gone extremely well and our talent management team is in position to drive strong results in 2018. We enter our first full year with the AAG team excited for the growth prospects we see for this business across all of our operations in France, the UK, Germany, and Poland. So, in summary, our fourth quarter global automotive results were in line with our expectations both before and after the added contribution from AAG. We entered 2018 optimistic for further improvement in our results for this largest business segment of GPC. Now turning to our industrial business, motion industries posted another impressive quarter with sales up 7.4% consistent with the first three quarters of the year. Overall, motions fourth quarter capped off an outstanding year in 2017 with solid mid-single digit comp sales growth further enhanced with their pneumatic engineering acquisition and the addition of Apache Hose & Belting Company. This combination of strong organic growth and acquisitions also led Motion to significantly expand their operating margin. Favorable conditions in the industrial economy during 2017 drove solid growth across all product categories in the industries we serve. Each of our major product categories posted sales gains in the top 12 industries where we compete. 10 sectors were up again for the fourth quarter with strong growth in the sectors such as equipment and machinery, iron and steel, lumber and wood products, aggregate and cement, equipment rental and leasing, and oil and gas extraction. We expect the strong industry conditions we experienced in 2017 to continue into 2018. The industrial indicators we follow including industrial production, the purchasing managers index, rate counts and the level of exporting goods remain solid and should drive ongoing customer demand across the diverse markets we serve. Turning now to EIS, our electrical and electronic materials group. Sales for this business were up 8.9% in the fourth quarter driven by the addition of Empire Wire and Cable in April of last year. Empire was an important strategic acquisition for EIS as it further expanded EIS's wire and cable offering and strengthen its capabilities to serve the industrial robotic and automation markets. This ties in well with Motion's expansion in this sector including its Braas in 2016 and the addition of Numatic Engineering in 2017. The EIS and Motion businesses have a growing number of common attributes including their product offering, suppliers and in many cases their customers. To that end on January 1 of this year, we announced that we were combining the EIS operation in the motion and the industrial parts group. As a result, beginning our first quarter, with our first quarter of 2018 reporting in any comparable prior year period EIS will be identified as Motion's electrical specialties group. The combination of these two segments will provide strong economies of scale and greater efficiencies which we intend to leverage. The opportunity to build synergies by sharing talent, physical resources greater [ph] and scale and value added expertise in each respective market channel is highly compelling. Most importantly, we anticipate this combination will create value for both our customers and all our stakeholders. Our management teams are excited for the opportunities they see as a combined operation and are working closely to maximize their future potential as a $6 billion industrial group. Likewise, with the planned addition of Inenco in Australasia which also provides us an entry into growing markets like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore our outlook for the global growth prospects for this group is promising. Now a few comments on S.P. Richards, our business products group which reported a 2.2% decrease in total sales for the fourth quarter. This business continues to be challenged by the continued pressures and demands through traditional office supplies, although the facility break room and safety supplies category continues to be a bright spot as they accelerate revenues and close 2017 at approximately 35% percent of total sales. Our fourth quarter business products group results reflect the continuation of challenging trends and the changing landscape of the office products industry. That said, our team remain focused on diversifying this business while building greater size and scale in the growing FBS market. This is a key element of our overall growth strategy and an important consideration as we continue to evaluate our long-term outlook for this business. So that recaps our consolidated and business segment sales results for the fourth quarter of 2017. Overall, the 4.5% sales growth before AAG was consistent with the first nine months of 2017 and we were pleased with the two months contribution from AAG which provided us with total sales growth of 11.3% for the fourth quarter. Importantly, we also made progress with our profitability and improved our operating margin for the first time in several quarters. We credit our teams for improved execution while striving to improve our overall operating performance. While we have work yet to do, we are encouraged with our progress in Q4. So, with that, I'll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with a review of our key financial information and then discuss our outlook for 2018. As Paul mentioned sales in the fourth quarter up 11% or up 2% before acquisitions and 1% favorable impact of foreign currency. For 2017, our total sales increase of 6% includes 1.5% comparable sales growth, a slight benefit from foreign exchange and a 4.4% increase from acquisitions. Our gross margin for the quarter was a reported 30.52% compared to 29.92% last year and reflects the benefit of increased supplier incentives in our industrial business as well as the higher gross margin associated with AAG's two-month results. The favorable impact of these items was slightly offset by the $5.6 million purchase accounting costs recorded in the fourth quarter. Before the impact of the AAG acquisition and the related purchase accounting cost, our adjusted gross margin would have been 30.2% in the fourth quarter or 30 basis point increase. For the full year, our reported gross margin of 30.08 compares to 29.98 in 2016. Before our accounting for AAG our adjusted gross margin would have been 30%. Looking to 2018, we remained focused on enhancing our gross margins through several key initiatives including continued supplier negotiations both globally and across our businesses. The ongoing investment and more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies as well as improved analytic capabilities around SKU profitability. We experienced a somewhat inflationary pricing environment in 2017 with at least slight inflation in each of our business segments for the year. Our cumulative supplier price increases for 2017 were three tenths of 1% increase for automotive, 2% percent increase for industrial, 1.3% increase for electrical and six-tenths of 1% for office. Turning to our SG&A our total expenses for the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion, which includes the impact of AAG's two months of operations as well as transaction related costs of $25 million. Excluding these items, our total SG&A would have been $939 million or at 5% and 23.78% of sales which is an increase of 10 basis points from 2016, but improved from the cost increases we reported in the past several quarters. So, despite the challenge of leveraging our expenses with less than 3% organic sales growth, our teams did a good job of managing their expenses during the quarter and we benefited from favorable year-end expenses an area such as incentive compensation, legal and professional, and insurance. With these fourth quarter results, our total expenses were $3.9 billion for the full year including two months with AAG and $43 million in transaction related costs of which $18.5 million was recorded in the third quarter. Excluding these items our total expenses were $3.77 billion, up 7% and 23.51% of sales or a 40 basis points increase. As referenced earlier, our expenses were up in 2017 for several reasons including the lack of leverage on low single-digit sales comps. Rising costs in areas such as wages and labor, freight and delivery, IT and digital investments. To offset these and other increases, we continued to enhance our cost saving initiatives and while we have much work ahead of us we were encouraged by our progress in the fourth quarter. With that said, our goal of achieving a lower cost highly effective distribution infrastructure will take time and our SG&A outlook includes certain costs that we deem necessary to support this objective as we move forward. In addition, we're considering certain accelerated investments in 2018 to take advantage of our projected tax savings related to the tax cuts and job. We expect this process to pressure our overall SG&A to some degree but we're confident in the positive impact on our long-term profitability. We'll now discuss the results by segment, our automotive revenue for the fourth quarter of 2.3000000000 was that 17 percent from the prior year and our operating profit of $183 million is at 14.5% with an operating margin of 7.9 percent as compared to 8.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding AAG, automotive fourth quarter sales would have been 2.1 or a 3.8% and our operating profit would have been $169 million or 5.7 percent increase reflecting an 8.2% operating margin. This 8.2% core margin is a 20 basis-points improvement from the fourth quarter in 2016 and it's much improved from the 120-basis points year-over-year decrease we reported in the third quarter. So, with this quarter's core operating performance and our expectation for an improved more normalized operating margin at AAG in 2018 relative to its two-month contribution in 2017. The automotive group entered 2018 with positive momentum which is encouraging. Our industrial sales were 1.2 billion in the quarter, a 7.4% increase from 2016. Operating profit of 103 million was up a strong 27% and their marketing margins significantly improved at 8.3% compared to 7.0% last year. The industrial group continues to benefit from both organic and acquisitive sales growth as well as improved gross margin including the favorable impact of supplier incentives as well as SG&A leverage. We're very pleased with the margin expansion for this segment. Our business product revenues were $466 million down 2% from last year and operating profit of $14 million is down 31% and their operating margin is 2.9%. As Paul discussed earlier, this segment remains under pressure due to the continued challenges facing the industry and as we evaluate our outlook for this business, our teams remain focused on the further diversification into the growing FBS market. The electrical electronic group sales were $193 million in the quarter up 9% from 2016. Their operating profit of $13.5 million is down 13% and the margin for this group is 7.0%. This decline reflects the lack of organic sales growth as well as ongoing customer and product mix shift. So, our total operating profit in the fourth quarter was up 13% on our 11% sales increase and our operating profit margin improved by 10 basis points to 7.4%. If we exclude the two months of AAG, our operating profit was up 8% on a 4.5% sales increase and our operating margin was up 30 basis points to 7.6%. So much improved operating performance for us in the fourth quarter and one that we will look to build on going forward. We had net interest expense of $17.4 million in the quarter which is up $12.6 million primarily due to the increase in debt associated with the AAG acquisition. With this in mind, we expect our net interest expense to be in the range of $93 million to $95 million for 2018. Our total amortization expense was $18 million for the fourth quarter which is an increase from the $12.5 million last year due to the amortization related to AAG. For 2018 we expect full year amortization to be in the range of $83 million to $85 million Depreciation expense of $32 million for the quarter was up $5.5 million from 2016. For 2018 we're projecting total depreciation to be in the range of $135 million to $145 million still on a combined basis, we would expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $220 million to $230 million. The other line which reflects our corporate expense was $56 million for the fourth quarter and that includes $31 million in transaction related costs associated with the AAG acquisition. Excluding those costs, our corporate expense was $25 million compared to $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year, this line was $160 million or $111 million if you exclude the $49 million in total transaction related costs that were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. This is up from the $95 million in the prior year as we had the benefit of certain real estate gains in 2016. For 2018, we're projecting our corporate expense to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 51.3% which reflects $51 million in provisional tax expense related to the transaction tax on foreign earnings as well as the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as was required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017. Excluding the impact of this expense as well as the two months of operation for AAG and any transaction related costs for that acquisition, our income tax rate would have been approximately 35%. This has improved from the 35.5% tax rate in 2016 due to the favorable mix of US and foreign earnings as well of the change in accounting for stock-based compensation. For 2018, we expect further shift in our US and foreign earnings associated with the full year of AAG operations, as well as the estimated benefit of tax reform on the US federal rate. So, we expect our tax rate to be 26% to 27% with provisional tax savings resulting from the tax reform that are currently estimated to be $80 million to $90 million. So now turning to our balance sheet, which remains strong and in excellent condition. Accounts receivable at $2.4 billion is up 25% from the prior year and it's up 3% excluding the impact of acquisitions, primarily AAG as well as foreign currency. This 3% increase compares to our 4.5% sales increase in the fourth quarter and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at December 31 was $3.8 billion are up 17% from the prior year and basically flat excluding AAG, our other acquisitions and foreign currency. We're very focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable of $3.6 billion at year-end is up 18% in total and up 3% excluding AAG, other acquisitions as well as foreign currency. The 3% increase reflects lower purchasing activity across our businesses during the latter part of the year offset by the benefit of improved payment terms with certain suppliers. At December 31 of 2017, our AP to inventory ratio was 96%. Our working capital of $1.8 billion at December 31 compares to $1.7 billion in 2016 and excluding AAG is $1.4 billion. Effectively managing our working capital is an ongoing priority for us and we see additional opportunities for improvement in 2018. Our total debt of $3.2 billion at December 31 compares to $900 million outstanding in 2016 and reflects an approximate $2 billion in borrowings the same in the fourth quarter related to the AAG acquisition. Our debt arrangements varying maturity and at December 31 our average interest rate on our total debt was 2.7% with approximately $1.7 billion in debt at fixed rates. We're comfortable with our current debt structure and we're fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a financial capacity to support our growth initiatives including strategic acquisitions and investments such as AAG and the Inenco Group, which we believe creates significant value for our shareholders. So, in summary, our balance sheet will remain a key strength of the company. In 2017, we generated $815 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend was $253 million. Our cash flow were in-line with our forecast and continue to support our ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe start to maximize shareholder value. Looking ahead we're planning for another strong year for cash generation in 2018 with our cash from operations estimated at $950 million to $1 billion and our free cash flow estimated at approximately $400 million. Our priority for cash remain the dividend, reinvestment in our businesses, share repurchase and strategic acquisitions which Paul covered earlier. Regarding the dividend, yesterday the board approved a $2.88 per share annual dividend for 2018 marking our 62nd consecutive year of increased dividends paid for our shareholders. This represents a 7% increase from the $2.70 per share paid in 2017 and it's approximately 61% of our 2017 adjusted earnings, including the benefit of AAG's two months. Our capital expenditures were $55 million in the fourth quarter and $157 million for the year. For 2018 we're planning for capital expenditures in the range of $200 million to $220 million an increase from 2017 due to the impact of AAG and certain investments that we're planning on in association with our anticipated tax savings. In 2017, we purchased 1.9 million shares of our common stock and today we have 17.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead. We continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best returns to our shareholders. So, this concludes our financial update for the fourth quarter of 2017 and as Paul mentioned before, it was a very active quarter for us and we're proud of our teams for all their efforts including the added work related to the AAG acquisition as well as tax reform. Additionally, while we have more work ahead of us we're encouraged by the progress in our operating performance and we're well positioned to further strengthen our results going forward. So now, turning to our guidance for 2018. Based on our current performance our growth plans and initiative as well as the market conditions that we see in the future we're [ph] our full year 2018 guidance as follows. We expect total sales to be in the plus 12% to plus 13% range including the benefit of any 2017 acquisition such as AAG but no future acquisitions and no impact from foreign currency. By business we expect plus 19% to plus 21% sales growth for the automotive segment and this includes plus 2% to plus 4% sales growth excluding AAG. For the industrial group, we expect plus 4% to plus 5% total sales growth and for business products we expect sales to be down 3% to down 4%. On the earnings side, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.75. This EPS guidance includes the benefit for a full year of operations with AAG as well as approximately $80 million to $90 million and lower provisional income taxes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With that said, we'd like to thank all of our GPC associates for the continued hard work and dedication. And at this point, I'll turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. Reflecting on 2017, our 90th year of operation, we had a number of accomplishments and milestones that better position the company for sustained long-term growth. We surpassed $16 billion in total sales for the first time in our company history. We expanded our global footprint with 15 strategic acquisitions across both existing and new markets adding $2.1 billion in annual revenues. In automotive, we acquired Alliance Automotive Group entering the European market with significant size, scale, and talent. In industrial, we expanded our presence in the growing robotic sector while also acquiring 35% of Australasia's leading industrial distributor. We made significant IT investments to improve our digital capabilities and enhance our B2C online offerings across North America and Australia. We made progress in managing our cost to drive savings at a lower cost structure resulting in improved operating margin in the fourth quarter. We generated solid cash flows returning $569 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. And finally, yesterday our board approved a 7% increase in the 2018 dividend, our 62nd consecutive year of increased dividends paid by the company. So, we enter 2018 excited for the opportunities ahead and well prepared to build on our accomplishments. We also have the added benefit of a generally strong economy across most of our global markets as well as future savings associated with tax reform. In addition, we believe tax reform has the potential to drive additional growth in US investment and the economy overall further benefitting US companies including GPC, our GPC associates and our key stakeholders. So, in closing, we look forward to operating with three primary business segments in 2018. By group our projected revenues will break down as 57% automotive, 33% industrial and 10% business products. We are market leaders in each of these segments and will continue to focus on both organic and acquisitive sales to drive long term sustained revenue growth. We also moved forward with plans an initiative to enhance our gross margins, reduce our cost and build a highly productive and cost-effective infrastructure. We expect our focus in these key areas to improve the operating performance in each of our businesses and for the company overall and ultimately maximizing shareholder value. We look forward to updating you on our progress again in April when we report on our first quarter 2018 results. So, with that we'll turn it back to the operator and Carol and I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Bret Jordan, Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Paul Donahue : Hi Bret. Bret Jordan : I got a little late on the call, but I'm not sure if you touched on regional performance in auto and maybe the cadence through the quarter and what you've seen early 18? Paul Donahue : Yes. Happy to address it Bret. We didn't talk about it specifically, but the cadence for the quarter for GPC a little slower out of the gates in October but we had a good November and a good December both. So, when you have the three up, it equated to a 5% overall increase. Our automotive business and I know specifically of interest to you was the kind of in a similar pattern a really good November and an okay December. If we look across the geography Bret, where we are seeing outperformance in Q4 was in our northern division. So, for us that's the northeast, the central, mid-west in the mountain. Those northern divisions all performed well, a little softer growth in the southern what we would call our southern divisions. But certainly, see a nice growth in the northern regions and what's part of that you have to attribute to the weather patterns. Bret Jordan : Yes, great. And then on the Alliance business do you have a fairly common vendor base will there be a lot of synergy as far as leveraging the suppliers there? And I guess the follow-up to that will those suppliers also be able to deleverage from a working capital standpoint are the extended payables programs something you can put into the European business? Paul Donahue : Yes. So, it's a little early yet Bret. Actually, our team had a number of meetings last week over in Europe with our global supplier base, and as you would imagine many of our top suppliers in the west, our top suppliers to us in Europe and Australasia for that matter so great companies like [indiscernible] Baash, Gates and Scheffler, Axalta, Delphi they are strategic suppliers for us across all of our markets right now. And yes, we think there's opportunity in a number of areas but honestly, it's just a bit early yet. Carol Yancey : And Bret, we do see opportunities from a working capital standpoint. We've already been in discussions and started programs with our banks that would be able to include our European operations. And so, all discussions that we're having we look at it from a comprehensive wide program including the working capital side. Bret Jordan : Give us sort of ballpark and what cash might come out of the Alliance working capital? I mean with their inventory was going into it. Carol Yancey : We don't but I can tell you and looking at and giving you what was improved guidance and cash from operations and free cash flow, we've contemplated some improvement in there. But won't specifically break that out. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Paul Donahue : Okay. Bret. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Chris Horvers, JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Horvers : I have a follow-up question on Bret's question. As you think about the US NAPA comp outlook. You saw nice improvement from 3Q to 4Q putting up a one comp in the US. How are you thinking about this year and how do you think about sort of the sustainability which of what I assume was a pretty good start to the year? Paul Donahue : Well, as we look into 2018 and certainly Chris as you would imagine this cold weather, we expect to ultimately be a nice boost for us. Our comps as you mentioned for 2017 were in the 1% range and for 2018, we were expecting still in the 1% to 3% range and certainly, our teams are going to be pulling every lever to get us to the top end of that range. It's early yet, and again I think this colder weather as reflected in the strong performance we're seeing in our northern divisions, I think longer term that's going to give a boost to our US automotive business. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then on the margin front, you mentioned I think that ex-AAG gross margins are up 30 basis points year-over-year. Was there anything unsustainable about that whether it when their allowances sort of catch up in the fourth quarter that won't necessarily be indicative of how we think about modeling 2018? Carol Yancey : Yes. I would point out on the gross margin. So, look there was in the Q4 probably two-thirds of that 30 basis points related to incremental rebase and primarily in our industrial group. The other 10 basis points is the core improvement. We had some favorable mix shift and some automotive product categories in the quarter as far as how the category has performed as well as Motions for business. To say that's not sustainable, I mean look, we're modelling similar core growth for industrial going into 2018 and looking for similar margin improvement. So, we would have to assume that that would stay in the numbers and we actually feel pretty good about gross margin. We were really pleased to see the Q4 opportunities and the trends that presented themselves. Christopher Horvers : So, it sounds like no less than 10, but maybe not all the way up to 30? Carol Yancey : Look. One other thing I'd point out Chris and with AAG and the acquisition, I mean we're going to have sometimes acquisitions come in with a little different gross margin and SG&A, but you have similar operating margins. But you've seen us, like I said we had some good improvement in the quarter and I hope we can sustain being around that 30% or slightly better. And look, some of the things we're doing in the pricing area, that's also going to help us on the gross margin side. Christopher Horvers : And then my last question is Motion had very strong operating profit expansion, 8.3% in the fourth quarter. And if I look back historically, that low 8% range on an annual basis is where that business seems to [ph] out on sort of when you get into that very strong macro environment. So, is that where that enforce you a good read on how to think about 2018 overall? Carol Yancey : Yes, well [ph] and again I would point out from Motion, so that improvement it was about a-third, a-third, a-third with incremental rebates, leverage on their core growth with SG&A and then just improvement in their core growth profit. So, as we look to more what their annual margin was in the high seven's, we would expect it to go up closer to the eight. But long-term, we're always looking for kind of an 8%, 8.5% for the industrial group. Paul Donahue : And Chris, I would just make a comment. I want to appreciate you calling out Motion. Motion had a very good year across the board. They had essentially 7% increases every quarter last year. We're excited about our acquisition, investment in Australia, basically the motion industry industries of Australia with the Inenco Group and look forward to expanding that investment in the coming 12 to 24 months. We're very bullish on our industrial business. If you look at all the key indicators from the PMI, industrial production there is no reason we shouldn't see another good year out of our industrial business in 2018. Christopher Horvers : Thank you. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Chris. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Carol Yancey : Hi Chris. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, just had a quick clarifying question. It's not like the, you might actually see this explicitly. But it's not like the math you gave on the call, what it suggested a 5.7% operating margin for AAG in the quarter. One I guess is that correct? And then two I was trying to contextualize the 30-basis points pressure, I mean it's put that on 6% of sales, it seems like [ph] repurchase accounting. Is that the right way to think about that or is there an outstanding SG&A adjustment? Carol Yancey : Well, let me take this in two parts. So first of all, you're doing some math to get to the automotive margin and I would tell you, we put AAG in for two months and two months is not necessarily representative of the full year for 2018. I mean you definitely have some seasonality. December in Europe, I mean you had two less selling days in France, one less selling day in the UK and you've got your level of fixed cost. So, we didn't give guidance on those two months that we are reiterating our confidence in our guidance in a more normalized margin for 2018. So, that's the first comment, the second comment is there is no purchase accounting or one-time deal cost in our automotive operating margins. We put everything in the other line and the purchase accounting and all that is in that other line. So, and going forward we would always pull that out of the operating segment. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes, that's okay. I understood that. And then, just wanted clarification on the weather gap. I think you just contextualized it. But were you able to say with the weather gap actually was between kind of the northeast markets and the rest of the country and had the compare to Q3? Just want to understand how much of that were actually contributing to the quarter? Paul Donahue : Yes, Chris for Q4 we saw about two full points of gap between our northern businesses and our southern business. And if you look at Q3, that gap was even more narrow it was closer to a point in Q3. But look the November numbers that we saw and we had good month in November, that also happen to be the coldest month in Q4. So, once again there is a direct correlation in our U.S. automotive business tide to the weather pattern. So again, we're bullish looking ahead at some of this winter weather that we're seeing, we'll be positive for our U.S. business in 2018. Chris Bottiglieri : And then, I guess somewhat related; I think you talked to the south being weaker, would have thought like it was a rig count and what we're hearing on demand for fleet -- fleet sales etcetera, like heavy duty trucks; can you talk about just generally speaking how your energy markets in heavy duty business is performing relatively? Paul Donahue : That's a great question, Chris, and I would tell you that our energy markets and specifically our southwestern division, they had a good quarter, they outpaced the balance of our southern division. So if you think -- I mean, when we talk about our southern divisions, we're stretching coast to coast and the southwest and our energy markets absolutely outperformed the balance of our southern divisions. Operator : And we'll go next to Matt Fassler, Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : My first question is sort of a follow-up from Q3. I think there was one business, I believe automotive where rebates worked against you from a gross margin perspective in Q3. If I'm right in recalling that, did that issue in essence go away in Q4? Carol Yancey : Yes. So in Q3 we called out some onetime sure off [ph] related to automotive and our business product segment and that was adjusting to what our purchasing levels were, our sales levels; so you had a little more of a true-up in Q3. Q4 was less of a headwind but still had it on the business product side. What helped us on gross margin in Q4 from automotive, we had some product mix shift that were a little bit better, so we had product categories that have higher margin, that didn't perform as well in Q3, those performed better in Q4. And then said the other way, we had lower margin product categories that were performing really well in Q3 that were driving down margins; so we had some product mix favorable side changes in Q4. So definitely not as much incentive noise in Q4. Matt Fassler : Understood. And then you spoke about tax reform and the amount you're going to flow through; could you help us quantify the discretionary investment if you can do so that you chose to make -- given that tax reform hasn't [indiscernible] a bit of a windfall and I'm going windfall to your net income run rate? Carol Yancey : So, these are our best estimates right now as you guys know, this is all provisional and we've done the best we can, estimate what that is and looking at the $80 million to $90 million in both cash and EPS savings, you're going to see us evaluate that and put it in our usual priority, so we certainly mention the 7% increase in the dividend this morning. We've mentioned incremental investments in our business and when you look at our CapEx, we certainly had to include an amount in there for AAG but there could be an estimated $25 million to $45 million in incremental CapEx that we've put into our 2018 guidance. And then we want to invest in our facilities technology investments, probably go at a quicker pace since this has presented itself. And then lastly, we're looking at some programs that would directly benefit our people and this can be in areas like training and talent and compensation and certainly investments in our facilities also benefit our employees as well; so that's all been reflected in our guidance. Matt Fassler : So the $5.60 to $5.75 includes what you might do with some of that money out of P&L? Carol Yancey : Yes. And look, I know on the $5.60 to $5.75, I mean we've talked about -- there are some investments that we're having to make in our North America automotive business and those are incremental investments, we've got additional CapEx, we've got some headwinds on the business product segment. And then we did have and we've called out, we did have some favorable one-time adjustments in Q4 that were in insurance, legal and professional; those things present themselves with maybe $0.15 to $0.20 EPS headwind, and that's been contemplated in the guidance that we've given you but we're still putting out there plus 19% to plus 22% increase in EPS. Operator : We'll take our next question from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : I guess bit of a follow-on to Matt's question if you think about reinvesting and thanks for outlining all that but I didn't mention -- it didn't seem like there is anything on the gross margin side could there be given that some of these -- the investment in people and facilities could be in supply chain? And then I had a follow-up. Carol Yancey : You're spot-on, I appreciate the additional clarity. We have a long list of projects we've meet in doubt with our Canadian team, our U.S. team and it ranges anywhere from pricing, software and optimization and investments in people, data analytics to supply chain reinvention, to using more predictive analytics in our inventory modeling and supply chain. Facilities is around whether it's conveyers or our warehouse management system combining facilities, you can definitely get productivity improvements, you can get gross margin improvements, so we haven't necessarily put it on each line item, we're just telling you that those investments will benefit us in the long-term. Unidentified Analyst : And my follow-up was on the motion industries; I think Paul, you've called out how well it's done and how the outlook there seems to be improving. If we look at your guidance for this year on motion; how much of the growth -- I think last year 7% was sort of the numbers that kept put up for this year how much do you expect of the growth to be acquisition as opposed to organic? Carol Yancey : So last year's full year numbers had a comp number of 4% and acquisitions of 3% and that's what got you to the 7%. We're giving you the plus 4% to plus 5% which would imply a comp of 3% to 4% and acquisitions of 1% to 2%; that acquisitions is carryover from 2017 acquisitions, it's nothing further. I can tell you we certainly hope to be at the higher end of that 3% to 4% and -- but right now we felt like it was appropriate to start with 3% to 4%. Paul mentioned all the favorable fundamentals, we had a presentation from their management team yesterday and we certainly all feel encouraged by the long-term fundamentals but right now we're going to start-off the year with kind of a similar comp into '18. Paul Donahue : And we've got a really high performing management team at motion and if the right opportunities come along on the acquisition front we will absolutely step into them and continue to look at tuck-ins and bolt-ons for our motion team. But that team we expect to have another really good 2018 and I would just add to Greg, welcome back, it's good to hear your voice again. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Curtis [ph], Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Unidentified Analyst : A very quick question on the new revenue recognition standards for franchisees; just wondering if there is any implications for the numbers for your guys in terms of going forward or perhaps historical numbers? Carol Yancey : Actually we've been working on that for two years now, we did a lot of analysis, a lot of work on it and came up with a very immaterial minimal adjustment; so really no impact on the company which is why it's not really called out. And so because of our -- the way that we just recognize our product sales and again, we looked at a lot of different things that we will not be reporting much of an impact. Operator : We'll go next to Carolina Jolly, Gabelli. Carolina Jolly : I guess as I look to some of the more global occurrences, it looks like we're getting some still tariff and maybe some change to trade agreements. Are we able to expect due to past prices right away or is there some lag in that? Paul Donahue : Carolina, you were kind of breaking up on us. Can you repeat that question? Carolina Jolly : So as we see some -- these steel tariffs come through and some change to the trade agreements potentially, are we -- do we expect GPC to pass price along or is there some type of lag in that? Paul Donahue : I'm sorry, I didn't catch it the first time but I understand what you're asking now. And absolutely if we absorb raw material increase and that our suppliers come to us with increases we will absolutely pass those along and don't anticipate any lag period between us accepting those price increases and us passing those increases along. That said Carolina, we with our scale now in Europe, Australasia and of course, across North America, we are evaluating all of our global supplier base and as the question was asked earlier, we've got some great global strategic suppliers that we'll give every opportunity to partner with us as we move forward. But in terms directly to your question, we will absolutely pass along any price increases that we've received. Operator : And due to time constraints, I'd like to turn it back to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's conference call. We appreciate your support at Genuine Parts Company and we look forward to reporting out on our first quarter results in April. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this mornings' press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now, let me turn the call over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid. And welcome to our first quarter 2018 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning.  Earlier today we released our first quarter 2018 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our three businesses : automotive, industrial including both our Motion and EIS businesses and business products, including an update on our pending agreement to spin this business off and combine it with Essendant, which we announced last week.  Carol Yancey, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2018. After that we\u2019ll open the call to your questions.  So to recap our first quarter performance across our global platform, total sales were a record $4.6 billion, up 17.4%, driven primarily by acquisitions and lower single digit comp sales growth. Net income was $177 million and earnings per share $1.20.  Excluding the impact of transaction related costs associated with the fourth quarter 2017 acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group and the agreement to spin-off the business products group, adjusted net income was $186 million, up 16% and adjusted earnings per share were $1.27, an increase of 18%.  So we entered 2018 as a more diversified global distributor and we remain committed to our key growth initiatives in order to drive long term sustained revenue growth. As a reminder, our four growth initiatives are as follows : Driving greater share of wallet with their existing customer base, employing an aggressive acquisition strategy focused on both geographical in-fill and product line adjacencies, expanding our digital capabilities and lastly further expansion of our U.S. and international store footprint. We continue to see these growth pillars combine with the diversity in our operations, both across our core business segments and geographies, creating ongoing shareholder value.  As we look to our Global Automotive Group, total sales were up 29.6% in the first quarter, including an approximate 1.5% comp sales increase, as well as the benefit of acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation. Breaking it down further, sales for our U.S. Automotive operations were up 3.5% in the first quarter, with comp sales up slightly. This is consistent with the sales comps we saw throughout 2017 with retail sales outpacing commercial sales. With that said, we estimate that the winter storms across the North East and Atlantic regions of the U.S. during the quarter which resulted in multiple distribution center and store closers, as well as the shift in the Easter holiday and approximate 1% negative impact on sales. By customer segment, we were encouraged to see our sales to NAPA Auto Care improve further in the first quarter up low single digits and our major account sales moved in the right direction as well. So the combination of a more normalized winter seasons in most parts of the U.S. coupled with the ongoing initiatives with our commercial customers, which includes an expansive and growing list of value added services, should drive stronger sales over the balance of the year.  Turning to our retail business, we remain focused on the many opportunities we have with our DIY customers and this continues to play out in terms of positive sales comps. Among our initiatives, the NAPA Rewards Program now has over 7.1 million members, NAPA Online sales continue to grow and our retail impact store project which is a multiyear initiative to modernize and refresh our NAPA Store layouts. This project has resulted in our team upgrading and updating 535 company owned and independent owned stores through March of this year. These stores continue to produce our strongest retail sales comps and we look forward to the positive impact of this initiative as we roll this platform out to another 250 to 300 stores in 2018.  We expect to see the overall aftermarket industry and ultimately our U.S. Automotive Sales strengthen over the balance of 2018 for several reasons. We expect to see the demand for failure and maintenance parts increase due to the impact of a more normalized winter weather pattern, something we haven\u2019t experienced for two years. We expect the number of vehicles and the aftermarket sweet spot to stabilize in 2018 after falling for the past few years due to the historically low new car sales and the post recession years after 2008. Long term fundamental drives for the automotive aftermarket remains sound, with a growing total fleet and relatively stable fuel prices, despite the recent increases which continue to drive increased miles driven among consumers. Total mils driven increased 1.2% in 2017 and they were up another four-tenths of 1% in January of \u201918, the most recent data available.  We also expect our ongoing acquisitions to positively contribute to our future sales. Thus far in 2018 we added Smith Auto a Fresno, California based automotive group with five stores and approximately $17 million in annual revenues to our U.S. network. Smith Auto as well as other accretive tuck-in acquisitions remains an important part of our growth strategy and we see additional opportunities to expand our U.S. store footprint.  So now let\u2019s turn to our International Automotive Businesses in Europe, Australasia, Canada and Mexico. We will begin with the newest addition to our growing automotive footprint Alliance Automotive Group. As you will recall, we acquired AAG one of the leading automotive aftermarket distributors in Europe with operations in France, the U.K., Germany and Poland back in November of 2017. So this was their first full calendar quarter as part of the GPC family. We are pleased to report that this business is performing quite well, posting low single digit sales comps and in line with our plans for both sales and profits. The AAG team completed several small bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter and has a full pipeline of additional acquisitions for the periods ahead.  In addition, our management teams are working hard to deliver the $25 million in synergies we announced with this transaction and expect to realize over the next three years. These synergies primarily relate to our sourcing opportunities and we remain confident that we will achieve the targeted goal. As we work through this integration which is going very well, we expect the talented management team at AAG to drive strong results throughout 2018. AAGs growth plans are supported by the backdrop of solid industry fundamentals and steady economies across their markets. We look forward to their continued positive impact on our overall automotive results.  Now a brief review of our other international automotive businesses. As a group, these operations delivered a 6% total sales increase in the first quarter, including a 2% comp sales increase in local currency. In Australia and New Zealand total sales in local currency were up mid single digits in the first quarter, driven equally by an increase in comp sales and the ongoing benefit of acquisitions. The Asia-Pac business operated with 560 stores in the first quarter of \u201818 and this business has plans for further store expansion in the future.  In addition, the Asia-Pac team continues to make important e-commerce investments in several areas, including the strategic investment in a leading ongoing business to enhance our digital capabilities. We expect these initiatives in addition to the sound underline fundamentals for the Australasia after market, including a growing car park driven by record sales, relatively low gas prices, an upward trend in miles driven and an overall healthy Australian economy will drive continued solid results for our Australasian automotive business.  At NAPA Canada, sales remained strong in the quarter with total sales in local currency up mid single digits and comp sales up low single digits. These results include the acquisition of the Universal Supply Group purchased back on December 31. Universal ads 21 Ontario based stores to our operations, generating strong sales across both light vehicle parts and heavy duty truck parts. Finally, the industry fundamentals and general economic climate in Canada remain positive. So we remain optimistic for another good year from our Canadian team.  In Mexico our automotive operations finished the first quarter of 2018 with total sales up mix-single digits before the favorable impact of currency. The NAPA Mexico footprint includes 42 total stores and we look forward to expanding our store base further over the balance of the year. We expect this expansion combined with our other growth initiatives in Mexico to further accelerate our revenue growth in this large market.  Turning now to the industrial parts group which includes the combined results for EIS and Motion. Following a 7% increase in 2017, total sales were up 8.3% in the first quarter, including 5% comp sales growth and the benefit of acquisitions.  The industrial economy continue to experience favorable conditions in the first quarter with positive reports from the major industrial indicators such as purchasing managers index, industrial production, rate counts and U.S. exports. These industry fundamentals, as well as our ongoing growth initiatives continue to drive robust growth across our product categories and the industries we serve.  Each of our major product groups posted sales gains in 10 of the 12 industries where we compete were up as well. Additionally the equipment and machinery industry, our largest single sector, showed the strongest growth among the industries we serve for the second consecutive quarter.  Other sectors, performing especially well include open paper, iron and steel, lumber and wood products, aggregate and cement, equipment rental and leasing and oil and gas extraction. Our industrial management teams at Motion and EIS are working closely together and making progress to generate economies of scale and improved efficiencies in the newly combined organization. The opportunities we see ahead for our larger and strong industrial group are encouraging and we expect strong results throughout 2018.  We would also add that we are very pleased with the ongoing growth at Inenco; the Australian based industrial distribution company we partnered with in 2017. This business is performing quite well and continues to expand its footprint across Australia and New Zealand, while also operating in Indonesia and Singapore.  Inenco announced earlier today the acquisition of HCD Flow Technology, a leading supplier of industrial hose and pumping equipment, further solidifying our market leading position in New Zealand. Today we have a 35% investment in Inenco and we look forward to investing further in this business within the next 12 to 18 months. This quality organization will be a great addition to our global industrial group.  Now, a few comments on S.P. Richards, our business products group which reported a 4.8% decrease in total sales for the first quarter. This business remains challenged by the continued pressures and demand for traditional office products, while sales and the facilities break room and safety supply category continues to partially offset these headwinds and post solid growth. Due to the challenges we have faced in this business we have been evaluating our long term strategic outlook for S.P. Richards for some time. As referenced at the beginning of my comments, last week we announced that after a comprehensive review of our options, we entered into an agreement to spin-off the S.P. Richards business and merge it with Essendant, another national business products wholesaler. This transaction made sense for several reasons. It maximized the value for S.P. Richards. GPC shareholders will gain 51% ownership of the combined company, allowing our current shareholders to participate in the significant upside of the newly combined company. The newly combined company in the best interest of all stakeholders, as it will be better positioned to effectively compete in the business product space with greater ability to support the customer community.  This option allows us to strengthen our focus on our core and larger, higher growth and higher margin global automotive and industrial businesses, and finally the $347 million in cash payments to GPC further enhances our capital allocation strategy. We believe the combination of Essendant along with S.P. Richards creates a stronger, more diversified business. Together these talented management teams and complementary cultures with a shared commitment to serving customers will be better positioned for future success. For employees, the new company will have the scale and depth to compete more effectively. We look forward to supporting the S.P. Richards and Essendant teams in facilitating a seamless integration. The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2018 subject to regulatory and Essendant shareholder approvals and other customer closing conditions. So that is the summary of our consolidated and business segment sales results for the first quarter of 2018. It was another eventful quarter for us and we believe the steps we have taken in Q1 will set us up well for not only a successful 2018 campaign, but an even brighter future for GPC. So with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. We\u2019ll begin with the review of our key financial information and then we will provide our updated outlook for 2018. As Paul mentioned, total sales in the first quarter are up 17.4% or up 2% before acquisitions and a 1% favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Our gross margin for the quarter was 31.3% compared to 29.6% last year. This strong increase primarily reflects the higher gross margin associated with AAG\u2019s operations, as well as other higher gross margin acquisitions and it also includes the benefit of increased supplier incentives in our industrial business. These favorable items were offset by $5.8 million in deal cost that was reported to cost of goods sold in the first quarter as well as the negative impact of lower supplier incentives at S.P. Richards. We remain focused on enhancing our gross margin through several key initiatives, including continued supplier negotiations both globally and across our businesses, the ongoing investment and a more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies as well as improved analytic capabilities around SKU profitability. The pricing environment remains somewhat inflationary through the first quarter and we would expect this to continue, especially if the steel and aluminum tariffs take effect in the coming months. At this point there is much uncertainty on this issue and it\u2019s really too early to determine the potential impact of tariffs on price inflation, but as we said before, we\u2019re generally able to pass along these types of increases to our customers. Our cumulative supplier price increases for first quarter of 2018 were flat for automotive, up 1.3% in industrial and up six-tenths of 1% in office. Turning to our SG&A, total expenses for the first quarter are $1.2 billion, representing 26.3% of sales. This is up from last year as our expenses for the quarter reflect the operating cost at AAG, including incremental depreciation, amortization and interests, as well as $7.2 million in deal costs reported during the quarter. In addition, we continue to experience the lack of leverage on our comparable sales in both, the U.S. automotive and business products division, as well as ongoing pressure from rising costs in areas such as payroll, freight and including fuel delivery and IT and digital.  To offset these and other increases we continue to enhance the cost saving initiatives across our business and we will remain focused on showing more progress in this important area in the quarters ahead. With that said, we also outlined in our year end call certain incremental costs that would be necessary to support our long term savings plan which will overall pressure our SG&A to some degree. All-in however, we\u2019re confident that we can improve our cost structure to positively impact our long term profitability. Now let\u2019s discuss the results by segment. Automotive revenue for the first quarter of $2.6 billion was up 30% from the prior year and operating profit of $185 million was up 22% with an operating margin of 7.2% compared to 7.7% margin in the first quarter of 2017. Primarily the decline in operating margin reflects the deleverage of expenses in our U.S. automotive business. Our industrial sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter are an increase of 8%. Operating profit of $112 million is up 8% and their operating margin is 7.2% compared to 7.3% last year with the slight decline due to the combination of motion with EIS\u2019s lower net margin. That said, we expect to see a strong performance from industrial in the quarters ahead, which does lead to margin expansions for the year. Our business product revenues were $474 million down 5% from last year and their operating profit of $22 million is down 31% and their operating margin is 4.6%. This business continues to operate in a challenging environment and this is pressuring their profitability. Our total operating profit in the first quarter was up 11% on the 17% sales increase and our operating profit margin was 6.9% compared to 7.3% last year. Our teams are working hard to improve on these results in the quarters ahead. We had net interest expense of $23 million in the quarter, up $17 million due to the increase in debt associated with the AAG acquisition as well as an increase in rate for the quarter. With that said, we continue to expect net interest expense to be in the range of $93 million to $95 million for the year. Our total amortization was $21 million for the first quarter, an increased from the $11 million last year, primarily due to the amortization related to AAG. For 2018 we are updating our full year amortization to be $86 million to $87 million. Our depreciation expense of $37 million for the quarter was up $10 million from last year and for the full year we\u2019re updating our total depreciation to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. So on a combined basis we now expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $225 million to $235 million. The other line which typically reflects our corporate expense was $44 million for the first quarter and this includes approximately $13 million in transaction related costs incurred in the quarter. Excluding these costs our corporate expense was $31 million which is up $6 million from the prior year and this is primarily due to the costs for our retirement plan valuation. For 2018 we continue to expect our corporate expense to be in the $115 million to $125 million range, excluding transaction related costs. Our tax rate for the quarter was 23%, much lower than the 34% tax rate in the prior year, due mainly to the lower tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In addition our tax rate was positive impacted by the favorable mix of U.S. and foreign earnings in the quarter. Our first quarter rates are typically our lowest quarterly rates each year and for the full year we currently expect our 2018 tax rate to approximate 26%.  Now let\u2019s discuss the balance sheet which remains strong and in excellent condition. Our accounts receivable at $2.6 billion are at 27% from the prior year and up 4% excluding the impact of acquisitions, primarily AAG as well as foreign currency. The 4% increase compares to our 2% comparable sales increase for the first quarter. So we have some work to do on improving this metric, but we do remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at March 31 was $3.8 billion or up 15% from March of last year. It\u2019s down slightly excluding AAG and our other acquisitions as well as foreign currency. This improvement highlights the positive impact of our current initiatives to improve the inventory levels in our core businesses and we are very focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable was $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter is at 17% or at 2% excluding acquisitions as well as foreign currency. The 2% core increase reflects the lower levels of purchasing activity across our businesses, especially in U.S. automotive and business products which is slightly offset by the benefit of improved payment terms with certain suppliers. At March 31 our AP inventory ratio was approximately 100%. Working capital of $1.8 billion at March 31 compares to $1.6 billion last year. So effectively managing our working capital continues to be one of our top priorities and we look forward to showing further improvement in the quarters ahead. Our total debt of $3.3 million at March 31 compares to $1 billion in total last year and it continues to reflect an approximately $2 billion in borrowings that were assumed in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the AAG acquisition. Our debt arrangements vary in maturity and at March 31 the average interest rate on our total debt was 2.84% with approximately $1.5 billion in debt at fixed rates. We\u2019re comfortable with our current debt structure and we\u2019re fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and the financial capacity to support our growth initiative, including strategic acquisitions and investments such as AAG in Europe and the Inenco Group in Australia, which we believe creates significant value for our shareholders. So in summary, our balance sheet remains the key strength of the company. In the first quarter we generated $138 million in cash from operations, which has improved from last year. Our cash flow has continued to support our ongoing priorities for the use of cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. For 2018 we expect cash from operations to be in the $950 million to $1 billion range and free cash flow of approximately $400 million. Our priorities for cash remain the dividend reinvestment in our businesses, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. These priorities have not changed even with the savings from tax reform and the cash associated with the pending spin-off transactions. Regarding the dividend, 2018 marks our 62nd consecutive year of increased dividend paid to our shareholders. Our annual dividend of $2.88 represents a 7% increase from the prior year. We invested $32 million in capital expenditures in the first quarter which is up from $25 million in the prior year. For the year we continue to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $200 million to $220 million, an increase from 2017 due to the impact of AAG as well as certain additional investments that we are planning and associated with our anticipated tax savings. We did not purchase any of our common stock in the quarter and as of today we have 17.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases that we expect to be active in the program and the quarters ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. So now turning to our guidance for 2018, based on our current performance, our growth plans and initiatives, as well as the market conditions that we see for the future, we are maintaining our full year 2018 sales and earnings guidance as follows : We continue to expect total sales to be in the plus 12% to plus 13% range, excluding the benefit of any future acquisitions as well as an impact from foreign currency. By business we continue to expect plus 19% to plus 21% total sales for the automotive segment, plus 4% to plus 5% for the industrial segment, as sales decrease of minus 3% to minus 4% for the business products segment which will continue to be included in our guidance until the spin-off transaction is closer to completion. On the earnings side we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.75, which is consistent with our initial guidance announced in our last call. This EPS guidance includes the benefit of a full year of operations for S.P. Richards, the Business Products Group. In closing, we made progress in several important areas that better position us for the future and although we have much work ahead of us, we move forward excited about the many opportunities we have to grow our sales and improve our operating performance in the quarters ahead and over the long term. We\u2019d like to thank all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work and dedication as our people are our greatest asset and we\u2019re excited about the long term growth prospects for Genuine Parts.  Paul, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. As we reflect back on the first quarter we have several accomplishments we\u2019d like to highlight. We established a new sales record at $4.6 billion and up 17%. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.27 increased by 18% from 2017. We reiterated our full year sales and earnings guidance with sales at plus 12% to plus 13% and comparable EPS of plus 19% to 22%. We completed our first full quarter with AAG and this business continues to perform well and we are making progress on our integration. We took two significant steps to optimize our portfolio, further enabling us to focus on our higher growth and higher margin global automotive and industrial businesses.  First, we combined EIS with Motion to form a larger and stronger industrial products group with expected revenues exceeding $6 billion annually. In addition we entered into an agreement to spin off the business products group and form a new company with Essendant. We made significant IT investments in the quarter to improve our digital capabilities and enhance our B2C online offerings, as well as enhance our operational efficiencies and productivity in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Australasia. We generated solid cash flows improving our cash from operations relative to 2017 and finally we increased our 2018 dividend for the 62nd consecutive year. So with these accomplishments we move forward in 2018 better positioned to address our challenges and maximize the growth opportunities available to us. We remain focused on both organic and acquisitive sales to drive long term sustained revenue growth and will continue to execute on our plans and initiatives to enhance our gross margins, reduce cost and build a highly productive and cost effective infrastructure. We expect our focus in these key areas to improve the operating performance in our core businesses and for the company overall.  As always, we look forward to updating you on our progress again in July when we report our second quarter 2018 results. So with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to Ashley and Carol and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Horvers : Thanks, good morning everybody. Paul Donahue : Hey, good morning Chris. Christopher Horvers : I want to first focus on the U.S. NAPA business. Can you share how much the impact of Easter was by itself and I understand the weather headwinds in March with all the nor easters that came up the east coast, but at the same time it would seem like you had a pretty favorable January. So I just wanted to get your thoughts there. Do you think it \u2013 is it fair to you know call out weather in March and not acknowledge the strength in January? Paul Donahue : Yeah, so Chris the \u2013 and it\u2019s a fair question. The cadence of the quarter, certainly January started out pretty good and that cold weather helped our business for sure. February was pretty good as well. Where we began to see it tail off was in March and specifically in the second half of March. Easter had an impact. Probably to address your question specifically, Easter was probably less than 0.5% overall impact, but you know the \u2013 you take three nor easters that hit the Northeast in the month of March, we had numerous DC store shutdowns in both the Northeast and Atlantic and that absolutely had an impact. What we see right now Chris is that certainly too much winter weather is not a good thing. We\u2019ve seen our Ag business is off to a slow start, agriculture business. Our break business which is, you know we are usually taking off this time of the year is soft, but look in the long run the cold weather is a benefit for us. We think we\u2019ll see a pick up most likely in Q2 and on into Q3 as parts fail, maintenance come into play, pot holes begin to take their toll. So longer term it is going to be a positive for us. Christopher Horvers : And then, you know it sounds like you know with the slightly positive U.S. comp and DIY better, was do-it-for-me thus down negative and I am just curious, you\u2019ve been around this business for a long time, what do you think has changed in the do-it-for-me business, because it\u2019s you know clearly DIY doing better than do-it-for-me is something very different from what had occurred for a long period of time. Paul Donahue : Well, I again \u2013 and Chris look, it would be fair to point out that our NAPA business is not like our peer groups. We are improving our retail business and we\u2019ve had an initiative to upgrade our stores for some time.  But retail for us DIY is still less than 25% of our overall business. We\u2019re still largely driven by our DIFM business and our commercial business. As I mentioned, we saw improved results in our auto care business which we have 17,000 NAPA auto care centers. That business was up low single digits, which has improved. Major accounts while improving somewhat from previous quarter, we\u2019re still challenged and what we hear in the marketplace Chris is that overall their business overall is pretty much flat. So specifically on your question about our DIFM business it was pretty much flat in the quarter. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then one last one. Just as you think about the SG&A dollar growth, can you talk about where that played, the SG&A dollars played out relative to your expectations for the first quarter and you know what\u2019s the stripping out all on the acquisitions. What\u2019s sort of the core growth rate in your, you know the SG&A structure this year. Thanks very much. Carol Yancey : Yes so Chris, when we look at SG&A in the quarter and where our expectations were, so our core growth in U.S. automotive was not quiet where we thought it would be, much about what Paul mentioned earlier, what we saw certainly in March and then our business products division, their core growth was a little bit worse than what we saw.  So having said that, it\u2019s Q1 and what we certainly, we look at the 300 basis point increase. Looking at, you got the deal costs in there, you got AAG, you\u2019ve got increased interests in amortization and that would be about half of the increase. The rest is really from the lower core growth and payroll is the biggest driver there. So we look at our businesses and we look at headcount and we look at headcount being flat as an organization, but these wage pressures, the increases we are facing in fuel, I mean those are real dollars.  So the headwinds on wages and fuel are real and that was probably a little worse than we thought in the quarter and we mentioned the additional investments we are going to be making in IT and digital and certainly that was planned for. So where probably we were short was the lower core growth and then seeing the additional stronger wage pressures and increases in fuel and deliveries. Christopher Horvers : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matt Fassler : Thank you so much and good morning to you. My first question just based on quantifying the impact of AAG to gross margin and I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s intrinsic marginrate and if it is that much higher, curious as to why or whether it\u2019s just kind of P&L geography. I know we saw this popup to a smaller degree in Q4 when you only had ownership of that business for part of the quarter, but just so that we can model that appropriately over the next couple of quarters, if you could talk about why this is driving the reported gross margin so much higher. Carol Yancey : Yeah, happy to take that. So gross margin was up 170 basis points in the quarter and I would tell you AAG was about 100 basis points, and the remaining amount is due to improvement on the industrial side and also slight improvement on the automotive side offset by declines in business products. The reason that AAGs gross margin is stronger and we\u2019ve spoken to \u2013 sometimes we\u2019ve have acquisitions, Asia-Pac in particular and now AAG that come in with a higher gross margin and higher SG&A, but these are comparable from an operating margin basis.  The big driver for AAG and I think we mentioned this early on when we made the acquisition, they have growth revenue that is more around slightly over $2 billion but the GAAP reported revenue, so growth billings will be much higher. The GAAP reported revenue is more like $1.7 billion. So when you look at the gross margin and the SG&A you are going to have higher gross margin by lowering your sales number. Matt Fassler : Understood. The second quick question I have relates to operating leverage in the automotive business. If you think about the underlying intrinsic business ex-acquisitions, can you talk about the kind of sales growth that you think you need to breakeven in terms of automotive unit margin? Paul Donahue : Yeah Matt, this is Paul. We generally take about 3%. We have been kind of mired in this flat to 1%, 2% comp growth here now for few quarters in the row and we got to generate some top line growth. I covered our growth pillars with you earlier. Our team is laser focused on driving top line growth so that we can leverage that fixed expense that we have, but we generally look at 3% as a must. Matt Fassler : And is that breakeven higher today, given both some of the discretionary investments that you are making also you spoke about the backdrop in terms of wages and fright and obviously that something that everyone is coping with. Does that take that number above 3% or is 3% still, is leverage still at... Paul Donahue : No, 3% is a good number Matt and we are absolutely our committed to the investments that Carol mentioned. But 3% is a good number. Matt Fassler : And then very quickly finally. So I think you said in the other line items, just to understand P&L geography of the dealer related costs. I think you broke out $13 million of cost, part of it in gross margin, part of in SG&A, in your initial comments. Then you also saw about $13 million in other line item. I just want to make sure, and I\u2019m like just be in my own confusion that I understand where exactly that $13 million that we exclude, resides in your disclosure. A - Carol Yancey : Yeah, so in the segment information there are no deal costs in any of the operating segments. So we put the deal cost of $13 million the other net line and then when you look at the income statement, we had $5.8 million in cost of goods sold and $7.2 million in SG&A. Matt Fassler : Got you. So you broke it out on that divisional P&L and you just articulated it where it shows up on the consolidated P&L, that\u2019s very helpful. Carol Yancey : Correct, but it\u2019s all the same $13 million. Matt Fassler : Perfect. Thank you so much guys. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Matt. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys, Scot Ciccarelli. Paul Donahue : Hi, Scot Scot Ciccarelli : I had two questions. Hi, the first is, I know it\u2019s probably hard to figure out just given the changes occurring, wage expense, etc. Can you give us an idea how much of your cost structure in the auto business is fixed versus what you consider is variable? Carol Yancey : Well, I would tell you on SG&A when we look at our cost in SG&A and we\u2019ve said as always at least two-thirds of our costs are payroll and payroll related. Having said that, when you look at facilities and a portion of the payroll being fixed, we are probably 55%-ish that we would say would be fixed, and that why when we talk about what we need to leverage, it keeps at that 3%ish growth in order to leverage. Scot Ciccarelli : Alright, so 55%... Carol Yancey : Now having said that, we are working hard to make sure that we are address our cost base and whether we look at rationalization of facilities, investments in productivity improvements, optimizing our fright and delivery, all these things to help take some of these costs that could be fixed to lower basis. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it, understood. And then secondly, can you also comment on merchandise margin performance in the U.S. auto business just given the concerns out in the market place regarding price transparency? Carol Yancey : Yes, so our gross margin on the U.S. automotive business was flat. We actually, I think this is our second quarter where we\u2019ve seen flat to maybe just up slightly gross margin and we\u2019ve talked about we are not seeing impact on our gross margin as it relates to price transparency. Having said that, we are looking and always trying to optimize gross margin dollars, we got several initiatives going on. So not really \u2013 again part of that gets back what Paul mentioned, being the next that we have of commercial versus retail too. Scot Ciccarelli : Understood, okay thanks a lot guys. Paul Donahue : Thanks Scot. Carol Yancey : Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Paul Donahue : Good morning. Carol Yancey : Morning. Bret Jordan : I was on a hare late. Did you talk about regional performance in the U.S. auto market? Paul Donahue : We did not Bret, but I\u2019m happy to talk about it. We got a \u2013 about five of our eight divisions across the U.S. that are pretty well grouped together and they range from a point down to a couple of points up, so a very narrow band.  Our outliers, and we\u2019ve got a couple of outliers, certainly one would be the Northeast as you might expect. As Chris asked earlier, that winter weather certainly has been a boon for Northeast business and our Northeast business has performed quite well. Despite the interruptions with the nor easters that business has performed quite well.  On the flip we\u2019ve got one of our businesses, one of our divisions in the mid-Atlantic area that would include Memphis, Richmond that part of the country. They\u2019ve been hit hard again with winter disruptions and we\u2019ve had a number of store closers DC closures. They are not equipped to handle the snow like they are in the Northeast. So that\u2019s pretty much what we\u2019ve seen through Q1. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then the comment on inflation, I guess not seeing a lot in the first quarter in auto. What\u2019s your expectation hearing more about Asian labor and obviously some material inflation and the cost of factoring for your suppliers? Do you think the bias is to more inflation in the second half of the year? Carol Yancey : We do. In talking to our merchants and our suppliers, we do think we are going to be at a half a percent or maybe even a full percent for the year maybe in the later part of the year. And as far as, there is still a lot of uncertainty around the tariffs as I mentioned, so we are still just waiting on that but I think we are coming off of five consecutive years of having deflation. So the fact that we can come up with flat to up slightly, we do think we\u2019ll see that in the back half of the year? Bret Jordan : Okay and then one last question, on Smith Auto and some of the deals you have done, Merle's and of the little acquisitions. What\u2019s the percentage of auto sales that are company owned stores now versus independent? Paul Donahue : It\u2019s a good question, perhaps let me think on that for just a minute. You are right to point out Smith and Merle's and we\u2019ve had three or four others in the past number of quarters. It\u2019s still holding fairly steady when you look at independent versus company stores, independence would acquire for better than two-thirds of our overall business. Bret Jordan : Okay, great, thank you. Paul Donahue : And the mix of stores is staying pretty much the same. Bret Jordan : Okay great, appreciate it. Thank you. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Jacob Moser : Hey guys, this is Jacob Moser for Chris. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Jacob Moser : So now that you have been involved with AAG for almost 6 months. We\u2019re curious to see what you\u2019re going about differences in the European market. And then for the semi related, like how mature is \u2013 thinking in terms of the growth outlook. Will that most be at Greenfield and existing markets there or do you think mostly growth in Europe will sort of opportunistic M&A driven. Paul Donahue : Yeah, I\u2019ll take that one. Look the difference in between the European market place and the U.S. What we found, and again it\u2019s early. But it\u2019s very similar, we\u2019ve got many of the same suppliers when you think about our large global supplier base, its folks like Bosh, NGates and SchaefflerKYB, NGK they supply us around the world.  The folks at AAG have a, they are more commercially oriented, much like we are here in the US. They have a blend of both company stores and independently owned stores. So the differences are really very subtle.  If you think about our growth outlook, one of the things that drew us to Europe and to AAG is we are very bullish on the growth opportunities in the future and we think that the consolidation that is taking place now in Europe will only accelerate and certainly we intent to be part of that consolidation. But at the same time our folks at AAG are seeing, are seeing good comp store growth as well. So we are very bullish on our future and with our European partners. Jacob Moser : Great. Thanks for talking the question. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Mike Montani : Hey guys good morning, its Mike Montani on for Greg. Carol Yancey : Hey Mike. Mike Montani : Just wanted to ask if I could a couple of quick ones. One was, if you could talk a little bit about some of the other acquisitions that you had made year to date thus far besides the AAG. Just want to make sure we have accurate total incremental revenue contributions in the model. Carol Yancey : So it was really minimal in the quarter. We talked about Smith Auto that was the one that Paul mentioned. In Europe there was eight single store acquisitions that are just small bolt on acquisitions, but really in the quarter its Smith Auto that we mentioned earlier. Paul Donahue : And just as a reminder Mike, you know AAG was actually late last year. So that was not a 2018 acquisition. Mike Montani : Yeah, got it. Okay and then if I could just follow up a little bit; you guys had mentioned there was optimism around industrial and seeing some margin expansion there as we work through the year. I guess I am just wondering, is the same sentiment fair for the U.S. automotive division give the thought that the comps will be improving here, at least towards that two to three range it looks like? Paul Donahue : Yeah, well certainly two different industries. I\u2019ll make be touch on industrial first Mike and you are right, we are very optimistic. You know we had a terrific year last year with Motion and we have seen that continue on in the first quarter. Last year each quarter we were up 7%, first quarter this year we were up 8%. So they continue to rock along, PMI numbers, rig counts, industrial production, all are positive. Manufacturers are bullish right now about the U.S. and so we don\u2019t see any slowdown in industrial. Automotive, it\u2019s a different industry, differ business, but we are optimistic about our U.S. automotive business as well. We think as I mentioned earlier that certainly this winter weather that we experienced in Q1, although I think being offset somewhat with business disruptions in Q1, I think we will see the benefit in Q2 and beyond and again, most of the fundamentals in automotive remain positive. So there is no reason we shouldn\u2019t continue to grow our U.S. automotive business and get it back into those 3% to 4% comps that we historically have posted. Mike Montani : Okay and if I could just ask about sourcing for a minute, I know you all have done a lot of work in the past sourcing out of Asia. Can you just update us on what percentage of the buy you all will be doing there, especially in light of the S.P. Richards divestiture? How to think about just kind of the ability to source from other countries as well if that were to come up? Paul Donahue : Yeah, so Mike we have a sourcing office in China, we\u2019ve had it for well over 10 years that services all of our businesses. The amount of volume rolling through that office as a percentage of our total is still a small percentage and a bit of that was in our office products business.  What I would comment on Mike is, you know as we now move into Europe and Australia and New Zealand continues to expand, as we look across our souring and our supplier base, you have really four different sources if you will. You have your U.S. exclusive suppliers, you have European exclusive suppliers, you\u2019ve got global suppliers of which I\u2019ve already listed a number of those and then you have of course Asian sourcing as you just mentioned.  We are working very closely with our team in Europe and working through that suppler base and that sourcing model and we think there is real opportunity for us to continue to build and to drive global synergies across all of our businesses. Mike Montani : Great. Thank you. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Jason Haas : Hi, this is Jason Haas for Elizabeth Suzuki. Thank you for talking the question. So I just got a follow-up regarding your comments on inflation. Can you provide color on what product categories you have the best pricing power in and might be the best position to pass along any inflation that we might see? Carol Yancey : Well actually, the comments that we have, I mean right now we are flat in automotive and what we would look for if we do have some inflation in the back half of the year to around a half a point, those increases would be passed along to customers. So it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a different there is product categories and how we pass that along. Because these would be increases of such that are passed along in the broad market; this is not something specific to us or to a certain supplier. So they would be broad market related. And quite honestly, that\u2019s how the potential would be with tariffs or any of those changes is that it would be broad based.  So out of those we\u2019ve got color on exactly what categories as we are going to come in, but we think about it in a much broader sense. Jason Haas : Thanks, and then as a follow-up. So we\u2019ve seen the weather in April has been a lot colder than last year. So I\u2019m curious just quarter-to-date if you have seen any sort of pickup in demand or do you think the weather is going to kind of push those sales later maybe into May or June? Paul Donahue : Well its, Jason I mean it\u2019s early to comment on that, but what I would tell you is we need to get on with spring. I know you guys are getting some winter weather up there still in the northeast. We had \u2013 just last week we had over a foot of snow in the Midwest, many parts of the Midwest, that\u2019s not great for our business. We are in the time of the year where farmers got to get out in the field and we do a ton of business with agriculture, fields are frozen, covered with snow. This is break season; the break season is now really being delayed. So look I think that business will come but it\u2019s getting pushed out a bit because of this unseasonably cold winter weather in late March and April. Jason Haas : Thanks. Paul Donahue : You are welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Seth Basham : I have a follow-up question along those lines. Just thinking about your performance in the quarter in the U.S. auto business, can you provide color on how weather sensitive versus non-weather sensitive categories performed overall? Paul Donahue : Yeah, it\u2019s a good question Seth. When you look at our key product categories, I guess not surprisingly with a little more severe winter weather, batteries were our number one growth business and I would tell you it\u2019s a little bittersweet because we had a good -- we had a really good quarter in batteries and we had some service interruptions early in the quarter that I think it even could have been better.  Our tool and equipment business was good, our hydraulics business was good, chemicals as you would expect performed quite well, so all of those categories were strong in the quarter. Where we saw some underperformers was around our under car business. So again going back to what I had mentioned earlier, when you get into March we generally consider the month of March as the kickoff of break season and with some of the weather that we had across the U.S., I think that\u2019s going to get pushed out a bit. Seth Basham : Got you, a follow-up on that, March beginning the break season. With your commercial customer focus, how does weather play into that? I can understand DIY-ers not being able to work on their cars outside, but it wasn\u2019t so bad that it created difficulties in taking cars to a shop to get fixed. Paul Donahue : No, it certainly wouldn\u2019t Seth but I just think that consumers are putting it off and it also certainly relates to, when you look at the categories performing well just as batteries it directly relates to failure. So I think just some of your maintenance categories are just going to get delayed, going to get pushed out a bit, and that\u2019s regardless of whether it\u2019s DIY or DIFM. I think that\u2019s the case. Seth Basham : Got you. Thank you and then one housekeeping item, you may have addressed this before, but thinking about the seasonality of AAG business, can you remind us how it compares to the U.S. or the Global Auto business? Paul Donahue : Very similar, very similar to the U.S. and on that note Seth as I now give the weather report across the U.S. I can talk about Europe as well and we got hit hard. The UK was basically shutdown for two days in Q1 that impacted AAGs business. I think we would have seen, I don\u2019t think \u2013 I know we would have seen even stronger numbers out of that team without that, but the weather patterns are very, very similar the U.S. Seth Basham : Thank you. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Carolina Jolly with Gabelli. Carolina Jolly : Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Just one question I guess. This is another quarter where you have seen some weakness in your national account business. When you talk to those customers, do they give you any other factors outside of weather that might be affecting your business? Paul Donahue :   Well, and I didn't glean this directly from conversations with our major account customers. But as you look across some of the headwinds, Carolina you would have to, I mean certainly weather isn\u2019t always going to be near the top of the list. But let\u2019s face it, vehicles and parts are seeing less failure these days. Vehicles are much better made, the quality of vehicles are much better made and I think you are just seeing less failure. But I do believe in the long run this major account business will bounce back. We don\u2019t believe we are losing any market share with our key partners. We\u2019ll continue to drive to try to grab a greater share of their spend. As I mentioned in our key growth pillars that is absolutely our first and foremost is grab a greater share of wallet. So the business is there for our teams. We just got to promise that we got to execute a bit better. Carolina Jolly : Alright, thanks a lot. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference call back over to management for any additional or closing comments. A - Carol Yancey : We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation in today\u2019s first quarter conference call. We thank you for your support at Genuine Parts Company and we look forward to talking to you with our second quarter results. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. We thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Research Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter two018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sid Jones, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sidney Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter two018 Conference Call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for the full year. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today's call also may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. Now let me turn the call over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and welcome to our second quarter two018 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our second quarter two018 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our three businesses, Automotive, Industrial and business products. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2018. After that, we'll open up the call to your questions. So to recap our second quarter performance across our global platform, total sales were a record $4.8 billion, up 17.6%, driven by the favorable impact of strategic acquisitions and a 3.4% comp sales increase, which has improved from the plus 2% in the first quarter. Net income was $227 million and earnings per share of $1.54 was also a new record. Excluding the impact of transaction and other cost related to the acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group and the agreement to spin off the Business Products Group, adjusted net income was $234 million, up 23%, and adjusted earnings per share was $1.59, also up 23%.  As we look to our global Automotive group, total sales were 27.7% in the second quarter, including an approximate 2.1% comp sales increase, which compares to a 1.5% increase in the first quarter. We are pleased to see our comps headed in the right direction. We also have the benefit of acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation. Breaking it down further, sales for our U.S. Automotive operations were up 4% in the second quarter, with comp sales up 1.5% and improved from the first quarter. We were encouraged by the positive shift in the underlying sales environment for this business, which we believe reflects the continuing favorable effect of this winter's more normalized weather as well as the summer heat across most of the U.S. in both May and June. After a slow start out of the gate, largely due to the cold and wet conditions at the start of spring, our sales were much improved in both May and June. By market segment, sales to our retail customers continue to outpace sales to the commercial segment, although our commercial comps were improved from the first quarter and reflect our strongest results over the past 9 quarters. By customer segment, we were encouraged to see stronger results in both NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts sales. NAPA AutoCare sales were plus 3% for the quarter while Major Accounts sales were up slightly for their first positive comp in several quarters. Looking ahead, we believe the improving conditions for underlying sales demand, combined with our ongoing initiatives, continue to enhance our value-added services for both existing and new commercial customers. This should drive further sales growth in the upcoming quarters.  Turning to our retail business. We remain pleased with the continued solid growth in this segment due primarily to initiatives like the NAPA Rewards Program, expanded store hours and our retail impact store project. These initiatives continue to drive incremental sales growth. And while retail remains at 20% to 25% of our U.S. Automotive sales, it is an important segment of the overall market.  In summary, we are encouraged by the improvement in our U.S. Automotive comp sales in the second quarter, and we expect to see demand across the aftermarket continue to strengthen. As we head into the second half of 2018, we are seeing the positive shift in demand for failure and maintenance parts due to the continuing impact of more normalized winter weather patterns and the record heat across much of the U.S. thus far this summer. We expect the number of vehicles in the aftermarket sweet spot to further stabilize and ultimately become a tailwind in 2019 and into 2020. The long-term fundamental drivers for the automotive aftermarket remained sound with a growing total and aging fleet and an increasing -- increase in miles driven among consumers. We also expect our ongoing acquisitions and overall footprint expansion to positively contribute to our future sales.  In addition to the five Smith Auto Parts stores added to our U.S. network in March, which we discussed last quarter, we recently added the Sanel Auto Parts to our network of independent NAPA auto parts stores. Sanel Auto Parts is a 44-store, fourth generation business with market-leading position in New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine markets. Sanel represents the largest independent changeover in the history of NAPA, and we want to welcome both David and Bobby Segal and the entire Sanel team to the NAPA and GPC family. The addition of Smith auto and Sanel Auto Parts to our overall store network, as well as other accretive tuck-in acquisitions, remain an important part of our growth strategy, and we see additional opportunities to expand our U.S. store footprint.  So now let's turn to our international Automotive businesses in Canada, Mexico, Europe and Australasia. Collectively, these operations delivered a second consecutive quarter of 6% total sales growth, including a 2% comp sales increase and accounted for approximately 40% of our total Automotive revenues. Starting with our other North American Automotive operations, total sales were up mid-single digits at both NAPA Canada and in Mexico.  In Canada, sales were driven by low single-digit comp sales growth and acquisitions, including the addition of Universal Supply Group on December 31, as we discussed last quarter. The NAPA Canada team remains focused on their sales initiatives and with positive industry fundamentals and a stable economy at their back, we expect continued growth at our Canadian operations over the balance of 2018. Now turning to Alliance Automotive Group. This business continues to operate well across its European footprint in France, the U.K., Germany and Poland. The team at AAG posted mid-single-digit sales comps for the second quarter and continues to benefit from ongoing acquisitions. AAG remains on plan for both sales and profit, and we are pleased with the continued progress on our integration plans, including our initiatives to drive synergies.  As mentioned before, AAG's robust acquisition strategy resulted in additional bolt-on acquisitions again in the second quarter. We also announced on June 7 the addition of the Hennig Group in Germany, a leading supplier of light duty and commercial vehicle parts. Hennig has 31 branches across Germany and is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $190 million. We are excited to welcome the Hennig team to our German operations and expect to close on this transaction in the September-October time frame. The addition of the Hennig business, the full pipeline of other potential acquisitions and our continued focus on underlying core growth is supported by relatively solid economic and industry fundamentals. We are encouraged by the opportunities we see for our European operations and are confident that the AAG team will drive strong results through the balance of the year and beyond. In Australia and New Zealand, total sales in local currency were up mid-single digits while comp sales were up low single digits in the second quarter, consistent with the first quarter. The Asia Pac team is doing an excellent job of balancing their strategy to generate both comp sales growth and accretive acquisitions, including important e-commerce investments to enhance our digital capabilities.  We expect our continued focus in each of these areas, coupled with sound economic and aftermarket fundamentals, to drive continued solid results. But before we launch into our review of our Industrial business, allow me to summarize our global Automotive results.  After a slow start to the quarter, our U.S. business rebounded in the months of May and June and finished out the quarter with improved comps. Our European acquisition, AAG, continues to outperform, and we expect continued great things from this team. Our remaining international Automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada and Mexico continue to perform to plan, and we are optimistic for a solid second half from this group.  So now let's turn to our Industrial Parts Group. We are pleased to report the sales environment for this business remains positive. Total sales for Industrial were up 8.7% in the second quarter, including 6.5% comp sales growth, plus the benefit of acquisitions. These increases improved on the already solid growth we reported last quarter and reflect the positive impact of our ongoing growth initiatives and favorable economic and industry-specific factors. These would include the continued strength in major industrial indicators such as Purchasing Managers Index, Industrial production, active rig counts and U.S. exports.  In addition, 13 of our 14 major product groups, including the electrical specialties group, posted sales gains, and all 12 of the top industries we serve were up as well. The aggregate and cement, equipment and machinery, chemicals and allied products industry sectors were especially strong, with each showing low double-digit increases. The broad strength across our products and customer base indicates a strong industrial economy, a promising sign for the balance of 2018 and well into 2019. Our Industrial management teams at motion and EIS continue to work closely together and are making progress to generate additional revenue opportunities, economies of scale and improved efficiencies in the combined organization. The combination of these two businesses into a larger and stronger industrial group was absolutely the right decision for our team and the opportunities we see ahead for this business are encouraging. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect continued strong results from the Industrial group.  We also remain pleased with the ongoing growth at Inenco, the Australian-based industrial distribution company we partnered with in 2017. This business is performing well, having just closed its fiscal year with a record-setting performance. This group surpassed the AUD 500 million threshold for the first time in their fiscal year 2018.  As Inenco further expands its footprints across Australia and New Zealand, with acquisition such as HCD Flow Technology in New Zealand, which we announced last quarter, while they also expand their presence in Indonesia and Singapore, we are further encouraged for the future growth prospects for this business. As a reminder, we currently have a 35% investment in Inenco and we look forward to further investing in this business within the next 12 to 18 months. This quality organization will be a great addition to our global Industrial group. Now a few comments on S.P. Richards, our Business Products Group. This segment reported flat sales for the second quarter, which was a vast improvement from the 5% decrease recorded last quarter. While this business faces headwinds in the demand for traditional office products, our diversification into the facilities, break room and safety supplies category is offsetting some of these headwinds. With that said, we continue to work towards the closing of our definitive agreement with Essendant and now is back on April 12, whereby GPC will spin off the S.P. Richards business and merge it with Essendant, another national business products wholesaler. As discussed last quarter, this transaction made sense for several reasons. Primarily, the newly combined company is in the best interest of all stakeholders as it will be better positioned to effectively compete in the business product space with greater ability to support their customer community. Additionally, this allows GPC to further strengthen our focus on our core and larger, higher growth and more profitable Automotive and Industrial businesses.  Since we last reported on April 19, you are likely aware of several developments involving this transaction with Essendant. Despite these developments, our agreement remains in place. And subject to regulatory and Essendant shareholders' approval, we continue to expect to successfully close on the agreement. We believe the combination of Essendant, along with S.P. Richards, creates a stronger, more diversified business as together, these talented management teams and complementary cultures, with a shared commitment to serving customers, will be better positioned for future success.  Likewise, for employees, the new company will have the scale and depth to compete more effectively. We look forward to supporting the S.P. Richards and Essendant team in facilitating a seamless integration. So that is a summary of our consolidated and business segment sales results for the second quarter of 2018. We are pleased to report improved results with many positive developments to build on as we move through the back half of the year. So with that, I'll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will provide an update of outlook for 2018. Our total sales in the second quarter were up 18% or up 3% before acquisitions and a slight benefit from foreign currency translation. Gross margin for the second quarter was 31.55% compared to 30.24% last year. Consistent with the first quarter, this strong increase primarily reflects the higher gross margin associated with AAG and other acquisitions as well as the benefit of increased supplier incentives in our Industrial business. These items were partially offset by lower supplier incentives for the Business Products Group.  We remain focused on enhancing our gross margins through several key initiatives, including continued supplier negotiations both globally and across our businesses, the ongoing investment in more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies and improved analytic capabilities around product and customer profitability. The pricing environment has been somewhat inflationary in our Industrial and business products businesses thus far in 2018 and we would expect this to continue with the ongoing rhetoric around new tariffs. With the latest round of tariff talk, we could also see an inflationary impact in Automotive, however, there is still a fair amount of uncertainty around its timing and ultimate impact. With that said, we expect to be able to pass along any increases to the customers. Our cumulative supplier increases through the six months of 2018 were flat for Automotive, up 2% in Industrial and up 1.1% for office. Turning to our SG&A. Total expenses for the second quarter were $1.22 billion, representing 25.33% of sales. This is up from last year due to the higher operating cost model at AAG as well as incremental depreciation, amortization and interest associated with the acquisition. In the quarter, we also incurred $9 million in transaction and other cost related to AAG and the pending transaction to spin off S.P. Richards. In addition, we continue to experience the lack of leverage on our comparable sales in the Automotive and business product segments as well as ongoing pressure from rising costs in areas such as payroll, freight and delivery, IT and digital.  Finally, as we discussed in prior calls, we increased the level of technology and productivity investments this year, which we believe will generate longer-term cost savings and efficiencies.  As we move forward in the year, we're focused on our plans to address the rising cost environment and generate meaningful savings. This is essential as we work to improve our operating margin in the Automotive segment and specifically, the U.S. Automotive business. This is a top priority for us, and we're fully committed to taking the necessary steps to get this done. Now let's discuss the results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the second quarter was $2.7 billion, up 28% from the prior year, and operating profit of $244 million was up 18%, with an operating margin of 8.9% compared to the 9.7% margin in the second quarter of 2017. Primarily, the decline in operating margin reflects the deleveraging of expenses in our U.S. Automotive business, as well as the cost pressures and investments just discussed.  Our Industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, a 9% increase from quarter two, and our operating profit of $125 million is up 12% and our operating margin is 7.8% compared to 7.6% last year, with the 20 basis point improvement due to a solid gross margin and improved leverage on our expenses with a 6.5% comparable sales increase.  We expect to see continued margin expansion at Industrial over the balance of the year. Business products revenues were $483 million, flat with the prior year, and their operating profit of $21 million is down 29%, with an operating margin of 4.4%. Although we saw sales stabilize for this group in the second quarter, the business products segment continues to operate in a challenging environment and faces unfavorable product and customer mix shifts. Both of these issues are pressuring their profitability.  Our total operating profit in the second quarter was up 12% on the 18% sales increase and our operating profit margin was 8.1% compared to the 8.5% last year. This change in margin is consistent with the first quarter and as we said before, improving on these results in the quarters ahead is a top priority for us.  We had net interest expense of $25.5 million in the quarter. And for 2018, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $98 million to $100 million, which is an increase from our previous guidance of $93 million to $95 million. Our total amortization expense was $22 million for the second quarter, which is an increase from the prior year due to the amortization related to AAG. For 2018, we're updating our full year amortization to be $88 million to $90 million, which is up from the prior guidance of $83 million to $85 million. Our depreciation expense was $31 million for the quarter, up $4 million from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect total depreciation to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. And on a combined basis, we would expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $230 million to $240 million. The other line, which typically reflects our corporate expense was $43 million for the second quarter, and this includes $9 million in transaction-related costs incurred in the quarter. Excluding these costs, our corporate expense was $34 million, which is consistent with the second quarter of 2017.  For 2018, we continue to expect our corporate expense to be in the $115 million to $125 million range, which excludes transaction-related costs. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 24.4%, which is an increase from the 23% in the first quarter, as expected, but down significantly from the 36% tax rate in the prior year, which is due mainly to the benefit of U.S. tax reform. In addition, our tax rate was positively impacted by the favorable mix of U.S. and foreign earnings. We are updating our full year estimate for the 2018 tax rate to approximately 25% from the previous estimate of 26%.  Now let's turn to a discussion of the balance sheet, which remains strong and in excellent condition. Our accounts receivable of $2.7 billion is up 23% from the prior year and up 3%, excluding the impact of acquisition, primarily AAG, as well as foreign currency. The 3% increase is in line with our 3% comparable sales increase for the quarter, so we made progress in improving on our receivables during the quarter. In addition, we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at June 30 was $3.5 billion, up 5% from June of last year and down 3%, excluding AAG, our acquisitions and foreign currency. Inventory at June 30 highlights the positive impact of our current initiatives to improve the inventory levels in our core businesses, and we're very focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable of $3.8 billion at June 30 is up 16% in total and flat with the prior year excluding AAG, other acquisitions and foreign currency. Our flagged for payables is primarily driven by the 3% increase in inventory, which is resulting from the lower levels of purchasing activity in our U.S. Automotive and Business Products Groups. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of improved payment terms with certain suppliers. And at June 30, our AP to inventory ratio was an approximately 110%. Our total debt of $3.2 billion at June 30 is consistent with our debt at December 31 and March 31, and it reflects our increase in borrowings for the AAG acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our debt arrangements vary in maturity and currently, the average interest rate on our total debt stands at 2.98%. We're comfortable with our current debt structure, and we have the strong balance sheet and financial capacity to support our growth initiatives, including strategic acquisitions and investments such as AAG and the Inenco Group in Australia, which we believe creates significant value for our shareholders. So in summary, our balance sheet remains a key strength of the company.  Turning to our cash flows, we've generated $455 million in cash from operations for the six months in 2018, which has improved from last year. Our cash flows continue to support the ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. And for 2018, we continue to project cash from operations in the $950 million to $1 billion range and free cash flow of approximately $400 million.  Our priorities for cash remain the dividend, reinvestment in our businesses, share repurchase and strategic acquisitions. Regarding the dividend, 2018 represents the 52nd consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. Our 2018 annual dividend of $2.88 represents a 7% increase from 2017.  We have invested $65 million in capital expenditures thus far in 2018, which is up from $54 million in 2017. For the year, we continue to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $200 million to $220 million, with the increase from 2017 mainly due to the impact of AAG and certain technology, facility and productivity investments that we're planning for in association with our tax savings.  We have not purchased any of our common stock in 2018. And today, we have 17.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to be active in the program over the long term as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. So now let's turn to our guidance for 2018. Based on our current performance, our growth plans and initiatives, as well as the market conditions we see for the foreseeable future, we now expect total sales to be in the range of plus 13% to plus 14%, excluding the benefit of any future acquisitions and any impact from foreign currency. This represents an increase from the previous guidance of plus 12% to plus 13%.  By business, we're currently expecting plus 21% to plus 22% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, which is an increase from the previous guidance of plus 19% to plus 21%. Plus 6% to plus 7% total sales growth for the Industrial segment, which is an increase from the previous plus 4% to plus 5%. And a sales decrease of minus 3% to minus 4% for the Business Products Group, which we continue to include in our guidance until the spinoff transaction is closer to completion. This estimate is unchanged from the prior guidance. On the earnings side, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share, excluding any transaction-related costs incurred during the year, to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.75. This EPS guidance includes the benefit of a full year of operations with S.P. Richards, the Business Products Group.  So that's our financial report for the second quarter. And we closed the first half of 2018 with positive momentum, and we look forward to building on that over the second half of the year as we address those areas in need of improvement, such as our SG&A and Automotive operating margin.  Again, this is a top priority for us, and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress in the quarters ahead. Before turning it back over to Paul, I'd like to thank all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work and dedication at GPC. We appreciate all you do. And now I'll turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. To recap the second quarter, we have several accomplishments to highlight. Although we also have a few areas requiring improvement, and we plan to address these head on. We fully recognize the need to show progress in our core operating results. And the key here is to improve our Automotive margin, specifically in our U.S. operations. To this end, our team is focused on driving core sales growth to better leverage our fixed expenses. We have more work to do to execute on our sales initiatives and maximize the growth opportunities available to us. And we are also focused on ensuring a steady gross margin along with an efficient cost structure.  Rising costs in several areas has continued to offset our savings initiatives, so we must work to eliminate even more cost while continuing to provide exceptional customer service. We are committed to taking action to deliver cost savings in every aspect of our U.S. Automotive business. From an execution standpoint, we can and we will do better. Our team has delivered a much needed lift in revenues this quarter. And now we must increase our intensity around our execution and deliver improved results. As we look at the highlights from the second quarter, there are many to report on. We established a new sales record at $4.8 billion and up 18%. We established the new earnings record with EPS of $1.54, up 19%. We improved on our Automotive sales comps on our U.S. operation, and we continue to perform well in our international Automotive businesses. Our Industrial segment produced strong sales growth and improved on their profitability with an expanded operating margin. We stabilized our business products sales and continue to work towards the spinoff of this business. We improved the strength of our balance sheet and generated strong cash flows to support our capital allocation plans. We announced the significant strategic acquisition in Germany that will strengthen our position in this key market. And we increased our full year sales guidance to plus 13% to plus 14% and reiterated our full year adjusted EPS guidance at plus 19% to plus 22% over last year. With these accomplishments, as well as our other action plans to address areas requiring improvement, we entered the second half of 2018 focused on improving our operating results. We will continue to emphasize an organic and acquisitive sales strategy to drive long-term, sustained revenue growth and will continue to execute on our plans and initiatives to enhance our gross margins, reduce cost and build a highly productive and cost-effective infrastructure.  We expect our focus in these key areas to improve the operating performance in our core businesses and for the company overall. As always, we look forward to updating you on our progress again in October when we report our third quarter two018 results. So with that, we'll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bret Jordan, Jefferies. Bret Jordan : A couple of questions on AAG. So the mid-single-digit comp in Europe, is that, do you think, better than the market? Are you gaining share there? Or was the market very strong in Europe? Paul Donahue : Bret, I think that, overall, as we model that business and did our due diligence, we believe we're outperforming right now. Our thoughts going into the year would be really on the low side of positive comps, and we outperformed. And I would really call out our team in the U.K. where we had strong single-digit comps in the U.K. And Germany, we did just fine as well. So a really good performance by the AAG team. Bret Jordan : How do we think about their EBITDA margin? I guess, it sounds like their gross margin's high, but maybe some incremental SG&A in that business mix? Carol Yancey : No, actually, when we look at their operating margin, their operating margin is performing better than our U.S. Automotive margin and more in line with our other international Automotive businesses. So they actually carry a slightly higher operating margin and there isn't really any concerns with SG&A with that group. I can tell you when you have mid-single-digit comps and you're growing a little bit better than the industry, they're doing a really nice job on the margin side. So they are at plan with where we told you guys back last year with the $0.45 to $0.50 EPS on a full year basis and probably more at the high end of that number. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then the question I have to ask, any regional performance spreads in the quarter in the U.S.? Paul Donahue : Yes, Bret, certainly, the strength for us this past quarter was in our warmer markets. So our Southeastern division had a strong quarter. Our Southwestern division had a strong quarter. And if you look out West, we did just fine. They outperformed what we call our colder weather division, so the Midwest, the Central, Northeast, even the Mountain. And again, that April soft start with -- we had snow across the Midwest go in the month of April. That certainly had an impact on our Northern divisions, but they rebounded nicely in May and June. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then one last question. We said you would probably passing through anything you see in tariffs. Have you had any conversations or have your suppliers been opening the conversation about higher pricing? Obviously, even before tariffs, they were seeing labor and maybe some material input inflation. But what do you expect for inflation in the second half? It sounded like it was flat in the second quarter. Carol Yancey : Yes, so on the tariff side for Automotive, and you're right, we're flat in price increases for the first half. We certainly expect -- we've had some increases and some decreases, first half. We certainly expect to see something in second half for the year. When we speak specifically to tariffs, I think what's been effective thus far to date is they're negligible, especially when you look at this is just our U.S. Automotive business primarily what we're talking about year-to-date. So we absolutely have had conversations with our suppliers. They're ongoing. We've got a team that's very involved with this. And we would be looking at any increases, whether it's raw materials, freight, interest rates, tariffs, we're looking at it very broadly. We've got teams in place that are working with our global sourcing offices. We've got modeling going on. We're going to use a lot of database negotiations with our suppliers. But at the end of the day, it's going to be something that we pass along to the customer, and we'll just have to wait and see how this plays out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham, Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Nice improvement in the U.S. comps. But I was wondering if you could address some of the margin weakness in the U.S. Can you give us a breakdown how the margin performed between gross and SG&A, and what's been the drivers are specifically? Carol Yancey : Yes. So Seth, when we look at our Automotive margins and the decline that we had in the quarter, that is completely related to the U.S. Automotive business. So combination, flat to slightly up on gross margins. We had a little bit of customer and product mix issues in the quarter that were a headwind on gross margin. But the primary issue is SG&A. And what I would call out is what we're seeing is probably about half of the margin deterioration is great and diesel fuel and delivery related and also IT investments, which we've called out, and the other half is payroll. And so the two things I would say is that these increases in payroll and specifically freight and delivery are greater than what our, say, 5% sales increases, including AAG. And so we had particular issues in the quarter with freight. You guys have seen it. April, it particularly spiked. It stayed up very strong in the Q2. We had some additional driver regulations. There's labor shortages. So our teams are working very hard to deal with those freight increases that are greater than our sales. And so we're working on that and considering and looking at a number of things from passing along to the customers. And the other thing with payroll, as you know, again, with payroll increases, some of the minimum wage increases and some of the unemployment. And quite honestly, incentive compensation swing this year compared to last year, which is a function of the improved sales, all that with a up slightly comp that we don't leverage on is really what's weighing on those U.S. Automotive margins. But having said that, and you heard Paul say it, we've got a lot of plans in place for the second half to hopefully narrow that gap and make up some of the progress there. Seth Basham : That's helpful color. How do you think about the pricing power of your business in the U.S. given these rising costs that everyone else is facing? Do you have an ability to pass along those higher cost in the form of higher prices? Paul Donahue : Yes, we do, Seth. And if you look across our businesses in the U.S. whether it be Industrial, auto or business products, our intent -- and it's no different in 2018 as it has in past years, we do intend to pass those along. And when you look at our size and our scale in the Automotive sector, we certainly believe we have the ability to pass those along, not here -- not just in the U.S., but across the globe as well. Seth Basham : Fair enough. And then just thinking about the cadence of your sales for the quarter in the U.S., you talked about softer April and stronger May and June. Did -- was May your strongest month and then a bit of deceleration in June? And how do the July period start off for you? Paul Donahue : No, the -- well, Seth, look, April was a train wreck. April weather really, really put us in a bit of a hole, coming out of April. We saw -- and I'm speaking just the U.S. Automotive right now. But it was a similar trend across all of GPC. We saw it rebound nicely in May and it held up in June. So there was no slide in June and July with the heat that we're seeing across the U.S. is holding up just fine. So as we predicted last quarter, that combination of that brutally cold winter we had, coupled with the heat that really kicked in May, June and is holding in July, that bodes well for the aftermarket. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth Suzuki : So regarding your guidance, you had raised the sales growth outlook and the tax rate was lowered for the full year, but the EPS range is still the same. Do you think -- is there some conservatism being baked into that earnings outlook, particularly given the uncertainty around tariffs? Or do you think costs are already turning higher than you previously expected, so you're just going to keep the outlook for EPS the same as it was? Carol Yancey : Yes. So what we looked at, certainly, we look at where we are thus far through the six months. So there is certainly a consideration that we're a bit behind through the six months. We had implied kind of flattish operating margins on a full year, and we're a little bit behind now. So that's part of it. We are implying a little bit stronger comp growth when we've got a range for a second half. If we come in a little bit stronger there, that would give us more comfort. But the other thing I'd point out is we called out a couple of cost increases for second half. So interest, amortization. We even have a little bit of FX in the second half. So I think our second half margins would be somewhat comparable to what you saw in the first half and we hope to kind of narrow that range. And look, as you mentioned, which is all the uncertainties right now, we just felt it was appropriate to leave the range that we have at this point. Elizabeth Suzuki : Yes, that makes sense. And as you mentioned, the inability to leverage cost in the auto business this quarter, comps were above 2%, globally. So what do you think is the bogey for where your comp needs to be in order to get operating leverage in this current environment? Carol Yancey : Well, we've said in the past that, that comp is around more of a 3% number to get us there. Having said that, when you've got these kind of increases in freight and delivery, we're working awful hard to get that to where it needs to be. So having 1.5% or 2% is certainly helping us, but we need to get 3 or above. And the reason we're comfortable with that is we can look at our industrial business and see what we've done there, their margins and their improvement, and we know also historically what we've done in the past. So a number of these projects we have will be helping us try to narrow that gap. Paul Donahue : And Liz, I would just add to the comments Carol just made, the 3% number. The good news is that we were there and a little above that number in both May and June. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers, JP Morgan. Christopher Horvers : My first question is on the gross margins. Can you remind us of what the sort of acquisition benefit was in the gross margin? What I'm basically trying to figure out is if I look at the core gross margin rate performance and ex acquisition in 2Q versus 1Q, was it -- did you see similar up year-over-year? Or was there some degradation in the performance in 2Q versus 1Q, and what would have driven that? Carol Yancey : Yes. So when you look at Q2 specifically, our core growth margin without AAG would be up slightly. So more around a 10 or 20 basis point up. That is primarily due to Industrial strong performance in their core gross margin, their improved supplier incentives, and that is being offset by the lower supplier incentives and product mix, customer mix issues and business products. And then the core Automotive is up slightly as well. When you ask specifically about Q1 to Q2, there is a little bit of a shift in Q2. It's small, and that primarily -- we would call out a little bit of the mix issues in the quarter. Some of our categories in Automotive, be it batteries, tools and equipment, commodities, chemicals, those carry the lower gross margin. So a little bit of mix shift. But I think when you look at kind of full year, you're going to see us have an up slightly gross margin, and that should carry through. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And maybe as you think about a core growth rate or comp in Industrial, 6.5, accelerating on a 1 year and 2 year, really very impressive. The margins haven't really flowed through. You would think at that pace that you would see more OI rate expansion. So is there something different about the cycle? Is it -- is some of this the freight cost that you're referring to? Is the vendor allowance dynamics different around cycles? Is the mix of the business that is growing? Curious how you think about as to the long-term potential of the Industrial operating income rate considering how strong it is at this point. Carol Yancey : Yes. So the one thing I would call out, our Industrial business has performed quite well. As you recall, we combined the electrical division within motion. So when you look at their performance in the quarter, motion standalone was actually up 30 basis points in the quarter. So nice improvement there. The supplier incentives are moving in line with sales. This team is doing a terrific job on their balance sheet, working capital and inventories. So we're always going to be mindful of that. On a long-term basis, we're looking for their margins to be at 8 to 8.5. You're going to see more incremental margin improvement with the 10, 20, 30 basis points because it's a very competitive environment out there. So as they are having these increases, they're working very hard with their customers, especially those under contract to pass them along. So it remains a competitive environment. But we're pleased with this 30 basis point improvement that we have thus far. And a long-term basis, I think you can expect to see about this rate going forward. Paul Donahue : And Chris, I would just add, our Industrial business really shows no signs of slowing down. And as you commented, they're building upon quarter after quarter. I mean, this rebound really began in Q4 of '16, carried all the way through last year. And now, the first half of this year. And when you look at key indicators, whether it be the manufacturing capacity numbers or the PMI numbers, rig count, all those continue to be very positive. So we're bullish on our Industrial business and expect to see continued good results from this group. Christopher Horvers : And that's a good segue. As you think about the energy business and your exposure to that, I was just curious what you're seeing. I'm surprised it wasn't up. You didn't mention that as a low, a double-digit grower. Is there something different this time in terms of the amount of hiring that's been happening as oil prices have come up? Is it that -- there's been more automated then there's been more investment so there's less -- sort of less need in terms of -- for parts of existing products versus [indiscernible] cycle? Paul Donahue : No, I don't think so, Chris. One thing I would point out is we look across our divisions across the motion business. So I look at the -- if you were to ask about the regionality in our Industrial space, our best-performing operations are down in the Southwest part of the U.S. And again, we're stacking these increases on top of the quarter after quarter and over last year. So when you ask specifically about our oil and gas extraction business, it's up mid- to high-single digits, so still, still comping very well. Christopher Horvers : Yes. And then my last question is just for the peeling of the onion on the Automotive business. You talked about the West and the South being stronger because it didn't have April. I don't know if you have this in front of you, but if you could just focus on the May and the June side. Was the performance in sort of the North Central and Northeast more similar to the other areas of the country? Paul Donahue : Yes, they rebounded nicely. And again, I've mentioned this on a number of times and we talked about it last quarter as well, the Midwest, which I visited just recently, spent time with our owners up in Illinois and Minnesota. These guys, the farmers couldn't get the field. They have to put a snow for the end of April. Once that snow cleared, we got into May and June, those businesses rebounded nicely, but they had just -- they were coming out quite of a hole in April. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Melich, MoffettNathanson. Gregory Melich : I guess, a quick follow-up on the auto trends and then I want to fully understand the guidance. Paul, when you talked about that bounce back in those markets, like the Midwest and Northeast, are those areas now actually running ahead of the rest of the country? Is there some sort of catchup from that? Or are they just sort of back to a more normalized trend? And then I have a follow-up. Paul Donahue : Back to more normalized, Greg. And if I look at the Northeast, for instance, they're going to get skewed with the, I mentioned, the big change over there. We're going to have really starting to take hold here in the second half, Sanel Auto Parts up in New England. So our Northeastern business is going to benefit greatly from adding that business. But no, we've returned back to more normal growth patterns across the Northern, Northern sector of the U.S. Gregory Melich : Great. And then a follow-up on a bigger picture question on tariffs and passing through. What percentage of your product in the auto business is imported either indirectly or direct? And how, historically, it's been so long since we had any inflation in auto parts. What's the history? Or what do you think it takes in terms of timing for that to actually flow through to the end market? Paul Donahue : Yes, I'll take the first part of that question, Greg, and I'll let Carol weigh in on the second half of your question. As we look across our businesses and what percentage of their business is coming out of China, whether it be on a direct sourcing standpoint, which is still relatively small for us. But our manufacturers and suppliers who manufacture and bring parts in from China, our Automotive business is about 40% and S.P. Richards is greater than that on the office side. Motion is significantly less than that number. So that's kind of how it breaks down by business. Carol Yancey : And I think the only other thing I'd add is, as we've mentioned before with this tariff, and again, while there's a lot of uncertainties, this really does not impact our European Automotive business or our Australasian business. So this 40%, Paul mentioned, was really on the U.S. Automotive number. And as far as to how long and passing it through, look, one of the things is -- and we saw this with the first round that came into play, when these things go into effect, there's a number of discussions to go on with the suppliers. There's a lot of modeling that's done. We could look at early buy-ins. We could look at when the market can bear. I mean, we may even have opportunities to have margin increases in certain areas. So it's going to be -- I mean, we will have time. And if the effective date that's out there tentatively, remember to be September 1st on this list three that we have, we would have time to work with our suppliers on passing those through. Gregory Melich : Great. So it sounds like something more for fourth quarter in terms of... Carol Yancey : Well, look, we're really watching it very closely. But we know -- we don't know right now. We don't have anything factored in, but we would say later in the year for sure. Paul Donahue : Greg, the list three that Carol referenced is the one that we're all keeping a very close eye on. We really, as we mentioned, it's negligible to this point, but everybody is keeping a close watch on list three. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri, Wolfe Research. Christopher Bottiglieri : Quick clarifying one. The 5% comp growth or mid-single-digit that you said, slight in Europe, is that all same-store sales? Or is some of that like square footage growth? Paul Donahue : It's a combination of both, Chris. Our AAG business in Europe, we've done a number of small bolt-on acquisitions that's kind of been their historical pattern. And we've continued that as we've stepped into that business. Again, where we were pleasantly surprised is the strength of our comp number in the quarter. And again, hats off to our team in the U.K. and in Germany. They've done a terrific job. Christopher Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then earlier in the conversation, you start talking about productivity investments. Can you just maybe remind us what you're doing there and types of projects are working and there's a way to quantify to the extent that those are currently impacting margins? And is there a point where you lap those? Are you kind of seeing this as like a multiyear process? Carol Yancey : Well, the first thing I would say, this is a multiyear process. It's being driven GPC and it's actually being driven globally. I sat through a recent meeting with our senior operations team, and these are projects that are in Australia. They're in Canada. They're in Europe. It's putting further automation, as an example, further automation in our facility, so our distribution centers and enhancing those facilities. In some cases, moving to newer, more improved facilities, consolidating facilities, putting in automation. We're also looking at -- on the technology side. We look at automation there and whether it's back office, shared services, we certainly have projects there. So some of it is warehouse management type software and enhancements there. Pricing is other thing I'd call out. I mean, we call our technology and productivity investments in our pricing, data analytics and software and actually working with a group to use the data that we have and be able to have a more optimized pricing strategy for our retail and wholesale business. So that's some of where our investments are going to. As far as -- again, a multiyear process and as far as calling out, I think, again, it's probably too hard to really specifically talk about it, but it would fit into what our long-term margin goals are going forward. Christopher Bottiglieri : Got you, okay. And then just one final unrelated question. You mentioned that the NAPA AutoCare Centers are seeing really strong growth right now. And then the national accounts, still a bit lighter. Can you talk about maybe what you think is driving that variance between the 2 customers? I would think they have kind similar demand patterns, but anything you can maybe talk to that could explain that gap? Paul Donahue : Yes. First, I'd point out that the growth that we saw both out of our NAPA AutoCare Centers and the Major accounts is the best growth that we've seen in a number of quarters. We can do better and we will do better, but we're very pleased to see it headed in the right direction. NAPA AutoCare Centers, Chris, if you think about it, we've got a bit more of a captive audience there. They fly our flag. They fly the NAPA brand. They use our training, a lot of our systems, our guys are well entrenched there with our autocare centers. So our expectation would always be that auto care centers are going to outperform. Major Accounts, that's a competitive business for sure. And our competitors are all chasing that business as well. Again, we were pleased to see a positive increase in the quarter because it's been a while since we've seen our Major Accounts post positive comps. So we're encouraged by that. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Fassler, Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : My first question relates to your guidance, your revenue guidance. Can you talk about how much of the change in the revenue guide, that hike in the revenue guide, relates to your second quarter performance? And then on the forward, how much of it would relate to your organic outlook versus acquisitions versus what, I think, is probably a slightly less helpful FX outlook for you guys. Carol Yancey : Yes, I mean, I'm going to start with the FX. And I think you're spot on. I mean, we had about 0.5 point improvement in the first half, and it is not going to be as helpful in the second half. So we've modeled a slight headwind in the second half that would have us at maybe flattish, maybe up slightly for the full year. The second thing I'd remind you is AAG came on November 1 of last year. So you have that few months of revenue for AAG. I can tell you our guidance for second half versus first half is really largely based on where we are today. I mean, the run rate that we have to date and then mentioning the AAG 2 months and FX, we have not modeled in any acquisitions that haven't closed yet, and that would include the Hennig acquisition in Germany because that has not closed yet. Matthew Fassler : Got you. That's very helpful color. Secondly, you spoke about your confidence in the aging of the auto fleet and the sweet spot, stabilizing and helping the business going forward. You all have, presumably, pretty good visibility to the years, of cars that you're servicing. Are you -- other than the fact that they certainly should play out just based on everything we've seen historically. Are you seeing any evidence as cars make their way through your system that the dilution or the pain from these issue is abating and that the vintages are starting to help you out? Paul Donahue : Matt, we have been saying now for some time that our hope and our expectation was that we would begin to see a little bit of a lift in the second half of this year, but certainly more so in 2019. And look, it's hard to zero in exactly why all of a sudden here in the months of May, June and certainly, in the July, things have really picked up. Is it all weather related? Is it partly due to the -- us coming out of that low we saw from the '08, '09 SAAR. But the fact is business is picking up. And I think it's certainly a combination of factors, including really a good job by our team in the field. Matthew Fassler : That's super helpful. And then one final question because we do get a lot of questions on the tariff scene. Presumably, the 40% of the products you said that is coming from overseas for the U.S. auto business are final goods or finished goods that are sourced from overseas. Correct me if I'm wrong, but beyond that, are there components that would contribute to or that are found in and some of your purchases that would make the underlying number a little bit better. Just trying to understand not just direct pressure, first order pressure, but whether there's additional potential inflationary pressure for the industry from those inputs? Paul Donahue : No, it would largely be the finished goods that we're bringing in. Matt, we saw back when the steel and aluminum tariffs went in back in June. So it's still very, very early. We've seen some folks and they push through a few small price increases due to what's happening, and that's across a couple of our businesses, but it's very minimal and it's -- look, it just started to really take hold in June. So I think that's a bit early to tell. But the majority of what we're referring to on that 40% is all finished goods. Operator : Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli, RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : I'm sure it feels like that the horse is good at this point but I did have one more on the auto side. I'm trying to quantify train wreck, if we can. Paul, was the business in the U.S. down like kind of 2% to 3% in April? Or was it even worse than that? Paul Donahue : No, you're in the range. And it was probably a poor choice of words. But no, it's -- you're right in that range, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And is there any kind of difference in terms of DIY or commercial performance when you have those kind of wet and cold conditions in the spring? Or is that kind of uniform across the business? Paul Donahue : Well, as we reported now for a number of quarters, our retail business continues to outperform. And our retail business, once again, was up mid-single-digit in the quarter. And that's a number of quarters in a row. What we are encouraged about is the slight lift that we saw on the wholesale side, which it's been a challenge. We've been battling that flat to even slight declines on the wholesale business. So it's really encouraging to see a lift in our wholesale business as well. Scot Ciccarelli : Got you, okay. And then the last question here. Should we expect tables in inventory to largely stay at these levels? Or is there something particularly happen or influence that ratio at this quarter? Carol Yancey : So we would expect to be around this level, the 100% to 110%. We did have a reclass in the quarter in inventory, and it was about $200 million related to sales return and that moved from inventory to current assets. So that probably spiked in the quarter, but that's going to stay there for the rest of the year. So -- but again, I think we made good progress on working capital, and you can expect us to stay around that level. Scot Ciccarelli : Can I ask a clarification on that. So there was, what, $200 million of incremental inventory return in the quarter? Or is that like an accounting function of some sort? Carol Yancey : No, it's an accounting -- it was related to the new revenue recognition guidance that was effective for this year. So it was reclassing an inventory amount to other current assets. Operator : Our final question comes from Carolina Jolly, Gabelli & Company. Anna Jolly : Most of my questions have been answered. But just, I guess, 2 clarifying ones, the do-it-yourself growth that you've been experiencing, would you attribute any of that to general industry growth? Or is that all of your investments in that investment? Paul Donahue : Well, it's hard to say. We'll wait and see how our competitors report, Carolina. But as I have said in quarters past, our retail team is doing a terrific job. And our bar was set a bit low. And our team has done a terrific job of really upgrading our stores, which we've hit now. Most of our company stores have been revamped, expanded store hours. We have revamped our product assortment. All of that, I believe, is having a very, very positive contribution to our retail numbers. Anna Jolly : Great. And then just another clarifying one. I know this has been asked a lot, but for the Automotive margin breakdown, would you say that the 40% that is international, did they actually see margin expansion? Or is this really all the U.S. that we saw some of that deleveraging and additional cost that you went over? Carol Yancey : So basically, our international automotive margins had expansion, and that's a function of their core sales being mid-single digits. So we actually did have expansion year-to-date in the quarter for our international business. And remember, AAG is in there as well and that carries a higher margin. So I want to be clear, it was only the U.S. Automotive. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We want to thank you for your participation in today's conference call. We look forward to reporting to you in our third quarter call in October, and thank you for your support and your interest of Genuine Parts Company. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin. Sid Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company third quarter 2018 conference call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for the full year. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today's call also may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. Now let me turn the call over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our third quarter 2018 results. I will make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for the full year. After that, we'll open the call to your questions. So we entered the third quarter with positive momentum, having just reported record sales and earnings in the second quarter. Our teams carried this momentum over into the third quarter, producing a strong sales performance, while also improving our total operating margin, earnings and working capital position. This was encouraging as the quarter also presented our teams with a few challenges. The unfortunate passing of Tim Breen, one of our key business leaders, the termination of our proposed merger agreement with Essendant, and the effect of Hurricane Florence all impacted our businesses and our associates in the quarter. Despite these challenges, our team stayed focused and delivered total GPC sales of $4.7 billion, up 15.3% driven by the favorable impact of strategic acquisitions and a 4.3% comp sales increase. This 4.3% comp sales increase has improved from the 3.4% increase we delivered in the second quarter and 2% in the first quarter. It\u2019s also worth noting, our performance this quarter was our strongest comp growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income was $220 million and earnings per share was at $1.49, excluding the net impact of transaction and other cost related to the acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group and the recently terminated agreement to spin off the Business Products Group, net of the $12 million termination fee, adjusted net income was $218 million, up 28% and adjusted earnings per share was $1.48, up 29%. We will kick off our business segment overview with our Global Automotive Group. Total Automotive sales were up 23.3% in the third quarter, including a 3% comp sales increase. This has improved from the 2% increase in the second quarter and a 1.5% increase in the first quarter. So we are pleased to see the steadily improving comps, which are driven primarily by our U.S. Automotive results. Our total sales also benefited from acquisitions, net of an unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately 2%. We'll first review our performance for our largest business segment, our U.S. Automotive division. Sales for our U.S. Automotive operations were up 4.9% in the third quarter, with comp sales up 3.2%. This has much improved from the 1.5% comp increase we delivered in the second quarter and the slight increase we reported in Q1. This is also our best U.S. sales comp since the first quarter of 2016. This year's steady improvement in our core sales reflects the ongoing execution of our sales plan as well as the continued strengthening of the underlying sales conditions for the automotive aftermarket in the U.S. The warmer-than-average temperatures for much of the quarter came on the heels of a hot summer and a colder winter, which likely increased parts failure and maintenance and grow the improved demand. Our growth in Q3 was fueled by increased sales to both our retail and commercial customers, and for the first time in two years, sales to the commercial segment outpaced our retail sales. This was driven by the continued strengthening of our NAPA AutoCare sales, which were up 3.4% for the quarter. This is a significant commercial program for NAPA, and we are encouraged by the positive sales trends with these accounts. Looking forward, we believe the improving conditions will drive further commercial growth for both our AutoCare and Major Account customers. And while our Major Account sales lagged the strength of our overall growth in the third quarter, we are optimistic for stronger sales in the quarters ahead. Turning now to our retail business, our growth in this segment reflects the positive impact of initiatives such as NAPA Rewards Program, now 8.5 million member strong, expanded store hours and our retail impact store project. We have completed the rollout of the retail impact initiative to our company-owned stores and have now shifted our focus to our independently-owned stores. We expect these strategic initiatives to drive further sales growth for our retail segment, which represents 20% to 25% of our total U.S. automotive sales. So in summary, we are encouraged by the ongoing improvement in the sales environment for our U.S. Automotive operation and its positive impact on our operating results. As mentioned in last quarter's call, we believe this trend will continue in the quarters ahead for several reasons. We are seeing the positive shift in demand for failure and maintenance parts due to return of normalized weather pattern. We expect the number of vehicles in the aftermarket sweet spot to further stabilize and, ultimately, become a tailwind in 2019 and 2020. The long-term fundamental drivers for the automotive aftermarket remained strong, with a growing and aging fleet and increasing miles driven among consumers. We also expect our ongoing acquisitions and overall footprint expansion to further contribute to sales. Previously we discussed the addition of Smith Auto and Sanel Auto Parts to the NAPA network, and these businesses are performing well for us. Most recently, we announced the acquisition of Hastings Auto Parts, a four store group in the Detroit area, which joined NAPA on October 1. Hastings significantly enhanced our presence in the Detroit Metro area and will contribute approximately $10 million in annual sales. We welcome the Hastings leadership group to our NAPA team. Our accretive tuck-in acquisitions remain an important part of our growth strategy, and we see additional opportunities to expand our U.S. store footprint. Now let's turn to our international automotive businesses in Canada, Mexico, Europe and Australasia. These operations account for 40% of our total automotive revenues and delivered a collective 5% total sales increase, including a 2.7% comp sales increase. We'll lead off with our key North American automotive operation. Total sales were up mid-single digits at NAPA Canada and up low single digits in Mexico. In Canada, we continue to drive our core sales growth with the solid execution of our sales initiatives, while also adding strategic tuck-in acquisitions to further expand our Canadian presence. We continue to look for further growth in Canada and Mexico as we move forward. Turning to Alliance Automotive Group, this business continues to operate well across its European footprint in France, the UK, Germany and Poland. Comp sales grew low to mid-single digits and were positive across all four regions, with the strongest results in Germany and the UK. Additionally, the European team continues to drive strong sales growth from its ongoing acquisitions. AAG's robust acquisition strategy resulted in several additional bolt-on acquisitions in Q3, including TMS Motor Spares, which closed on August 31. TMS, headquartered in Carlisle, England, is a leading automotive parts distributor and adds 24 locations to the AAG network. TMS further expands our U.K. footprint with seven locations in England and provides for our first company-owned stores in Scotland, with 17 locations there. We expect this strategic acquisition to generate approximately $30 million in annual sales, and we are pleased to extend a warm welcome to the TMS team. We also announced AAG's October 2 acquisition of Platinum International Group headquartered in Manchester, England. Platinum is the leading value-added battery distributor, serving primarily the automotive industry from nine U.K. locations and one in the Netherlands. Platinum strengthens AAG's position in the U.K. battery market and is expected to generate estimated annual revenues of $75 million. We want to welcome both the TMS to welcome both the TMS and Platinum teams to the AAG family.  Wrapping up our AAG overview, we continue to work towards the closing of the previously announced acquisition of the Hennig Group in Germany. They are leading supplier of light-duty and commercial vehicle parts, with 30 branches across Germany and estimated annual revenues of $190 million. Subject to final regulatory approvals, we currently expect to close on the Hennig acquisition later in the fourth quarter. The addition of these businesses, a full pipeline of other potential acquisitions and our continued focus on underlying core growth is supported by relatively solid economic and industry fundamental across the European markets we serve. We are also pleased with the continued progress on our integration plans, and as we approach the one-year anniversary of this acquisition, we remain encouraged by the opportunities we see for our European operations and are confident the AAG team will continue to deliver for GPC. Our growing operations in Australia and New Zealand posted another solid quarter. Total sales in local currency were up mid-single digits while comp sales were up low to mid-single digits in the third quarter. The Asia-Pac team continues to drive its sales growth with a combination of initiatives to grow core sales and accretive acquisitions, while also executing on plans and initiatives to enhance our customer service capabilities and overall operating performance. We expect Asia-Pac's growth plans combined with the continued backdrop of solid economic and aftermarket fundamental to generate strong results in the quarters ahead. In summary, our U.S. business continues to strengthen, with September being our strongest average daily sales month of the year. The strong finish to the quarter enabled our U.S. team to post another quarter of improved comp sales growth. Our European operations performed well with solid core growth and the added benefit of ongoing acquisitions. Our remaining international automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada, and Mexico are all performing to plan. We continue to build size and scale as we expand our automotive operations around the globe. So now let's turn to our Industrial Parts Group. The sales environment for this business remains strong across our operations in U.S., Canada and Mexico. Total sales of $1.6 billion were up 8.3% in the third quarter including a 7% comp sales growth plus a benefit of acquisitions. This 7% sales comps further builds on the 4% to 6% comps achieved over the previous five quarters and reflects Industrial's strongest sales comp since the fourth quarter of 2014. This ongoing pattern of solid sales growth is consistent with the positive impact of our growth initiatives for this business and the favorable economic and industry-specific factors benefiting the industrial marketplace. These include the continued strength in major industrial indicators such as the Purchasing Managers Index, industrial production, active rig counts and U.S. exports. Further supporting the broad strength across the industrial marketplace, all 14 of our major product groups, including the electrical specialty group posted sales gains in the quarter and each of the top industries we serve were up as well. Iron and steel, chemicals and allied products and oil and gas extraction industries were especially strong, with each showing low double-digit increases. On October 1, we announced the acquisition of Hydraulic Supply Company in Sunrise, Florida. HSC is the leading full-service fluid-powered distributor, with a broad product offering of hydraulic, pneumatic and industrial components and systems. HSC operates from 30 locations, primarily in the Southeastern U.S. and further enhances Motion's footprint for additional fluid power product. HSC is expected to generate estimated annual revenue of $85 million. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to John Serra and the HSC team to our Industrial operations. We are encouraged by the strong results in the Industrial business thus far in the year. Looking forward, we expect our plans and initiatives to drive both core and acquisitive growth combined with the extended industrial growth cycle, which still has strength to support strong results for this segment in the quarters ahead. We also remain pleased with our investment in Inenco, the Australian-based industrial distribution company we partnered with in 2017. This team just wrapped up a strong fiscal first quarter. While we currently have a 35% investment in Inenco, we will look to increase our investment in 2019. Their strategic supplier base lines up well with Motion's and they give us a strong hold not only in Australasia, but also in strategic markets like Indonesia and Singapore.  As we reflect on our Industrial performance and future growth prospects, we are especially proud of the resilience this team has demonstrated following the loss of Tim Breen, the President and CEO of Motion Industries. On August 20, we announced Tim's sudden passing, and we are all deeply saddened by the loss of such a good friend and colleague. He will be truly missed. Randy Breaux and Kevin Storer, both very talented and seasoned executives, have stepped up to lead the Motion team, and we are certain that the Industrial Group is in very capable hands as we move forward. And we know Tim would be very proud of his Motion team.  So now let's turn to S.P. Richards, our Business Products Group. This segment reported total sales of $496 million, up 1.3% for the third quarter. The increase was driven by the growth in comp sales and marks the first positive sales comp since the third quarter of 2015. And more encouraging, this improvement reflects the increase in sales for three of our product categories : core office supplies, technology and FPS, our facilities break room and safety supply category. As mentioned earlier, our definitive agreement with Essendant announced in April April, whereby GPC would spin off the SPR business and merge it with Essendant, was terminated in September. Despite our best efforts to proceed with this agreement, Essendant's Board of Directors determined that the competing acquisition proposal from Staples was a superior proposal as defined in the merger agreement. While we disagree with this determination, the SPR and Essendant merger agreement was terminated and GPC was paid a $12 million termination fee.  Considering these circumstances, GPC will continue to operate the S.P. Richards business. We believe with \u2013 that with further industry consolidation, there is significant opportunity for this business to grow and deepen its relationships with both independent dealers and other customer channel, and we'll continue to invest in these growth opportunities when and where appropriate.  Finally, we extend our thanks to all of our associates at S.P. Richards. Our team, led by Rick Toppin, has done a terrific job of staying focused on what truly is important, and that is providing exceptional service to all of our customers. So that is a summary of our consolidated and business segment sales results for the third quarter of 2018. We were pleased to show progress in our operations and report improved results and will continue to build on these positive trends as we move through the fourth quarter of the year and on into 2019. So with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will provide our updated outlook for 2018. Our total sales in the third quarter were up 15.3% or up 4% on a comp basis, which excludes acquisitions and a 1% unfavorable foreign currency translation. Our gross margin for the third quarter was 31.43%, which compares to 29.95% last year. Consistent with the first half of 2018, this strong increase primarily reflects the higher gross margin associated with AAG and other acquisitions. In addition, we continue to see improved margins in our core U.S. Automotive and Industrial businesses. The Industrial business has also benefited from a slight increase in supplier incentives. We remain focused on enhancing our gross margins through several key initiatives, including ongoing supplier negotiations, both globally and across our businesses; the investment in more flexible and sophisticated pricing and digital strategies; improved analytic capabilities around product and customer profitability. We expect these initiatives to support our current gross margin rates in the quarters ahead despite the growing competitiveness across the markets we serve. The pricing environment has been more inflationary in our Industrial and Business Products businesses thus far in 2018. We also saw the initial signs of inflation in our Automotive segment in the third quarter, and we would expect to see this trend continue over the balance of the year and into 2019 due to the current tariff regulation. While the impact of tariffs has been fairly minimal through the nine months, the most recent list of goods subject to the 10% tariff is extensive and something that our teams are managing with our suppliers as we move forward. We continue to expect to pass along any increases to our customers as we have thus far. Our cumulative supplier price increases through the nine months of 2018 were up 4.1% in Automotive, up 3.2% in Industrial and up 1.5% in Office. Our SG&A and other expenses for the third quarter were $1.19 billion, which represents 25.25% of sales. This has improved from the first and second quarters due primarily to our stronger core sales growth. In addition, while we continue to experience ongoing pressure from rising costs in areas such as payroll, freight and delivery, our teams are addressing these factors and making progress on our cost-saving plans and initiatives. Finally, we would add that our third quarter SG&A included a $3.1 million benefit associated with transaction and other costs related to AAG and the attempted transaction to spin off S.P. Richards, which is net of the favorable impact of a $12 million termination fee. Now we will discuss the results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.6 billion, which is up 23% from the prior year. And our operating profit is $227 million was up 27%, with operating margin of 8.6% compared to 8.3% margin in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in operating margin relates to the improved leverage on our 3% comparable sales growth in the U.S. and reflects our first quarterly margin expansion since the first quarter of 2016. We are optimistic for further expansion in the quarters ahead. Our Industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, a strong 8% increase from Q3 of 2017. Our operating profit of $119 million is up 10% and our operating margin is 7.6% compared to 7.4% last year, with the 20 basis point increase due to another quarter of solid gross margin expansion and leverage on expenses from the 7% comp sales increase. The Industrial business has been consistently strong since the start of 2017, and based on our outlook for continued strength, we expect to see further margin expansion at Industrial as we move forward. Our Business Products revenue for $496 million, up 1% from the prior year. Their operating profit of $20 million was down 17% and their operating margin is 4%. So despite positive total sales growth and the first positive comp for this group since the third quarter of 2015, this business continues to be pressured by the lack of expense leverage, challenging industry conditions and an unfavorable product and customer mix shifts. With that said, we have plans and initiatives in place to further improve revenues for the Business Products Group to better leverage our expenses and stabilize the margin. Our total operating profit in the third quarter was up 18% on the 15% sales increase, and our operating profit margin was 7.7% compared to 7.6% last year. This is our best performance of the year, and while pleased to report the margin improvement, we will continue to execute on our initiatives to deliver further expansion. We had net interest expense of $22 million in the quarter. And for 2018, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98. This is down from our previous guidance of $98 million to $100 million and is primarily due to lower interest from the decrease in debt as well as some beneficial cross currency strategies. Our total amortization expense was $24 million for the third quarter, which is an increase from $12 million last year, primarily due to the amortization related to AAG. For 2018, we expect full year amortization to be in the range of $88 million to $90 million. Our depreciation expense was $37 million for the quarter, and for the full year, we continue to expect total depreciation to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. On a combined basis, we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $230 million to $240 million. The other line, which represents our corporate expense, was $29 million for the third quarter, which includes an approximate $3 million benefit associated with transaction and other costs, net of the favorable termination fee that we recorded in the quarter. Excluding this benefit and the transaction and other costs that were incurred in the third quarter of 2017, our adjusted corporate expense was $32 million or a $6 million increase from last year, which is primarily due to payroll pressures, including incentive and variable pay, increased costs for minority interest and ongoing investments in IT and security initiatives. For the full year, we currently expect our corporate expense to be in the range of $120 million to $125 million range, excluding transaction-related costs. This compares to our previous guidance of $115 million to $125 million. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 24.5%, down significantly from the 35.7% tax rate in the prior year due mainly to the benefit of the U.S. tax reform. Looking forward, we continue to expect a 25% tax rate for 2018, and we anticipate a higher fourth quarter tax rate as we finalize our provisional tax reform adjustment. So now let\u2019s turn to a discussion of the balance sheet, which remains strong and in excellent condition. Our accounts receivable of $2.7 billion is up 23% from the prior year and up 7% excluding the impact of acquisitions, primarily AAG and foreign currency. This increase is greater than our 4% comp sales increase for the third quarter, but it primarily relates to one less collection day in September. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at September 30 was $3.5 billion, which is up 5% from September of last year and down 1% excluding AAG, our other acquisitions as well as foreign currency. Our teams continue to improve the inventory levels in our core businesses and will continue to manage this key investment to the appropriate levels as we move forward. Our accounts payable of $4 billion at September 30 is up 23% in total and up 9% over the prior year excluding AAG, other acquisitions and foreign currency. The net increase in payables reflects the benefit of improved payment terms with certain suppliers, and at September 30, our AP-to-inventory ratio improved to 114% from 110% at June 30. We are especially pleased with our progress in managing our trade payables and its positive impact on our cash flows. Our total debt of $2.9 billion of September 30 is up from $1.1 billion last September, but is down from $3.2 billion at June 30. The increase from September last year reflects our borrowings for the AAG acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our debt arrangement vary in maturity, and currently the average interest rate on our total debt stands at 3%. We\u2019re comfortable with our current debt structure and have a strong balance sheet and financial capacity to support our growth initiatives, including strategic acquisitions and large investments such as AAG and the Inenco Group in Australia, which we believe serves to create significant value for our shareholders. So in summary, our balance sheet is a key strength of the company. Turning to our cash flows, we have generated $926 million in cash from operations for the nine months in 2018, which has much improved from the last year due to the increase in net income and the improved working capital position. Our cash flows continue to support our ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. For 2018, we are increasing our projected cash from operations to the $1 billion to $1.1 billion range, up from our previous guidance of $950 million to $1 billion. Likewise, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. Our priorities for cash remain the dividend, reinvestment in our businesses, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. Regarding the dividend, 2018 represents our 62nd consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. Our 2018 annual dividend of $2.88 represents a 7% increase from 2017. We\u2019ve invested $92 million in capital expenditures thus far in 2018, and for the year, we\u2019re planning for capital expenditures in the range of $175 million to $200 million, which accounts for the impact of AAG and certain technology, facility and productivity investments that we have planned for in association with our tax savings. Regarding our share repurchase program, we have 17.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase, and we expect to be active in the program over the long term. We continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment, and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. So now let\u2019s turn to our guidance for 2018. Based on our performance thus far in 2018, our growth plans and initiatives, including our announced acquisitions and the market conditions that we see for the foreseeable future, we expect total sales for 2018 to be in the range to \u2013 of plus 14% to plus 15%, and this guidance excludes the benefit of any future acquisitions and represents an increase from the previous guidance of plus 13% to plus 14%. By business, we\u2019re currently expecting plus 22% to plus 23% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, which is an increase from the previous guidance of plus 21% to plus 22%. Plus 7% to plus 8% total sales growth for the Industrial segment, which is an increase from the plus 6% to plus 7% previously. And a sales decrease of minus 1% to minus 2% for Business Products, which has improved from the prior guidance of down 3% to down 4%. On the earnings side, we currently expect adjusted earnings per share excluding any transaction- related costs and fees incurred during the year to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.70. This represents a small change from our previous EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.75 and better reflects our performance through the nine months, as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s our financial report for the third quarter, and we\u2019re pleased to build on the positive momentum from the first half of 2018 and show progress in several areas, including SG&A, our total operating margin and working capital. As we noted before, further progress in these areas remains a top priority for us as we move forward And at this point, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. In our closing comments last quarter, we alluded to a few areas requiring improvement and we outlined our plans to drive these improvements. We called out the need to show progress in our core operating results, specifically our U.S. Automotive margins. We discussed the need to drive core sales growth to better leverage our fixed expenses. We also discussed rising cost and the need to aggressively attack operating cost, while continuing to provide exceptional customer service. We are pleased we can report progress in just about every facet of our U.S. Automotive operations along with our other business units. As we look to the highlights from the third quarter, there are many. Sales remained strong at $4.7 billion and up 15%. Comp sales were up 4.3%, our strongest comp increase in almost four years, driven by improvement across all of our business segments. Automotive comp sales plus 3%, including a 3.2% increase for our U.S. operations, the strongest comp since Q1 of 2016. Industrial comp sales at plus 7%, the strongest comp since Q4 of 2014. And finally, Business Products Group comp sales 1.3%, their strongest comp growth since Q3 of 2015. We saw a continued gross margin expansion and improving SG&A expense trend. Our operating margin expansion driven by 30 basis point improvement in Automotive and 20 basis point improvement in Industrial. Adjusted EPS of $1.48 was up 29%, and we strengthened our balance sheet, improved our operating cash flows, with the excellent working capital management. We announced strategic acquisitions with Automotive adding TMS and Platinum in Europe and Hastings in the U.S. and Industrial adding HSC. And finally, we increased our full year sales guidance to plus 14% to plus 15%, and we fine-tuned our full year adjusted EPS guidance to plus 19% to plus 21% over last year. So, it was a productive quarter for GPC, and we entered the final quarter of 2018 with plans and initiatives to further improve on our operating results. We remain committed to an organic and acquisitive sales strategy to drive long-term sustained revenue growth while also focusing on the continued improvement in our gross margins and cost management. We are excited for the future, and as always, we look forward to updating you on our progress when we report again next quarter. With that, we'll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Chris. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Christopher Horvers : Nice acceleration in NAPA U.S. and upside in industrial. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Christopher Horvers : Wanted to ask a little bit about the do-it-for-me side of NAPA in the U.S. Looking at the past two quarters, we had you about down 1% in the U.S. do-it-for-me in 1Q and then up a similar modest amount in 2Q. It seems like the do-it-for-me side accelerated to, call it, a 4% to 5% trend. Is that about right? And broadly, can you talk about the category performance that you saw that drove this acceleration? Paul Donahue : Sure, Chris. Happy to do so. When you say category, you're talking product categories, Chris? Christopher Horvers : Yes, please. Paul Donahue : Yes. So, strong-strong quarter in our battery business, strong quarter in our filter business. Those two categories are two of our single largest categories. We had another good quarter in our tool and equipment business. So those would be three that certainly would warrant being called out. But we also called out AutoCare, our NAPA AutoCare business, which is a $1 billion-plus business for us. We had our really -- our second really good quarter in a row. Many of the initiatives our team has put into place are beginning to take hold, which is great to see. And on the Major Accounts side, our nationally-branded chain, all showed solid growth in the quarter as well. So a combination of things. And Chris, we always talk about the weather. That certainly did not hurt us at all in the quarter as well. Christopher Horvers : So I had a question about that, I mean, I could understand having strong AC business given the hot summer in July, in August in the battery, but you commented that September was your best month, I think, in the U.S. on a days -- day basis given the extra Sunday that you had. So what would you attribute the strength in September to? Is it just that sort of lag effect? Is it more pricing coming through on the inflation front? Any comment there? Paul Donahue : Well, September was still -- again, if you go back to the weather, Chris, September was still really warm month in many of our markets. But I think it's also, as we have said many, many times on these calls, that the weather tends to build on itself. So you had a really cold winter followed by a hot summer. That hot summer -- the batteries and the like aren't going to fail immediately when you hit the months of June and July. It does tend to build on itself. And I think, what we saw with our strong average daily sales in September was just really the culmination of all that wear and tear, and certainly, we saw it in the failure-type products as well as the maintenance products. Christopher Horvers : And then the last question is on the inflation front, I mean, some of the CPI data seems to be accelerating here in the third quarter. You talked about auto inflation, I think, 40 bps cumulatively through the first nine months and I think the first half was sort of flat. So does that imply that maybe a 100 bps of the comp acceleration is pricing coming through on the inflation front? Carol Yancey : Yes, I think on the inflation front, we did see a bit of inflation in Q3 and you mentioned the 40 bps that really is what we saw in the latter part of the nine months. We'd be lucky to get to a full point by the end of the year, maybe more like a 0.5 to maybe 0.75 at the end of the year, excluding any kind of tariff impact. So again, positive for us to see but truly not a significant impact on our true same-store sales. I mean, we had, just as Paul mentioned, strong commercial growth with a couple of our major wholesale-type programs and improvement across the board in a lot of product categories. Christopher Horvers : Understood. Thanks very much. That\u2019s great. Carol Yancey : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Livers : Hi. This is actually Jonathan Livers on for Scot this morning. Thank you for taking my question and really nice quarter guys. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Jonathan Livers : Yes. Could you give us a sense of what geographies performed well, especially in the U.S. auto side of the business? Paul Donahue : Yes. Happy to Jonathan. We saw real strength in some of our biggest markets. We were certainly led in the quarter by our Midwest business, our Midwest team had a terrific quarter with strong single-digit comps. Our Northeast part of the country also had a very strong quarter, and that team has been performing well all year. Some of our warmer markets to the Southeast and Southwest performed well. Again, the Southeast has been stepping up most of the year for us. So those would be four that I would definitely call out. Jonathan Livers : Yes. Thank you for that. And just a quick follow-up if I could, what kind of \u2013 could you perhaps quantify or discuss? You mentioned it briefly at the beginning that the impact of Hurricane Florence in the quarter that had on the business? I know you just mentioned the Southeast was strong, but any impact it had there? Paul Donahue : Yes. Well, first Jonathan, I appreciate you asking that question. The -- we had two events, one really hit in October and that would be Michael, but Florence definitely had an impact across our business and more in our Atlantic division, which is up in the Carolinas. We had close to, I think, 100 stores closed at one time in NAPA, but we also had many of our Motion branches that were closed. We'll pick up some of those sales with storm-related-type products, generators, cleanup supplies and the like. And -- but I would tell you, a good bit of our focus was really assisting both our associates as well as our independent owners, just helping get back on their feet and recover from some of the damages in the stores. Michael, which, as we know, was I think the worst hurricane to hit the U.S. in 50-plus years. We still have parts at the Panhandle that do not have electricity. We had stores as well as Motion branches in the Panhandle. Panama City had significant damage, significant water damage. But other stores in the Panhandle as well as South Georgia as well were impacted. Jonathan Livers : Got it. Thank you very much for the color. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Matt Fassler : Thanks so much. Appreciate it. I want to start with a couple of quick ones on Automotive. First of all, you spoke about the pace of the trend through Q3 and through September in particular. Can you talk about the organic automotive comp implied in your guidance for the fourth quarter? Carol Yancey : Sure. We are implying for an Automotive comp guidance would be similar to where we are through the full year. So if you look at Automotive, and our total Automotive comps excluding AAG through the nine months around 2%, so we would assume in Q4 that we would have 2% to 3% comps, but maybe more towards the 3% range. So that's implied in our guidance. Matthew Matt Fassler : Got you. And I know that we're only on October 18, for there's only 18 days. Anything that you've seen quarter-to-date to shake you off that? Carol Yancey : Well, that's consistent with what our implied Q4 guidance is. So again, we're going to be comfortable with that range. Matt Fassler : Got you. Understood. And then, second question, in Industrial, you spoke about some of the factors, some of the cross wins, I guess, impacting the ability to leverage in that business, and your sales have clearly recovered and you're closing the gap with your peers on the comp store sales line as well. Can you talk about what you need to see or what you can do to extract more leverage from that sales strength? Is it a function of industry conditions? Is it a function of getting the comp above that 7% level? If you could talk, maybe if there are cost initiatives that are underway. And I know you referred to some of them that you think you can get more traction as we move through the year and then into 2019. Carol Yancey : Yes. So great question. And look, we are pleased with where Industrial is from a sales basis, and actually, as we called out all year, they've had really nice improvement on the gross margin line. So for the quarter and year-to-date, nice, close to 40 bps improvement on the gross margin line. Where the headwinds are is in SG&A, and as we pointed out all year, I mean, they saw, as with many businesses, significant increase in freight and freight-related cost. So to the tune of 20 to 25 basis points is what we are seeing. We saw it in Q2 and seeing in Q3. Also, have some payroll pressures, which, again, we talked about before. So it's causing them -- despite having a strong 7% growth, causing them not to quite have as much leverage on the SG&A side. Having said that, our industrial teams are working really hard to make sure that they can pass along these increases and look forward to passing those along. You don't always are able to pass it along as quickly as you'd like because so much of their business is under contract. But they're working hard to kind of drive the freight recovery through higher cost of invoicing, and they're also looking to leverage better on their staffing levels and just overall SG&A. So again, we see improvement there but really the things that are holding us back are on the SG&A line. Paul Donahue : And Matt, I would just add to that, the team at Motion is always looking at opportunities to consolidate facilities and branches where possible and where necessary. We are also looking at further investing in productivity-enhancing technology in our operations as well. And then last is, as we do in our Automotive business, we're just looking constantly at tools that will help us optimize our pricing approach and pricing strategies. Matt Fassler : Understood guys. Thank you so much for that. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re Welcome. Thanks Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Elizabeth Suzuki : Just one question on, as we look out to next year and you guys start to do your planning, and do you think there's any reason to believe that if we have a normal winter that demand would for some reason be slowing in 2019 in the auto business particularly versus 2018? I mean, anything in like the macro or demographics that you're seeing, fleet of vehicles that you think is \u2013 would be cause for a concern on the demand side. Paul Donahue : Elizabeth, thanks for your question, and no, there is nothing on the horizon that would suggest that we should see a slowdown in our parts business here in the U.S. If anything, we think some of the tailwinds that we'll get from the car park \u2013 the aging of the car park as we further distance ourselves from 2008 and 2009 will actually be a benefit. So you started out with assuming we have normal weather, that's always an impact. We'll just \u2013 we'll continue to hope for the best. But no, they are \u2013 we are bullish on our parts business here in the U.S. and expect to see it to continue to perform well. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. Thanks. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Please proceed with your question. Seth Basham : My first question is on the gross margins. Another good performance, of course, driven by AAG. I was hoping you could quantify the contribution of the gross margin increase from AAG as well as the gross margin improvement in the U.S. auto businesses? Carol Yancey : Yes. So what I would speak to on gross margin, if you strip out the impact of AAG, our gross margin in the quarter was up probably 20 to 25 basis points. And I would say that, that came from a combination of the Industrial improvement that I talked about earlier and also the U.S. Automotive improvement as well. Now these are being offset by a decline on the Business Products side, which is primarily related to the mix issues that we've faced basically all year. So our core gross profit, again, has been up pretty consistently for a couple of quarters, and we would expect to be able to continue to see improvement there. Seth Basham : Got it. So with Industrial up 40 bps or so, that would suggest the U.S. Automotive business is probably up somewhere in the 20 bps range year-over-year for the quarter? Carol Yancey : Yes, that's a fair estimate. Seth Basham : All right, great. Thank you. And then secondly, as we think about the impact of tariffs, you guys mentioned that you expect to be able to pass along any tariffs that you \u2013 the price increases related to tariffs going forward. Could you give us some perspective on if you've already started raising prices as a result of tariffs and if you've been able to recoup all those costs? Carol Yancey : Yes. So I think the first comment I mentioned is on the Industrial side. You saw pretty heavy inflation that they've seen year-to-date, 3.2%. That \u2013 some of that is indirectly tariff-related because there are a number of \u2013 there are manufacturing partners that have materials and components from China that could be part of their final products. So there is some implied tariff that's in the Industrial business, and we talked about passing that through and there is a little bit of a lag there. But as it relates to the Automotive side and Business Products, I mean, through the nine months, we would say that there was minimal impact of tariffs. As you know, the more significant tariff, the List 3 came into effect the last quarter \u2013 for the last week in September. So as we look ahead on that, we would expect to be working, and we have been working very closely with our suppliers, and our intention would be to pass those along to the customer. Paul Donahue : Seth, I would just add a couple of comments to what Carol said. One of the things that doesn't get talked about much as we discussed tariffs, there's a positive outcome to the situation with tariffs as well and that's for Motion. If you recall, one of our top- performing business segments this past quarter is an iron and steel. We've got mills coming back up online in the U.S., and those are a few of our biggest customers promotion. So that business is benefiting from the tariffs, continues to do very, very well. But at the end of the day, Seth, our expectation is that we will pass along the price increases as we have in the past. But I would also tell you that we'll monitor the situation very closely. We'll watch we are lining up competitively in the marketplace and we'll respond accordingly. Seth Basham : Got it. And just a follow-up on that Paul. I think you guys have mentioned some 40% of your U.S. auto COGS are from China. As a mitigation strategy, would you look to find other sources for some of those products coming from China? Paul Donahue : Yes, we would, Seth. And I would just say that the 40% is our total amount of our imports coming into the Automotive parts group. We would say, directly out of China is closer to sort of 20%. But as I said, we'll continue to monitor it, and if we have to look for alternative sources, we will do so. The advantage of having a extremely strong brand like NAPA is we can shift and we can shift very quickly to other countries and other sources if we find that we can't remain competitive in a particular market. Seth Basham : Got it. Thank you very much and good luck. Paul Donahue : Your welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Good morning guys. Question on AAG, and as you lever working capital, I guess, how have you done on an AP-to-inventory basis in Europe? And then, as you build in incremental businesses like the battery distribution, how do we think about maybe EBITDA margins looking out a year or two given the business mix? Carol Yancey : Yes, so I'll start off with a working capital for AAG and just comment that our improvement in working capital in Q3 was completely driven by our core existing business, primarily Automotive, with the impact of extended terms with some of our U.S. vendors and then also more normalized level of purchasing. So we have not seen the impact of the working capital improvement, specifically for AAG. But having said that, we've got a number of things in process that we know that we will be able to achieve those synergies and the working capital improvement within the next \u2013 at the end of three years is what we've got out there. So we are certainly encouraged by the opportunities we have coming on working capital from AAG and know that there are opportunities there. Paul Donahue : And then Bret, I would just \u2013 the second part of your question, with some of our acquisitions, our expectations is those will not be dilutive to our overall margins. And as you know, we've been quite active on the M&A front in Europe and we intend to continue to be. I think what has been encouraging for us in 2018 is our core growth, and we continue to see same-store sales in the core markets we currently compete in, in the 3% to 4% range. And that's been \u2013 that's honestly been very encouraging for us, and we expect that \u2013 and intend to keep that moving forward. We're excited with the acquisitions of both TMS and Platinum and then Hennig, which will be, we suspect, finalized in Q4. All three will be additive to AAG in 2019. Bret Jordan : Okay. Great. And then one final question on the U.S. auto. You mentioned national accounts were strong. Have you picked up new national accounts? Or is this strength with existing national accounts? I'm just \u2013 I guess, the real question is, is your 3.2% U.S. comp, do you think that that's a share gain number? Or do you think that was sort of in line with the underlying market growth? Paul Donahue : Well, I guess, Bret, we'll have to wait and see how the other public companies report. You never quite know for sure. Bret Jordan : I was hoping you were going to tell us. That was the point. Paul Donahue : When you're the first one out, you'll have to kind of wait and see. But look, we're pleased with the 3.2%, and as I said in my prepared remarks, Bret, our team has worked awfully, awfully hard, and it's great to see the turnaround and the continued sequential improvement in our same-store sales. I would just give you a little bit more color on our Major Account business. The growth that we're seeing, I called out our nationally-branded chain, they are doing well. Where we've seen a little bit of a softness is in some of our government business and a bit of our fleet business, and that's an opportunity for us to get that back on a growth curve in Q4 and on into 2019. Bret Jordan : Okay great thank you. Paul Donahue : Yes, you welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Hi thanks and great quarter guys. I wanted to follow up on a couple of things. Carol, I think you mentioned that pressure was more in SG&A and actually freight cost showing up in SG&A. Is that the reason that the guidance actually was unchanged or trend a little bit at the top end despite sales being stronger? Was there anything else that sort of factored into that, the guidance shift calculation? Carol Yancey : Yes. I'll just mention, and you're right, on the payroll and the freight, both of those in Q2 and also Q3 are growing at a pace much further than our sales. So if sales are growing without AAG 5%, freight and delivery is up something like 10%, 11% and payroll's up 6% or 7%. So you're certainly seeing that and we're expecting that to continue in Q4. The real modification, and again, we were pleased to be able to raise our sales guidance when we considered where we were thus far in nine months, consider the acquisitions. And then quite honestly, net of an FX headwinds, we are pleased to raise the sales guidance. We really just fine-tuned the earnings guidance based on where we are thus far. And look, FX had a negative impact of $0.02 in the quarter, and there may be a little bit more pressure in Q4. As I mentioned, we still have the pressures from payroll and freight. We called out a little bit of a corporate expense number, too. So just \u2013 really just narrowing, refining where we think we're going to be based on where we are through nine months. Greg Melich : Got it. And then Carol, another follow-up on the balance sheet, and then Paul, I had a strategy question. We're at a level now we have, I guess, 1.5 times debt to EBITDA, so plenty of ability to do other things. When the new lease accounting comes in, we get to back to around three times debt to EBITDA. Is that \u2013 do you think that's about a rough \u2013 add a little bit of over a turn when we think about the new standards? Or you haven't even looked at that yet? Carol Yancey : Actually, if we \u2013 we're still looking at that. When you look at our minimum lease payments, which is something like $1.1 billion and when you add some of the other items that will go in there, you're probably fairly close. But quite honestly, as I think all companies probably facing this, I think there will be a consistent change in how everybody looks at this and whether everybody pulls it out and would start it without leases or it just adjust. But again, we \u2013 the idea is we have a reasonable level that we are at right now. We certainly have capacity and flexibility, and with our working capital improvement, we're really pleased with that. So I don't think the lease number is going to change the basic strategy of our capital allocation or debt or acquisition strategy. Greg Melich : Got it. And Paul, there's been a lot of \u2013 on the \u2013 you mentioned the retail side of the auto business. For the first time in a while, it's great to see do-it-for-me growing faster. But we have seen a lot of competitive shifts and actions going on this summer, and just this week, Advance doing a store within a store with Walmart. I'd like to just hear your opinion, if something like that would be interesting to sort of \u2013 or is it something that could put too much conflict with the do-it-for-me side of the business? Or are there other considerations that you think about if thinking about doing something like that? Paul Donahue : Yes. Greg, as far as yesterday's announcement, it's a bit early for us to have any real specific reaction. We didn't really get any details as what their plan is or how the mechanics of this are going to work. What I would tell you from Genuine Parts Company and NAPA, what we are excited about and we'll continue to invest in is our own online initiatives and driving our omnichannel strategy. We launched an app online, which is our flagship here in the U.S. We're seeing over 0.5 million visits now per month. We have customers both click and collecting in our stores as well as having products shipped directly to home. We reached \u2013 recently launched in Australia. We've had over 3.5 million visits to our new site there, averaging 25,000 a day in terms of site visits. We launched in Canada as well. So we're focused on our omnichannel strategy. Greg, feel good about what we're doing, we feel good. And I'm glad you called out that our commercial businesses, which is our real focus. And when you think about the new sites and the announcements of yesterday, I think that's going to be more DIY-centric than it would ever be DIFM- type centric. Greg Melich : Got it, thanks a lot and good luck. Operator : Thank you. Due to time constraints, our final question will come from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks. I want to follow up on the 20% China. It was kind of lower than I was expecting. Is that just a direct source mix? Does that include Chinese sales from U.S. suppliers, the sourcing in China? Carol Yancey : Yes, Chris. And again, I just want to be clear that what we gave out, so for our U.S. Automotive business, which, again, is probably about \u2013 if you look at our total cost of goods sold for the company, U.S. would be, say, 75% to 80%. When you look specifically at Automotive, we said 40% is directly sourced outside the U.S. and 20% of that would be China impacted by tariff. And so, as we work and look down through Industrial, as I mentioned, very, very small amount. It's more indirect. Office products, we would have something like 10% of their cost of goods sold that's subject to the Chinese tariffs, even though they source a lot more outside the U.S. There's products that aren't subject to it. So at the end of the day, when you look for GPC in total, you're talking about less than 10% of our cost of goods sold. In total, something more like maybe 7% or 8% that is impacted. Paul Donahue : Chris, I would also \u2013 when you start to break it down on the Automotive side and you start to look at the various product categories that are impacted that we know of right now, you also need to look at what's not impacted. So our biggest categories, which I mentioned earlier, where we saw a significant growth in Q3, batteries, filters, oil and chemicals, none of those product categories are impacted by the tariffs. The tariffs, really, you're looking at undercar, some brake rotors friction, chassis-type product. So yes, it's impactful. We've got cross-functional teams working between our pricing groups, our sourcing groups, our product groups that are pouring through the data. And again, as I said in my earlier comments, our intention is that we will pass it through as we normally do, but we will also continue to monitor where we are from a competitive standpoint. Chris Bottiglieri : That's really helpful. And then, these numbers you've provided, are those just tariffs that have already been passed? Or does this include proposed tariffs that haven't officially been passed through yet? Carol Yancey : So what we are talking about is the List three, the 10% tariff, about $200 billion in goods that just went into effect at the very end of September. And so what we're talking about is what is specifically impacted by the ones that have just been passed. And again, remember, there is \u2013 there was no really \u2013 no impact, virtually no impact on our business through the nine months. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. That makes sense. And then just unrelated. So even an update on your U.S. fleet business. I would take like rig count and oil and kind of rebasing. Just want to get a sense for, how that business is performing? And to what extent that, that's contributing to your high levels of commercial comp growth? Paul Donahue : Yes. I mentioned earlier, Chris, when I break down our Major Accounts business, you really got to get into the detail and look at the various segments. Our Major Accounts business was basically flat, down slightly in Q3. But our nationally-branded chains, all performed well in the quarter. Where we saw some \u2013 where we saw a bit of softness was in our fleets and some of our government business. So our team's working really hard to understand where some of that softness is coming from in the fleet business, and we're going to work really hard to turn that around in Q4 and heading into 2019. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Carol Yancey : Well, we want to thank each of you for listening to and participating in our earnings call today. And we look forward to reporting back to you with our Q4 results in February. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Jones. You may begin. Sid Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company fourth quarter 2018 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2019. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today's call also may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now let me turn the call over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results. I will make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our businesses. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2019. After that, we'll open the call to your questions. We were pleased to build on our prior progress in 2018 and report another solid quarter of improved results. For the second consecutive quarter, each of our three business segments grew their revenues with positive core sales comparisons and combined with the added benefit of our accretive acquisitions. We further improved our operating results with a 30 basis point increase in total operating margin. These results let our team to produce record sales and earnings for 2018 as well as improve our working capital position and generate strong cash flows. To recap, total GPC sales in the fourth quarter were $4.6 billion of 9.4% from 2017 driven by a 0.6% comp sales increased and a 6% benefit from strategic acquisitions, net of a 1.2% negative impact from foreign currency translation. The 4.6% increase in comp sales reflects our strongest growth in 2018 up from the 4.3% increase in the third quarter plus 3.4% in the second quarter and the plus 2% in the first quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter was $187 million and earnings per share were $1.27. Excluding the impact of transaction and other costs as we covered in our press released adjusted net income was $198 million or $1.35 per share up 13% from the adjusted earnings per share in 2017. For the year total sales were record $18.7 billion a 14.9% increase compared to 2017. Net income was $810 million and EPS were $5.50. Before the impact of transaction and other costs, adjusted net income was $836 million and adjusted earnings per share, $5.68 a 21% increase on a comp basis to 2017. Turning to a review of our business segments, sales at our Global Automotive Group were up 11.4% in the fourth quarter, including a 3.8% comp sales increase and the benefit of acquisitions less than unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately 2%. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in our Global Automotive comp sales growth, which was up from a 3.3% increase in the third quarter, a 2.1% increase in the second quarter and a plus 1.5% increase in the first quarter of 2018. We would add that the operations in each of our regions, including North America, Europe, and Australasia contributed to the improved fourth quarter sales comp. In our U.S. Automotive division sales were up 4% in the fourth quarter with comp sales accounting for most of that at plus 3.3%. This was in line with our 3.2% comp sales increase in the third quarter and reflects a solid execution of our sales initiatives, sound fundamentals for the aftermarket and generally favorable weather conditions which drove improved demand for much of the year. Following a cold winter in early 2018 the U.S. experienced a hot summer and warmer than average temps for most of the third quarter. This was followed by an early cold snap in October and November producing the coldest November in 27 plus years while December was impacted by warmer than normal temps and heavy rainfall in many regions of the U.S. Our fourth quarter sales increase was driven by the positive growth with both our commercial and retail customers. Sales to the commercial segment, which represents 75% to 80% of our total U.S. Automotive sales outpaced our retail sales for the second consecutive quarter as sales to our NAPA AutoCare customers were strong at plus 3.8% for the quarter. NAPA AutoCare, an industry leading commercial program for our automotive business and a key sales driver for us ruled over 18,000 members and 2018. To that end, we are pleased with the improved numbers our team is driving through our NAPA AutoCare segment and we remain confident that improving trend will carry over into 2019. We're also pleased to report continued progress with our major account partners as sales to this group improved in the fourth quarter. We expect to see this positive trend continue in the quarters ahead, do our ongoing and extensive efforts to meet and exceed both the product and service demands of these national and regional customer. In our retail business, we continue to deliver positive sales comps due to initiatives such as NAPA Rewards Program, now 9.4 million members strong and growing, expanded store hours across our network and our retail impact store project. In 2018 we completed the rollout of the retail impact initiative in our company owned stores and we're pleased that these stores continue to outpace the sales growth and our non-impact traditional stores. We also began implementing this initiative with our independently owned stores in 2018 and we'll continue this roll out over a multiyear process to drive additional retail sales across the NAPA network. In summary, our U.S. Automotive team delivered a solid fourth quarter and for the year this group produced 4% sales growth. We are pleased to see the momentum built throughout the year and expect to see this continue into 2019. Turning to 2019 we entered the new year with Kevin Harrington as President of the U.S. Automotive Operations. Kevin is a 29-year NAPA veteran with significant leadership experience and a deep knowledge of the automotive aftermarket and we're excited to have him lead the U.S. Automotive team into the future. We further bolstered our North American automotive business with the addition of Scott Sonnemaker, who joined the company earlier this month as Group President, North American Automotive. And this key role created the streamline the automotive structure and further our global focus. Scott has responsibility for all aspects of the automotive business in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Scott is a seasoned executive in the distribution industry having spent 20 plus years in leadership roles at Sysco Foods. We're excited to have Scott on board and lead our efforts to maximize the future growth of this important segment of the company. Rounding out our North American automotive operations, total sales were up mid-single-digits of both NAPA, Canada and in Mexico before the negative impact of foreign currency translation. In Canada, we continue to drive our core sales growth with the solid execution of our sales initiatives and continue to benefit from our creative tuck in acquisitions which have expanded our Canadian presence. Our leadership team in Canada is also doing a fine job of improving their operating results and we expect another solid year in Canada in 2019. In Mexico, we have operated for the last several years under two banners, Autototo, our legacy business model in Mexico and NAPA Mexico. We launched our NAPA Initiative in 2014 top rate in sync with our U.S. and Canadian NAPA Operations. Our long-term strategy has been to move to one banner in Mexico. To that end, we have entered into an agreement to dye bath the Autototo business effective March 1, 2019. Autototo represents approximately $100 million in annual automotive revenues and was not a significant contributor to our overall profitability. We're excited to move forward with a greater focus on NAPA, Mexico and the growth opportunities we see to expand on our sales, market share and growing our NAPA footprint in Mexico.  In Europe, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of the AAG acquisition in November of 2018 and in both the fourth quarter and full year, this business produce solid sales and operational results across its European footprint. This is a spatially encouraging in light of the unusually mild weather and many regions of Europe during the fourth quarter as well as the continued political unrest in France and ongoing Brexit concerns in the UK. All in, the AAG team remain focused on finishing the year strong, producing mid-single-digit comp sales increases driven by positive growth in each region. In addition, AAG is on positive growth in each region. In addition, AAG's ongoing acquisitions favorably impacted our sales in Europe with TMS Motor Spares acquired on August 31 and Platinum acquired October 2, having an especially positive impact in the UK. As you may recall, TMS is the leading automotive parts distributor based in Carlisle, England with seven locations there and 17 locations in Scotland. Platinum International Group based in Manchester, England is a value-added battery distributor with nine UK locations and one location in the Netherlands. We see additional opportunities for acquisitions in Europe and we are pleased to begin the year with the closing of the Hennig Group acquisition on January 8. Previously announced in 2018 Hennig Group is one of Germany's leading supplier of vehicle parts with 31 branches across Germany and estimated annual revenues of $190 million. The addition of Hennig Group further expands our presence and scale in the German marketplace and we're excited to have them join the AAG team.  We are quite pleased with AAG 2018 performance and positive contribution to GPC. Our strategic expansion into Europe require the right partner with a history of proven success and a vision for the future and with AAG we have that team in place. We enter 2019 excited to begin our second full year with the AAG team and are encouraged by the growth opportunities we see for our European operation. In Australia and New Zealand, we had another solid quarter with both total sales and comp sales up mid-single-digits in local currency. Additionally, the age of PAC team did a fine job of converting this strong growth to improve their fourth quarter operating results. All in, 2018 proved to be another year in a series of strong performances by the age of PAC team and we expect this to continue into 2019. The economic growth in Australia is fairly robust and projected remains wrong. The favorable economy and sound aftermarket fundamentals combined with the ongoing execution of our growth plans both well for the continued growth of our Australasian automotive business. In summary, our global automotive group posted solid results in the fourth quarter and we move forward into 2019 with plans for digital sales growth and operating improvement. Now let's turn to our Industrial Parts Group, which continues to post some progressive sales growth and improved operating results. Total fourth quarter sales for Industrial, were $1.6 billion, an increase of 8.7% including a 7% comp sales growth plus a benefit of acquisitions. This represents the second straight quarter of 7% sales comp, our strongest since 2014. It also continues our two-year run of consistent sales increases driven by the effective execution of our growth initiatives and the favorable economic and industry-specific factors which continue to benefit the industrial marketplace. These factors include industrial indicators such as purchasing managers index, manufacturing industrial production, active rate counts, and U.S. exports. A broad strength in the industrial marketplace is also evident in our product and industry sector sales performance. Again, this quarter of 14 of our major product groups posted sales gains with a specially strong results and safety products and industrial supplies, hose, pumps and pneumatics [ph]. Likewise, sales to 10 of the Top 12 industries we serve were up as well highlighted by double digit increases in the iron and steel, chemicals and allied products, oil and gas extraction and rubber and plastic industries.  Our growth initiatives for Industrial include ongoing strategic acquisitions. The addition of hydraulic supply company in the fourth quarter performed well and was a creative to our results. Last week we also announced the acquisition of Axis New England, which we expect to close next month. Axis is a leading automation and robotics business with locations in Danvers, MA and Rochester, New York. It further expands our capabilities in the area of Industrial plant floor automation. Axis highlights our ongoing strategy to participate in the fast-growing automation space and further builds on our previous acquisitions. We look forward to having Todd Clark and his talented team join us as part of the motion automation solution group. We expect this business to generate estimated annual revenues of $55 million. We are proud of the Industrial team and their tremendous operating performance in 2018 and as we look ahead to 2019 we expect to build on last year's success under the leadership of Randy Breaux, the recently appointed President Motion Industries. Randy is a tremendous leader with significant experience in the industrial manufacturing and distribution markets. We're excited to have Randy lead our talented Motion team into the future. In addition to our future growth prospects in North America, we are planning to expand our industrial footprint into Australasia in 2019 with the full purchase of Inenco. As a reminder, this Australian based distribution company has operations in New Zealand as well as the growing presence in Indonesia and Singapore. GPC originally made a 35% investment in Inenco in 2017 and they have performed extremely well while growing both top and bottom line the last two years. We expect to be in a position to complete this acquisition at some point in calendar year 2019. Inenco's annual sales are approximately $400 million and is a great strategic fit with Motion aligning well with our strategic supplier base and providing for a market leading presence in Australasia, Indonesia and Singapore. Now, a few comments about S.P. Richards, our Business Products Group. This segment reported total sales at $457 million up $1.6 million for the fourth quarter driven by the growth in comp sales. This represents a third consecutive quarter of sequential sales improvement for this business and follows a positive sales comp reported in the third quarter of 2018, the first positive comps since the third quarter of 2015. In addition, sales were up in three of our four product categories for the second straight quarter. These include core office supplies, technology and our facilities break room and safety supply category. It's also important to highlight that the SBR teams significantly improved their operating results in the fourth quarter hosting a 270 basis point improvement in operating margin. This was an excellent way to finish the year and we want to thank all of our S.P. associates for their great efforts. Today, S.P. Richards represents the only independent national business products wholesaler in the U.S. and we continue to believe that there is opportunity for this business to grow and deepen its relationship with both independent dealers and other customer channels. We will continue to invest in these growth opportunities where and when appropriate.  So that recaps are consolidated and business segment results for the fourth quarter of 2018. We were pleased to report sales growth in each of our business segments and also show progress and our overall operating performance. Our team finished 2018 with positive momentum, which we will carry with us into 2019. With that, I'll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will discuss our full-year outlook for 2019. Our total sales of $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter were at 9.4% driving gross margin of 33.5% compared to 30.5% in 2017. For the full year, our sales of $18.7 billion increase 15% and our gross margin improved to 32% from 30% in the prior year. These comparisons reflects significant improvement in our 2018 gross margin due to several reasons. The Automotive and Industrial businesses have benefited from effective margin initiatives including ongoing negotiations with our global suppliers, more flexible and sophisticated pricing and digital strategies as well as more favorable product mix. In addition, the higher gross margin model at AAG and other acquisitions has positively impacted our gross margin throughout the year. Specific to the fourth quarter, all three of our segments earned additional supplier incentives due to improved volumes and we also had the benefit of year-end inventory gains net of life out, which further improved our gross margin relative to 2017. With the continued emphasis on our margin initiatives, we expect our 2019 gross margin rates to remain relatively in line with our full-year 2018 rate. This the same as reasonable in place and have 1% to 2% and consistent levels of volume incentives. We experienced an inflationary pricing environment across each of our segments in 2018 with more normal inflation in our industrial and business products and more pronounced and more pronounced in place and in the fourth quarter for Automotive. Overall, we attribute much of the fourth quarter and present place into the direct and indirect impact of tariffs, but we also had steady price increases for raw materials, commodities and supplier freight spread throughout the year. While the impact of tariffs was not significant in 2018, we passed on the supplier increases to our customers to maintain our growth margin. We expect this to continue in 2019. Our cumulative supplier price increases for the 12 months of 2018 were up 1.8% in Automotive, up 3.8% in Industrial and up 1.8% in office. Our selling administrator and other expenses in the fourth quarter were $1.2 billion representing 26.4% of sales. For the year, these expenses were $4.6 billion or 24.6% of sales. These operating costs were up from 2017 and both the quarter and the year due to several factors including the impact of a higher cost model at AAG and other acquisitions as we discussed earlier. In addition, increase investments in facilities and people in 2018 as well as rising costs in areas such as payroll, freight, delivery IT, cyber security also impacted our operations. Additionally, in 2017 we benefited from lower than expected year-end expenses in areas such as incentive compensation, legal and professional and insurance. This made for a more difficult comparison in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our selling, administration and other expenses on the income statement also includes $17 million and $30 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 respectively in transaction and other costs primarily related to AAG and the attempted transaction to spin off the business products group net of a favorable termination fee we received. In 2017, transaction and other costs primarily ray to AAG were $25 million and $44 million for the fourth quarter and the full year. We account for these items on the other net line in our segment information schedule in today's press release. To improve on our operating expenses, we continue to work towards a lower cost but highly effective infrastructure. Our plans includes steps to accelerate the integration of our acquisitions, investments to enhance our productivity and supply chains and innovative strategies to unlock greater savings and efficiencies across our global operations.  Now let's discuss the results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.6 billion up 11% from the prior year and their operating profit of $199 million was up 9% with an operating margin of 7.7% compared to 7.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017. While we continue to improve our leverage on solid sales SalesPro, this was offset by the increased investments in our facilities and people as well as rising costs in areas such as payroll and freight. Our Industrial sale for $1.6 billion in the quarter, a strong 9% increase from the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our operating profit of $131 million was at 12% and their operating margin improved to a solid 8.3% from 8.1% last year with a 20 basis point increase due to gross margin expansion and the ability to leverage their expenses on the strong sales growth. The Industrial business has been operating well now for eight consecutive quarters. Our business product revenues were $457 million a 2% increase from the prior year and their operating profit of $26 million was up significantly driving 5.7% operating margin, which is up from 3% in 2017. There's a tremendous business to the year for the business products team. Our total company operating profit in the fourth quarter was up 14% on a 9% sales increase and our operating profit margin with 7.7% compared to 7.4% last year for a 30 basis point increase. This represents our second consecutive quarter of operating margin improvement. We had net interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter and for 2018 net interest was $93 million. In 2019 we expect net interest to hold fairly steady in the $91 million to $93 million range despite four rate increases in 2018 and another two expected for 2019. Our total amortization expense was $22 million for the quarter and $89 million for the full year. For 2019, we expect full year amortization to increased slightly to $90 million to$ 92 million.  Our depreciation expense was $42 million for the fourth quarter and $153 million for the full year. We expect this to increase to $170 million to $180 million in 2019 due to the increase in capital expenditures in 2018 and our plans to further utilize our tax savings and strong cash flows for additional investments in 2019. On a combined basis, we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $260 million to $270 million in 2019. Continuing with the segment information presented in our press release, the other line, which represents our corporate expense with $58 million in the fourth quarter and that includes $17 million in transaction and other costs discussed earlier. Excluding these costs, our corporate expense was $41 million or a $16 million comparable increase from 2017. For the full year, our corporate expense was $174 million including $36 million in transaction and other cost or $138 million excluding these costs. This is up $27 million from 2017 on a comparative basis. Primarily, the increase in corporate expense for the fourth quarter and the full year reflects the incremental costs associated with our retirement plan valuation and other retirement benefits as well as an increase in short and long-term incentives, IT and security and cost-related to minority interests. With the these and other costs in mind, we expect our corporate expense to be in the $125 million $135 million range for 2019. Our tax rate for the quarter was 26.6%. This compares to our fourth quarter 2017 rate at 51% which included the required one-time unfavorable provisional adjustment related to tax reform. Our fourth quarter 2018 tax rate was higher than the first three quarters of 2018 due to the final transition tax expense adjustments as well as the non-deductible retirement plan expense that we mentioned earlier. The effective tax rate was 24.6% in 2018 and we're planning for a full year tax rate of 25% in 2019. So, now, we'll discuss our balance sheet which remains strong and in excellent condition. Our accounts receivable was $2.5 billion up 3% from the prior year and well below our fourth quarter sales increase. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at December 31 was $3.6 billion down 4% from 2017 so our team's made significant progress in 2018 and are doing an excellent job of managing this key investment. Our accounts payable of $4 billion is at 10% due mainly to the benefit of improved payment terms with our key global partners. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio improved to 111% at December 31 of 2018. We're very pleased with the improvement in our working capital position and its positive impact on our cash flows. Our total debt of $3.1 billion at December 31 is down slightly from the $3.2 billion in 2017. We're comfortable with our current debt structure and we have a strong balance sheet and the financial capacity to support our future growth initiative as well as ongoing priorities for an effective capital allocation. We generated strong cash flows in 2018 with $1.1 billion in cash from operations up 41% from 2017. In addition, our free cash flow, which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend improve to nearly $500 million from $263 million in 2017. We expect another solid year in 2019 and we're currently estimating $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow in the $400 million range. Strong cash flow continue to support our priorities for the use of cash which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our key priorities for cash remain the real investment in our businesses, their repurchases, strategic acquisitions and the dividend. Regarding the dividend, yesterday, the board of directors approved a $3.05 per share annual dividend for 2019 marking our 63rd consecutive annual increase in the dividend paid to our shareholders; this represents the annual increase in the dividend paid to our shareholders, this represents the 6% increase from the $2.88 per share paid in 2018 and it's approximately 54% of our 2018 adjusted earnings per share which is in line with our targeted payout ratio. We invested $232 million in capital expenditures in 2018 and this reflects the step-up investment related to the addition of AAG and our plans for incremental spend in areas such as technology and productivity in our facilities. For 2019 we will continue to reinvest our tax reform savings and our working capital improvement and we're planning for capital expenditures in the range of $300 million. Regarding our share repurchase program, we purchased approximately 1 million shares of our common stock in 2018 and today we have 16.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We accept to be active in the program over the long-term and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. So now let's discuss our guidance for 2019. And arriving at our 2019 full year guidance, we considered our performance in 2018, as well as our current risk, plans, and initiatives including the previously announced [indiscernible] acquisition. In addition, we took into account the impact of a strong U.S. dollar and the market conditions we see for the foreseeable future which by most accounts indicate the potential for a global economic slowdown at some point in 2019. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2019 to be in the range of plus 3% to plus 4% or plus 4% to plus 5% before the approximate 1% headwinds from foreign currency translation. This guidance excludes the benefit of any unannounced or future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 2.5% to plus 3.5% total sales growth for the automotive segment, or plus 4.5% to plus 5.5% before the impact of an approximate 2% currency headwind. For the industrial segment, total sales growth of plus 5% to plus 6% and flat total sales for the business products segment. On the earnings side, we currently expect earnings per share to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.90 or an adjusted $5.81 to $5.96 before the impact of an approximately 1% currency headwind. Our going forward reflects the cautiously optimistic outlook for 2019. We are being cautious due to the potential front economic slowdown and in particular, a slowing industrial economy in the second half of the year. In addition, expect to see more challenging sales environment in Europe in 2019. Despite these conditions though, we're optimistic that our management teams have the plan and initiatives in place to work through the issue and show more progress than 2019. Likewise, we're very confident in the underwriting fundamentals of our broad and growing business platform which provides us with sustained long-term growth opportunities. So that's our financial report for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2018, as well as our outlook for 2019. We were very pleased to finish the year with solid results and we look forward to reporting from progress in the coming quarters. With that, I turn it back to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. Reflecting on 2018, our team was hard at work executing on their sales and cost initiatives to drive stronger pipeline topline growth, improve our operating results and enhance our earnings growth. We were also focused on ensuring a successful year in our European operations and capturing the synergies planned for this acquisitions. Likewise, with the combination of VIS and Motion on January 1 of 2018. We focus this year building on the synergies created by a larger and stronger industrial operation. Finally, we significantly improved our working capital position during the year driving exceptional cash flows utilized for key investments in the company, as well as turn of capital via share repurchases and dividend which we just increased for the 63rd consecutive year as announced earlier today. With these things in mind, we're pleased to achieve record sales and earnings for the year, and encouraged by the operating improvement across our global distribution platform in North America, Europe and Australasia. Our team had many accomplishments and we are proud of their efforts to create long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to calendar; we are excited for the opportunities to build on the positive momentum generated in 2018. GPC is well positioned to capital on it's many global prospects, and further improve our operating results. With that said, we are also very aware of the potential for a slowdown in the global economy as Carol mentioned, and that was a key factor in arriving at our outlook for 2019. Our growth plans, however, our solid, we remain committed to an organic and acquisitive growth strategy to drive long-term and sustain revenues while also focusing on the continued improvement in our gross margins and cost management. We are confident that our unwavering focus in these areas combined with a continued emphasis on a strong balance sheets, excellent cash flows and effective capital allocation will serve to maximize your return to our shareholders. We're excited for the future and as always we look forward to updating you on our progress when we report again. With that, we'll turn it back to the operator and Carol and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : On the Allianz [ph] business, I mean you've talked about some weather and the political concerns. Could you sort of stack which was a bigger issue? And it sounds like you still copped up mid-single-digits. Was that local currency? Paul Donahue : That was local currency, Bret. And look, our team at AAG, despite some of the challenges that they faced in the quarter, had a darn good quarter. And I give them a whole lot of credit for executing on a number of their key initiatives. We've got a -- as you know, that market, Bret, it's fragmented. Lots of opportunities to continue to roll up bolt on acquisitions as well as some good strategic ones. And again, I give our team a ton of credit because they had some real headwinds, but despite those headwinds posted a solid quarter. Bret Jordan : What are you saying over there as you look at payable program both in the European business and maybe Australasia as well? Carol, maybe you could talk about what can be liberated out of working capital maybe? Carol Yancey : And our working capital improvement that we had this year was not related to Europe, but having said that, we worked with the teams over there and our teams here to start putting in place a number of our similar programs. So, we do expect to see some working capital improvement starting in 2019. We have similar supply chain programs already in place for Europe and we have some of our global partners, some on and some coming on. So we would expect to see some working capital improvement from them in 2019. Bret Jordan : And then I guess one just housekeeping. As you look at the fourth quarter in the U.S. business, the sort of the cadence of the quarter I'd imagine it's similar to what other people are saying October, November, strong and December weak. But maybe you could talk maybe a little about the cadence and regional performance. Paul Donahue : Now, that's exactly right, Bret. We're no different than many others who have reported October and in November were definitely the strongest two months and then we saw our sales moderate in December. And think the moderation in December was really related just to kind of how the holidays timed out coupled with the warmer temps and a ton of rain across the U.S. As we look at our regionality of our business, I got to give a call out to our Midwest team. They had a terrific Q4. And you know, when you look at some of the temperature up in the cities like Chicago in Q4 and on end of January and as the polar vortex rolled across, had really spiked our business and it continues to do well. So Midwest was definitely a top performer for us. The Northeast performed well again as they did all of 2018 and the Central Division. So again, you look across the Upper Midwest, Brent really going from the Midwest all the way to the Northeast was solid business for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth Suzuki : So, the business products segment made a pretty nice come back here with solid comps through the last two quarters and some nice operating margin expansion. Since the spinoff plan fell through, has there been a reallocation of attention or resources to S.P. Richards? And then what do you view as the longer term outlook for that business? Paul Donahue : Well, Liz, great question. And I would say a few things about our office team led by Rick Top and they had a really solid second half of the year. They were focused on the business and won some new business. And in addition to driving some good core results out of our office supply, the core office supply business, I would also tell you that we saw good growth in our facilities and break room business and along that up the line and it kind of goes with the second part of your question about are we make an investment in the S.P. Richards business. We just brought on a key executive -- industry executive, Steve Shells [ph] to run our FPS business. And he is a well-qualified executive. We expect to see continued growth out of that segment. Long-term, Liz with S.P. Richards, we are head down operating the business and I think what you saw with the much better performance in Q3, Q4 when our team is solely focused on running the business and the changes that are happening in the industry we'll see better results. And again, we're really proud of the team and a great job they did in the second half of the year. Elizabeth Suzuki : And just a question on NAPA, I hear automotive segment has had a split of about 75%. DIFM about 25% DIY for a long time. And if we look at this business in 20 years, do you think the split is still going to be about 75%, 25% or is there a plan to evolve that over time? Paul Donahue : Well, you know, Liz, we have embarked on a longer-term plan to upgrade our stores and we've now completed all of our company stores and we saw a nice lift in our retail business. We're now embarking on a similar strategy with our independent owned stores and our goal is to help our independence lifts their retail business as well. But even with those key initiatives, DIFM is going to be the larger segment. It certainly the faster growing segment, the vehicle population today is only growing more and more complex. I don't see that changing anytime soon. So I would expect certainly into the future our mix will stay relatively similar to what it is today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : So, first one I got through the impact of tariffs. So to start with, it looks like your Automotive inflation year to date moved to 140 basis points relative to last quarter. That seems pretty massive. I would like imply something, the order of 500 basis points of inflation to Q4 and actually have something wrong there. Just wanted an aiding comment on that. Carol Yancey : So, first of all, the tariffs, as we talked about it in our last quarter, the 10% tariff that went into effect that relates to about 18% to 20% of our U.S. cost of goods sold that's coming from China. So as it relates to that cost of goods sold, we worked with our Chinese suppliers, we took into account many factors with our teams, our cross-functional teams, we negotiated with the Chinese suppliers, we looked at the effect of currency and ultimately, we had more of say 4% to 5% increase that we took and that we also passed on to our customers. So what you saw in Q4 was definitely the impact of the tariffs coming through in the quarter that was pretty late in the year. So, we were able to pass that through and obviously you can see that in our growth margins. So as we look ahead, we're expecting about a 1% inflation for U.S. Auto for 2019. That does not contemplate any further changes to tariff. Chris Bottiglieri : I guess maybe two follow-ups there. So you would think, I mean, if it was 4% to 5% Q4 take several quarters for you to anniversary that. So why wouldn't the inflation impact, I guess be more '19 and what percent? That's the first part. Carol Yancey : So again, I think the 4% to 5%, it's not on all categories. There was only certain categories that this tariff applied to, so there were some key categories that it applied to. So when you blended in to the total automotive business and you look at it across the board, it waters itself down to say a 2% or 1%, and that's a cumulative number as it comes through. So we're not expecting a lot of those changes went in late Q4, so we're expecting some additional inflationary environment going into 2019 is probably the best way to say that. We said in our prepared remarks that inflation would be 1% to 2%, and I would tell you right now our best estimate is about 1% for U.S. Automotive, and about 1.5% to 2% for Business Products and Industrial. And again, more than anything, what's important is that our ability to take those price increases and pass it through to the customer. Chris Bottiglieri : And then I wanted to -- kind of given your weaker economic outlook, or just -- I guess preparing for that; I wanted to ask you a question on kind of downside risk. If you look at your automotive business in the U.S. can you tell us how the business performed out of same-store basis back in the economic downturn, the next one could be as bad as the but I just want some context. And then, similarly, I know you're new to the UK and to Germany, but those management teams are still obviously with the company and I'm sure that a lot of them are around with the downturn. Is there a way to contextualize how those business performed in the last economic downturn as well just to understand the cyclicality of those business in Europe? Thank you. Carol Yancey : Well, I think the first comment I want to just clarify; so our U.S. business comps, you're coming off -- I mean, obviously, second half is stronger than the first half but we had about 1.6% U.S. comps for 2018. We're implying in our guidance for U.S. comps to be up 3% to up 4%; so we are not implying weakness in our U.S. comps, I think what you're speaking to more specifically is probably related to either Europe or the industrial business but our North American automotive businesses and our Australasia and automotive businesses going into 2019 are improved from 2018. Paul Donahue : And Chris, I would just add to that, generally what we see in the automotive aftermarket in a slower economy which generally will result in fewer new cars sold, the automotive aftermarket generally performs pretty well, people hold onto the vehicles longer, they are conducting more repairs on those vehicles during the course of the year. So whether it be in Europe or the U.S., if there is a slowdown, and that's yet to be determined, I think our automotive aftermarket will be just fine and as you mentioned, we've got a very experienced team on the ground in Europe that has worked their way through these economic cycles that I think will be just fine. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : My first question on the U.S. auto business, you spoke to favorable weather trends for most of 2018, based on what you've seen in 2019 to-date, how do you think the weather situation is setting up for 2019? Paul Donahue : Seth, I think that while we can't go into too many specifics about what we're seeing in Q1, anytime we're seeing that kind of extreme weather pattern, so we're seeing again and we're seeing actually this week across parts of the U.S.; that's going to bode well for the automotive parts business and I think what we're now experiencing is really the back-to-back normalized winters. And as we have said many times in these calls through the years, that's what this business needs and our business like our peer group, generally performs much better when we're in those kinds of normalized weather patterns. Seth Basham : Excellent, that's helpful perspective. Secondly, as we think about the gross margin outlook here; first, in terms of the fourth quarter performance for auto, you talked about a few drivers, maybe you could help us tell [ph] in terms of listing the biggest drivers in terms of degree of magnitude to the gross margin improvement between supplier negotiations and pricing and rebates? Carol Yancey : Yes, so happy to answer that. As you may recall, through the nine months our gross margin with AAG was up about 150 basis points and we ended the year up 180 basis points. So the strong fourth quarter was a combination of several things; so as we have said all year, automotive and industrial had improved gross profit all year and that continued into the fourth quarter, as has AAG. So AAG including some of the synergies as we continue to integrate those business, as well as their acquisitions have had a strong gross margin. In addition, as Paul mentioned, our favorable results in office products that grew; if they had a more favorable product mix and that helped with their gross margin conversion, so you see that in their operating margin and a lot of that flow through to the gross margin line. And then lastly, automotive, industrial and office, all of them had better volumes which led to incremental supplier incentives that went into that number. And then we also had with some of this inflationary environment, we had favorable inventory gains and that was net of the LIFO at automotive and industrial. So while we're not going to breakout any one of those, those factors went into the Q4. Having said that we feel like this 32% rate as we look ahead is appropriate as we go forward. Seth Basham : Just one follow-up on that. Regarding the pricing and digital initiatives that you've undertook in auto; can you give us some perspectives on how material they've been to your improvement in gross margin rate? And how you think those will benefit you going forward? Carol Yancey : I guess we've factored that in, I mean you've seen the gross margin improvements all year in auto, and we would say that it's not any one thing but circling [ph] our investments and pricing and data analytics and some of the new strategies that we're doing have gone into that. But also, from a global sourcing and our global supplier partners, I mean it's buy side and sell side strategy that have gone into that. So we've seen that throughout the year, and again, we would expect that to continue on into 2019. And then the great thing is, we had some inflation for the first time in many years, and as we look ahead to 2019, we expect to have a little bit of that as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : I know you said that potential risk in the back half on a global economic slowdown. Is there anything that you're seeing now in the industrial business that's alerting you or causing you any concern or is it more sort of speculative and what others are talking about that -- just putting this in your guidance? Paul Donahue : It's a great question, Chris, because what we're seeing on in on the industrial side, certainly with some of the key metrics that we follow very closely like, PMI, and manufacturing output. The PMI number in January was up from the December number; so it actually I think was over 56 in the month of January which we take as a real positive, and then you get a federal reserve number on industrial output and productivity and that was a little bit slower in the month of January. So there is some mixed signals out there, I would tell you that we're not feeling in our business yet, but there is just a lot of noise out there that you kind of worry about avoiding; we worry all the time, right, if you don't know pretty sure. But our full year projection, we still feel good about where our industrial business is going, and the team we have in place running that business. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then, as you're following up on the winter question asked before, I mean, [indiscernible] -- Canada I think was in polar vortex from the past 7 weeks or something like that and obviously the Midwest has been hit harder. Do you think the regional performance in the U.S. in 2019 could be different from what you've seen? I think the West was weaker earlier in '18 and really the Northeast and Midwest -- Northeast lead for most of the year and now it seems like the Midwest has picked up. Any sort of -- I'd love to hear your thoughts in terms of how the regional performance might change based on what we've seen so far? Paul Donahue : Well, I think that question Chris is -- and it's a bit hard to say at this point. We have a number of initiatives that are going on in all of our geographical regions outside of weather impact that will influence our performance in those particular divisions, but as we sit here today and looking at another potential polar vortex coming across the U.S., it does appear that many of the same regions; the Midwest, the Northeast, the Central will be the benefactors of that extreme weather. I would add one of our geographical regions that we've seen a nice spike in '19 as out in out mountain division, so that includes Seattle and Colorado and Wyoming, etcetera; that business has gotten off to a good start in 2019. So it's good to see those folks stepping it up. So we'll wait and see, but again, we've got many key initiatives in the works that will certainly bolster all of our divisions in 2019. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then in terms of the operating margin outlook, is there any difference in terms of how you're thinking about the three divisions? And then related to that; is your comp needed to drive expense leverage coming down in '19 or will it be relatively consistent for 2018? Carol Yancey : Chris, I think as we think about our operating margin, and look, we were pretty excited to have a second half operating margin as 7.7% in total. Our Q4 improvement at 30 bips was really great to see after 10 bips in Q3. We're anticipating 2019 probably something like 10 basis points to 15 basis points in total operating margins. I would have to say, just given our growth outlook that that would come from primarily automotive and industrial. But I want to point out and it's -- there are a lot of investments in our business that -- again, we've talked about our tax savings, we've talked about our CapEx, and we have been investing in our facilities and productivity, in people, and -- again, pricing, data analytics, supply chain, a lot of investments for the future, and those investments will help us. And I think those investments as it flows through the SG&A line, also depreciation, we've got that -- that we know will be beneficial long-term but we're still fighting these headwinds as we've talked about with the tight labor market and wages and payroll. And then also freight and delivery, so those categories still grew greater than our sales and I -- while we think some of the freight in field will level up in 2019, this tight labor market we're in and with wages, we're not sure that that necessarily cycles out. So, I don't think it's a lower comp number, we have the margin improvement but again, we've implied some improved comp numbers for all of our businesses going forward. So again, on a long-term basis, we would expect to see operating margin improvement. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing comments. Carol Yancey : We'd like to thank you for participating in our fourth quarter and year-end conference call. We appreciate your support and interest in Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to reporting out on our first quarter results. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sid Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company first quarter 2019 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2019. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website.  Today's call also may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now, I will turn the call over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our 2019 first quarter conference call. Earlier today, we released our first quarter 2019 results. I will make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our businesses. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2019. After that, we'll open the call to your questions. To recap our first quarter performance across our global platform, total sales were $4.7 billion, up 3.3% from Q1 of 2018, driven by 3.3% comp sales increase and a 2% benefit from strategic acquisitions, net of a 2% headwind from foreign currency translation. Net income in the first quarter was $160 million and earnings per share were $1.09. Excluding the impact of currency losses and transaction and other costs related to the sale of Auto Todo, one of our two automotive parts businesses in Mexico, adjusted net income was $187 million, or $1.28 per share, up 1% from adjusted EPS in Q1 of 2018. Overall, our sales and earnings were in line with our plan for the first quarter, which assumed a stronger currency headwind than we were expecting for the full year, as well as one less selling day relative to Q1 last year. In addition, as discussed in our year-end call, our plans accounted for the sale of the Auto Todo business. We can report we've successfully closed on the sale of this business in the month of March. We are pleased to report another quarter of positive sales comps across each of our business segments, while also benefiting from the favorable impact of ongoing strategic acquisitions. Our sales performance was indicative of the continued improvement in our U.S. automotive business. And the steady growth we continue to generate in our Australasian and Canadian operations. Our strength in these areas offset the pressure on our core automotive results in Europe related to mild winter weather and broad economic and political considerations. In addition, our industrial business remain strong and we made further progress in stabilizing the business products group. Turning to a review of our business segment, total sales in our Global Automotive Group were up 2.3%. This includes a 3.1% comp sales increase and a 2.9% benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency translation of 3.4% along with the impact from the sale of Auto Todo. Breaking it down further, sales for our U.S. automotive division were up 2.5% in the first quarter, with comp sales at 3.5%. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter of improved sales comps and reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. automotive aftermarket, as well as the effective execution of our ongoing initiatives to drive both DIFM and DIY sales growth. To sum it up, we believe the aftermarket has benefited from a second consecutive normalized winter and ongoing sound fundamentals. These positive factors led to improved sales growth with both our commercial and retail customers. Sales to the DIFM segment, which represents 75% to 80% of our total U.S. automotive sales were driven by improved results across our primary commercial programs, both NAPA AutoCare Centers and major accounts. NAPA AutoCare is an industry leading commercial program for our independent repair customers and a key sales driver for us. We entered 2019 with over 18,000 members and sales to NAPA AutoCare Center customers were up 5% in the first quarter, following approximately 3.5% growth in 2018, and the strongest growth for this program since the first quarter of 2016. In addition, sales to our major account partners were up 2.2% in the quarter. This improvement follows basically flat year-over-year sales in 2018, and represents the strongest quarterly sales performance for this group in three years. Major accounts, which include fleet and government customers, national tire centers, and OE dealers among others, are a large and important customer segment for us. And the positive sales trend with these accounts is significant. We want to recognize our NAPA AutoCare and our major account teams for their hard work in driving growth with these key customers. We're also pleased with the positive sales results in our retail business as the initiatives such as the NAPA rewards program, which has now reached 10 million members strong and still growing, expanded store hours across our network and our retail impact store project, continue to make a difference and drive steady growth. With the rollout of the retail impact initiative completed in our company owned stores, these stores are outperforming and driving stronger retail sales growth than in our independent. So as we look ahead to the multi-year implementation of this initiative in our independent NAPA stores, which we began in 2018, we see opportunities to drive additional retail sales through our NAPA network in the period ahead. Turning to NAPA Canada, we took advantage of mid-single digit comp sales and the added benefit of accretive tuck-in acquisitions to produce another quarter of solid results. We were especially encouraged by the step up in comp sales relative to last year, and importantly this converted to improved operating profit. So our Canadian operations are performing well, and we expect to build on this trend in the quarters ahead. As I mentioned earlier, we closed down the sale of Auto Todo, our legacy automotive business in Mexico. This business generated $100 million in annual revenues, and was not a significant contributor to our overall profitability.  Going forward, our focus will be on expanding our presence in Mexico under the NAPA banner. In Europe, the first quarter presented a challenging sales environment due to the combined impact of a mild winter across most of the regions which we operate. The continued disruption of business associated with Brexit concerns in the UK, social unrest in France and the overall softening economic environment. While these factors pressured our core automotive growth in Europe, AAG\u2019s acquisition activity more than offset the decrease in comp sale. 2018 acquisitions such as TMS and Platinum in the UK, and the Hennig Group acquired in Q1 which expands our presence in Germany have been accretive to our sales and earnings, and we're excited to have these businesses as a part of our AAG operations. In March, we also announced the acquisition of PartsPoint Group in the Netherlands, which we expect to close on in June of this year. PartsPoint is a leading supplier of automotive parts and accessories in the Benelux marketplace, with a network of one national distribution center, six regional warehouses and 147 branches. This new business is an excellent strategic fit for AAG and we're excited for the opportunities we see in the Netherlands and Belgium. We expect PartsPoint to generate estimated annual revenues of $330 million and we look forward to welcoming CEO and Managing Director, Cor Baltus and the entire PartsPoint team to the AAG and GPC family. So, despite the current challenges we face in Europe, our team is fully prepared to push through these near-term issues via the continued execution of their growth plans, and cost savings initiatives. We remain confident in the growth potential we see for our European operations over the longer term. In Australia and New Zealand, we produced another quarter of steady growth, with low to mid-single digit sales increases for both total and comp sales. We're also pleased that the Asia-Pac team further improved on their operating results. This business unit continues to operate very well. And with the backdrop of economic stability and sound aftermarket fundamentals, we expect to see additional growth in our Australasian automotive business in the quarters ahead. In summary, our global Automotive Group posted solid overall results in the first quarter, despite the slowing we experienced in our core automotive business in Europe. Our team in Europe has initiated plans to address these concerns and we move forward with expectations for additional sales growth and operating improvement over the balance of the year. Turning to our Industrial Parts Group, this business continued its long run of consistent sales increases, with first quarter sales of $1.6 billion, up 5.7% including 4.2% comp sales growth, plus a 1.8% benefit of acquisitions, which was partially offset by a slight currency headwind. As a reminder, our recent acquisitions include the October 2018 addition of a hydraulic supply company, a fluid power distributor, in the March addition of Axis Automation, a leading automation in robotics business that further expands our capabilities in the area of industrial plant floor automation. Overall, our Q1 results were driven by the effective execution of our growth initiatives and the generally favorable economic and industry specific factors, which continue to benefit the industrial marketplace. As we move forward, we remain focused on our key growth initiatives and those factors we control to drive additional sales and earnings growth. Looking at our product and industry sector sales performance, 13 and 14 major product groups posted sales gains, with especially strong results in the material handling and hose and pumps category. Additionally, 9 of the top 12 industries where we compete had sales increases consistent with last quarter, highlighted by strong growth in the iron and steel, automotive, aggregate and cement and fabricated metal product sectors for the second consecutive quarter. Offsetting these positive results were softer sales and the electrical specialties group. And our team is working hard to improve the sales performance for this group going forward. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain confident in the growth outlook for our North American industrial business. In addition, we are excited for the opportunity to expand our industrial footprint into Australasia later this year, as we expect to acquire the balance of Inenco. This Australian based industrial distribution company has operations in New Zealand, as well as a growing presence in Indonesia and Singapore. In 2017, GPC made a 35% investment in Inenco and they have performed extremely well, while growing both top and bottom-line for past two years. Inenco's current annual sales are approximately $400 million and the business is a solid strategic fit with motion industries. Aligning well with our global supplier base, and providing for a market leading presence in Australasia, Indonesia, and Singapore. We will wrap up our business unit updates with S.P Richards, our Business Products Group. We have been pleased to stabilize this business over the last two quarters. In Q1, sales were up 1% for both total sales and comp sales. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive comp sales, driven by improved sales in three of our four product categories, including positive results in core office supplies, technology and facilities and safety supplies category. Most encouraging is our sales to our independent reseller, national account and internet reseller customers, which were all positive. We believe that our growth and these product categories and customer channels reflect the opportunities we have to further grow the business, as the only independent national business products wholesaler in the U.S. We will continue to invest in these growth opportunities where and when appropriate. So that is a recap of our consolidated and business segment results for the first quarter of 2019. As stated earlier, we are pleased to report results that were in line with our plans for the quarter. And we are confident that the progress we made in Q1 will set us up for a successful 2019 and an even brighter future for GPC over the longer term. With that, I'll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will provide our updated outlook for 2019. Our total sales of $4.7 billion in the first quarter were up 3.3%, driven by improved sales in each of our business segments. Our gross margin for the quarter was 31.8% compared to 31.3% in 2018, with the improvement in margin relating to several factors. Primarily the increase reflects higher margins in our automotive and industrial businesses due to their ongoing margin initiatives, including global supplier negotiations, more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies and favorable product mix. In addition, the increase in supplier incentives due to improved volumes for these segments also had a positive impact on gross margins. In the Business Products Group, our gross margin was pressured due to unfavorable shifts in product and customer mix. Moving forward we continue to expect our 2019 gross margin rate to remain relatively in line with our current run rate, assuming reasonable inflation of 1% to 2% and consistent levels of volume incentives. The pricing environment remain inflationary across our businesses in the first quarter with tariff price increases for raw materials, commodities and supplier freight each having an impact on our total costs. We continue to pass along our price increases to customers to protect our gross profit dollars and to maintain our gross margin wherever the market conditions will allow. And we would say that the current levels of inflation have been a net positive to our results. We expect this to continue through the balance of 2019. Our supplier price increases thus far in 2019 have impacted our purchases by one half of 1% in automotive, 1.2% in industrial and 2% in office. Turning to our SG&A, these expenses were $1.2 billion in the first quarter and represents 25.3% of sales. These operating costs were up from last year as a result of several factors including the effect of rising costs in areas such as payroll, freight and delivery, IT and cyber security, as well as the loss of leverage on our expenses in Europe related to the slowdown in their core sales. To offset these and other increases, we continue to work towards a lower costs, but highly effective infrastructure in the quarters ahead. Our plans include steps to effectively integrate our acquisitions to drive facility consolidations, productivity solutions, and other initiatives that will drive efficiencies across all our operations. We expect to benefit from these initiatives and other cost control measures across our operations in the quarters ahead. Moving down the income statement, we would point you to the other non-operating expenses line. The change in this line primarily reflects the $27 million realized currency loss related to the divestiture of Auto Todo as noted earlier. Now let's discuss the results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the first quarter was $2.6 billion, up 2.3% from the prior year, and our operating profit of $179 million was down 3%, with an operating margin is 6.8% compared to 7.2% margin in the first quarter of 2018. So while we're seeing improvement on our gross margin line, we continue to be impacted by the rising costs. And we were also impacted by the deleveraging of expenses in Europe.  With that said, several of our automotive operations produced improved operating results in the quarter and we expect to see more improvement in the periods ahead. Our industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, a solid 6% increase from Q1 of 2018. Our operating profit of $121 million is up 8% and our operating margin improved to 7.4% from 7.2% last year, with the 20 basis point increase due to gross margin expansion and the ability to leverage their expenses. The industrial business has been operating well for nine consecutive quarters and remain strong as we head into the second quarter. Our business products revenues were $479 million, up 1% from the prior year and their operating profit of $21 million is 4.4% of sales, which is down slightly from 2018. We've been pleased to stabilize this business over the last few quarters and we're working hard to improve their operating results. Our total company operating profit in the first quarter was up 1% on a 3% sales increase, and our operating profit margin was 6.8% compared to 6.9% last year. This follows two consecutive quarters of margin expansion and we are planning for improved margins again in the quarters ahead. We had net interest expense of $23 million in the first quarter, which was flat from the first quarter of the prior year. Looking ahead, we continue to expect net interest expense to hold steady and to be in the $91 million to $93 million range for the full year. Our total amortization expense was $23 million for the first quarter, and for 2019 we expect full year amortization of approximately $92 million. Depreciation expense was $39 million and the first quarter and we continue to expect depreciation of $170 million to $180 million for the year. On a combined basis, we expect depreciation and amortization to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million for 2019. Continuing with the segment information presented in our press release the other line which primarily represents our corporate expense was $64 million in the first quarter, which includes $34 million in transaction and other costs related to the sale of Auto Todo. Excluding these costs, our corporate expense was $30 million, which is a slight improvement from 2018 when we adjust for the $13 million in transaction and other costs that was reported last year. For 2019, we continue to expect our corporate expense to be in the $125 million to $135 million range. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 24.2%, which is an increase from the 23% rate in the prior year, but likely our lowest quarterly rate for the year. For the full year we continue to expect our 2019 tax rate to be approximately 25%. Now let's turn to the balance sheet which remains in strong and excellent condition. Our accounts receivable of 2.7 billion is up 4% from the prior year, and this compares to our 3.3% sales increase for the first quarter. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at March 31 was $3.7 billion, which was down 2% from March of last year. This improvement reflects the positive impact of our current initiatives to improve the inventory levels in our core businesses and we remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Our accounts payable of $4.1 billion is up 8%, due mainly to the increase in purchasing volume, as well as the benefit of improved payment terms with key global partners. At March 31st, our AP to inventory ratio stands at 110%. Our total debt of $3.4 billion at March 31, is up slightly from the $3.3 billion in 2018. We remain comfortable with our current debt structure, and we have a strong balance sheet and the financial capacity to support our future growth initiatives and our ongoing priorities for effective capital allocation. In the first quarter, we generated $62 million in cash from operations and for 2019, we continue to expect $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in cash from operations. And free cash flow, which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. These estimates are in line with the solid cash flows generated last year and continue to support our ongoing priorities for the use of cash which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our key priorities for cash remain reinvestment in our businesses, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions and the dividend. Regarding the dividend, 2019 marks our 63rd consecutive annual increase for the dividend paid to our shareholders. Our dividend of $3.05 represented a 6% increase from 2018 and is approximately 54% of our 2018 adjusted earnings, which is in line with our targeted payout ratio. We invested $46 million in capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019, which was up from $32 million in 2018. This reflects the planned increase in our investment in areas such as technology and productivity in our facilities. And for the full year, we continue to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $300 million. Regarding our share repurchase program, we currently have 16.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. Thus far in 2019, we have not made any purchases under the program as we have been active with other investment opportunities, such as M&A and capital expenditures.  Moving forward, we expect to be active in the program as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. Now let's discuss our current outlook for 2019. We are reaffirming our full year 2019 sales and earnings guidance established in February. Our outlook is based on several factors, including our performance in the first quarter, our current growth plans and initiative and the market conditions we see for the foreseeable future across our operations. In addition, we took into account the impact of a strong U.S. dollar and continue to estimate a 1% currency headwind for the full year. Although we do expect this to be greater than 1% again in the second quarter, which is similar to the first quarter. Finally, our outlook account for one additional selling day in the third quarter relative to 2018 to make up for the one less selling day in the first quarter this year. With these factors in mind, we reaffirm our outlook for total sales in 2019 of plus 3% to plus 4%, or plus 4% to plus 5% before the 1% headwind from currency translations. As is customary, this guidance excludes the benefit of any future acquisitions. By business, we continue to guide to plus 2.5% to plus 3.5% sales growth for the automotive segment, or plus 4.5% to plus 5.5% before the impact of an approximate 2% currency headwind, plus 5% to plus 6% total sales growth for our Industrial segment, and flat total sales for our Business Products segment. On the earning side, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.56 to $5.71, which accounts for the transaction and other costs incurred in the first quarter. We're also reiterating our outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $5.75 to $5.90, or $5.81 to $5.96, before the impact of the 1% currency headwind. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes any first quarter as well as any future transaction or other costs. We are optimistic that our management teams have the plans and initiatives in place to show additional progress in 2019, and to successfully operate through the near-term challenges in Europe, as well as the potential for a slowing industrial economy. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our broad and growing business platform, which provides us with the same long-term growth opportunities. So that completes our financial update. And we're pleased to report results that were in line with our plans for the quarter. And we made progress in several important areas that better position us for the future. Paul, I'll turn it back over to you. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Carol. We entered 2019 excited for the opportunity to build on the positive momentum generated last year. And for the first quarter, we were pleased to report accomplishments in a number of areas.  Our total sales and earnings were in line with our plan. Our teams produce positive sales comp in each of our business segments; we experienced the continued strengthening of our U.S. automotive business; we reported another quarter of consistent and steady growth in our Canadian and Australasian automotive businesses, our industrial business remain strong and continues to perform well; we further stabilized our results in our Business Products Group; we closed on two accretive acquisitions, Hennig Group for the automotive business and Axis in industrial. We closed on the sale of our legacy Auto Todo business in Mexico. And finally, we announced entry into the Benelux region of Europe with the addition of PartsPoint Group planned for June of 2019. We enter the second quarter of 2019 focused on further strengthening of our global platform, driving consistent and sustainable sales growth and improving our operating results. We plan to support these objectives with a strong balance sheet, strong cash flows, and effective capital allocation. We believe our continued focus in these areas will create significant value for our shareholders as we move forward through the year. These are exciting times to Genuine Parts Company and we're optimistic for the future and the additional growth opportunities we see across all of our businesses. As always, we look forward to updating you on our progress when we report again. So with that, we'll turn it back to the operator and Carol and I will take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Carol Yancey : And before we turn to Q&A this morning we want to mention that we're going to have our inaugural Investor Day at GPC's headquarters in Atlanta on Tuesday, June 4th. We will also have a store tour and reception beginning on the afternoon of June 3rd. This event is for institutional investors and analysts and will be a great opportunity to hear from our business leaders. If you're interested in joining us or have any questions, please email us at investor_day@genpt.com. Operator, please continue. Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Horvers : Can you -- just first that clarification the 3.5% U.S. that includes a headwind for one less day or that excludes that headwind? Paul Donahue : Yes, that includes Chris. Christopher Horvers : So it would have been 4.0 ex-that, is that right? Carol Yancey : Well, we would give -- we would say it's about 1.5%, 1.6% for the shorter day in the quarter. So probably more like a 5% on an average day basis. Christopher Horvers : Average daily basis. Got it. And then in terms of -- I want to dig in a little bit on the cadence both in the U.S. business, U.S. NAPA business, as well as in Motion. So maybe first on the U.S., the U.S. NAPA business, was there a lot of noise around tax refunds or weather in February, how would you describe the overall cadence of the business? And then on Motion, you did a six in the fourth quarter, which decelerated pretty sharply. How would you describe sort of cadence to that business, and then how you're thinking about that going forward? Paul Donahue : Yes. So we'll start with U.S. automotive Chris, and pleased to report that business got stronger as the quarter progress. So, January soft out of the gates a little bit with a warmer first half of January polar vortex kicked in, in the second half and we\u2019ve really took off from there, we had a good February and a better March for the automotive parts business. On the industrial side, pretty consistent and one thing I'd point out Chris, when you mentioned the slowdown. The industrial business if you break out just the core motion business, that business was up 7% in the quarter which is pretty consistent with where we've been the last really two plus years. The Motion business, as you look at the average daily sales really good January, softened a bit in February and then rebounded nicely again in March. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then typically if you could just maybe share some light on April and refresh on what the U.S. NAPA business look like last year from a cadence perspective, in 2Q I think that some of the more DIY-oriented auto parts retailers out there talked about, April being pretty tough because of the weather last year. Is that something that you experienced and could you share any comments on how things are trending now? Paul Donahue : Well, Chris, there's not a lot we can say at this point about Q2. The one thing I would mention then and we always end up talking a good bit about weather on these calls. Blizzard in early April are necessarily great for the automotive parts business where we're ready to get into the spring selling season break fees. And so it's early yet, but look, what we're encouraged mostly about Chris is the turnaround we're seeing in our U.S. automotive business. We have new leadership in place, we've seen steady improvement over the past few quarters. The weather has certainly normalized with the exception of what we saw in early April. Industry fundamentals continue to be really sound and we're seeing nice improvements in our -- both our AutoCare and our major account business on the DIFM side. So, lot to be encouraged about as it relates to our U.S. automotive business. Christopher Horvers : Super, have the great rest of the year, guys. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Chris. Carol Yancey :  Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Paul Donahue : Good morning. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi. Sounds like there's a lot of moving pieces on the auto side that impacted EBIT margins. Can you provide some more color specifically on what you saw with the U.S. auto margins, please? Carol Yancey : Yes, so as it relates to our automotive margins, and we kind of as we talked about in our comments, we have seen continued improvement from our automotive gross margins and that would be across the board and also include U.S. automotive. So gross margins has been improved for all of last year. We're running on probably six or seven quarters. When we look at our U.S. SG&A, little bit of headwinds there that we've called out before, but what I would tell you is they were more flattish. And so we had improved margins for Canada, for Australasia, flattish for U.S., and as we mentioned, with kind of a loss of leverage for Europe that's where we really saw the pressure in our automotive margins. Scot Ciccarelli : So just to be very specific, so flat U.S. EBIT margins, is that basically what the message is? Carol Yancey : Yes. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay. And then can you clarify your comment regarding inflation, when you talk about your costs of goods change that you already highlighted for the different categories, is that all the flow through? Because I thought the expectation was a little bit higher inflation than what you pointed out specifically on the auto side? Carol Yancey : Yes, so what I commented on is the price increases we've received thus far in Q1 on our purchases. And when we look forward, what our full year expectations are, we would say for automotive, for example, they were only up half a point in Q1. And some of that is flowing through to the sales line, and obviously, for all of our businesses. But as you know, the timing and the way that that can be passed through, you're probably getting more like half of that benefit that's flowing through on the top line. But our full year inflation expectations for automotive would be more like 1% to 1.25% on a full year basis. And then for industrial and business products, probably more like a 2%. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple of clerical ones upfront. What was the difference between the U.S. auto up 2.5% and the comp 3.5%, did you close doors or something else that caused that spread? Paul Donahue : Well, it's a combination of things, Chris, your comment of closed stores is accurate from a year ago. But there's also consolidation of stores, as well as stores that we sold off. So if you go back a year ago from Q1, it was about -- the impact was about 60 stores that were -- that would fall in one of those buckets of consolidated closed or sold. And that was the explanation for the difference in the comp versus total. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. That's really helpful. Okay. And then Easter. So last year, Easter was like a combined one point headwind for the Northeaster [ph] and the Easter shift. So what I understand how much you think you benefit of this quarter from Easter? And then similarly, what do you think the headwind will be for Q2 as we kind of think through the cadence? Paul Donahue : Yes, so Chris last year. I believe our comment was it was about a half point. And we feel that's about what we've picked up in Q1 of this year. So as we look at April falling in -- or Easter falling into April, we would expect it to be about the same. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay, got you. Okay. And then my first real question, I know this is a lot. But -- so Europe, I guess, one key quantify, that you are going to grow, I don\u2019t think you've done that yet. And then two, if I'm following the call correctly, Europe's about 20% of your automotive sales or it sounds like it drove that 40 basis points margin decline. So is that right that 20% of your business drove a 40 basis points decline? Paul Donahue : Well, let me comment on your first question on the overall comp. I think you asked that did you not Chris for Europe. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes, for Europe, please. That will be really helpful. The comp in the prior acquisitions. Paul Donahue : Yes, so our total sales were up high-single digits in Europe, which was largely driven by acquisitions if you go back and look pure organic, and that would be between the UK, France and Germany. Our organic would be down about 1% year-over-year. Carol Yancey : And just a comment on the automotive margins, as we've mentioned before, our European business does carry a higher operating margin than what the total number is. So there's 1% comp decline and knowing that we really can't leverage on that. And look, our teams have got plans in place to address that over the balance of the year. But how quickly that happened in the quarter and then being able to react to it did drive the basis point decline in the quarter. But again, we're working hard to turn that around over the balance of the year. And I would tell you in the balance of the year, we would expect to show margin improvement on a full year basis of more in the magnitude of 10 to 15 basis points for both automotive and in total. Paul Donahue : Chris, just an additional comment or two about Europe since you raised the question. We see the issues that we're facing there, which I think a number of companies are facing is largely transitory. And you've couple some of the economic what we believe are short-term challenges with the fact that in our markets between the UK, France and Germany they literally had no winter weather. And just as we see here, we never talk about the weather in Europe, but just as it impacts our U.S. automotive business that had a huge impact on our European business. So few short-term challenges, but ones that we believe are largely transitory and we'll get by. Chris Bottiglieri : That makes a lot of sense. Good luck. Thank you. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. Thanks, guys. From a foreign exchange standpoint, when do you think the year-over-year impact starts to reverse or improve, because you're only expecting about a 1% headwind for the year and it was a 2% headwind this quarter. So, do you think there's a risk to the 2019 outlook if foreign exchange plays out somewhat differently than the way you're modeling? Carol Yancey : Yes, so a couple comments, as we mentioned earlier, we do expect you to be very similar to Q1. So definitely a greater impact in Q2 at a similar rate as it was in Q1. So we would expect to see it a little bit better for Q3 and Q4. We based our guidance and we've modeled that full year 1% based on the rate that we started with at the beginning of the year. As we look ahead, we think that's still appropriate, but obviously we'll continue to keep an eye on that over the balance of the year. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay, great. And how quickly can you adjust pricing or anything else or your contracts to offset factors like both the supply or price increases or foreign exchange and when there are a rapid changes, is it a three months impact or six months? Like how long is that usually an impact on your earnings? Carol Yancey : Yes, look I would say our teams have done a really good job in the gross margin area, and we're balancing a lot of things that are coming in. So with having more of an inflationary environment has given us an opportunity to drive a little bit of lift in our gross margins. We are balancing any currency impact that comes into there. And then, as we look at what our pricing constraints may be, we also look at pricing opportunities. As we've mentioned before, both our automotive team and industrial teams are doing a lot around pricing, data analytics, their pricing strategy and being more nimble and being able to react quicker.  So, we are obviously looking at that as it relates to the market and the competitive environment. But again, if we just look at our gross margin, we feel like we've done a pretty good job of getting those pass through. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great, thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Good morning, guys. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Bret Jordan : On the European business I guess, could you sort of bucket what was winter versus the economic issues you referenced maybe as far as impact? Paul Donahue : It's hard to say Bret, how it splits out between the two both are certainly impactful. I would say though, if you were to ask me, which was more impactful in the quarter. I would say it was the weather. And, look the European economy has not been the greatest in the last few quarters. So the outlier is that really, really warm weather they had in Q1 that really impacted the business, especially as it relates to a lot of our winter goods category categories that were impacted greatly in the quarter. So hard to break it down specifically, but if you were to ask me, I'd say weather was more impactful than some of the economic issues. Bret Jordan : So how is the cadence, I guess, is the cadence stabilizing or did it improve as the quarter went as you got out of the cold weather selling season or is it just continuing to drag? Paul Donahue : It was pretty flat throughout the quarter. I mean, pretty straightforward. You've heard me mentioned earlier, our total sales in Europe are up high-single digit, our comps were down one which were pretty consistent through the three month period. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then, Carol, as far as payables in Europe, how you find the ability to manage the working capital over there with a few deals done now? Carol Yancey : Yes, so great question. And we still continue to believe and are pleased to see some improvement in our synergies, both from margin initiatives and on the payable side. So in working with a lot of our global suppliers, we do have programs that have been put in place, we have additional terms that have been negotiated, those will be falling more in the second half of the year. And that's actually been factored into our working capital guidance that we've given. So those are actually coming along quite well. And there's even an offset that comes to the U.S. where we're getting some improved terms based on European supplier relationships. So it actually works on both sides. Bret Jordan : Great. And then, Paul, one last question on U.S. auto, could you comment on any major regional dispersion that either outperformance or underperformance in the U.S.? Paul Donahue : Yes, much like Q4, Bret, the strength and not surprisingly is those cold weather region. So our best performing region again in Q1 was our Midwest team who had just an outstanding quarter followed right closely by our Central Division and our Mountain Division also had a very strong quarter. Northeast was good. And then trailing those four northern divisions would be our southern businesses, which were flat to down -- or flat to up low-single digit, good business but certainly the outliers were the strong performance in our northern divisions. Bret Jordan : All right, great, thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Michael Montani : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask first of if I could, for Carol, with the 3% plus organic growth, just wanted to think through for the remainder of the year what kind of organic growth do you think you would need to show leverage on SG&A given some of the headwinds that you had flagged? Carol Yancey : Yes, so as we mentioned, and we are definitely seeing that operating margin improvement on our industrial business, and again, that's coming through there greater comp, and we're seeing the nice improvement there. On the automotive side are and we've pointed out our U.S. automotive, even with a comp of 3.5%, while those margins were flat in Q1, that's the best they have been in eight quarters. We've seen tremendous progress they've made in some areas such as payroll and freight with some of their investments. So some of the things that are staying in the SG&A, which would -- whether it's depreciation and IT and some of the investments we're making and still some headwinds on payroll and freight. We're definitely making progress. And I would say by the end of the year, we would see margin improvement. So we're close to having that comp now and as we kind of mentioned, Europe was the one thing that was really a headwind on the margin.  So certainly end of the year if comp stay in that 3% to 4% range, we would expect to have that 10 to 15 basis point margin improvement. Michael Montani : Okay. And then if I could, just from an U.S. Automotive perspective, I was hoping that you guys could unpack a little bit kind of the traffic versus ticket dynamic within 3.5% comp. And then secondly, I apologize if I had missed this, but did you give a split in terms of the DIY versus the DIFM comp? Paul Donahue : Yes. Mike, I'll take both of those. The -- between DIFM and DIY, both showed positive sales growth in Q1 and both were up in the low to mid-single digits range. So we're pleased with the growth we're seeing in both. Even more pleasing is the fact that for another quarter, I believe in fact two quarters in a row now, we've seen improvement in our number of invoices running through our stores, but also the average ticket size coming through.  And as you know, Mike in recent quarters, while we've seen an increase in the size of the invoice, our number of tickets were down, very pleased to report this quarter that we're seeing a lift in both for the second consecutive quarter. So great job by our team in the U.S. Michael Montani : Great, thank you. Paul Donahue : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carolina Jolly with Gabelli. Please proceed with your question. Brian Sponheimer : Hi, it\u2019s Brian Sponheimer pinch hitting for Carolina. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Brian Sponheimer : Hi, everybody. Couple of questions on the acquisitions that you've made in Europe and maybe the valuation multiples that you're seeing their relative to the attractiveness of making similar acquisitions in your core markets. Paul Donahue : Well, Brian, a couple of comments. So the couple of acquisitions that we've done, one which we closed on, which was Hennig, which is an automotive parts business in Germany that closed earlier in Q1. And then, we recently announced PartsPoint Group out of the Netherlands and Belgium, which we hope to close in early June. I would say from a valuation and multiple standpoint it's very similar to what we've seen in the U.S. these are not -- these businesses we've got relationships with again much like our approach here in the U.S., Brian. And we're not getting into bidding war auctions with private equity. So it's been very same I will leave it at that. Brian Sponheimer : Just kind of following on that, for both auto and for motion you chose Australia first for international expansion in Australasia. What are the dynamics as far as Motion either looking into Europe or further in the U.S. as far as acquisitive growth there, given that your suppliers are large multi-national companies and your customers are large multi-national companies. Paul Donahue : Yes so -- I'm sorry, Brian, didn't mean to cut you off. Look, our industrial business has been a solid performer for going on 10 quarters now. We're excited to move into Australasia. We took a 35% investment in an En. Co. [ph] a couple of years ago. We\u2019ve gotten to know that team very well, we've gotten to know their business and the market that they serve today, which is generally Australia, New Zealand as well as into Southeast Asia. Great business one that we hope to close on the balance later in 2019. That will give us a nice foothold in that part of the world with a $400 million MRO player which arguably is a leader in their market. We have no designs right now on taking our industrial business into Europe, Brian. But -- and partly because we have big opportunities to continue to grow here in the U.S. as big as we are we still have less than 10% market share. So we think we have ample opportunity to continue to grow in North America as well as we'll look at potential bolt-on opportunities in Australasia as well. Brian Sponheimer : All right terrific. Well, thank you very much. Paul Donahue : You're welcome. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We like to thank you today for your participation in our first quarter earnings call. We thank you for your support and interest in Genuine Parts Company. And we look forward to reporting out our second quarter results in July. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Sid Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company second quarter 2019 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2019. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid. And I\u2019ll add my welcome to our second quarter 2019 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our second quarter 2019 results. I\u2019ll make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our businesses. Carol Yancey, will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2019. After that, we'll open the call up to your questions. To recap our second quarter performance across our global platform, total sales were a record $4.9 billion, up 2.3% from Q2 of 2018, driven by a 1.6% comp sales increase, and a 2.7% benefit from strategic acquisitions, net of a 1.5% headwind from foreign currency translation, and a 1.5% impact from the Auto Todo divestiture. Net income in the second quarter was $224 million and earnings per share were $1.53. Excluding the impact of transaction and other cost related to acquisitions, adjusted net income was $230 million, or $1.57 per share. Our second quarter results were highlighted by positive total sales growth in each of our automotive regions, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australasia and in our industrial segment, while the business products group had a slight decline in sales. Our core automotive performance in Europe was pressured by the ongoing transitory factors of a mild winter season and broad economic and political consideration. Turning to a more detailed review of our business segments, total sales in our Global Automotive Group, which represented 56% of our total revenues were up 1.4%. This includes a 1.3% comp sales increase and a 3.5% benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency of 2.5%, and the impact from the sale of Auto Todo in Q1. By region, our U.S. automotive sales were up 2.3% in the second quarter with comp sales at plus 3%. This marks the continuation of solid U.S. sales comp in our fourth consecutive quarter of 3% comp sales growth, despite the challenge of wet conditions across much of the country throughout the quarter. We remain confident in the strength of the U.S. automotive aftermarket over the balance of the year, and we look forward to executing on our growth initiatives to cease the opportunities provided by both the positive business climate and sound industry fundamental. In the second quarter, we had positive sales growth with both our commercial and retail customers. We were especially pleased with the strength of our sales to the commercial segment, which represents close to 80% of our total U.S. automotive sales. While we experience sales gains across our commercial customers segment, sales to our NAPA AutoCare Centers drove the outperformance. Sales to our AutoCare customers were up 5%, in-line with the first quarter and improved from the 3.5% growth in 2018. This was a direct result of the increase focused by our new management team to drive a greater share of wallet with these strategic customers. NAPA AutoCare represents the fastest growing customer segment for our U.S. automotive business and is targeted to represent well over 18,000 members this year.  We expect continued growth from these customers in the quarters ahead. Sales to our major account partners were up 2% in the quarter [technical difficulty] regional accounts and OE dealers among others represent a large and important customer segment. Driving improved sales with this group is meaningful to our overall results and an important element of our growth strategy. Turning to our retail segment, sales to this group were positive as noted before, but pressured somewhat from the wet weather that persisted throughout the quarter. We believe our retail business will bounce back as the weather normalizes. Our retail impact stores, which represent those stores that have been renovated and reset continued to outperform our overall retail performance, and we have significant opportunity to further expand this initiative across our network. While we have successfully completed this initiative in our company stores, we\u2019ve really just begun to implement these changes at our independent stores. In addition, the NAPA Rewards Program, which now has reached 10.7 million members strong continues to drive additional retail sales and positively impact our overall results. At NAPA Canada, our business remains strong having produced another quarter of solid sales growth driven by mid-single digit comp sales growth and the added benefit of accretive tuck-in acquisition. Our Canadian team maintained a strong margin and we expect to continue to build on this positive momentum. In Europe, our automotive business continued to operate in a challenging sales environment. The mild winner across most of the regions in which we operate, disruption of business associated with Brexit, and the overall softening economic environment each weighed heavily on our core sales and significantly pressured our operating results. Our management team in Europe began taking step to address these issues early in the first quarter by implementing comprehensive cost saving initiative to mitigate the effects of this downturn. We are ramping up these ongoing efforts and expect to personally offset our property clients in Europe over the balance of the year. During the quarter, we announced the closing of the PartsPoint acquisition effective in June. This new business is an excellent strategic fit for AAG and we\u2019re excited for the growth opportunities we see in the Netherlands and Belgium. The Benelux region of Europe has not been impacted by the economic and political factors affecting much of Europe, providing a more stable operating environment. We expect PartsPoint to generate estimated annual revenue of $330 million and look forward to growing this business and further strengthening our European operations. And finally, yesterday we announced that AAG has entered into an agreement to acquire the Todd Group, a leading distributor in France for heavy-duty and truck parts and accessories for the independent heavy-duty aftermarket. The European heavy-duty market has avoided the economic and other pressures in Europe and continues to grow at solid rates. With the addition of Todd, AAG becomes the undisputed leader in the independent heavy-duty aftermarket in France with well over 300 total locations. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2019 and for this business to generate $85 million in estimated annual revenues. Undoubtedly, we are all disappointed with our recent results in Europe. We remain committed to our growth plans, while also taking proactive steps to immediately reduce our cost structure and work through these challenges, which we believe to be transitory in nature, but impactful in the near term as we have seen in this quarter\u2019s results. In Australia and New Zealand, we are pleased to report another solid quarter with low to mid-single digit sales increased for both total and comp sales. This steady growth reflects the positive impact of a well-executed growth strategy combined with the effective cost controls and sound aftermarket fundamentals. As part of our growth plans for this business, we increased our investment in Sparesbox to 87% effective July 1. While not significant to our financial results, Sparesbox is Australia\u2019s leading online automotive parts and accessories business. As a cutting-edge digital specialist, this partnership served to enhance our understanding of the digital marketplace and grow our digital sales capabilities in Australasia and potentially across our global operation. We are excited to expand our partnership with the Sparesbox team and look forward to growing our business together. In summary, while our European business remains challenged, our automotive businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Australasia are performing well thus far in 2019. We are confident that we can continue this positive trend, while also working to improve our European results in the quarters ahead. Turning now to our Industrial Parts Group, this business continues to perform well with sales of $1.7 billion, up 4.9%, including 3.1% comp sales growth, and a 2.1% benefit from acquisitions, which was partially offset by a slight currency headwind. Importantly, this quarter\u2019s sales growth drove improved profitability and a 30-basis point improvement in operating margin. So, we are pleased with the continued progress we are making in our industrial business. Overall, we continue to effectively execute on our growth initiative and operate in a stable industrial economy. In addition, our acquisitions continue to perform well and positively contribute to our overall results. Looking to our product and industry sector sales performance, our results were consistent with the first quarter. 12 of 14 major product groups posted sales gains with especially strong results in the industrial supplies, material handling, and hose and pumps category leading the way. Additionally, 9 of the top 12 industries, where we compete, generated sales increases, highlighted by strong growth across several sectors, including iron and steel, fabricated metal products, chemicals and allied products, aggregate and cement, food products, and automotive sectors. Offsetting these positive results were softer sales in the electrical specialties group, primarily driven by the impact of lower copper pricing. We remain confident in the growth outlook for our North American industrial business for the balance of the year. In addition, as previously announced, we expanded our industrial footprint into Australasia with the purchase of the remaining 65% stake in Inenco, effective July 1. We originally purchased a 35% stake in Inenco in 2017 and held the opportunity to acquire the balance of the company at a later date. Throughout our two-year partnership, this team consistently exceeded our expectations, and we look forward to growing our business together for many years to come.  Inenco, is already one of Australasia's leading industrial distributors with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Singapore. In total annual sales of approximately $400 million. Inenco is an excellent strategic fit with motion in North America from a products and services perspective, and presents tremendous opportunities with our global suppliers and extensive and diverse customer base. Likewise, we expect to realize additional cost-related synergies associated with our automotive business in Australasia. So, we are excited to move forward with full ownership of this outstanding organization and we officially welcome Roger Jowett and the Inenco team to GPC. Now, we want to update you on our performance at S.P. Richards, our business products group. For the second quarter, total and comp sales for this business were down slightly. While business products has performed well for several quarters, we experience a bit of softening in our core office supply business in Q2, although our facilities and safety supply supplies business delivered solid results. FPS represents 35% of our total business products revenue and is the fastest growing segment in the industry, providing us with additional future growth opportunities. In addition, during the second quarter we operated well and we held our operating margin constant with last year. This bodes well for margin improvement as sales strengthen and we build on our position as the only independent national business products wholesaler in the U.S. So, that's a recap of our consolidated and business segment results for the second quarter of 2019. With that, I'll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will provide our updated outlook for 2019. With our second quarter total sales of $4.9 billion, representing a 2.3% increase and including 1.6 comparable sales growth, our gross margin in the quarter was 32.4%, compared to 31.6% in 2018 with the improvement in margin relating to several factors. Similar to the first quarter, the increase primarily reflects higher margins in our automotive and industrial businesses, due to the ongoing initiatives, including taking advantage of a global supplier presence, more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies, and favorable product mix. In addition, the increase in supplier incentives across our business segments also had a positive impact on gross margin. Our team has done an excellent job of improving our gross margin and for the balance of the year, we continue to expect our 2019 gross margin rate to remain relatively in line with our current run rate. This assumes continued inflation in the 1% to 2% range and consistent levels of volume incentives. The pricing environment has been relatively inflationary thus far in 2019. In automotive, price increases primarily reflect the impact of tariffs, while industrial and business products have seen increases associated with general inflations in areas such as raw material pricing, commodities, and supplier freight. Thus far, we have been successful in passing on the price increases to our customers to protect our gross margin overall. So, we continue to believe that the current levels of inflation have been a net positive to our results. We expect this to continue through the balance of 2019. Specific to tariffs, their impact in the second quarter as well as the six months relates to the 10% tariff previously implemented. By segment, the impact of tariffs on our sales in the second quarter were 1.2% for U.S. automotive, 0.3% for industrial, and 0.3% for business products. As mentioned before, we have maintained our gross margin related to the 10% tariffs and we expect to do the same as we incurred the 25% tariff impact going forward. As a reminder, 10% of our U.S. cost of goods sold is subject to this tariff, including 20% of our U.S. automotive cost of goods sold, and 9% of our business products cost of goods sold.  Turning to our SG&A, these expenses were $1.2 billion in the second quarter, which represents 24.7% of sales. These operating costs were up 6% from last year as a result of several factors, including the effect of rising cost in areas such as payroll, freight, IT and cyber security, as well as the loss of leverage on our expenses in Europe and business products due to the declines in their comparable sales for those businesses. As we have discussed in several of our past earnings calls, we have ongoing initiatives to offset the rising cost environment and to better leverage our expenses as we move forward. These include steps to more effectively integrate our acquisitions, facility consolidations, productivity solutions, and other initiatives to drive efficiencies across our operations. As Paul will cover later, we recognize the need to produce greater cost savings and we\u2019re developing additional plans to get that done. So, now let\u2019s discuss the results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the second quarter was $2.8 billion, up 1.4% from the prior year, and our operating profit of $228 million was down 6% with an operating margin at 8.2%, compared to 8.9% margin in the second quarter of 2018. So, while they continue to see improvement on our gross margin line, we were also impacted by rising costs, as well as the deleveraging of expenses in Europe, which accounts for more than half of the decline in our margin. As mentioned earlier, we are enhancing the initiatives to address our cost in the quarters ahead. Our industrial sales were $1.7 billion in the quarter, a solid 5% increase from Q2 of 2018. Our operating profit of 136 million is up another solid 9%, and operating margin improved to 8.1% from 7.8% last year with a 30-basis point increase due to gross margin expansions and the leveraging of expenses. The industrial businesses continue to operate well with 10 consecutive quarters of strong sales and operating results. Our business product revenues were $478 million, down 1% from the prior year. Operating profit was $21 million and 4.4% of sales, which is consistent with 2018. They are solid operating results as this business continues to stabilize. Our total company operating profit in the second quarter was 386 million, down 1.2% on a 2.3% sales increase and our operating profit margin was 7.8%, compared to 8.1% last year. We had net interest expense at 23 million in the second quarter, which was consistent with the first quarter, but down from the 26 million in the second quarter last year. Looking ahead, we\u2019re currently expecting net interest to be in the $97 million to $98 million range for the full-year, which is up from our previous estimate of $91 million to $93 million. This accounts for the new debt assumed for the PartsPoint and Inenco acquisitions. Our total amortization expense was $24 million for the second quarter, and for 2019 we are updating our full-year amortization to approximately $100 million from the previous $92 million, also due to our recent acquisitions. Our depreciation expense was $42 million in the second quarter and we continue to expect depreciation of $170 million to $180 million for the year. On a combined basis, we expect depreciation and amortization to be in the range of $270 million to $280 million for 2019. Continuing with this segment information presented in our press release, the other line, which primarily represents our corporate expense was $37 million in the second quarter, which includes $4 million in transaction and other costs, primarily related to the PartsPoint acquisition. Excluding these costs, our corporate expense was $33 million, which has improved slightly from 2018 when adjusted for the $9 million in transaction and other costs recorded last year. For 2019, we continue to expect our corporate expense to be in the $125 million to $135 million range. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 25.7%, which is an increase from the 24.4% rate in the prior year. This is primarily due to the non-deductible transaction, and other costs, as well as statute-related adjustments that are reported in these periods. For the full year, we continue to expect our 2019 tax rate to be approximately 25%. Now, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet, which remains strong and in excellent condition. Our accounts receivable of $2.8 billion is up 6% from the prior year. This compares to our 2.3% total sales increase and it also includes a 3.7% impact from our acquisitions, including PartsPoint, which was acquired in June. We remain very pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at June 30 was $3.8 billion, up 8% from June of last year. This increase primarily relates to the additional inventory that was acquired through the acquisitions over the last 12 months, which added 6.5%. In addition, the increase in inventory includes the impact of inflation, as well as tariffs. We remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Our accounts payable of $4.1 billion is up 6%, due mainly to the increase in purchasing volumes and to a lesser degree the benefit of improved payment terms with our key global partners. At June 30, our AP to inventory ratio stands at a 108%. Our total debt of $3.9 billion at June 30 is up from $3.4 billion at March 31, and this is due primarily to the additional private placement debt that we assume for the recent acquisitions of PartsPoint and Inenco. We entered into these agreements with favorable rates and maturity periods ranging from 5 to 15 years. At June 30, our average interest rate on our total outstanding debt stands at 2.5%, which has improved from 3.0% at June 30 last year. We remain comfortable with our current debt structure and have a strong balance sheet and the financial capacity to support our future growth initiatives and our ongoing priorities for effective capital allocation. Turning now into our cash flows, we have generated approximately $300 million in cash from operations thus far in 2019. For the full-year, we currently expect approximately $1 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow, which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million. So, we expect our cash flows to continue to support our ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, the dividend, as well as share repurchases. We have invested a $107 million in capital expenditures thus far in 2019, which is up from $65 million in 2018. This reflects our growing global platform and a planned increase in our investment in areas such as technology and productivity in our facilities. For the year, we continue to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $300 million. Our 2019 annual dividend of $3.05 was increased 6% from 2018 and is approximately 54% of our 2018 adjusted earnings, which is within our targeted payout ratio. 2019 marked our 63rd consecutive annual increase in the dividend paid to our shareholders and it\u2019s a record we are proud of. Regarding our share repurchase program, we continue to have 16.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have not made any purchases under the program in 2019 as we have been active with other investment opportunities such as the recent M&A activity and capital expenditures that were discussed in this call. So, now let\u2019s discuss our current outlook for 2019. In consideration of our results thus far in the year, our current growth plans and initiatives and the market conditions we see for this foreseeable future across our operations, which include the slowing global economy and continued softness we expect in Europe over the balance of the year, we are updating our full-year 2019 sales and earnings guidance. In addition, we took into account the recently added PartsPoint and Inenco acquisitions, as well as the impact of a strong U.S. dollar, which we continue to estimate as a 1% currency headwind for the full-year. Finally, our outlook accounts for one additional selling day in the third quarter relative to 2018 to make up for the one less selling day in the first quarter of 2019. With these factors in mind, we expect our full-year sales to increase 4.5% to 5.5%. This updated sales outlook represents a change from our previous guidance for a plus 3% to plus 4% sales increase, and it includes an approximate 2% sales contribution from the PartsPoint and Inenco acquisitions. As is customary, this guidance excludes the benefit of any future acquisitions. By business segment, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 5% for the automotive segment, which is improved from our previous guidance of plus 2.5% to plus 3.5%, due to an approximate 2% contribution from PartsPoint; plus 7% to plus 8% for the industrial segment, which is up from plus 5% to plus 6% previously, and this is inclusive of an approximate 3% sales contribution from Inenco; and essentially flat to down slightly for total sales for the Business Products segment. On the earnings side, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.42 to $5.52, which accounts for the transaction and other costs incurred through the first six months of 2019. We are updating our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to $5.65 to $5.75 from $5.75 to $5.90 previously. This represents a $0.15 to $0.20 change in earnings before an approximate $0.05 contribution from PartsPoint and the additional 65% investment in Inenco. As a reminder, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes any first half, as well as future transaction and other costs. So that completes our financial update and outlook for 2019. We enter the second half of the year committed to our initiatives to grow the business and improve our operating results. We also remain focused on further strengthening our balance sheet and generating strong cash flows to support an effective and meaningful capital allocation. Paul, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. With this quarter's challenges and the need to modify our full-year outlook, it\u2019d be easy to overlook our team\u2019s accomplishments, which include the following. We achieved record quarterly sales of $4.9 billion, including positive comp sales growth in our U.S., Canadian and Australian automotive businesses. We improved our gross margin significantly with a 91-basis point gain. Our industrial business continues to perform well with operating margins improved 30 basis points. We further stabilized our Business Products operating margin, which was unchanged from last year; and we expanded our global footprint with two large strategic acquisitions, PartsPoint Group in The Netherlands and Inenco in Australia. That said, we also thought it would be important to remind you of our multi-year efforts to optimize our portfolio and position the company for a sustained long-term growth. We spoke to this journey at our June 4 Investor Day and want to highlight a few key points for you now. First, we expanded our automotive footprint beyond North America and into Australasia six years ago. And this group has performed very well for us and added significant value. More recently, since 2017, we\u2019ve added 45 acquisitions to our portfolio, which have provided $3 billion in incremental revenues and positively contributed to both our automotive and industrial footprints. While the majority of these new businesses have represented strategic bolt-on types of acquisitions, we've all stepped out and taken advantage of more significant opportunities, including our entree into Europe in late 2017 via Alliance Automotive, which we have further expanded with key strategic acquisitions in 2018 and 2019, and effective this month, our industrial expansion into Australasia with the purchase of Inenco. And while our European operations performance has impacted our first half results, we believe the challenges for this business are transitory, and we remain 100% confident in the industry fundamentals and longer-term growth prospects for this group, as well as the value it will create as part of our portfolio. In addition to these expansionary initiatives, we have also taken steps to streamline our operations. In 2018, we consolidated our electrical business into motion industry to build a larger, stronger, and more cost-effective industrial business. Effective this year, we consolidated several automotive operations representing our in-house supply network in NAPA to a more efficient North American automotive supply chain. And finally, earlier this year, we divested of our legacy automotive business in Mexico Auto Todo to more effectively focus on the growth potential of our NAPA Mexico model established just a few years ago. Today, we go to market with a strong and cohesive automotive network and enhanced global industrial operation and a re-energized Business Products group. We remain confident in our overall strategy and the additional growth opportunities we continue to pursue across our global platform. Make no mistake; we are not satisfied with our overall results in the quarter. That said, we are confident the plans we are implementing will have a long-term positive impact on our cost structure. Our immediate focus is on the execution of our initiatives to control costs and improve our profitability. While this has been a consistent theme for us throughout our transformation process, and we have had some success through our investments in technology and automotive supply and industrial realignments, we have yet to fully realize the savings we need to outpace the pressures of rising cost and the increase in the spend for necessary investments. So, to this end, we are accelerating our ongoing cost savings plans and developing aggressive expense reduction initiatives to more effectively address our cost structure, drive meaningful savings and ultimately deliver incremental value. The senior leaders across our business and corporate office have been tasked with this mission, and we will be held accountable to work together to execute on plans to eliminate costs, as well as standardize and automate processes while ultimately enhancing our productivity to further support our ongoing growth. As examples, through our early efforts, we have identified opportunities to restructure and consolidate several functional areas and facilities, reducing both personnel and occupancy cost such that we can operate more efficiently and at a lower cost. Clearly, the successful execution of these and other cost initiatives will require some heavy lifting and the focus of our entire organization. In addition to these initiatives, we will also be working to aggressively drive incremental revenue growth capturing a greater share of wallet with our existing customers, securing new business opportunities, driving our digital strategy, and finally, securing additional bolt-on acquisitions will all play a part in delivering an improved topline performance. We have a highly capable management team and anticipate delivering improved results and creating value for our shareholders. We will update the investment community on our action plans and progress in our third quarter earnings call. Thank you for listening, and with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions. Operator : Great, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question here is from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Daniel Imbro : Wanted to start actually with a clarifier, Paul. I may have missed it in the prepared remarks, but could you just share what were European overall comp sales during the second quarter? Did you guys share that in the prepared remarks? Paul Donahue : Daniel, the comps out of Europe, if you recall Q1, we were down slightly in Europe and in Q2 that deceleration \u2013 really it was amplified and our comps in Europe were down closer to 7% to 8% in the quarter. Daniel Imbro : Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just digging into that a little bit deeper, are there certain geographies that are meaningfully weaker than others? Obviously, you noted that Benelux is more resilient. And then, just within that we didn't get much of a winter, but we did get some recent extremely heat, did that drive any uptick? Or how was the cadence through 2Q across Europe? Paul Donahue : Yes. That\u2019s a great question, Daniel, and as you know, our three primary markets are France, the UK, and Germany. We\u2019ve just entered Benelux, we\u2019re also in Poland. We\u2019ve seen Benelux and Poland have largely escaped some of the downturn we've seen in France, UK, and Germany. The biggest challenge for us in Q2 was France followed by the UK. Germany actually bounced back in Q2. They had a soft first quarter, but actually showed a slight increase in Q2. And I would also \u2013 you commented on the recent warmer temps, record high temps in Europe, and what we\u2019ve seen out of the blocks in July and its early, Daniel, but we have seen better sales performance in the month of July and we would attribute some of that certainly to the extreme heat that we've seen in our markets. Daniel Imbro : Great, thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. Paul Donahue : Welcome. Daniel Imbro : And then, last one for me. Just on the U.S. auto side, you know, weather you noted was disruptive given the rain. Could you maybe quantify what kind of headwinds that was to your business here in the U.S.? Paul Donahue : Yes. It's hard to say \u2013 to pinpoint exactly, Daniel, but look, I think Q2 was just one more reminder for all of us that, you know, the impact that mother nature can have on our business. We were \u2013 if you look at the cadence of the quarter, we were \u2013 in the U.S. automotive, we were up slightly in April. May was our most difficult month, and certainly when you look at the weather patterns, May was the most challenging weather-related month. It was awfully wet, still cold. And then, we bounced back in June with a much stronger June. So, hard to pinpoint exactly, but we absolutely know it had an impact. Daniel Imbro : Great. Thanks so much guys, and best of luck. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. If I can just follow up on the auto part retail comment in question earlier, I was wondering if you could maybe characterize the competitive environment currently just now that we\u2019re a few months in now with the tariffs, are you seeing your competitors [past prices] as well? Paul Donahue : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. We are \u2013 and I'm assuming you're referencing our U.S. automotive business. Kate McShane : Yes, U.S. Paul Donahue : Yes, and look, the environment is still very same. We have seen our competitors passing along tariff-related increases much like we have. So, we have not seen any serious disruption in the automotive aftermarket here in the U.S. So, you know, we\u2019re continuing to monitor very closely, but at this point, I think everybody has passed along the increases. Kate McShane : Okay, thank you. And then, my second question unrelated, I think on the last quarterly call you hosted you were talking about working capital improvement that was starting this year for Europe because you were putting supply chain programs in place. And I just wondered if you could update us on where you are with that and what it contributed in the quarter? Carol Yancey : Yes. So, we did have \u2013 we continue to actually perform quite well. The synergy targets we put in place. We bought Europe a year and a half ago. Those include both procurement synergies and working capital synergies that were right on track for that with working capital being delivered. Having said that, [lot of the way] these terms come in and we\u2019ve got these terms.  While they are negotiated globally, we could see it benefit in the U.S. as it relates to the European suppliers as well. So, we know we have further benefit coming in the second half and that\u2019s contemplated in our guidance. So, Q2 you did necessarily see much of an impact, but we have implied for improvement both in global automotive, including Europe and North America as well, honestly as our industrial business for the second half and that\u2019s contemplated in our guidance. Kate McShane : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question here is from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys, how are you? Paul Donahue : Good morning. Scot Ciccarelli : So, Paul, I guess, I just want to understand kind of the cadence a little bit better, and this is specifically on the U.S. auto side, if April was up just slightly, I\u2019d probably interrupt that, I don\u2019t know, 1% to 2%. I would also assume May was down a couple of points just given how wet it was and what we know it does to the business to get to a 3% comp for the quarter should we assume June was up at least in the mid-single digit range. Paul Donahue : Absolutely Scot, you\u2019re spot on with your assumptions. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay, got it. Do you attribute that to anything, the weather cadence or is there something else that may have happened just so we can kind of understand if there is another influence on that factor? Paul Donahue : Well, if you go back to my prepared comment Scot, what we saw in the quarter, as we saw in Q1 as well is our DIFM, our commercial business in solid. We continue the good momentum we had in Q1 in our NAPA AutoCare business. We believe we\u2019re grabbing greater share of wallet with our key AutoCare customers. So that business as mentioned in my prepared remarks we\u2019re very pleased with our major account business is positive, which is certainly an improvement over where we were last year. If you think about the impact of the weather Scot, certainly in the month of May that\u2019s probably more, we were more impact on our retail side than our commercial business. Scot Ciccarelli : And was the gap between DIY and commercial wider this quarter than it has been in recent quarters? Paul Donahue : Yes, it was. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay, thanks guys. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome. Carol Yancey : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Chris Horvers : Thanks, good morning everybody. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Chris. Chris Horvers : Carol, can you break down the EPS guide change a little bit further? I get the $0.5 for the acquisitions, but you are just thinking about the core emotion business, the core NAPA business, in particularly in the U.S., first is Europe. How did you change the underlying guide in the core businesses ex the acquisitions? Is it effectively lowering for European losses, but at the same time it looks like emotions you know sales outlook is a little lighter for the year considering the acquisition? So, if you could talk us through that that would be really helpful. Carol Yancey : Sure, I\u2019m happy to. So, starting with automotive first, implied in our Q1 comp, we did moderate probably a half a point or so in Q2. That is in part based on again the U.S. comp was strong at 3%, they were 3.5% for Q1. Europe as Paul mentioned, they are running down mid-single digits through the first half. So, we lowered a bit for Europe. We lowered small amount for U.S. and quite honestly, we have seen some weakness in Australasia. So, we looked at that business more so on their top line. We had a little bit there. So, implied in that automotive there is a slightly lower comp that went into our guidance and then you\u2019re spot on for industrial as well.  What industrial is seeing is that maybe this happened a little sooner. The signals are definitely mixed, but where we had implied comp, you know of maybe 3 to 4 in Q1, we\u2019re looking at more 2 to 3 right now, that is taken into account, the slowing business in our electrical specialties group that we called out in Paul\u2019s comment, a lot of that is due to copper pricing and some of their customer mix, but again we felt it was appropriate to lower just a bit for industrial and then we do see a bit of moderation in some of our operating margins headwinds in the second half, so that was factored in as well. So, that\u2019s kind of walk through on the guidance. Chris Horvers : Just a couple of questions follow here. So, for the U.S., the kick down for the sort of implied U.S. comp from here, was that solely because of 2Q or did you change your back half outlook? Carol Yancey : Probably more, a little bit of Q2, but honestly it was very transitory as Paul mentioned. I mean this was weather in Q2 and transitory. We still feel good about our commercial business and a lot of the factors, so really more of a Q2. We are not seeing anything else right now that would give us concern in the second half. Paul Donahue : Chris, just a tag team on that a little bit. You know, you look at our core for GPC, it\u2019s certainly North American automotive and industrial and we feel good about both of those key business and both add a good first half of the year. We expected everybody has been calling for a significant slow-down on our industrial business in the second of the year and if you follow all the metrics, whether it\u2019s PMI, which has declined significantly from January to June, but then there was a manufacturing number that came out earlier this week, which was very positive. So, you\u2019re getting mixed signals on the industrial side. So, we\u2019re being a bit cautious, but our motion business is hanging in there and when you look across industrial, I mean you\u2019re looking at 34 straight months of growth in that world. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about our two key and core businesses. Carol Yancey : One final thing, I would just say the operating margin decline for Europe is probably more of a stand out than some of the slight modifications in the U.S. comp or the industrial comp. Chris Horvers : Just to clarify that, is European auto \u2013 could you say it\u2019s operating income loss currently? Carol Yancey : No, just to be clear, and we talked about this in Q1, the margin decline in automotive margins, we said in Q1, was primarily as a result of Europe with them comping down 1%. To their credit, they in March took action plans and set out full plan for all their countries, and they\u2019re starting to make a lot of progress on those plants, but what happened in Q2 was such \u2013 so much more pronounced that it\u2019s really hard for them to, when you are comping down at a higher, as Paul mentioned 7% or 8%, whatever plans you had in place, it\u2019s difficult to see the improvement. We do see some of that coming in the second half or some moderation, so when you look at automotive margins in Q2, we said more than half, it was probably 50 basis points of the 70 basis point decline and again we would expect to see that moderate with the plans they have in place. The teams have done some good job, looking at some consolidation of facilities, looking at some of their head count and some of their restructuring that they\u2019re doing and they\u2019ve got close attention on all these areas. So, they are definitely positive over prior year, it\u2019s just the leverage issue with the poor sales decline. Chris Horvers : Understood and one last one, just on a follow-up on the tariff question earlier. So, going to 25% now presumably those price increases are passing through now, so is the behavior the same they seem to be passed on very quickly by you and your peers back in September, call it of last year, is the 25 \u2013 is there any difference to like, is it being passed on more hesitantly and then how do you think about what maybe the inflation outlook will be for the industry given its move from 10% to 25% for the U.S. NAPA business? Carol Yancey : Yes, it is a great question. As we kind of look ahead, I think as we, as you spoke to the 25% tariff, we do believe and we know and we\u2019ve already done \u2013 have passed those along in many of our businesses and product lines, those went into effect right away, not seeing any issues with passing them along, but having said that our business had been pursuing alternative sourcing as we look to move purchases outside of China, be it Malaysia, India, Vietnam, Mexico, are picking up capacity. In addition, our Chinese sources are also moving some of their capacity from China and that\u2019s going on as well. So, when we look at the full-year, we will have a more pronounced effect for tariffs in the second half that will be passed through. We expect second half to be approximately 2% for automotive and I think we were 1.2 in the first half. So that will get us to probably a point and a half full-year tariff/inflation for automotive. For business products and office products, it\u2019s going to be something less; it will probably be a half a point for the full-year on tariffs, but their inflation, which includes raw materials, commodities, supplier freight, their inflation will be more like 2% on a full-year basis. Chris Horvers : That\u2019s super helpful. Best of luck. Thank you. Paul Donahue : Alright, thanks Chris. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Seth. Carol Yancey : Good morning, Seth. Seth Basham : My first question is to close the loop on the U.S. auto comp trends. You know it saw a nice strengthening in July, you spoke to material improvement in Europe in \u2013 I mean you spoke to material improvement in Europe in July, but do you also see a further acceleration or consistent mid-single digit type comp growth in the U.S. in July today? Paul Donahue : It\u2019s early, yes, Seth. But certainly, I would tell you that the hot, hot temps that we are seeing across the U.S. right now is going to be a real boost for our business. If you think about the NAPA business, we do a significant chunk of business up in the Midwest Central, which will get [I\u2019m sure] somewhere someone will ask about regionality and our trends. Despite all the wet weather, the Midwest Central was our strongest performing business in the quarter. We do a lot of business with farmers and agriculture, and you know, many of these farmers are just now getting out in the field. So, this hot weather will help and we expect to see a boost in our topline in U.S. automotive in Q3. Seth Basham : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Any other callouts from our regional performance standpoint for the quarter? Paul Donahue : Yes. So, I mentioned central part of the U.S., Midwest, upper Midwest, but I\u2019m also very pleased to see some strengthening performance in the South, both in the Southwest part of the country, as well as the Southeastern part of the country, both. But we have a \u2013 we track [eight] geographical regions except those four would be at the top of the list. Seth Basham : Fair enough. And turning to margins for the auto business in the U.S., you saw a decline there, I guess, implied by your comments, what's driving that decline? What are you doing to control costs in the U.S. to alleviate that pressure? Carol Yancey : Yes. And I would mention the other basic point decline in automotive margin is in part Canada and Australasia\u2019s automotive margins and I would tell it\u2019s a little bit of the slowing that we talked about in Australasia. Some of it is timing and definitely expect to see some improvement in the second half for both of those businesses. U.S. was slightly down. It was very minor, so we are really almost running flat U.S. automotive margins, and remember, we\u2019re comping at 3.2% for the six months and we\u2019re getting pretty good leverage, flattish operating margins out of that. But having said that, we\u2019re not going to sit and say that we\u2019re satisfied and we certainly want to improve our SG&A performance. So, there's a number of things that that group is looking at. You know specifically, they are looking at it from a North American automotive standpoint. Paul mentioned facilities and as we look for facilities, its consolidation and rationalization and a number of facilities with automation. In the last six months, we\u2019ve got several facilities both in Canada and the U.S. with [goods to person] conveyor mechanism, [vertical less] modules, things like that mechanized orders that we\u2019re using. Additionally, Paul mentioned functional areas, so think about IT technology, we\u2019re really looking at a digital transformation of our IT infrastructure. So, we can best optimize things like the number of data centers we have, leveraging the cloud, new technologies and networking, back office functions, robotics, sales organizations, leadership, so a number of things that we\u2019re working on as a group. Paul Donahue : And Seth, I just would tag team on Carol\u2019s comments, you know, you would ask this question of us at our Invest Day as well, and I would tell you that our teams have been really hard at work to reduce our overall cost structure at GPC. We\u2019re \u2013 as Carol mentioned, we\u2019re reviewing every aspect of our business. What I would tell you is during our Q3 call and presentation, we\u2019ll be in a much better position to begin to unveil some of those more detailed plans for you. Seth Basham : Wonderful. Thanks a lot. I look forward to it. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question if from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Bret Jordan : Most of them have been asked, but a couple of cleanups, I guess. The other four regions, could you tell us how the East, Northeast, West and Northwest did? Paul Donahue : Yes. Happy to, Bret. The \u2013 you know, the \u2013 most of those guys are in line. Where we looked at our comps, most of our \u2013 most of our regions were right in between, you know, on the low side of, you know, 1 to 2 and on the high side up to 4.5% or so. But, you know, the \u2013 where we see a bit more challenges are West, and I already mentioned the strength we\u2019re seeing in the Midwest Central Southern parts of the \u2013 Southern parts of the country as well. The Northeast despite really bad weather performed just fine and as did the Mid-Atlantic. So, not a huge \u2013 you know, sometimes we see really huge disparity amongst the regions, but what I would tell you \u2013 that kind of that range narrowed this quarter. The other thing I would mention, Bret, that we did see across all of our divisions is strengthening in our DIFM business and that was consistent amongst all of our \u2013 all of our regions, which we are \u2013 I mean look, that\u2019s our bread-and-butter and we\u2019re really encouraged to see some of the DIFM initiatives. Our teams have been working so hard on really begin to take hold. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then I guess as we\u2019re looking at Europe, and you\u2019ve call out weather and the economy, I guess could you sort of weight the impact of weather versus the economy and the softness there? And obviously as we get further from winter, have we sort of \u2013 have we regionally skewed the performance where weather is less impactful, but some economies are more impactful? Paul Donahue : You know \u2013 so, Bret, we talked about that a little bit on the last call and we had the question earlier about the U.S. weather impact. You know, Bret, it\u2019s really hard to pinpoint exactly. We do know it\u2019s a significant factor. If you back to a year ago, certainly in the UK, they had one of their coldest winters on record followed this year by one of the warmest winters on record. So, it had a significant impact. It\u2019s very difficult to pinpoint an exact number, but I would tell you that with the records heat that we've seen over the last number of weeks, we are seeing an uptick in the business and that\u2019s got us feeling better about our back half prospects in the key markets in which we compete. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome, Bret. Operator : Your next question is from Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Suzuki : Hi, thank you. Just a longer-term question on Europe because you just made another acquisition there, and there's \u2013 you know even though you\u2019ve seen some perhaps temporary weakness. Just curious how much of that weakness you think is going to continue to impact your overall results for more than a couple of quarters? And, you know, what the vehicle fleet dynamics are that make it an attractive market for you to be in long-term? Paul Donahue : Yes. Great question, Liz. We\u2019re still very bullish on the European aftermarket and hence the additional acquisitions that you\u2019ve seen and read about over the last number of weeks. You know if we look at those individually, the one that we just announced yesterday, Todd. Todd is a very strong, heavy-duty truck part supplier in France. They have the 30 plus locations. The combination of Todd along with our existing heavy-duty footprint that we have in France will position us as the Number 1 player. And we\u2019ve seen our heavy-duty business hold up well across all of Europe despite, you know, the slowdown that we\u2019re seeing in the light vehicle market.  So, we feel good about the acquisition of Todd. We feel good about our acquisition of PartsPoint, which is, you know, based in the Netherlands and in Belgium is their stronghold. And again, they've not been as impacted as the \u2013 some of the other markets with the slowdown, and, you know, as we look at the European market and the vehicle [part of it], the vehicle part that is similar in size to the U.S., the age demographics are similar. It is incredibly fragmented aftermarket across Europe and we have not lost our excitement about that marketplace for the long term and we think we will be just fine. The issues we are faced with right now, less we believe are largely transitory and we\u2019ll get past them as we go through the second half of the year. Carol Yancey : And Liz one other thing about the margin. The team has done a tremendous job and Europe is very impactful from a global procurement synergy. So, when you look at our gross margin results and the overall improvement in margin and where we are tracking to our synergies with Europe, again that volume is impactful for us, it\u2019s really the opportunities they have with some SG&A as they work through this core sales decline. So, longer-term we see that working its way out. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And just one more quick one. What age do vehicles typically enter your addressable market in Europe? Is it similar to the U.S. or is the sweet spot a little bit different? Paul Donahue : No, it\u2019s similar Liz. When the vehicles are going out of warranty and those warranties are very similar in Europe as they are in the U.S. The other thing I would mention about, the European market is there is very little to almost no retail business. So, DIFM really rules the aftermarket in European. So, very similar to the U.S., I would mention, now that we\u2019re on the European market, one of the initiatives that will be launched in the second half of the year is to launch our NAPA private brand in Europe and we\u2019ve got plans in place to launch it in the UK in three key product categories, and we think that\u2019s going to give our team a real boost in the second half of the year. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. Thanks very much. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Montani from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to add some extra clarity if I could around the U.S. comp trajectory, I\u2019m sorry if I had missed this, but did you provide with the overall commercial and then DIY comps were in the quarter? Paul Donahue : We did not provide that Mike for the quarter. I would tell you that both DIFM and DIY were positive and I would also tell you that DIFM significantly outperformed our DIY business in the quarter. Michael Montani : Okay, and then if I heard correctly, I think you said there was a 3% U.S. comp in auto, but then more like a 2.3% total growth there, was there store closures or other rationalization there that could have caused that? Paul Donahue : Yes and that was a good catch, much likely we talked about it in the first quarter and I guess it\u2019s a little unusual to see comps outpacing total, but that was the case in Q2 and you\u2019re right, our total U.S. comp were up 3% and what we\u2019re pleased with Mike that\u2019s our fourth consecutive quarter of 3% plus comp. We did have store closures that were up against, we had I believe about 40 plus that were not in our mix in 2019, but that\u2019s an ongoing part our business, and where we have underperforming stores whether they are company owned or independent owned, we\u2019re going to move and that\u2019s the necessary part of the business. I would tell you that we see that, even though that was a factor in Q1 and Q2, we see that trend really slowing in the second half of the year. Michael Montani : Thanks. And then if I could on traffic and ticket, I heard 1.2% from tariffs, was the ticket basically the same so that traffic was up over 1.5% to drive this through the year? Paul Donahue : Well what I would tell you Mike is that, again we saw our average basket and average ticket was up significantly year-over-year, close to 4%, up year-over-year; unfortunately, what we saw this quarter, which was a bit of reversals over the last 2 or 3 quarters is we saw our foot traffic down just a bit, and honestly we attribute that to some of the inclement weather that we saw, you know when you have as much rain as we saw in late April and May even into early June, that\u2019s going to \u2013 unfortunately it\u2019s going to impact the foot traffic we see in our stores and so that was an impact in Q2. Michael Montani : The last thing I had was on the U.S. EBIT margin if I heard correctly for automotive was maybe down slightly even with that 3.2 comp, and so I was just trying to reconcile the because with the total company gross is up 85 bips plus and I think automotive was one of the stronger ones, if you can just help us understand and parse that out? Carol Yancey : Yes. So, again, we\u2019ve talked about, and you\u2019re right, the U.S. automotive team has done a terrific job on the gross margin and we are really pleased in this inflationary and tariff environment to be able to protect and maintain our gross margin percentage pass those through, and also have this quarter improvement in gross margin.  The things we talked about in SG&A and some of it I call out is our increased level of investment, these things that we\u2019re doing with facilities and automation and technology, digital investment, pricing investments you see our elevated CapEx, we\u2019ve talked about IT spend, cyber security, those things are all weighing on their SG&A. We actually, when we look at payroll and freight, where we were a year ago with payroll and freight is, I mean, I think I remember this call a year ago, pay roll was up 6% in year-to-date and year ago freight was up low double digits. They are sitting more like 2% to 3% in payroll and 6% to 7% for freight. So, those things have moderated and that\u2019s helped, but we still have the cost of some of these investments that is in our SG&A. So, they should be second half again if comps continue around 3%, we should see that be similar and hopefully maybe a bit better in the second half. Michael Montani : Great. Thanks so much. Paul Donahue : Thanks Michael. Operator : Our next question here is from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted the part you left off on, are you assuming 3% in the back half? Wasn't sure that was a good tongue slip or something? Carol Yancey : U.S. comps? Chris Bottiglieri : Yes. Carol Yancey : That\u2019s fair, yes. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I wanted to dig in on margins a little bit. In Europe, it\u2019s roughly 20% of your business that\u2019s only 50 basis point decline, and that would imply European margins were down 250 bips. If I recall the accounting and business structure in France is a little bit different from the rest of Europe. So, it sounds like a lot better than 200 basis points decline last quarter given that the weakening macro environment is on Q2. Let\u2019s try to understand if France was a disproportionate impact of that margin decline, if any way you can contextualize that would be helpful? Carol Yancey : Yes. I mean, we're not going to get into exact specifics on that, but you heard Paul say, France was one of the toughest markets in Q2, and from a number of factors in the quarter that was a difficult market and it was a difficult comp for them. Again, that team has a number of things in place that they\u2019re looking at and we should hope to see some of those things take effect. We do think, and we\u2019ve modelled for to this, that what we saw in the first half of the year, the impact on margins does moderate in the second half and that\u2019s because of some of the things that are putting in place, but France was a disproportionate number. Chris Bottiglieri : That's helpful. And then free cash flow, I think you kind of touched this on the prepared comments, but it looks like you cut the free cash flow guide at $100 million. The EPS cut was I know just backing into [with price or EBITDA] seems a lot less. So, trying to get a sense as CapEx going up relative to the plan, is it all working capital, are there more like cash non-GAAP items driving that, just any way you can contextualize the cut of free cash flow would be helpful? Carol Yancey : Yes. So, I think, I mean you\u2019re right. We modified it slightly, maybe around 100 million. I would say it\u2019s more around working capital. The timing of when these terms come. So, let's say we have terms with our supplier that are 180 days and then we negotiate it to be 240 days or we negotiate to 360, we don't see that for another six months. So, the timing of some of the working capital is what went into that. So that was really \u2013 and there were some slight changes in some of the other categories, but mostly working capital. CapEx, we looked at $300 million, which is what it's been the whole time. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. And then final one is like positive question. This industry is historically very dissensitive, a cyclical. I understand like initially, there's economic weakness in Europe and a lot of other factors that are transitory that you're dealing with. But is there any way to look at your data internally and tell you how did the European business perform on a same branch basis, compared to how your U.S. business performed in the last downturn? Just trying to get a sense for like does this get better or soon? Or this because it's defensive and like this cyclicality that we're seeing today maybe goes away even if European growth kind of stays where it is. Any way to contextualize, that would be helpful? Paul Donahue : Yes. Chris, I'll take a shot at it. Look, we do believe it's going to get better. The European marketplace, as I mentioned to an earlier question is very similar in nature. The aftermarket is very similar in nature to the U.S. aftermarket. And I think what we saw, which was a bit unprecedented in Q2, as we talk to our senior management team, who you've met, Chris, they've been running that business for 30 years in Europe and what they saw in Q2, they have not seen in all the time they've been running that business. It was a confluence of events. Certainly, the slowdown in the economy. Some of the geopolitical issues with Yellow Vests and disruptions around that coupled with an incredibly mild winter and all of those factors unfortunately hit us at once and led to a really soft quarter for the team. We don't see that as a long-term situation, and certainly, we'll \u2013 we're certainly expecting that to improve in the second half of the year and well into 2020. Carol Yancey : And I think one final thing. We think we will see improvements from their cost initiatives and as well as the integration of their acquisitions, too, as we look ahead, which will help offset this. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Makes sense. Alright, thank you for the time. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Chris. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments. Carol Yancey : We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's call. We appreciate your support and interest in Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to talking to you at our Q3 call. Thank you, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Genuine Parts Company. Thank you. You may begin. Sid Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company third quarter 2019 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2019. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now I will turn the call over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid. And let me add my welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our third quarter 2019 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance, and then cover the highlights across our businesses. Carol Yancey will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for the full year. After that, we will open the call to your questions. So to recap, our third quarter performance across our global platform. We are pleased to set a quarterly sales record achieving the $5 billion quarterly sales mark for the first time in our company's history. This represents a 6.2% sales increase from Q3 of 2018 and follows a 2.3% total sales increase last quarter with the improvement driven by a 1.2% comp sales increase and a 6.7% benefit from strategic acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 1.7% headwind from foreign currency translation and the decline in sales related to the Auto Todo divestment earlier in the year. Net income in the third quarter was $227 million and earnings per share were $1.56, excluding the impact of transaction and other cost and income related to acquisitions and divestments, adjusted net income was $219 million or $1.50 per share. This compares to $1.48 reported in the third quarter of last year. Our teams were active this quarter executing our strategy to further optimize our portfolio. This included actions to complete the Inenco industrial acquisition and Australasia, the sale of EIS and the investment in Sparesbox Australia's leading online automotive and accessories business. We made significant progress in several areas, this quarter and we are excited for the growth opportunities we see ahead. We will cover each of these areas as we review our business segments. Our global automotive sales, which represented 56% of our total revenues were up 5.3% from last year and improved from 1.4% in Q2, comparable sales were up 1.8%, which was improved from the 1.3% in Q2 and acquisitions added another 6.5% of sales. This growth was partially offset by an approximately 2% unfavorable foreign currency translation and a 1% impact from the sale of the Auto total business in Mexico. In our North American operations, U.S. automotive sales were up 2.5% on a comp basis and our Canadian Automotive business posted 3.8% sales comps. We remain confident in the ongoing strength of the North American automotive aftermarket and expect these markets to gain positive momentum over the balance of the year and well into 2020. For the second consecutive quarter, we had positive sales growth with both our commercial and retail customers with sales to the DIFM segment performing very well and outpacing our DIY sales. Among our DIFM customer segments, sales to our NAPA AutoCare Center customers continue to outperform our overall commercial sales growth. This customer group represents approximately 18,000 independent repair shops in the U.S. and another 2,000 in Canada. So obviously a very key segment to us. We were also pleased to see stronger growth with our major account customers with sales increases in each of our categories including our fleet and government customers, national tire centers, regional accounts and OE dealers. Now turning to our retail segment, while our team generated a positive revenue increase in the quarter, we have experienced a few headwinds in this segment of our business. We believe this reflects a combination of lapping strong comps associated with our impact store rollout in 2018, a continued slowing of our transaction count, which we have seen across the industry and finally, timing related to major promotional events. Our team has launched a series of initiatives, which we expect to improve this trend in the quarters ahead, while Carol will provide more financial details later, it's worth adding that both our U.S. and Canadian businesses delivered improved profitability and strong margins in the quarter. So a solid quarter for our North American automotive operations and we expect to continue to build on this positive momentum. In Europe, we continue to operate in a challenging sales environment although we are pleased to report an improvement in our core sales performance relative to the second quarter. Overall, our sales comps were down mid-single digits, an improvement from the high single-digit decline in Q2. Across our geographical regions, we saw a significant improvement in our largest market, France, which posted a slight increase in the quarter. Germany was down slightly while the UK was our most challenged region as it continues to feel the effect of Brexit along with tough comps fueled by a series of one-time events in 2018. The UK labor market remains strong despite a decline in employment in Q3 while domestic growth is showing signs of slowing and overall business sentiment is lumping. That said, the news coming out of the UK this past week is somewhat encouraging and we remain hopeful the UK, and European Union can reach an agreement sooner or rather than later. The AAG team has made progress in executing on their sales and cost savings plans and we believe we are beginning to see the impact on our business, both on the revenue and cost side of the ledger. Specifically related to sales one key initiative to highlight would be the Q3, Q4 rollout of the NAPA brand across several product categories. We believe the introduction of a quality private label offering will further distinguish our European business from the competition and provide incremental growth opportunities for us. As it relates to cost savings, our efforts thus far are having a positive impact on our European operating profits and we expect to generate additional expense reductions in the periods ahead. In addition, we also made progress with our European M&A strategy during the quarter. We continue to integrate the PartsPoint acquisition, which closed on June 1st with our overall European business and this group performed according to plan. Likewise, we closed on the Todd acquisition in France on October 1st. This strategic acquisition positions us as the market leader in the heavy-duty segment across the French market. As a reminder PartsPoint and Todd are expected to add $330 million and $85 million in annual revenues. So despite current market conditions, we see many good things taking shape in our European business, and we remain committed to our growth and integration plans for this important segment of our Automotive operations. Now turning to Australia and New Zealand, our team continues to outperform the market with solid comp sales growth of 4.2% for the quarter. This represents our strongest core sales growth in 2019 despite more challenging economic conditions across the region. We were also pleased to complete our full -- our first full quarter with our 87% investment in Sparesbox which closed on July 1. As a reminder Sparesbox is Australia's leading online automotive parts and accessories business and while not material to our financial results, this partnership serves to enhance our understanding of the digital marketplace and grow our digital sales capabilities in Australasia, and potentially across all of our global operations. So that's a review of our global automotive business and now we will turn to our industrial business. Our Global Industrial Parts Group continues to push further with our portfolio optimization initiatives with the closing of the Inenco acquisition on July 1 and the sale of EIS on September 30. We will address both transaction shortly, but overall this group had a solid quarter with sales of $1.7 billion, up 9.9%, including an approximately 1% comp sales increase and a 9% benefit from acquisitions. This group also improve their operating margin by 30 basis points for the second consecutive quarter and 50 basis points if we exclude EIS. So we are pleased with the continued progress in our Industrial business. The softness we have seen in our top line growth is not unexpected given the overall slowdown we have seen in the industrial economy. This has translated to mixed results across our product and industry sector sales with eight of our 14 product categories and seven of 12 industries positive in the third quarter. With the slowing U.S. manufacturing trends the Motion team continues to look for strategic tuck-in acquisitions as part of its overall growth strategy and effective October 1 acquired the fluid power house headquartered in Ontario, Canada. FPA which is a full service fluid power distributor with four locations and projected annual sales of $20 million. Our Industrial business in Canada has been growing at a high single-digit pace or better for 11 consecutive quarters and we are excited to bolster their position in the Fluid Power segment. We have also further diversified our industrial footprint with the entry into Australasia. We were pleased to close on the Inenco acquisition and Australasia on July 1 and they have hit the ground running. Inenco is a leading industrial distributor in this region with operations in Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia, and this business performed very well in the quarter, providing accretive sales and profitability. We continue to believe that Inenco was an excellent strategic fit with Motion in North America and presents tremendous opportunities for global industrial growth. Finally, during the third quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to sell the Electrical Specialties Group of Motion Industries and this transaction ultimately closed on September 30, 2019. As background, we had determined that this was in the best interest of the company given its lower growth and lower margin profile relative to our core industrial operations. We were very pleased to complete the sale of this business and take another step forward in our strategy to optimize our portfolio and best position GPC for sustainable long-term growth. So now let's discuss S.P. Richards, our Business Products Group. For the third quarter, comp sales for this business were down approximately 1%. This sales decreased primarily reflects the slower sales in our core office supplies and technology categories as well as slower sales with our National Accounts Group. In contrast, our facilities and safety supplies business delivered another quarter of solid results and we expect continued growth from this category in the quarters ahead. Despite the softness in the top line, the BPG team has stabilized its operations with improved profitability and a 40 basis point year-over-year improvement in operating margin for the quarter. This is significant progress and especially impressive given a devastating fire that occurred at our Atlanta DC at head office in mid-July. First, we want to say how pleased we are to report then no one was injured during this unfortunate event. Second, our team was well prepared with an effective business continuity plan enabling them to get back up and operational in a matter of days. We are proud of our team for their attention to safety and servicing our customers under very difficult circumstances. So that's a recap of our consolidated and business segment results in the third quarter of 2019. But before I turning it over to Carol for her remarks. We wanted to update you on our action plans and progress in accelerating our ongoing cost savings plans and developing aggressive expense reduction initiatives. These efforts are designed to more effectively address our cost structure, drive meaningful savings and deliver incremental value. So today, we are pleased to announce that we have plans in place to generate annualized savings of $100 million by the end of 2020. And as Carol will discuss later these are meaningful cost reductions that will help drive operating margin expansion in the years to come. Our team is committed to this mission and excited to work together to achieve these savings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Carol. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then provide you with our updated outlook for 2019. With our third quarter total sales of $5 billion representing a 6.2% increase, our gross margin for the quarter was 32.4% compared to 31.4% in 2018 with the improvement in margin relating to several factors. These include more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies, favorable product mix and the benefit of higher supplier incentives. In addition, the PartsPoint and Inenco businesses have higher gross margin profiles. These factors drove improved gross margins in all three of our business segments and we continue to expect our 2019 gross margin rate to remain relatively in line with our current run rate. The pricing environment across all three of our segments has been relatively in place scenario thus far in 2019. In automotive, the price increase is primarily related to the impact of tariffs, while Industrial and Business Products has seen increases associated with general inflation in areas such as raw material pricing, commodities and supplier freight. Thus far we have been successful in passing on the price increases to our customers to protect our gross margins. So we continue to believe that the current levels of inflation have been a net positive to our results and we expect this to continue through the balance of 2019. Specific to tariffs their impact in the third quarter primarily reflects the 25% tariff on List 1, 2, 3 items, although business products was also impacted by the 15% tariff on the List 4A items which was effective September 1. With this in mind, the impact of tariffs on our Q3 sales was approximately 2% for U.S. automotive immaterial for industrial and approximately 1% for business products. We would add that the tariffs have had no impact on our gross margins. Turning to our SG&A. These expenses were $1.3 billion in the third quarter, up 13.5% from last year and 25.3% of sales. Our SG&A expenses continue to be impacted by the effect of rising costs in areas such as payroll freight and delivery, IT, and cyber security, as well as ongoing investments to improve our efficiencies and productivity. The PartsPoint and Inenco businesses also have a higher SG&A profile, and this was a factor in the increase. In addition, we are seeing the deleveraging of expenses due to slower comparable sales growth in certain operations. As Paul mentioned earlier, we've been enhancing our initiatives and intensifying our efforts to reduce our costs and more effectively leverage our expenses. While these efforts are still in the early stages of implementation. We've made significant progress and we expect to generate meaningful savings as we move forward. By the end of 2020, we expect to generate annualized savings of $100 million and we will continue to evaluate opportunities for additional cost reduction in the years beyond. As part of our commitment to drive efficiencies and eliminate redundant costs, we're focused on a variety of cost saving initiatives. We intend to reorganize and streamline several functional areas across our operations including numerous back office responsibilities. In addition, we expect to consolidate and ultimately reduce our total number of distribution facilities and to enhance the automation utilized and distribution and back office functions. These actions will require organizational changes and we're currently working on a number of workforce initiatives to successfully drive this process, while also maintaining excellent customer service. We look forward to providing more details on these plans and initiatives as they are finalized and launched and executed in the coming quarters. So now let's discuss the results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.8 billion, up 5% from the prior year and our operating profit of $222 million was down 2% with an operating margin of 8.0% compared to 8.6% margin in the third quarter of 2018. This quarter, the 60 basis point decline in margin directly relates to the challenges we are facing in Europe. And as mentioned, we expect to see improvement in Europe as well as all of our Automotive operations through the saving plans that we will be implementing through the next 12 months. Our industrial sales were $1.7 billion in the quarter, a strong 10% increase from Q3 of 2018. Our operating profit of $138 million was up 15.4% and their operating margin improved to 7.9% from 7.6% last year with a 30 basis point increase due to gross margin expansion and the leveraging of expenses. The industrial business continues to operate well with a 11 consecutive quarters of solid sales and operating results. Our business products revenues were $492 million, down 1% from the prior year. Their operating profit of $21.6 million is up 9%, and their operating margin improved to 4.4% from 4.0% last year. So it's nice to see the margin expansion and continued steady results for this business. Our total company operating profit in the third quarter was $381 million, up 4% on a 6% sales increase and our operating profit margin was 7.6% compared to 7.7% last year. We had net interest expense of $25 million in the third quarter, which is up slightly from the second quarter and up from the $22 million in the third quarter last year. Looking ahead, we are currently expecting net interest to be in the $92 million to $93 million range for the full year, which is down from our previous estimate of $97 million to $98 million. This improvement reflects our lower projected interest rates and debt levels for the balance of the year. Our total amortization expense was $26 million for the third quarter and we continue to expect full-year amortization to be approximately $100 million. Our depreciation expense was $42 million in the third quarter and we are narrowing the range for our full-year depreciation expense to $170 million to $175 million for the year. On a combined basis we expect depreciation and amortization to be in the range of $270 million to $275 million for 2019. Continuing with the segment information presented in our press release, the other line which primarily represents our corporate expense was $26 million in the third quarter including an approximate $12 million benefit associated with the transaction costs and other income related primarily to the Inenco acquisition and the sale of EIS. The acquisition of the final 65% interest in Inenco resulted in a $39 million gain on the revaluation of our original 35% investment. This was partially offset by transaction costs, and the $6 million net loss related to the sale of EIS, excluding these items, our corporate expense was $38 million or a $6 million increase from last year and primarily relates to payroll pressures increased legal and professional fees, ongoing investments in IT, Cyber security, Digital and overall omnichannel initiatives. For 2019, we are narrowing our expected range for corporate expense to $130 million to $135 million. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 25.3%, an increase from the 24.5% rate in the prior year, primarily due to transaction and other associated costs. For the full year, we continue to expect our 2019 tax rate to be approximately 25%. Now let's turn to our balance sheet, which remains strong and an excellent condition. Accounts receivable of $2.7 billion is up 3% from the prior year. This compares to our 6% total sales increase and represents a 2.5% increase excluding acquisitions, foreign currency and the impact of EIS. So we did a good job of managing this account and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at September 30 was $3.7 billion, up 5% from September of last year, excluding acquisitions, foreign currency and EIS our inventory was up less than 1% and we're very pleased with the progress our teams are making in maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels. Our accounts payable of $4.2 billion is up 4% due mainly to the increase in purchasing volume and to a lesser degree the benefit of improved payment terms with key global partners. At September 30, our AP to inventory ratio was 113%. Our total debt of $3.4 billion at September 30 is down from the $3.9 billion at June 30th due primarily to the repayment of debt as a result of our strong cash from operations in the third quarter. At September 30, our average interest rate on our total outstanding debt stands at 2.23% which is improved from the 2.63% at September 30 last year. We remain comfortable with our current debt structure and we have a strong balance sheet and the financial capacity to support our future growth initiatives and our ongoing priorities for effective capital allocations. As mentioned, we had strong cash flows in the third quarter and we've generated $745 million in cash from operations thus far in 2019. For the full year, we continue to expect approximately $1 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow, which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend to be in the $300 million to $350 million range. So we expect our cash flows to continue to support our ongoing priorities for the use of cash which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, the dividend and share repurchases. We have invested a $183 million in capital expenditures thus far in 2019 up $91 million from 2018. This reflects our growing global platform and the planned increase in our investments in areas such as technology and productivity in our facilities. For the year, we're updating our capital expenditures to the range of $250 million to $300 million. Regarding the dividend 2019 represents our 63rd consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. Our 2019 annual dividend of $3.05 represents a 6% increase from 2018 and it's approximately 54% of our 2018 adjusted earnings, which is in line with our targeted payout ratio. Turning to our share repurchase program we have purchased approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock thus far in 2019 and today we have $15.6 million shares authorized for repurchase. We expect to be active in the program over the long term and continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. So now let's discuss our current outlook for 2019. We are updating our full year 2019 sales and earnings guidance in consideration of several factors. These factors include our results through the nine months of the year, our current growth plans and initiatives, the market conditions we see for the foreseeable future across all of our operations, the September 30 sale of EIS and the ongoing impact of a strong U.S. dollar. With these items in mind, we expect our full year sales to increase approximately 3.5%. This updated sales outlook represents a change from our previous guidance for a plus 4.5% to plus 5.5% sales increase and it accounts for the sale of EIS as well as the incremental impact of foreign currency translation relative to our previous guidance. As this is customary, this guidance excludes the benefit of any future acquisitions, by business we are guiding sales to be up 3.5% to 4% for the Automotive segment, which has changed from our previous guidance of plus 4% to plus 5% and primarily due to the impact of foreign currency and a challenging sales environment, which we continue to face in Europe, plus 4% to plus 4.5% for the industrial segment, which is down from the plus 7% to plus 8% previously primarily related to the sale of EIS, and down approximately 1% for the business products segment. On the earnings side, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.44 to $5.52, which accounts for the transaction and other costs and income incurred through the nine months in 2019. And we are updating our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to $5.60 to $5.68 from the previous $5.65 to $5.75, this represents a $0.05 to $0.07 change in earnings primarily due to the sale of EIS. As a reminder, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes any nine month and future transaction and other costs, that completes our financial update and our outlook for 2019 and I will now turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. We were pleased to perform in line with our expectations for the third quarter, and would highlight several accomplishments. We had record quarterly sales, surpassing $5 billion in sales for the first time in our company's history. We achieved another quarter of positive comp sales growth in our U.S., Canadian and Australasian automotive businesses as well as our Industrial business. We further improved our gross margin with a 105 basis point year-over-year gain. Our Industrial business continue to perform well, generating a 30 basis point margin improvement. The Business Products Group further stabilized posting a 40 basis point margin improvement. We improved our working capital position and generated strong cash flows and finally, we expanded our global footprint via several diversified acquisitions, both by segment and geography, including a Inenco and Sparesbox on July 1, and the fluid powerhouse and Todd on October 1. In addition to these accomplishments, we have made strong progress on our ongoing business transformation. We continue to take steps to optimize our portfolio of businesses as demonstrated by the sale of EIS on September 30. Finally, we strengthened our focused on sustainable, value-creating initiatives to drive meaningful enduring efficiency including the cost reduction actions we discuss today. We will also continue to execute on our aggressive initiatives to improve top line performance. We plan to achieve this by incrementally growing revenue through new business generation, executing our digital strategy and finally securing strategic bolt-on acquisitions. We are focused on creating significant long-term value for our shareholders and we will continue to update the investment community as we make progress towards this important objective. We thank you for listening, and with that, we'll turn it back to the operator and Carol and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Horvers : Thanks, good morning everybody. So first, a cleanup question, did both NAPA and Motion have one less Sunday in the quarter and what was the approximate comp benefit to that? Carol Yancey : Yes. So we really, while we did have arguably an extra day in the third quarter and we were sort of day in Q1, it varies depending on the business and the geography in the segment. So we would say it was more of a minimal impact. Christopher Horvers : Minimal. And so I guess -- maybe historically said 50 basis points or something less than that. Carol Yancey : Something less than that. That's correct. Christopher Horvers : In Motion, did have one less? Carol Yancey : They did, yes. Christopher Horvers : Okay, got it. And then could you maybe first on the Motion side, can you talk about those core Motion comps ex that extra day noise. Did it turn negative in September. And how are you thinking about the outlook over the coming quarters given the fact that the PMI has been I think negative in back-to-back months. Paul Donahue : Yes. So Chris, thanks for the question. The look our Motion business, despite the decline two months in a row in PMI. And if you go back further Chris, PMI has been declined for six consecutive months and 10 out of 13. So not a new phenomenon by any stretch. Our Motion business we're pleased with the way the guys delivered in the quarter. Much like our overall business their strongest month of the quarter was August. They had a good month in August. July and September were both slightly weaker than August. But again, we're very pleased with the way the team delivered, and what is clearly a slowing industrial environment, but as we have seen in this cyclical business in the past, Chris they've done the right things in terms of cost take out and fortunately we're deliver -- we're able to deliver nice operating margin improvement in the quarter. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then just having to be able to run through the numbers, but I guess you think about what's the sort of implied Motion comp for the fourth quarter. Carol Yancey : Chris, that would be similar to what it was in Q3, so around a 1% comp. And one other just item to note we're really pleased to have our expansion in a different geography in the industrial business going into Q4 and beyond with Inenco and Australasia. They're not quite as susceptible to some of the things that we're seeing in North America. So as we look ahead, still strong reported total sales, but a similar comp for Q4. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then just lastly the -- similar discussion around the U.S. NAPA business. How did you see the monthly trends ex that -- the extra day noise? And then how -- what the implied in U.S. NAPA comp here for the fourth quarter? Paul Donahue : So I'll take the first part of the question, Chris the cadence of the quarter again, very similar to what I described in Industrial. Good August, very good August for the team here in the U.S. September not a surprise. We are up against our strongest comp of the year in September. And then July, what I'd say about July, we got off to a better start in July, and I think I might have even a commented on it during the last call, we saw that slow in the second half of the month of July. But all-in-all, very similar to the cadence that we outlined for industrial. And as far as guidance looking forward I'll let Carol tackle that one. Carol Yancey : Yes, sure, Chris. As we look as we just ended the nine months with U.S. automotive coming around 3%, we would expect to be similar in Q4 was around 2.5% to 3% comp. Christopher Horvers : Perfect, thanks so much. Best of luck. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Gustavo Gonzalez : Hi, good morning. This is actually Gustavo Gonzalez on for Scot today. Thank you for taking our questions. Just on sort of the strategic M&A and in particular automotive and sort of industrial and acknowledging, there are a lot of sort of puts and takes market-by-market. Can you sort of update us on how the M&A environment or opportunity set out there, it looks like right now versus, say, two or three years ago and maybe even sort of directionally touch on what kind of multiples you're seeing in the market today versus prior years? Paul Donahue : Sure, I'll touch on that, the -- from our vantage point, from an M&A standpoint we will embark upon our plastic strategy at GPC to always be on the lookout for strategic bolt-on acquisitions across our different business segments and geographies. A classic coupled for us this past quarter were the Todd acquisition in France, which bolsters are heavy duty footprint and positions us at number one in that market, the fluid power house acquisition for our motion business, which strengthens our fluid power business in Canada. So those are our classic approach to M&A and certainly we will continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions that our strategy is generally to look for 1% to 2% per year in bolt-on acquisitions. In terms of the larger, more strategic acquisitions like AAG we're going to be more focused on integrating those more strategic acquisitions in 2020 and beyond. And then in terms of valuations the valuations that we look at in our bolt-on acquisitions that really has not changed in previous years those -- most of those type acquisitions, we know the players, they know us, we're not getting into a bidding more, and it's a very sane environment, if you would. Gustavo Gonzalez : Got it, thank you. Paul Donahue : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Matt McClintock : Hi. Yes, good morning everyone. I wanted to -- I wanted to know if you could focus on European automotive for a few minutes. I believe that you said that the French business returned to positive or slightly positive growth this quarter and I wanted to dig into that a little bit, what did you actually see in that business during the quarter that, that brought around that improvement that be the first question. Paul Donahue : And thanks for the question, Matt. Look, what I would say, first and foremost is we were very pleased to see our European business rebound in Q3. As you know, Q2 was a challenge. So the team rebounded nicely, the French team, which is our single largest market in Europe had a solid quarter and delivering a positive sales increase after a significant decline in Q2. I think that the initiatives that they put into place will continue to drive here going forward. But the French team did a good job, where -- where we saw softness in the quarter was in the UK and again, we believe those issues that we face in the UK are largely transitory we were pleased to see that perhaps there may be a resolution to the Brexit issues and that will certainly help our business going forward if they are able to reach resolution. Matt McClintock : And that has actually my follow up is the Brexit deal that apparently was reached today if that actually does go into place. Is that something that would remove an overhang immediately in your business? Or is that something that you would think would have to play out over a period of quarters before the overhang is removed. Thanks. Paul Donahue : Yes, that's a good question, Matt, and I wish I could give you a specific answer. It's hard to say, but I will tell you that there has been is a bit of malaise in the marketplace, folks aren't sure with all the uncertainty around Brexit in the past number of quarters, I think it just weighed on business in general. So if they are to reach resolution if it makes its way through Parliament and they do reach resolution. I don't know that we'll see an immediate bounce back, but I do expect there to be a bounce back for sure. And I would also add Matt, that the initiatives that we're taking whether it happens or not. We're getting aggressive in introducing our NAPA brand into the UK, we launched a couple of product categories in Q3, and intend to accelerate that in Q4 going forward. So whether they reach resolution or not? Our team stands ready to improve that business. Matt McClintock : I appreciate the color. Best of luck. Paul Donahue : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Imbro : Yes, good morning and thanks for taking our questions. What is there on North America, automotive organic growth, saw a nice acceleration in the two-year stack basis. Can you just talk about how much you think your programs, like the store remodels, loyalty or NAPA AutoCare are driving that growth versus just an industry acceleration we've seen as weather improves. Paul Donahue : Yes, Daniel. Thanks for the question, what I would tell you about our NAPA business in Q3, and it was a very similar trend as we saw in Q2 is our DIFM category, which is our largest segment by a large percentage, it performed very well in the quarter. I would point out our NAPA AutoCare business as a very bright spot in the quarter. Our team, the NAPA AutoCare team continues to do a terrific job, and we also saw a better lift in our major account business. So both did quite well. We've got opportunities on the retail side, we saw our retail business soften in Q2 that carried into Q3, we've anniversaried some of the new retail initiatives that we have been driving in the last few years, but we're confident our team will get that business back on track but DIFM is the real highlight for us in Q3 as it was in Q2. Daniel Imbro : Thanks a lot, that's helpful. And then maybe, following up on the last question, I think you mentioned you're rolling up the NAPA brand across some product categories in Europe. Can you help us think about how much of your business in Europe today is private label. I mean, how does that compare to existing players, and then how has the consumer responded so far to the new brand? Paul Donahue : Yes, it's probably a bit early Daniel to give you an update on how they've responded to the NAPA brand. I will tell you that our team was excited, we launched it at a major show in Q3, a lot of excitement, a lot of buzz. They know the NAPA brand in the U.K. What I would say overall about private brands in Europe, it varies by market. So, very little private label in Germany, a bit more in France and the U.K. would be the strongest market for private label, which is why we chose the UK to launch first, but make no mistake our intent will be to move into France, Germany and the Netherlands with the NAPA private brand. Daniel Imbro : Got it, thanks so much. Best of luck. Paul Donahue : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back and ask about the savings. Just in terms of timing, is there aren't going to be any impact to 2019, and then of the $100 million, you've identified, are you able to identify, how much could flow through versus how much needs to be reinvested given the rework changes you mentioned? Carol Yancey : Yes, so I appreciate the question, and as we kind of look ahead at the $100 million and your comment specifically about 2019, what we're planning for is that we would have annualized $100 million by the end of 2020 and that would be a net number that would flow in, but it would be over a number of several quarters as it comes in and in doing the things that we're talking about and we're obviously still working on our plans and still looking at a number of initiatives in areas, we could have some costs in Q4 that come out of either head count related or facility related as we look ahead, those would be one-time type non-recurring that we could have in Q4, but again we're going into 2020 with the expectation that it's $100 million annualized by the end of the year. And then we obviously would be continuing to look for other opportunities as we move ahead, we're certainly not going to stop with just this initial look at the first $100 million. Kate McShane : Okay, thank you. And then if we could just go back to the automotive industry and what you've seen now that tariffs, have been in place. Can you talk us through the impact on sales from inflation versus units and just what you think the impact was in the third quarter from tariffs specifically? Carol Yancey : Yes. So as we, and again we commented that primarily we're talking about for Automotive and is the list one through three of the 25% tariff that went up on July 1, that was in Q3 about 1.9% on our sales for U.S. automotive. It was about 1% first half, so we would expect a similar amount for Q4. So we have kind of a blended 1.5% full-year basis for U.S. automotive. For the industrial business, it's really immaterial and for business products it was about 1% in Q3 and we would have a similar amount for Q4 they do have List 4b that comes in, as of now 12/15, but there could be around 1% for them also in Q4. And again, I guess I would just leave you with, our teams have done a tremendous job navigating through all the puts and takes as it relates to tariffs. And we have successfully become much more agile and nimble in moving prices and being able to pass those through and have seen no impact on our gross margins. Kate McShane : Okay, thank you. And then my final question on automotive. You mentioned the timing of promotional events. Were certain promotional events brought forward or were they pushed into Q4? Paul Donahue : They were pulled forward Kate and honestly, we think that we'll balance those out as we roll into Q4, we'd begin to hit some colder weather. And we think we're going to be fine going forward, I would also just comment Kate, you ask about the U.S. automotive business. So I think one thing that we would absolutely stress is the health of the overall aftermarket, when you look at miles driven, which we saw a nice jump in July, gas price is down considerably, year-over-year the average age, all the fundamentals continue to be really solid for automotive aftermarket and when I look at our performance in the quarter, it plays to our strength, which is DIFM and I think that plays very well for us going into Q4 in 2020. Kate McShane : Okay, thank you. Paul Donahue : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I want to follow up a little bit on the tariffs and inflation. Carol in the past you guys have talked about general inflation in your COGS. Could you give us those numbers? Or highlight how much of the inflation that's occurring is related to tariffs as opposed to just some other inflation that might be out there. Carol Yancey : Yes, happy to do that, Greg. What we saw the tariffs and inflation for U.S. automotive are virtually the same. So the inflation that they've had, be it on the COGS side or passing through on the sales side, more like a 1.5% to 2% is generally been inflation. Our industrial business is running around 2% for inflation and there is more indirect to tariffs you would talk about raw materials and supplier freight and things like that, and that's a normal level for them and then business products, they would probably running about 3% in total for inflation with about 1% tariff related. Greg Melich : Got it. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, why is this quarter through the peak benefit to sales in terms of pass through? Is that just the timing of when the tariffs hit and when you flow it through. Is there something else we should be watching is to look at ebb and flow that -- is that number going forward. Carol Yancey : No, I guess, if you recall, the original 10% tariff that we were under, that's how we operated through the first half of the year, so the pass-through on pricing was about 1% and again we didn't take that full 10% tariff, but what we did take about half of that we passed through and that led to about a 1% impact first half the tariffs went up July 1% to 25% and again we didn't take that full amount but we knew our second half would be more pronounced. So that's why we've said all along, second half would be around 2% first half was 1%. Greg Melich : Got it. And then this is maybe a bigger picture question. The do-it-for-me was stronger, and you guys clearly went in there early and leaned into that, but DIY a little softer. Do you think there is -- is there any evidence that the consumer is having trouble with any of this inflation or may be deferring any decisions? Paul Donahue : It's a great question, Greg and one that certainly we've contemplated as well because we have seen a bit of softening on the retail front. I think it's -- may be a bit early yet to make a call there. But what I will tell you is we are watching it very, very closely. One of the key stats that we obviously always monitor closely are the number of tickets flowing through our stores and then obviously the average basket size. Basket size, both retail and wholesale was very healthy this quarter. Our retail ticket were down more so than our wholesale ticket. But, so I would tell you we're monitoring it closely. We're monitoring our competitive stand in the marketplace, and we'll react if and when necessary. But I think it's maybe just a bit early yet to make that call. Greg Melich : That's super helpful, thanks a lot. Good luck. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Seth. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Seth Basham : Good to hear that you have some plans for further cost savings. As we think about the outlook for 2020 from those savings, would it be appropriate to think that you'll be able to drive SG&A leverage, assuming a normalized sales environment in line with your long-term guidance? Carol Yancey : Yes. Look the $100 million is about a 50 basis point in operating margin improvement and we would expect to drive -- again, as you mentioned normal comparable sales growth, we would expect to drive SG&A improvement operating margin improvement. Seth Basham : Great. And then, as it relates to gross margin in the quarter, you talked about supplier incentives providing some benefit. Can you give a little bit more color as to what segment that was in and the sustainability of those types of incentives. Carol Yancey : Yes, so actually in all three of our segments we had gross margin improvement. The larger share of the gross margin improvement is coming from what I call, just the core gross margin and that is from favorable product mix to all the initiatives we've done in the area of pricing, so significant buy side and sell side initiatives that we're doing in all of our businesses has improved our gross margin. We have had -- because we have better growth, we have had positive supplier incentives and those are primarily been an automotive and office products. And then as we mentioned, we do have a little bit of an uplift in gross margin from PPG, PartsPoint and Inenco that carry a higher gross margin, but really the core is what's driving this which is just us delivering on our buy side and sell side initiatives and again doing it with a good bit of tariff impact and inflation. Seth Basham : Got it. Can you just provide a little more color on the gross margin benefit and SG&A headwind associated with the PPG and Inenco? Carol Yancey : Yes, happy to. So when you look at our gross margin as Paul mentioned, it was up 105 basis points if you exclude the purchase accounting adjustments we had, about a third of that was related to the two new acquisitions, so two-thirds of that was from our core business being up. And then on the SG&A side, when you look at our SG&A and if you take out again the one-time costs our SG&A was up around 120 basis points. We would tell you, it's similar 30 to 40 basis point impact for PPG and Inenco. So, our core business again should be improving a bit when you take out some of these things and it's important to kind of look at the operating margin side as well. Seth Basham : Understood. Thank you very much. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Seth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Jacob Moser : Hey guys, this is actually Jacob Moser on for Chris. Thanks for taking the question. Paul Donahue : Okay. Jacob Moser : So I'm just wondering of the $100 million of cost reductions. I think you guys said you still had some remaining from the $25 million synergy target from the AAG acquisition. So is this all incremental to that $25 million? Carol Yancey : Yes, it is that $25 million, as it relates to AAG, which we are on track and that was all related to gross margin and global procurement, those $100 million is in the area of SG&A. So it is more payroll and facility and freight-related. Jacob Moser : Okay, got you. And is it possible to quantify how much of that $25 million of synergies has come through at this point? Carol Yancey : No, we have -- we said we would achieve that by the end of three years and we are on track to receive that. So -- I mean look, it's -- we would argue that we're on track, it's in our gross margin number, but it's the bulk of our improvement is coming from all the other stuff that we're doing. Jacob Moser : Got you, okay. And then just, you said you paid down some debt in the quarter. So I think, now you're around three times debt-to-EBITDA versus maybe 1.5 historically like, have you changed how you're thinking about leverage and where do you see that shaking out? Carol Yancey : Yes. So what we had in the quarter is we had some really nice improvement in our working capital and we were able to take that improvement in our working capital and use that to pay down some of our debt. The proceeds from the sale of EIS had in effect been redeployed on the two other acquisitions that we made earlier in the quarter. So when we look at where our debt was and it had ticked up a bit at the end of Q2 and obviously we're pleased with where it is now and expected to come down maybe just a little bit more by the end of the year. We're comfortable with where it was before and we're comfortable with where it is now, what we really look at is having flexibility and looking at what the right opportunities are. So again we're still comfortable with the amount of leverage we have today and we will certainly take it up for the right opportunity. Jacob Moser : All right, great. Thanks for taking the questions. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Good morning guys. Carol, I -- if we think about the forecast on inflation, is it fair to think the '20 might have first half inflation similar to second half of '19 and the negligible in the second half, just as we lap those second list of tariffs? Carol Yancey : I mean like again assuming tariffs kind of stay where they are and I think the year-over-year what you've laid out makes sense. We don't really see any other -- other inflationary things that would come in, but I would think that would be reasonable first half versus second half 2020. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a question on private label in Europe, when you think about the margin profile of private label, what is the delta over there. And I guess to sell private label you need to price it more aggressively against the market that's used to branded. I mean how do you think you can pick up margin over there with a bigger private label program. Paul Donahue : Well, maybe I would start, Bret, by just mentioning again the initial launches in the U.K., we've launched private label batteries, as well as some suspension products, they will be priced a bit more aggressively then where our core product categories are today, what we've seen in the U.K., Bret, and you've probably seen, I know you follow it pretty closely over there, is a little bit of a flight to value, given the challenges, they are having in their economy and that's why, certainly we think we've got a big opportunity with the NAPA private brand. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then one cleanup. Regional performance in the U.S. NAPA, any particular strengths or weakness? Paul Donahue : Yes. Very similar Bret to Q2, which was our northern tier division. So that would include our Group in the Northeast which led the way again for us in Q3, the central part of the U.S., the Mountain Midwest all really performed well, Southwest did just fine. Where we saw a bit of softness was out west, which we also saw in Q2, and a little bit in the Atlantic. We think the Atlantic may have benefited a year ago from some one-time sales via the hurricanes coming through, so we are up against some bigger comps. So I wouldn't read too much into that. But the Northern part of the U.S. really, really performed well for us. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Paul Donahue : You're welcome. Thank you, Brett. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to management for any final comments. Carol Yancey : We'd like to thank you for participating in our call today and we look forward to reporting out our year-end numbers. So thank you for your support of Genuine Parts Company. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference, you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Fourth Quarter Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Sid Jones : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company fourth quarter and full year 2019 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2020. I\u2019m here with Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today\u2019s discussion of our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today\u2019s call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company\u2019s latest SEC filings, including this morning\u2019s press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call. We thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our business units. Carol will provide an update on our financial results and our outlook for 2020. After that, we will open the call up your questions. Our financial results in 2019 reflect the positive impact of our strategic growth initiative and continued focus on improving our operating performance, maintaining a strong balance sheet, driving meaningful cash flows, and effective capital allocation. Our strategic growth initiatives drove the third consecutive year of record sales for Genuine Parts Company with positive comp sales and the benefit of several key acquisitions across our automotive and industrial platform. Additionally, to further optimize our portfolio, we streamlined our operations with the sale of several non-core businesses, including Auto Todo in Mexico, EIS, and GCN and Canadian operations of our Business Product Group. In 2019, we also accelerated our initiatives to improve our operating performance. Our team executed well and we were successful in increasing our gross margin rate for the fourth consecutive year. Additionally, in accordance with our cost savings initiatives announced last October, we took action to streamline field management layers, restructured field support operations, and consolidate facilities across the organization. We also continue to assess all areas of the business to identify and act on additional opportunities that increase efficiency and productivity as well as reducing cost. As announced on November 18th, Will Stengel join the company as EVP and Chief Transformation Officer. In his first 90 days, Will has attracted talent and created a disciplined approach to help drive improved performance in partnership with the global operating teams. Our efforts thus far primarily reflect the savings associated with company's voluntary retirement program, which we will begin to realize this quarter. As a result of these initiatives, there were a number of one-time items recorded in the fourth quarter, which Carol will touch on shortly. We fully expect these steps to best position the company for improved profitability and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our targeted $100 million cost savings run rate by the end of 2020. Now, turning to the result. Fourth quarter sales of $4.7 billion were up 2.2%, or nearly 7%, excluding the impact of our divestitures highlighted by approximately 3% comp sales growth and our automotive segment. The strongest growth in automotive came from our U.S. and Australasian businesses, and these two groups also posted solid operating results. In addition, we produced further gross margin improvement for the quarter, and the industrial segment reporting continued operating margin expansion. In review of our business segment highlight, global automotive sales, which represented 59% of our total fourth quarter revenues were up 8.7% from last year, and improved from 5.3% growth in Q3. Comp sales were up 2.9%, which was a sequential acceleration from the plus 1.8% in Q3 and acquisitions, net of the Auto Todo divestiture another adjustment, added another 7.2% to sales. In our North American operations, U.S. automotive sales were up 5.2% in the fourth quarter with comp sales up 3.3% and solid growth and operating profit. This has improved from our 2.5% comp sales increase in the third quarter, and it's on top of the 3.3% growth in the fourth quarter of 2018. In Canada, our automotive sales were up low single digits with flat comp sales. Canada remains a large and strategic market for us, and we expect to deliver positive sales growth and market share expansion in 2020, driven by key commercial programs such as NAPA Autopro and NAPA AutoCare. We are also confident in the ongoing strength of the North American automotive aftermarket. We expect improving car park dynamics, such as the increase in the number of vehicles in the aftermarket sweet spot, an aging fleet and reasonable gas prices to further support continued industry growth. In the U.S., we produced another quarter of positive sales growth with both our commercial and retail customers. Likewise, sales to the commercial segment, which is nearly 80% of our total automotive sales, both in the U.S. and globally, outpaced our retail sales growth in the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year. Sales to our NAPA AutoCare Center and major account customer segments continue to drive our commercial sales growth. NAPA AutoCare is an industry leading commercial program, representing approximately 18,000 independent repair shops in the U.S., as well as another 2,000 and Canada. The major accounts group consists of national and retail customers, including fleet and government accounts, national tire centers, regional tire and repair chains, and OE dealers through our joint business planning, but these major accounts as well as expansive inventories, advanced technological offerings and best-in-class service capabilities, NAPA is well-positioned to serve these large and growing customer groups. And this holds true across all of our automotive operations. Similar to our strategy in North America, we serve the European and Australasia and commercial markets with effective banner program for the independent installer base and comprehensive products and services required by major account customers. Globally, our capabilities and selling to these customer segments distinguish our automotive businesses from our competition and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the years ahead. In our retail segment, we continue to benefit from initiatives such as NAPA rewards program, now 12 million strong and growing every month. And our retail impact store project, which we are rolling out across our independently owned store based. Today, our company-owned stores and approximately 200 of our independent stores have been updated for this initiative. And we have plans for another 300 plus remodeled stores in 2020. In addition, our retail sales reflect the favorable impact of our promotional activity in the quarter, which offset some of the early headwinds we began to see in December, related to the mild winter weather. In Europe, we were pleased to experience improving market trend and report our second consecutive quarter of sequential progress and our comp sales performance. Overall, our sales comps were flat in the fourth quarter, which is significantly improved from the mid to high single-digit declines in Q2 and Q3. While economic growth in the U.K. was relatively unchanged with the previous quarter, we were encouraged by stabilizing industry activity associated with higher confidence in a Brexit agreement. As a result, comp sales were much improved from the third quarter. In addition, our battery sales in the U.K. outperformed in the fourth quarter. And we continue to gain traction with the rollout of the NAPA brand and categories such as batteries, rotating electrical, shocks and timing belt. We anticipate the continued growth of private label in this region will enhance our brand positioning and sales penetration with all of our customers. In France, comp sales growth was basically flat with the prior year, and in line with the previous quarter, which had shown considerable improvement from the second quarter. The acquisition of the Todd group, effective 10-01-2019 also positively contributed to our total growth in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, Todd is expected at 85 million in annual revenues and positions AAG as the market leader in the heavy duty segment across the French market. Rounding out our European operations, we reported positive sales comps in Germany, and our June acquisition of Parts points in the Netherlands, performed a plan. We enter 2020, excited for additional growth opportunities in both Germany and the Benelux region of Europe. Looking forward, we expect improving conditions for top line growth in Europe to positively impact our comp sales, as well as leveraging our expense base. And as discussed throughout 2019, our team continues to execute on a variety of initiatives to generate additional expense savings. With these things in mind, we expect to improve Europe's profitability and operating margin in 2020 and beyond. In Australia and New Zealand, we posted another quarter of mid single digit comp growth, with solid operating profit. And we had point out that our performance in this region was fairly consistent throughout 2019. Our finish to the year was especially encouraging, given the trend of more challenging economic conditions over the last half of 2019. In addition, the people of Australia have experienced one of the most devastating and widespread bushfires on record across the region. We are proud of our team for their continued focus on safety and excellent customer service despite these incredibly difficult circumstances. In response to this crisis, the company was pleased to contribute to the Australian Red Cross, which has been instrumental in serving and protecting the many individuals and families in the communities we serve. So that\u2019s a recap of the global automotive group and our fourth quarter performance. With these results, and the many growth prospects we see for this segment across our operations, we are well positioned to produce additional sales growth and operating improvement in 2020. Turning now to our global industrial parts group, which represented 31% of our total revenues. Fourth quarter sales were $1.5 billion. Excluding EIS sales were up approximately 7% with the benefit of Inenco and Australasia and other industrial acquisitions, partially offset by a 1.2% comp sales decrease at Motion. Inenco, which we acquired in July, operated well and in line with our expectations for the quarter, as well as the first six months. The growing pressure on our North American sales reflects the slowing trend in the industrial economy that persisted throughout the quarter and the second half of the year. For perspective, three of our 14 product categories posted positive year-over-year sales in the fourth quarter. This was down from 8 of 14 and the third quarter, while sales by industry sector held steady with Q3, with seven of 12 industry showing improvement. These results align with our downward trend for indicators such as manufacture and industrial production and the Purchasing Managers Index. Although, the January PMI improved over 50 for the first time in five months. We remain optimistic that the industrial economy will further strengthen over the course of 2020, primarily in the second half of the year. In summary, the industrial group produced a solid quarter and performed well all year, with operating margin improvement in each quarter, despite slower sales comps in the second half of the year. We entered 2020 with strategic plans to capitalize on our market presence in both North America, and Australasia and improve our operating results. Now, a few comments to update you on our business products group, which accounted for 9% of total revenues. For the fourth quarter, this segment reported sales of 428 million, down 6.3% with the decrease primarily due to the continued softening demand for traditional office supplies and technology categories, competitive dynamics and lower volume with our national accounts group. On a positive note, we delivered another quarter of increased sales for facilities and safety supplies. And this category has grown to represent 35% of total sales for this business segment. While the growth in FBS is encouraging and represents an important element of our growth strategies for the Business Product Group. We will continue to evaluate our future plans for this business, as we move forward in 2020. With that in mind, we recently streamline this business segment with the sale of GCN, a small non-core operation in late 2019 and the sale of our Business Product Operations in Canada on January 1st of this year. So, that's a recap of our consolidated and business segment results for the fourth quarter of 2019. Before turning over to Carol, I'd like to make a few comments on the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China. While this situation is very fluid, we thought it would be helpful to provide a few more details on our level of exposure to this -- to the impacted region. From a topline perspective, we're not considering any sales weakness related to the outbreak as we do not have any sales exposure in China. We do however have exposure to affected areas throughout our supply chain including direct and indirect sourcing from China from North American Automotive, Australasia, and Business Products with only minimal impact in Industrial and European Automotive. And while we are in good standing today and do not foresee any material product shortages based on the current situation, we are very aware of the potential for a worsening scenario and we remain in constant contact with our suppliers across the globe to plan for any disruption in supply should the virus continue beyond the near-term. So, with that, I'll hand it over to Carol. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will provide our full year outlook for 2020. Total GPC sales of $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter were up 2.2% from 2018 or up approximately 7% excluding the impact of divestitures. These results drove the continued improvement in gross margin up 20 basis points to 33.7% from 33.5% in 2018. For the full year, sales of $19.4 billion increased 3.5% and our gross profit improved 55 basis points to 32.57 from 39.14 in the prior year. The improvement in gross margin for the fourth quarter and full year reflect a variety of factors including the benefit of enhanced pricing strategies and favorable product mix, as well as the favorable impact from acquisitions and divestitures. With the continued efforts in our gross margin initiatives, we expect our 2020 gross margin rate to remain relatively in line with our full year rate for 2019. This sustains reasonable inflation of now more than 1% 2% and consistent levels of volume incentives. In 2019, Automotive and Business Product inflation primarily reflects the impact of tariffs. And while tariffs were not affected for Industrial, this segment experienced approximately 2% price inflation. Throughout 2019, we were successful in passing on the price increases to our customers to protect our gross margin. So, we continue to believe the current of levels of inflation has been a net positive to our results. Specific to tariffs, their impact in the fourth quarter primarily reflects a 25% tariffs on less 133 items although Business Products was also impacted by the 15% tariff on List 4 items that was effective September 1st. As expected, tariffs were approximately 2% of sales for both U.S. Automotive and Business Products in Q4 and in the 1% to 1.5% range for the full year. Looking ahead, tariffs would be less significant in 2020 as their effective dates will anniversary throughout the year. Turning to our selling, administrative and other expenses. These expenses were $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter, which was up 3% from last year and 26.6% of sales. The fourth quarter reflects the lowest percent increase in our SG&A in 2019. For the year, these expenses were $4.9 billion, up 7% from last year and 25.4% of sales. So while we were encouraged by the progress and better aligning our fourth quarter expenses to sales and gross profit growth, our SG&A continues to be impacted by rising cost in several areas including payroll, freight and delivery, legal and professional, IT and cybersecurity. In addition, we remain challenged to leverage our expenses on low single-digit sales comps. These cost pressures and the lack of leverage let us to develop our 2019 cost savings plan, which we announced last quarter and Paul covered earlier. Through these initiatives, which are well underway today, we expect to generate meaningful savings as we move forward in 2020 primarily in the areas of personnel and headcount associated with various organizational changes. In accordance with the savings plan, the company recognized $112 million in restructuring cost in the fourth quarter that are accounted for as a component of operating expenses. These restructuring costs reflect severance and other employee cost including a voluntary retirement program, as well as facility and closure costs related to the consolidation of certain operation. The company also recorded $43 million in special termination costs related to that retirement benefits provided to employees that expected this voluntary retirement package. These costs are presented as non-operating expenses. The combination of restructuring and special termination costs reflects the one-time expenses that were record to generate annualized savings of $100 million by the end of 2020. This is a significant return on our investment and we look forward to updating you on the positive impact of these initiatives throughout the year. Separately in the fourth quarter, the company reported an $82 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our Business Products Group. Several factors that developed in the quarter including greater uncertainty associated with the longer term industry trend, as well as the competitive environment led us to this decision, which effectively eliminates the goodwill for this business segment. Rounding out our operating expenses, our depreciation and amortization expense was $73 million in the fourth quarter and $270 million for the full year. Depreciation was $48 million and $173 million for the quarter and the year, respectively. And we expect this to increase to $180 million to $190 million in 2020, which is due to the increase in capital expenditures related to our ongoing growth plans for reinvesting in the company. Intangible amortization was $25 million for the quarter and $97 million for the full year. We expect intangible amortization to increase to approximately $100 million in 2020. So, on a combined basis, we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $280 million to $290 million in 2020. So now let's discuss our fourth quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.8 billion, up 8.7% from the prior year and operating profit of $201 million was up 1% with an operating margin of 7.2% compared to 7.7% margin for the fourth quarter of the prior year. The 50 basis point decline reflects the headwinds in our European business and to a lesser extent, the Q4 results in Canada. Our U. S. and Australasian group have solid operating margins for the quarter. As we move forward, we expect a steady sales environment and additional cost savings to support our initiatives for improved operating results in 2020. Industrial sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, a 6% decrease from Q4 of 2018 or up approximately 7% excluding EIS. Our operating profit of $127 million was down 3% or up 9% excluding EIS. Operating margin improved to 8.6% from 8.3% last year with the 30 basis point increase due to margin expansion in the core industrial business as well as the favorable impact of the EIS divestiture. In Business Products, our revenues were $428 million, down 6.3% from the prior year. Their operating profit was $14 million and the operating margin declined to 3.3%. These results correlates to the decline in core sales for the quarter and further deleveraging of expenses. Total company operating profit in the fourth quarter $342 million and our operating profit margin was 7.3% compared to 7.7% last year. We had net interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter and for 2019 net interest was $91 million, which is down slightly from 2018. In 2020, we expect net interest of $86 million to $88 million, reflecting lower interest rate and lower debt levels. The corporate expense line was $36 million in the fourth quarter, down from $41 million in 2018. For the year, this was $138 million, which was flat with the prior year. We expect our corporate expenses to be within the $140 million to $150 million range for 2020. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26.5%, a slight decrease from the 26.6% rate in the prior year. Excluding one-time restructuring cost, our adjusted rate of 24.2% was improved from the 26.9% in 2018, due primarily to geographical income mix shift. For the year, our effective tax rate was 25.2% or on an adjusted basis 24.5%. And we are planning for our full year tax rate of approximately 24% to 26% for 2020. Our net income in the fourth quarter was $9 million and our EPS was $0.06, while our adjusted net income was $197 million or $1.35 per share. Net income for the full year was $621 million or $4.24 per share and adjusted net income was $833 million or $5.69 per share. So now let's turn to the balance sheet, which remains strong in an excellent condition. We continue to closely manage our accounts receivable, our inventory and our accounts payable to improve our working capital position. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables and the progress our team is making to enhance our supply chain, which has positively impacted our inventory investment in our gross margin trends. At December 31, our AP to inventory ratio is 107% and our total working capital, represents just 8% of revenues. Our total debt of $3.4 billion at December 31 is unchanged from September 30 and up from the $3.1 billion in 2018. At December 31, our average interest rate on all our outstanding debt is 2.2%, which is improved from the 2.7% at December 31 last year. With a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.34 times, we remain comfortable with our current debt structure and we have a strong balance sheet and the financial capacity to support our future growth initiatives and our ongoing priorities for effective capital allocation. In 2019, we generated another year of solid cash flows with approximately $900 million in cash from operations. We expect another solid year in 2020 and we're currently projecting $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion in cash from operations, with free cash flow after the dividend in the $300 million to $350 million range. Strong cash flows continue to support our ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our key priorities for cash remain reinvestment in this businesses, strategic acquisition, dividend and share repurchases. We invested $298 million in capital expenditures in 2019, which was up from $232 million in 2018. This increase reflects our growing operations and the incremental spend in areas such as technology and other productivity enhancing investments in our facilities. For 2020, we have plans for continued investment in our businesses and we expect total capital expenditures to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million for the full year. Acquisitions remain an important component of our growth strategy. And in 2019 we used approximately $700 million in cash, commercially funded by the proceeds from divestitures, to acquire new businesses and expand our global footprint. In 2020, we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisition in the automotive and industrial segments. Although, these future acquisitions have not been considered in our guidance for the year. Turning to the dividend. Earlier this week our Board approved a $3.16 per share annual dividend for 2020, which marks our 64th consecutive annual increase in the dividend paid to shareholders. This represents a 4% increase from the $3.05 per share paid in 2019 and it's approximately 56% of our 2019 adjusted earnings per share, which is in line with our targeted payout ratio. Finally, as part of our share repurchase program we purchased approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock in 2019 and today we have 15.6 million shares authorized for repurchase. We expect to be active in the program again in 2020 and over the long-term, we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividends serves to maximize the return for shareholders. So, now, let's discuss our outlook for 2020. In arriving at our 2020 full year guidance, we considered our performance in 2019 as well as the recent trends and our current growth plans and strategic initiatives. In addition, we take into account the current market conditions than what we anticipate for the foreseeable future in each of our business segment and the geographies that we operate. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2020 to be in the range to -- of flat to up 1% or plus 3% to plus 4% excluding the impact of the EIS and SPR divestiture. As mentioned earlier, this guidance excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisition. By business, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 5% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, which includes plus 2% to plus 3% comp sales growth. A sales decrease of minus 6% to minus 7% for the Industrial segment or plus 2% to plus 3% excluding the impact of EIS. This reflects a decrease in comp sales of approximately 1.5% to 2%. For the Business Product segment, down 4% to down 5% total sales decline or down 1% to down 2% excluding divestitures. On the earnings side, we currently expect earnings per share to be in the range of $5.80 to $5.90. This represents a 2% to 4% increase over our adjusted earnings per share in 2019 or a 5% to 7% increase excluding the earnings related to the divestiture of EIS. With this guidance, we move forward into 2020 confident that the management teams have the strategic plans and initiatives in place to meet or exceed these targeted results. We are excited by the cost savings potentials we've identified and encouraged that our transformation office is also focused on identifying additional opportunities for us. In addition, we believe that the underlying fundamentals of our broad and growing business platform will continue to provide us with sustained long-term growth opportunities. So, that's our financial report for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 as well as our outlook for 2020. We were pleased to finish the year with solid results and we look forward to reporting more progress in the coming quarters. I'll turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. We're pleased to perform at the high end of our expectations in the fourth quarter and finished the year with solid results. Allow me to recap the few highlights. We achieved another quarter of positive total sales growth, driven by a 3% plus from sales growth in our U.S. Automotive business, which represents our best comp in five years. So, congratulations go out to our U.S. NAPA team. We further improve the gross margin by 20 basis points in the quarter and by more than 60 basis points for the full year, our fourth consecutive year of improved gross margins. We experienced improving market trends in Europe and reported significantly improved sales comps relative to the second and third quarters. Our Industrial business continue to operate well, generating a 30 basis points improvement in operating margins. We streamlined our operations with the successful divestiture of several non-core business segments. We took action on our initiatives to achieve $100 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2020. And effective this week, our Board of Directors approved of 64th conservative increase in the dividend, up 4% from 2019. So, as you can see our team has been busy executing on our growth strategy as well as several initiatives to improve our operating results. Combined, these efforts have served to further optimize our portfolio and we expect to continue our strategic transformation in 2020. GPC enters a new year with strategic plans and initiative to drive sales and profit ability, working capital improvement, and significant value for all of our stakeholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress towards these objectives as we move through the year. So, thank you for listening. And with that, we'll turn back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning everybody. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Horvers : So wanted to start with the comp acceleration in U.S. NAPA, which is impressive in light of what we've seen from your peers with generally seeing deceleration. Can you talk about where you saw that? Maybe break that down between DIY and do-it-for-me? You did mention promotional effectiveness in December around the weather that would seem to me like that's more of a DIY versus commercial benefit. But sure -- wanted to get your thoughts there? And any comment in terms of was there any incremental inflation benefit that you kept in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? Paul Donahue : Well. Okay, Chris thanks for the question. I I'll do my best to cover all this point and maybe have Carol weigh in on a bit of an inflation discussion. You know, you mentioned commercial versus retail, our commercial business was solid. Our two big programs, Major Accounts, AutoCare both were inline with our overall commercial sales in the quarter, which was up significantly over 2018. So we're pleased with our commercial business and our retail business was solid as well. You mentioned the promotional activities Chris, so we had set out really to focus on all three of our big sales channels, retail, commercial as well as online. And I think that some of the initiatives that we put into play maybe be offset the impact of some of the mild camps we saw hit the business in December -- October, November still -- the weather was still fairly favorable. December and January, obviously, have done a good bit. Warmer they're taking a bit of a toll on some of our more seasonal categories. But our hard parts business remains solid and we're pleased with the performance of our U.S. automotive business in the quarter. Carol Yancey : And just a comment on the tariff impact for automotive business in the quarter. It was as expected about 2% related to tariffs. And so the second half being at 2%, first half at 1% gave us a blended 1.5% for 2019. And then just as a reminder as we go into 2020, we'll anniversary some of that. So we're looking for maybe a first half of 1% and a blended half a point for the full year. And that excludes any further inflation. Christopher Horvers : Got it. I'm not sure of -- again maybe as you think about relative to the third quarter you saw acceleration clearly in both sides of the business really impressive. But did you see more in DIY? Or did you see more in commercial? Any insights there? Paul Donahue : Certainly I would say our commercial outperformed our retail, Chris even though both were solid. And we continue to rollout our impact store initiatives to now we're \u2013 now working closely with our independent owners. But commercial both AutoCare and Major Accounts have performed well. You haven't asked about originality Chris, but I'll touch on it as I'm sure some will ask the \u2013 we saw really strong growth up in the north, certainly in the central part of the United States, Midwest. Our Mountain team had a really solid quarter. Where we saw some of the softness was out west, as well as in the Northeast part of the U.S. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then as you think about 2020, you gave guidance for the overall automotive division. How are you thinking about the U.S. NAPA business? And any comments on how the weather is impacted your business quarter-to-date and how it could \u2013 how that could sort of way on the year overall? Paul Donahue : Yes. Well, Chris, as it relates to the weather just to make a comment that we\u2019ve got a fairly diversified business model and really if you start to break our business apart only about 30% of our total revenues would really be susceptible to U.S. weather patterns. The industrial business, the Business Products Group, Europe, Australia, look we track weather we track weather around the world. I'm looking at floods in the U. K. and mild winter in Europe, record heat in Australia. So we look at whether around the world. And honestly, I tend not to dwell on it that much anymore since there's not a heck of a lot we can do about it. We're six weeks into the New Year, Chris. We'll see some ebbs and flows throughout the year. But I would tell you as we sit right now, we're confident in our full year guidance for automotive. Carol Yancey : And Chris, we are implying a comp increase for our U.S. business in 2020 of around 2% to 3%, which is very consistent with what we saw for 2019. And that's what we've modeled into our guidance. Christopher Horvers : Got you. And one last one. I'm not sure if you have this but Carol, do you \u2013 can you help us out with, so there's a lot going on with acquisitions and divestitures sizable ones. Can you just help us, as we think about 2020 versus what you just reported for 2019, what's the net impact at the operating profit and operating margin line from the mixture of everything that's going on? I'm not sure, if you have that but clearly I think you got some rate benefit but maybe some profit dollar loss. So help us reconcile that. Thanks so much. Carol Yancey : Yes. That for 2019, the core business if you will was without the impact of the acquisitions and divestitures was something around at $0.20 is what was factored in there. Christopher Horvers : $0.20 headwind? Carol Yancey : You're talking about 2019 Or 2020? Christopher Horvers : 2020 versus 2019? Carol Yancey : I'm sorry. I was \u2013 for 2020 \u2013 and that's \u2013 I'm sorry for that. But for 2020, we have implied, we will have operating margin improvement in our automotive and industrial businesses. And we have implied a 20 basis points improvement in our operating margin that largely relates to the cost reductions that we talked about and the work that the transformation office is doing. And that would be what would be in our numbers for 2020 and it would obviously be greater than that going into 2021. So that excludes all the impact from acquisitions and divestitures. Christopher Horvers : Got it. Thanks so much. Best of luck. Paul Donahue : Thanks. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of the Liz Suzuki of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. First, I just wanted to ask about capital allocation priorities in 2020. I know you laid out the four bucket there. But it seems like you're kind of taking down the debt levels a little bit despite very low interest rates. So I was curious, if a large acquisition opportunity came up that would be in the auto or the industrial business, where you might have to lever up a little bit to do it. Do you have a threshold to which you would aim to keep that leverage? Carol Yancey : Yeah. That's a great question. As you know, we have certainly taken our leverage up and we're definitely comfortable in the 2.5 to 3 times indefinitely for the right acquisition opportunity. That is something that -- when we think about a larger more strategic acquisition opportunity, those are things that you can always control. The timing, there's nothing in the horizon right now. We'll continue with our bolt-ons which are probably in the 1% to 2% range, as we look ahead. So we think the leverage that we have right now comfortable with that we know we have flexibility as we look ahead. And we would again just take into account what we already have coming into our numbers for 2020. We have a carryover impact to this is pretty nice -- on acquisition. So probably more of just the bolt-ons just for 2020. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. And I'll just take on one more if you wouldn't mind. Did you guys -- I may have missed this and did you talk about transaction growth versus average ticket in the U.S. auto business? And how that's been trending versus the last couple of quarters? Paul Donahue : No, Liz. I did not cover that. But it's a similar trend as we'd seen over the last few quarters, which is, nice growth in Q4 in our invoice in the size of our invoices. So nice mid-single-digit growth with a slight decrease in the number of invoices per store per day. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. Paul Donahue : You're welcome. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Matt McClintock of Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions. Matt McClintock : Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. Paul Donahue : Good morning. Matt McClintock : I was wondering, you bought up the impact project and you have now done that in 200 independents. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color or update us on what you saw in those independents in terms of lift, et cetera, in 2019. And then how quickly can you accelerate that, the adoption of new independents, should you decide that this is where from -- were of continued efforts. Thanks. Paul Donahue : Great question, Matt. This has been a multi-year project for us. We're at -- between the last couple of years we've done over a couple of hundred of our independent stores. And it's a comprehensive upgrade. It's everything from extending store hours; improving the retail storefront, changing out some of the product assortment. Probably one of the most important aspects of the program is adding business development managers in the stores as well. So we're expecting to ramp this project up in 2020. And actually looking for 300-plus stores in 2020, on the independent side. We fully completed and rolled out our company-owned store group and we are seeing some significant increases over our typical run rate when we do the full impact program. Matt McClintock : Okay. Thanks for that color. And then if I could have one more. Just on coronavirus, understand that for the Industrial business probably limited impact of new supply chain. But I suspect there's probably potential meaningful impact on your customer supply chains and that could lead to less activity. Just wondering I know this is a tough question to ask, but you're probably at a better position to give us color or help us to conceptualize how the impact on your customers' supply chains will actually flow through to your own topline? Any color there at all would be helpful from a derivative standpoint or a secondary standpoint. Thanks. Paul Donahue : Yes. Matt look it is -- as you know and it is a tough question because it's an incredibly fluid situation. We've been on the phone only with all of our business unit heads talking about not really our own supply chain which I covered in my prepared comments, but also some of our good customers as well. I would tell you it's early. We have not felt any downward pressure on our numbers from our customers at this point, but I would tell you that we are staying incredibly close to it and will continue to monitor the situation. Matt McClintock : Thanks for that color. I know it's hard, appreciate it. Paul Donahue : Yes. All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your questions. Daniel Imbro : Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Daniel Imbro : Paul would love to hear your update on the European market. I think you noted a growth return of relatively flat year-over-year. Pretty nice sequential proven. Can you talk about what the primary drivers of that will maybe industry versus company specific and kind of how you're thinking about that growth as we head into 2020? Paul Donahue : Yes. Thanks Daniel. We're quite pleased with the progress we've made with our European business. We had no doubt a tough Q2 and Q3 in Europe. What's interesting as you dive into those numbers, they're different markets. So, Q2, our French team and a challenging quarter; Q3, our U.K team had a challenging quarter. Both rebounded nicely in Q4 to get us to flat overall comp. Germany on the other hand showed growth in Q4, which certainly we were pleased to see. I would tell you that from our perspective, our team in 2018 and in the first half of 2019, they were very focused on integrating this business and doing all the things necessary to bring a privately-held European business under the umbrella of the U.S. publicly-traded company. I would tell you that that focus now has shifted in the second half of 2019 and as you going to 2020 more on growing this business, taking market share, and doing other things that this business has been for the past 30 years. So, despite some remaining complicated economic issues and some of those markets, we are certainly more bullish going into 2020 just because our team is focused on all the right things and focused on driving market share and growing our business. Daniel Imbro : Got it. And as a follow-up on that. It sounds like looking for more growth over there, that should I would think lead the margin leverage given the weaken sales led to deleverage last year. But Carol I think your answer just said most of the auto expansion should come from cost-cutting. So, how do I reconcile maybe those two statements? And what kind of impacts should be expected Europe to have on the automotive operating margin in 2020? Carol Yancey : Yeah. So for our automotive business and as Paul mentioned, their comps were down something around 3% for the full year, and in the fourth quarter about 40 bps of the 50 bp decline in our automotive margin was Europe and then other smaller impact was due to the slowdown in Canada in Q4. When you look at the full year, we would say that all of the decrease in the automotive margin was Europe, so stronger margin, obviously, in our U.S. business and Australasia business. So when we look ahead and remember that team started on their cost cutting in Q2 and they have been working very hard. And we actually saw some progress on -- in the second half of the year and we're certainly seeing further improvement that will come in 2020. We're modeling the comps of up 1% to up 2% for Europe in 2020. And with all the cost reductions that they've done and the further changes they made at the end of the year that gives them a flattish margin in 2020 and certainly as we look ahead, we would see that to be improved in 2021 and beyond. Daniel Imbro : Got it. And then maybe my last follow-up. Carol, just switching to the industrial site. I think you said the outlook calls for 2% or 3% growth, which includes slightly positive comps. One, did I hear that correctly? And two, what do you think the cadence of that growth should look like given -- you noted the recent infection higher in PMI and some of the leading indicators? Thanks. Carol Yancey : Yeah. So the 2% to 3% for the industrial outlook for 2020 and I would tell you, you have to remember to take into account that excludes the EIS amount. So the 2% to 3% implies something of 1.5% to down 2% comp. And I would tell you that that is primarily our Motion, North American business, probably more so in the first half, a little weaker, hopefully a little bit better in the second half. Our Australasian business and Inenco, they have comps of around up 2% in 2020. So we've implied something of a 1.5% to down 2% for 2020. Having said that, again with the cost reductions and the work that the transmission team is doing and the work that that business has done all-in 2019, they will have some operating margin improvement in 2020 despite having comps down 1.5% to 2%. So the team's done a great job in that area as we look ahead. Daniel Imbro : Got it. Best of luck. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning guys. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Carol, I might have missed this, but did you talk about how you've done on the payable side on the AAG business? Carol Yancey : We have not. And it's a great question Bret. We -- while you didn't necessarily see the impact directly in our Q4 working capital. I would tell you with the introduction of the private label and some of the works that our global procurement teams have done, they were able to achieve about $50 million in working capital improvements in 2019, and then we look ahead in 2020, we think we'll have another $50 million. And those are even greater than just Europe because we\u2019re getting some global savings, global working capital savings as well. And then on the other side, we are definitely on track and we will have our $25 million of procurement gross margin synergies by the end of 2020. And we were right on track with that as well. And that does not take into account the implied income statement benefit on these payable terms. So we've implied that in our 2020 working capital guidance to see that $100 million-plus coming into 2020. Bret Jordan : Okay. Great. And then I guess, when you look at Europe, what is the private label mix over there? And I think Paul called out some real strength in the U.K. battery business in the fourth quarter. I think they have had a mild winter. Are you guys doing something differently there on the promotional side or market share shifts that you're seeing? Paul Donahue : Well, to your first question Bret, the private label market in Europe is minimal. And AAG, our business there, they had a number of different private labels in different product categories. But it was certainly not an impactful part of their overall product mix. We have launched the NAPA brand now and in a few categories in the U. K, we're in the process of rolling that into Germany \u2013 I mean, into France and ultimately into the Netherlands. We're quite pleased with the acceptance we\u2019re seeing from our customers and you know, we have a separate battery business in the U.K. Bret that we acquired 12 to 18 months ago, called Platinum. And it is a strong player in the U.K. in the battery business. So it's a part of AAG, but that would account for some of the strength that we\u2019re seeing in and again, they've gotten behind the NAPA logo and the NAPA brand and are doing quite well. So we're pleased. And our goal will be to roll that NAPA brand across Europe. Bret Jordan : Okay. So the U. K. strength is more your strategy in the U.K. and not the category in the U.K.? Paul Donahue : Correct. That would be accurate. Bret Jordan : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next quarter comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Seth. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Seth Basham : My question just reverting to the U.S. NAPA business. Can you give a sense of cadence for the comps through the quarter? And how your thinking about that cadence of comps through 2020? That would be helpful. Paul Donahue : Yes. The cadence for the quarter Seth, if I look at GPC in total automotive, we're pretty steady throughout the quarter with actually November and December, slightly stronger than October. Automotive trended positive, U.S. automotive trended positive really every month with a solid December, probably unlike some of the other reports that we've heard but we did find in December, and again I think part of that goes back to some of the initiatives that our team launched in the quarter. I mean in the month and in the quarter. As I look across 2020, hard to say Seth, we again I mentioned earlier, we're we only six weeks into the year. We're going to see ebbs and flows as we go. But one thing we are encouraged is we're seeing some really cold weather hit the Midwest this week and looks like some big snow up in the Northeast. So that will blow out a lot of the inventory that's sitting in our customers shelves and hopefully propel us into a better spring. Seth Basham : Got it. Thank you. And then as a follow-up question. You guys have been doing a great job on gross margins with improvement for the past four years. You talk to a flattish gross margins in 2020. Can you just help us understand why we're likely to see a slowdown in that progress? Carol Yancey : Yes. I would say that our team has done a great job, especially in the tariff environment and really pleased to see it across the automotive and industrial businesses. A lot of our pricing strategies and a lot of our supply chain initiatives we're doing, we believe there still is some opportunities for that to increase. We're just sort of modeling flattish and maybe a bit of improvement. Now, remember, some of the improvement this year is related to the net improvement from acquisitions and also, honestly, acquisitions and divestitures. So some of it is coming from that, which we would anniversary that next year. Seth Basham : Understood. Thank you very much and good luck. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Seth. Carol Yancey : Thanks. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey, guys. It's Scot Ciccarelli. So a question on kind of the 2020 guidance. I guess, I'm trying to understand your expectations for, let's call it, core margins in auto and industrial versus what's the impact from cost-reduction action? So like, if you were to kind of take a step back, would you expect kind of core auto and industrial to have flat core margins? And the 20 basis point lift for the full year comes from layering in those cost efforts? Or are you expecting some deterioration because of the low top line growth? But it's more than made up for the cost reductions. I think that will help everyone understand kind of the cadence for both 2020 and then how these trends may roll through into 2021? Thanks. Carol Yancey : Yes. So as we mentioned, when you look at our automotive and industrial business, we are implying operating margin improvement there. That is coming from - the majority of that is coming from improvements in their cost savings. So you would say, without the cost savings it would've been more like flat. I would tell you, what we're really pleased to see is, especially like in the automotive business, for example, with comps of 2% to 3%, we're able to leverage and improve operating margin for the first time in a couple of years. So, again, this cost reduction and the transformation that we're talking about is giving us something better than a flattish margin with some of these low comps. And remember, the industrial businesses got a comp of down 1.5% to down 2%. And yet, they will, as well, have operating margin improvement. What you - and this gets back to the gross margin thing, you're going to see that more in the SG&A line. And that's why we've kind of implied a flattish gross margin with our improvement coming through SG&A. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. That's very helpful. And so, as you kind of think about the amount of cost savings that flow through - that you actually capture in 2020, because it's a run rate by the end of 2020 that gets you to $100 million. You're capturing, what, about half, kind of $40 million to $45 million, would be my estimate? Carol Yancey : Yes. That's reasonable. The $100 million in saving is about 2% decrease in our SG&A. So we're modeling about half of that in our AG&A, about a 1% decrease. And so, then again, as you look ahead in 2021 we would have the full benefit of that. And the other thing I'd mention, our transformation office and transmission team, they're hard at identifying other opportunities. So we're not just stopping with this first lift, if you will, of the $100 million. They've got a pretty exciting packet with all of our businesses and a team that's working on a lot of new initiatives that we hope to be able to speak about in the quarters ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Yes. All makes sense. Thanks a lot guys. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Scot. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to follow up on Scott's question for a bit. So that $40 million to $45 million that you're anticipating for 2020, what is like the cadence of that? Seems like you've taken a lot of non-GAAP cost in Q4 which I think would mean the cost of taking out of this point. But wanted to get a sense of cadence of how we see the cost takeouts planning throughout the year? Carol Yancey : Yes. I mean I guess it would be -- we did -- you're right -- and remember a majority of these first round of the $100 million, the majority of that is headcount because as you know 60%, 65% of our SG&A is headcount. So, with the payroll -- we did recognize those costs in Q4, the payroll start to -- you start to see that into Q1, but you definitely some of the other things will come a little bit later in the year. So, that's why we have some of the initiatives that come maybe in Q2 through Q4. So, it's not exactly divided by four quarters. But again as we've got some facilities, some consolidation amongst branches and operations those would come later in the year. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. And then more of a longer term question, as you have the dependence on making it a necessary store-up on investments to position their businesses to the future. Have you been to kind of rethink your long-term store potential? Do you still expect the majority of your stores will be independently owned versus company-owned or do you foresee the opportunity for some of these conversations to precipitate like higher store ownership of the company? Paul Donahue : Yes. Interesting question Chris. We -- look we're always evaluating our store models and store mix. Today of our 6,000 stores, roughly 5,000 are independently owned. We've had that mix for a number of years. We do not see any massive shift here in the quarters or even a year or two to come. We've got some great independent owners who are investing in their business, expanding their business. We have owners coming into our model all the time and so at this rate -- at this point in time, Chris, there is no strategy to shift to a 50/50 mix per se of independent and company stores. We're pleased with the progress. We're pleased with some of the new talent that will bring into our independent store group. I would also tell you that it is our intent to expand our company store group and to continue to open new company-owned stores and if you look at our recent history, Chris, we've closed a number of underperforming and non-profitable stores. We think a good bit of that heavy lifting while there is always some of that to be done, a good bit of that is now behind us and it's our intent to grow our company-owned store base from here going forward. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. That's really helpful. Thank you for the time. Paul Donahue : All right. Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back quarter management for any closing marks. Carol Yancey : We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's year end conference call. We appreciate your support and investment in Genuine Parts Company and we look forward to reporting out on our Q1 results. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to General Parts Company First Quarter and 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sidney Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company first quarter 2020 conference call to discuss our earnings results and COVID-19 business update. I\u2019m here with Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s conference call and webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation that can be found on the Genuine Parts Company Investor Relations website. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today\u2019s discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today\u2019s call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company\u2019s latest SEC filings, including this morning\u2019s press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid. And welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We hope you are staying safe and enjoying good health in these challenging times, and we appreciate you joining us today for our review of this morning\u2019s release. We would like to begin today\u2019s call with a few comments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its significant impact around the world. Our hearts go out to the millions of people affected by COVID-19, and we thank those health care providers and first responders on the front lines of our fight against this outbreak. Their commitment to the care and protection of our communities is admirable and greatly appreciated. We also owe a debt of gratitude to our associates across the global GPC family. Our team members have lived our GPC values every day and stepped up with powerful displays of commitment to each other, our customers and our communities. Working as a team, we rallied to navigate the crisis to ensure our employees stay healthy, our operations remain safe and our teams are well positioned to serve our customers\u2019 critical needs. Each of our three business segments are classified as essential businesses, and we are proud to be able to take care of our customers during these unprecedented times. Like everyone, new protocols at our facilities require us to adjust the way we conduct business. To highlight a few examples, we now make mask, sanitizer and other PPE widely available for our team mates, direct movement patterns within buildings, mandate social distancing and implement temperature checks in many of our operations. We created flexible operating policies for our associates and our customers, implemented remote work plans and develop phase attendant strategies to ensure a safe environment. Importantly, we stepped up our communication approach with our global employee base. We distribute daily and weekly updates to provide information and progress reports on our collective efforts. Our technology platforms and talented IT teams have worked hard to enable a seamless transition to our new technological reality. Despite all our new routines, our 55,000 associates remain positive, productive and connected. We are also exceptionally proud to recognize our colleagues who have been so generous to give back to our communities throughout this crisis. We have continued our support of numerous charitable organizations, including internal relief funds that support fellow GPC team mates the need and have many examples where we have donated PPE and cleaning and safety supplies to hospitals and health care centers. In addition, our employees volunteered their time to numerous worthy causes. Giving back has and always will be a core GPC value. Given the circumstances, we will start by sharing a few first quarter highlights, and then we want to turn to, one, the business environment over the past 90 days; and two, how our teams have responded. After that, I\u2019ll provide commentary on each of the business segments before handing the call over to Carol to detail the financial results. So total sales for the first quarter were $4.6 billion, up 1.1%, excluding the impact of divestitures or down approximately 3.7% on a reported basis. For perspective, sales were up over 2% through February, despite mild weather and mixed industrial end market trends. Sales in the first half of March were also strong, up approximately 4% compared to the same period the prior year. As the virus impact accelerated, we experienced an approximate 16% sales decrease during the second half of March compared to the same period the prior year. Net income in the first quarter 2020 was $137 million and earnings per share were $0.94, with adjusted net income at $133 million or $0.92 per share. We estimate an approximate 3% negative impact to net sales and a $0.21 negative impact to EPS during the first quarter 2020 contributed to COVID-19. Moving to the business environment and our response. You might recall from our February earnings call, we highlighted the strong momentum the teams were building with a solid fourth quarter in 2019 performance. We entered 2020 focused on our strategic growth, improving our operating performance and capital allocation initiatives. 2020 was poised to be an exciting year for GPC. In mid-February, when we released our 2019 results, we spoke to these plans and initiatives as well as commenting on supply chain operations in China, which, at the time, was impacted by the outbreak. As the impact of COVID-19 was more broadly felt around the globe, we began to see declines in demand in mid-March. National lockdowns in France and New Zealand followed and broad shelter in place mandates impacted our operations. This trend continued for the balance of the first quarter and throughout the month of April. In response to the crisis, we have elevated the cadence in which we are managing the business. I am proud of the coordinated and strong leadership demonstrated across the company over the past two months. Teams have stepped up, acted urgently and executed with discipline. We increased the frequency of our global leadership cadence and formed a cross-functional COVID-19 response team to accelerate decision-making, analyze rapidly-changing information and coordinate sharing best practices across the global teams. As a result, we took rapid action to address our cost structures given the new realities of sales volume and business activity. We developed a disciplined process to identify, analyze and prioritize nearly 50 enterprise cost actions. Select cost savings actions put in place include delayed merit increases, headcount reductions, voluntary and involuntary leave of absences, hiring freezes, executive and officer pay reductions, reduced bonuses and commissions, government subsidies collections, reduction in hours of operations, rent relief, professional fees and marketing expense reductions, T&E reductions and facility closures, to name just a few. We created detailed scenario models and built a refined financial forecast process to assess weekly performance and adjust action to business reality. Our teams continue to evaluate and implement cost savings measures to appropriately respond to the business conditions and are focused on maintaining cost discipline as our markets recover. We should mention that our global supply chain is operating well. Our supply chain, including foreign and domestic manufacturing capacity and logistics, is largely performing at levels seen prior to COVID-19. We believe the power of our global operating scale, product and geographic diversification of supplier partners and intense teamwork across our business units, create an advantage as we work to minimize any potential service disruption for our customers. We continue to monitor a few geographies in specific product categories such as PPE that are still returning to pre-crisis levels, but we are cautiously optimistic about the path to full recovery. We would be remiss if we did not take the opportunity to publicly thank our GPC procurement teams and our valued suppliers for their unwavering partnership and support. Now let\u2019s turn to a review of our business segments, beginning with our global automotive group. For the first quarter, this group represented 57% of total revenues and had a sales decline of 1%, excluding divestitures. In our North American operations, U.S. automotive sales were down 3.8% in the first quarter, with comp sales down 5.7%. Primarily, the sales decline reflects the combination of a slow start to 2020 due to the mild winter weather that pressured sales in January and February and the impact of COVID-19 in the last half of March. While sales started strong in March, up 7% through midmonth, sales fell by 24% over the final two weeks of the quarter. These headwinds drove sales declines in both the commercial and retail segments of our business. And while the DIFM segment, which represents 80% of our total U.S. automotive sales, outperformed our DIY sales for the quarter overall. This flipped in late March with DIY showing more resilience throughout this crisis. Under the current business conditions, online orders have increased significantly and have been an important factor in driving DIY sales. Our omnichannel initiatives, such as buy online, pick up in store, curbside pickup and expanded ship-to-home capabilities, including next-day delivery to every U.S. market, allow our customers a variety of convenient options when making a purchase. In addition, this environment has prompted us to provide additional services, such as same-day store deliveries on the DIY side and touchless delivery for our commercial customers. We believe that these services will prove to enhance our customer value proposition in both the near and long term. Before leaving our U.S. automotive operations, we thought we would share an update on the financial state of our independent owners and our good AutoCare customers. As we mentioned in our April six release, our NAPA team, along with several of our financial partners, are working closely with these independently-owned businesses to help them benefit from the financial assistance available to them. This has involved continued education regarding several programs, including the Cares Act. To date, the vast majority of our independent NAPA owners have applied for PPP assistance with 60% receiving funding and expect a decline. The majority of our owners have also applied for other financial support, such as loan payment deferrals and standard SBA loans for disaster relief. Importantly, we would emphasize that none of our NAPA owners had to close their businesses due to COVID-19. In addition, among our NAPA AutoCare center customers, most of which remain open for business, more than 60% have filed for assistance with over 40% currently funded. We are confident in the financial stability of these key partners and we\u2019ll continue to work with them to ensure they pull-through these difficult times. In Canada, we also experienced mid-single digit comp sales declines, which were partially offset by acquisitions. Through February, our Canadian business was trending slightly positive. Although sales began to gradually slow in early March before falling 25% over the last half of the month, in accordance with provincial shelter in place orders. In Europe, our automotive sales were up 14%, driven by the incremental benefit from the PartsPoint and Todd acquisitions in 2019. Sales were offset by a high single digit decline in core sales, driven primarily by COVID-19 as well as the impact of foreign currency. After posting relatively flat comp through February, sales in Europe slowed significantly in early March and were especially pressured following the March 17 preemptive government lockdown in France. France is our largest market in Europe, representing approximately 39% of total European revenues. And we look forward to the easing of these restrictions later this month. In light of our earlier expectations for much improved results for Europe in 2020, the current conditions represent a temporary setback, which our team is addressing via several measures, including aggressive cost reductions. In addition, with a vast network of operations across several key regions, including France, the U.K., Germany, Poland, the Netherlands and Belgium, we continue to view our expanded footprint in a large and fragmented European marketplace as an important competitive advantage. We are committed to our growth strategy for these operations and expect this business to emerge from the pandemic well positioned to actively build on its market-leading position in the recovery. Our strongest automotive results were in Australia and New Zealand, where we posted low single-digit comp growth and operating margin expansion despite a significant negative impact from foreign currency translation. This region was the least affected by COVID-19 in March. Although New Zealand, which represents less than 20% of our Australasian automotive revenues, was also under a mandatory lockdown. As in the U.S., online sales have been strong through this crisis and a solid driver of retail sales for this region. We continue to support our customers through buy online, pick up in store, and deliver from store capabilities, utilizing the Repco store fleet of delivery vehicles in all markets. With the dramatic growth in online demand, the timeliness of the Sparesbox acquisition in 2019 has proven especially beneficial. Sparesbox is Australia\u2019s leading online automotive parts and accessories business. And we have utilized its specialized expertise to enhance our understanding of the digital marketplace and improve our omnichannel capabilities in Australasia and across our global automotive operations. So that\u2019s a recap of the global automotive group and our first quarter performance. The headwinds we experienced relative to COVID-19 had a significant impact on demand late in the quarter. And despite our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of the aftermarket, we expect a decline in miles driven, consumer spending and overall economic activity to continue to pressure this segment over the near term. Now turning to our global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales were $1.5 billion, up 4.7%, excluding the EIS divestiture. North American comp sales were down 3.1%, including an approximate 1% decline in sales due to the impact of COVID-19. This was offset by the addition of Inenco in Australasia as well as other acquisitions, which contributed 7.8% of sales. Inenco was acquired in July of 2019 and performed well in the first quarter despite the challenges of the lockdown in New Zealand as well as Southeast Asia. Looking further at Motion Industries, our North American industrial operations, the slowdown in the industrial economy over the last five to six months in 2019 was showing the early signs of a recovery in January and February. Leading indicators, such as the purchasing managers index and industrial production, pointed to a stabilizing industrial economy until March when COVID-19 presented a new set of challenges for the industry. The growing pressure on demand related to customer closures and the broad decline in economic activity over the last two weeks of March led to just two of our 14 product categories posting positive year-over-year sales gains in the first quarter. This, of course, includes our safety products category, which has benefited from the heightened demand for PPE and other safety supplies throughout the crisis. By industry sector, all 12 key groups posted year-over-year sales declines, ranging from slight decreases for the food processing and aggregate and cement sectors, to double-digit declines for equipment and machinery, iron and steel, automotive and oil and gas. Despite the current sales environment, the Motion team operated well and delivered their eighth consecutive quarter of operating margin improvement. Thus far, in the second quarter, the economic pressure of COVID-19 has continued to impact the demand environment. With that said, we sell to thousands of customers, representing a diverse cross-section of industry sectors, which should soften the level of sales declines for this business. Likewise, we continue to expand our automation solutions capabilities and prepare for the surge in demand associated with incremental maintenance and repairs in a recovery. We are actively tracking the status of our customers\u2019 factories and seeing more customers returning to work and opening their plant. This is a positive development for the industry, which we expect to drive improved demand for our core industrial categories, including powered transmission and electrical products, hydraulics, pneumatics and conveyance, among others. Rounding out our business segment updates, the Business Products Group reported sales of $468 million, down 2.3% or up 1.5%, excluding the impact of its SPR Canada and GCN divestitures. The 1.5% sales increase reflects the positive impact of especially strong sales of jan/san and safety supplies, which we began to see in connection with the COVID-19 in early March. This category was up 28% from last year and accounted for 46% of total revenues for this business segment in the first quarter. Sales in this category have offset the declines in our core business products categories. And while we expect these trends to continue as we battle through COVID-19, we anticipate a more challenging second quarter relative to Q1. Looking beyond these near-term trends, we continue to evaluate our longer-term plans for this business. So with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Carol to give you a deeper look at our financials for the quarter. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. Total GPC sales were $4.6 billion in the first quarter, down 3.7% from 2019 or up 1.1%, excluding the impact of divestitures. For the quarter, we were pleased to report our tenth consecutive increase in our quarterly gross margin, with gross margin improving to 32.9% from 31.8% in 2019 or up 108 basis points. The improvement primarily reflects the favorable impact of divestitures and acquisitions of higher gross margin businesses in automotive and industrial. These items as well as favorable product mix shifts were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volume. The pricing environment stabilized in the first quarter from relatively high levels of inflation in 2019, primarily associated with tariffs in automotive and Business Products. In addition to the slight carryover effect of these tariffs in the first quarter, additional supplier price changes thus far in 2020 have been flat in automotive, 0.4% in Industrial and 0.5% in office. So overall, pricing had a slightly favorable impact to sales for the quarter, and we expect only minor price inflation through the balance of 2020. Turning to our selling, administrative and other expenses. This line item was $1.23 billion in the first quarter or up 2.4% from last year. Or up an adjusted 2.7%, excluding the impact of transaction and other costs, and this represents 27% of sales on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. These operating costs were up from last year due to several factors, including the loss of leverage on our expenses related to the lower-than-expected sales volumes and the impact of divestitures and acquisitions with higher cost models. In addition, the effect of rising costs in areas such as freight and delivery, insurance, IT and cybersecurity also drove the increase. With that said, we were pleased to see improving trends in several key areas such as payroll and legal and professional expenses. Costs in these categories were down from last year, which primarily reflects the favorable impact of our $100 million in cost-saving initiatives announced last year. We expect these improving trends to continue through the balance of the year given the positive momentum of these initiatives as well as our new and accelerated cost actions that are taken in association with the COVID-19 impact. Combining the SG&A line with our other operating and non-operating expenses, total operating and non-operating expenses were $1.32 billion for the first quarter in 2020. This is an increase of 1.9% from last year or an adjusted increase of 4.6% and represents 29% of sales on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. Our total segment operating profit in the first quarter was $276 million, down 14% on a 4% sales decrease or down 10% on a 1% sales increase, excluding divestitures. Our operating profit margin was 6.1% compared to 6.8% last year. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 23.7%, which is a decrease from the 24.2% in the prior year and due primarily to the net effect of shifts in income mix as well as favorable valuation allowances related to the gain on the insurance proceeds for the SPR fire, offset by less favorable stock option activity. Excluding onetime transaction, restructuring and other costs and income, our adjusted tax rate, which does not benefit from the valuation allowances just discussed, was up from last year to 25.8%. Our net income in the first quarter was $137 million and earnings per share of $0.94 and compares to $160 million and earnings per share of $1.10 last year. Our adjusted net income of $133 million or $0.92 per share compares to $187 million or $1.28 per share for 2019. Now let\u2019s discuss our first quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the first quarter was $2.6 billion, down 1.6% from the prior year or down approximately 1%, excluding Auto Todo, which we divested in March of 2019. Our operating profit of $142 million was down 21%, with operating margin of 5.5% compared to 6.8% reported margin in the first quarter of 2019. The decline in margin primarily reflects the COVID-19 headwinds in our U.S., Canadian and European businesses. This was partially offset by the improved operating margin in Australasia, which delivered another solid quarter. As we move forward, we expect to see additional pressure on sales and profitability in the near term related to COVID-19 and the expected decline in miles driven. Our Industrial sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, a 7.7% decrease from Q1 of last year or up approximately 5%, excluding the EIS divestiture. Operating profit of $114 million was down 6% from a year ago or up 5% excluding EIS. And the operating margin improved to 7.5% from the 7.4% reported last year with the increase in the margin expansion due to our core North American industrial business and the favorable impact of divestitures. For Business Products, our revenues were $468 million, down 2.3% from 2019 or up approximately 1.5%, excluding SPR Canada and GCN. Our operating profit of $20.2 million and operating margin declined slightly to 4.3% from the 4.4% reported for the first quarter last year. These results correlate to the decline in traditional office segment, offset by strong sales in the jan/san and safety category. To complete the review of our segments, we wanted to share our April daily sales results, which reflect the continued impact of COVID-19 on the overall economic environment. For the month, our total daily sales were down an estimated 25%, including approximate declines of 30% in the automotive segment, 10% in the Industrial segment and 20% in the Business Products segment. While we expect these levels of declines and the second quarter in general to represent a low point for demand across our businesses, we cannot reasonably forecast the full impact of COVID-19 in the coming months. As a result, we\u2019re planning accordingly. And as Paul discussed earlier, we\u2019ll continue to implement substantial cost-saving initiatives to sustain our operations through the current business conditions. In addition, we\u2019ve modified our near-term plans for capital allocation and implemented initiatives to more effectively manage our working capital to further preserve our cash. So now turning to the balance sheet. Our accounts receivable of $2.7 billion is down 1% from the prior year and compares to our 3.7% total sales decrease for the quarter. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables, and we continue to closely monitor our collection trends in light of the current business conditions. Our inventory at March 31 was $3.7 billion, flat from March of last year due to effective inventory management and reduced purchasing volumes. Our accounts payable of $4.1 billion is flat from last year, which correlates to the change in inventory and the lower purchasing volumes for the quarter. At March 31, our AP to inventory ratio was 110%, and which is consistent with last year and improved from 107% at December 31. Total debt of $3.6 billion is up 6% from $3.4 billion in 2019, and we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of March 31. In addition, we closed the first quarter with $1.1 billion in total available liquidity, and we continue to operate with $1.1 billion in available liquidity today. Additionally, we are pleased to report that we have amended our debt agreements to expand our debt covenants to a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.0 times, and our scenario planning supports the continued compliance with our covenants as we move forward through the year and enter 2021. We also continue to work with our banking and other global partners for additional credit capacity and other forms of financing, including the utilization of asset-based lending and other measures. We expect to continue to work further on liquidity option in the quarters ahead, and we\u2019re confident that we have ample liquidity to withstand the uncertainty associated with COVID-19. In the first quarter, we generated $72 million in cash from operations, a 20% increase from 2019. Our history of strong cash flows, which, of course, includes the Great Recession, continues to support our priorities for the use of cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. In the 3 year period of 2017 through 2019, we deployed $4.3 billion in capital across four key areas, including the reinvestment in our businesses via capital expenditures, M&A growth, net of divestitures, share repurchases and the dividend. And while we remain committed to these priorities over the long term, we have modified our current thinking in these areas to preserve cash as appropriate through the current business conditions. For example, we have reduced our forecast for capital expenditures to $150 million to $200 million in 2020, which is down from our previously announced plan for $300 million in spend. In addition, we have temporarily suspended any plans for acquisition and share repurchases. Combined, we believe these near-term changes in capital allocation will serve to enhance the company\u2019s cash position as we move through this downturn. Our current steps to conserve cash through cost savings, working capital initiatives and capital allocation reductions gives us confidence to continue to support the dividend, which we have increased for 64 consecutive years. Our current annual dividend of $3.16, represents a 4% increase from 2019 and is approximately 56% of our 2019 adjusted earnings, which is within our targeted payout ratio. Recently, our Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend payable July 1, and we remain committed to our dividend policy going forward. In these difficult times, it\u2019s especially important to thank our colleagues for their tremendous commitment to their jobs and to GPC. Our treasury, finance, IT and HR teams have all been working tirelessly to help navigate us through these uncertainties presented by COVID-19. So we\u2019d like to extend a big thank you to all of these teams, and we appreciate all their efforts. So that concludes our financial update for the first quarter of 2020, and I will now turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. We entered April well underway in our preparedness plans to protect our employees, customers and communities while also continuing to serve our customers and creating value for all of our stakeholders. Throughout the month, we were focused on the controlled execution of these plans and would highlight several key points. To date, we have been fortunate to have very few known COVID-19 cases among our 55,000 employees. A testament to the enhanced safety protocols we have implemented in our distribution centers, branches, stores and offices. Our operations are essential to our customers and remain substantially open across business segments and geographies. Our teams have been diligent and more frequent in their communications with employees and our supplier and customer partners. Our teams have been innovative in implementing new services that have proven valuable in driving sales. We have effectively realigned our capital allocation priority by reducing our capital expenditures and suspending share repurchases and M&A, while remaining committed to the dividend. And we have worked with our banks and other financial partners for additional forms of financing and amended debt covenants to provide ample liquidity through the crisis. Working together as one team, we believe the steps we are taking to stabilize our business in these unprecedented times, will position the company for strong sales and earnings growth as we exit this global pandemic. We acknowledge the unprecedented near-term challenges that we must navigate and corresponding hard work in front of us. With that said, we remain optimistic about the future as we\u2019ve had significant learnings from the current business conditions. And the industry fundamentals across our automotive and industrial operations are strong and supportive of sustained long-term growth. The circumstances of COVID-19 have required us to assess and build on our existing capabilities. And in addition to our immediate crisis response actions, each business team has developed strategic recovery plans, that detail strategic investment and productivity priorities that we believe will accelerate our momentum following the crisis. We have also accelerated the urgency and traction of various transformation initiatives that were in process while identifying others as well. This has led us to consider actions to further optimize our portfolio, such as exiting underperforming operations and improve our operational profitability, such as with our cost savings initiatives. Additionally, we discovered new and better ways of serving our customers and managing our business. Refined approaches to order fulfillment and logistics, field and functional staffing models, digital sales and marketing programs are just a few examples. The time to market of these efforts has been dramatically reduced as well. Change is difficult for any organization, but the crisis has shown our teams, we can move with discipline and urgency to make a positive difference. So in closing, while we are focused on what we can control, we do believe the long-term industry fundamentals remain favorable across our business segments. Importantly, each of our businesses compete in very large and fragmented markets. In automotive, low fuel prices, the dramatic reduction in new vehicle production, shift in travel preferences, shift in personal versus public transportation behavior, potential deferrals of new car purchases and expectations for miles driven to ultimately recover and grow over the long term are all positive tailwinds for the industry. In Industrial, our broad and diverse customer base, change in philosophies on global manufacturing and the growing demand for plant automation solutions all remain positive long-term trends. Through prior downturns, we have generated significant cash flows despite difficult sales environment, and our end markets and business model have proven resilient. The strength of our operating model and cash flow profile over the years support our consistent track record of increasing the dividend for 64 consecutive years. Moving forward, we will remain focused on taking care of our people, our customers and our communities. We will also combine urgent immediate action with activities that will position us for the future. We are incredibly proud of the hard work of our global teams. So thank you for listening. And with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. So for the auto business, in the countries where you operate, that have started to see a slowdown of new cases of COVID-19 and have started to open back up maybe a few weeks ahead of where we are in the U.S., has there been a significant rebound in auto part sales or is it pretty gradual? Paul Donahue : Liz, great question. We had a couple hour conference call with our European leadership team yesterday. And our markets where we have seen openings, i.e., in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, we are definitely seeing a resurgence in our sales top line. Those markets, they fared better than certainly our market in France and the U.K. France has been in lockdown for the longest period of time out of our markets, the U.K. locked down in late March. So those two have been dramatically impacted. We\u2019ll see France. What we hope, France will begin gradual reopening on May 11. We think U.K. will probably be later in May. But directly to your question, Liz, we are seeing an uptick, a nice uptick in sales in both Germany and the Netherlands. Liz Suzuki : And do you think there could be a shift in consumer behavior? And maybe it\u2019s already happening in those countries that are recovering, where commuting and vacation travel starts shifting more to the automobile as opposed to public transportation or air travel? Paul Donahue : Well, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Liz, look, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess at this point. But we would certainly expect in the near-term that we will see folks gravitating to more driving, more utilization of their automobile versus jumping back on airplanes. So I would think we\u2019ll see that in all our markets, AsiaPac, Europe as well as across North America. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you, Liz. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Hey. Good morning, guys. Paul Donahue : Morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Questions around the balance sheet, I guess, given the AP to inventory at 110 and likely higher leverage ratios just on the near-term lower EBIT. Is that something that you have to be concerned about the payables programs being at such high levels, given a higher leverage ratio with those lenders? Carol Yancey : Yeah, Bret, when we think about our working capital, we are still quite comfortable with where we are with our supply chain financing, our accounts payable programs and all of our programs with our suppliers. Quite honestly, as Paul mentioned, we\u2019ve had just a terrific working relationship with our procurement teams and our suppliers. And we\u2019re still making further progress on extended terms globally across our businesses, even in these times. When we think about our leverage and the metrics that you mentioned, we\u2019re comfortable with other levers we\u2019re pulling. So we mentioned some of the things we\u2019re doing in capital allocation, be it CapEx or be it our M&A or share repurchase, all levers we can pull quite easily. We also have some other working capital metrics we\u2019re looking at and making progress on. So in the area of inventory management, and then keeping just a tight eye on AR. So no, we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are, and we expect to hold on to that ratio as we move ahead and to still get working capital improvement. Bret Jordan : And I guess, you mentioned participating maybe some asset-based lending is - what are your plans around the balance sheet as far as for the liquidity? Carol Yancey : Yeah. So no, great question. As we did our modeling and worked with our banking and financial partners and did increase our covenant through the end of this year. And we\u2019re quite comfortable that we\u2019ll remain in compliance with that covenant without these other options. Again, with the capital allocation levers we pulled and some of our working capital improvement, we believe we\u2019ll be in compliance without doing other asset-based lending. But having said that, our treasury teams work continuously looking at many different options and whether it\u2019s an AR securitization or some real estate structure type transaction or quite honestly, we\u2019re also pursuing some international loans that are being made available in some of the geographies we have in Europe that\u2019s attractive financing. So we honestly believe we can be in compliance without doing those things, but we\u2019re being prudent to continue to model and look at what may make sense as we move ahead during what will be probably the toughest quarter from a balance sheet standpoint in Q2. Bret Jordan : Okay. Great. And then one macro auto question. You said that none of the NAPA U.S. independents had closed their doors. Do you see this event sort of driving some contraction in the total number of doors, whether it be other independent buying group members? But do you see this sort of being shocking enough that we\u2019re going to shrink the total number of stores in the auto parts space? Paul Donahue : Well, Bret, it certainly is possible. We - I don\u2019t know that the automotive aftermarket is going to be that significantly different from other small businesses that have been impacted. I will tell you that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our - many of our independent owners have already taken part in the PPP and are financially strong as well as many of our NAPA AutoCare centers, as well, have taken advantage. So we think that, if anything, Bret, there perhaps may be some acquisition opportunities down the road for a company like ours with as strong a balance sheet as we continue to maintain. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Paul Donahue : Yeah. Thank you, Bret. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Gustavo Gonzalez : Hi. Good morning. This is actually Gustavo Gonzalez on for Scot. Thanks for taking our questions. So your comments suggest that kind of trend deteriorated further in April versus March. And I know it\u2019s a limited data set, but the cadence in April stayed sort of relatively flat in all segments? Or did it improve or get worse from there sort of as the month progressed? Paul Donahue : Okay. So I\u2019ll take a shot at that. What we saw in the month of April is sequential improvement throughout the month that has now carried over into May. So really, what we saw here in the U.S. is as states reopened, we saw our business ramp back up. We expect to see the same in Europe, as I mentioned earlier, as we\u2019ve already seen in Germany and the Netherlands. We certainly expect that in Asia Pac as well. And as France comes back online, the U.K., we fully expect to see our business ramp back up. In Asia Pacific, we - New Zealand was in a total lockdown mode. That country is now reopening, and we\u2019ve seen a resurgence in business, both in automotive and Industrial. Gustavo Gonzalez : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then one more for me. So the declines in auto, the cadence has seen your end, your own stores and kind of what you\u2019re seeing with your wholesale sales to your independents. How different is that? Is there any delta you guys are seeing there? And then I know you guys said no closures on the impendent front currently, but how solvent with the current sales volumes do you think they can kind of last 20%, 30% down in sales? Paul Donahue : Yeah. So let me take the first question first. So between our company stores and our independent-owned stores, the numbers and trends were very similar, so not a big discrepancy between those two. What I would say and I\u2019ll repeat what I said earlier, I believe the number that I\u2019ve seen most recently is 60% of our independent owners have successfully applied for PPP funds. So to this point, our independent owners are in good shape. I believe over 90% have applied. And as you know, it\u2019s the banking system. Some of the applications have moved a bit slower, but we do believe that the program that the Fed has put out will benefit. And as it\u2019s designed to, should benefit small independent-owned businesses, like our good NAPA independent-owned stores as well as our NAPA AutoCare centers. So we think in the long haul, our group will be just fine. Gustavo Gonzalez : Got it. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Paul Donahue : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. David Bellinger : Great. Thank you. And I hope everyone is staying safe. Just following up on the U.S. auto business and the sequential improvement, you mentioned week to week. How are you thinking about the stimulus checks and the flow to consumers? How big of a factor was that to help the improvement? And can you talk about any regional differences that have stood out lately or a certain subset of stores that are performing better or worse than the overall automotive average? Paul Donahue : Yeah, David. Welcome. We\u2019re happy to have you on our account. I\u2019ll tackle the second question first in terms of regional differences, probably no surprise where we have seen the most pressure from a regional standpoint is in the Northeast. So our good owners and company stores in and around New York, Boston, have really been challenged, again, should not be a surprise. The Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. was pressured as well. On the flip side, our business has maintained relatively well in the Midwest as well as the Mountain area, which - those two regions of the country also had good fourth quarters as well. So we appreciate the great job our leadership teams are doing in both those markets. In terms of the stimulus checks, we would think that it can only be a positive. It\u2019s hard to track, David, exactly to pinpoint if we\u2019ve seen a lift week to week as a result of stimulus checks, but we have to believe that\u2019s a positive. I would also mention that - and as I did in my prepared remarks, we have seen a big uptick in our online and digital business, all across the GPC businesses. So again, the stimulus checks can only benefit our business in the long haul. David Bellinger : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Then just following up on the strong online sales you just mentioned to the DIY customers. Can you elaborate on what you\u2019re seeing there? Maybe give us a sense of magnitude of how much that channel has picked up. And could this become a more substantial piece of the business going forward? Paul Donahue : Yeah, great question. And look, we\u2019ve been investing in our online efforts both here in the U.S. as well as Australia. You might remember, David, I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, we did an acquisition in Australia last year of the leading online purveyor of auto parts, a company called Sparesbox, very timely acquisition for us. They brought a tremendous level of expertise and knowledge around all things digital, but also great automotive knowledge as well. So our business in Australia is up three times here over the last couple of months. Our business in the U.S. is up two times. Now granted, it is a fairly small base that we\u2019re coming off of. But we\u2019re thrilled with what we\u2019re seeing, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in our digital efforts across all of our businesses. David Bellinger : Got it. Thank you very much. Paul Donahue : Yeah. Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Thanks. I had a question for Carol and then Paul. Carol, could you help us understand the - what you think the variable margin is the business now? Is it - can we still use something like 25% or 30%, as things come under pressure? And is that still a good number? Or does that come back out? And then, Paul, I guess, really thinking about those trends you talked about, how much stronger was DIY than do it for me? Was it possible that it\u2019s actually up in April? And also in Industrial, if you could answer what the trends have been there since the second half of March and now into May, if it\u2019s accelerating or still decelerating? Paul Donahue : Yeah, okay. I\u2019ll let Carol tackle the first question. Carol Yancey : Yeah. So Greg, you\u2019re still correct on the 25% to 30% on the variable, and that is still a correct assumption. And when you mentioned, just a comment on the Industrial, as we mentioned, what April sales were for the Industrial business. So we - as Paul mentioned, each one of our businesses were better second half of April than they were first half of April, and that applies to the Industrial business as well. So the number that we gave for April would be Motion and Inenco together, Motion being a bit more down than what we gave you on the total reported number for April. But know that markedly different between the second half of April and the first half of April. And as Paul mentioned, that sort of continues into May. We had a good report from our industrial business as they\u2019ve seen plants start to reopening, and they\u2019ve seen this gradual economic reopening across the states and across a lot of these plants. And again, we saw that in our late April results for the industrial business. Paul Donahue : And Greg, related to your DIY versus DIFM, as mentioned. DIFM, for us, outpaced DIY in the first quarter. We did see that flip in April, as I\u2019m sure most did as states locked down. That said, I would tell you that our DIY business was still slightly down in April, although it did outpace DIFM. Greg Melich : That\u2019s great. Thanks and good luck, guys. Paul Donahue : Yeah. Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Carol Yancey : Morning. Chris Horvers : So a question on the - one follow-up question on regionality. How did the South perform like Florida, Texas? Those areas were less impacted, it seems, by the virus. So how did that perform in U.S. NAPA? And then my follow-up is you have the $100 million cost program. How much of that flowed through in the first quarter? And any comments on how that sort of might rollout and benefit the business over the rest of the year. And with the new cost-out program, can you put some numbers around that in terms of how substantial that could be? Paul Donahue : Okay. I\u2019ll tackle the regionality question, Chris, and I\u2019ll let Carol address the cost downs. Across the southern half of the U.S., our business was about in line with our overall business, certainly better than what we experienced in the Northeast, but not as good as what we saw in parts of the Midwest and the Mountain. So kind of in the middle of the pack. I think that\u2019s partially, Chris, it\u2019s probably fairly unique to our business. We have a large segment of business that\u2019s down in the islands and the Caribbean. Those stores are big volume stores, those stores all locked down early in the pandemic, and that\u2019s certainly swung, I think, a bit of the trend for us in the southern part of the U.S., but middle of the pack. And then I\u2019ll let Carol tackle some of the cost reduction question. Carol Yancey : Yeah, Chris, great question. We are on track. The $100 million of cost savings, that was largely related to as we talked about a voluntary retirement plan that was put in place at the end of last year, and we actually have tracked that. We know that a lot of those actions on and those reductions were coming out after Q1. And so we are on track with the $100 million cost savings. The accelerated actions that Paul talked about, and that\u2019s across all of our global businesses, it\u2019s 50 to 60 actions, and we listed out quite a few of those for you. We\u2019re not going to get into quantifying what they are, but know that, that is on top of the $100 million, and you\u2019re talking about some significant numbers as we look ahead that will help us as we get into what will be the toughest quarter. One favorable thing that we saw, and we called it out in our prepared remarks, for the first time in many quarters, our payroll was actually down in Q1, down slightly, excluding the impact of our acquisitions and divestitures. That\u2019s directly related to the $100 million of cost savings, the VRP actions that we took. And we - again, we haven\u2019t seen that in some time. We had reductions in legal and professional for, again, the first time in Q1. The other categories, big categories for us, such as freight and delivery and rent and facilities and IT and insurance. While those categories were up, they were not up as much as they were in the prior year. And so again, we had some improving trends in SG&A, but we had such a significant deleverage in the last part of March. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken the steps with the accelerated actions. Chris Horvers : Thanks, understood. And then as a follow-up, you talked about DIY was still slightly down in the U.S. in April, and that trends improved throughout the month. It seems like these stimulus checks really picked up the DIY side of the business. So did DIY flip to the positive as we progressed into the end of April? And did you see any improvement on the commercial side over the month as well? Paul Donahue : Well, as we said earlier, Chris, we saw our business trend up the entire month. So week to week to week. And including now into the first week in May, we\u2019ve seen our business improve. That said, our DIY business, I think your specific question, did it trend positive? It did not because we still had a significant decline in our footsteps into our stores, which, I guess, should not be surprised given how many cities and states were in total lockdown. There weren\u2019t a lot of folks out of shopping, unfortunately. Hence, the nice lift we saw in our digital and online business. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thanks very much and best of luck. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Chris. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Seth, is your line muted? Paul Donahue : Okay. I guess we lost that. Operator : Yes. Our final question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Imbro : Hey. Good morning, guys. And thanks for squeezing me in here late. Carol Yancey : Morning. Daniel Imbro : Paul, apologies if I missed this, but maybe just to clarify. Where did total organic growth shake out to for Europe? I don\u2019t - I didn\u2019t see a total number. I know you mentioned the geographies. But do you have that on hand? Carol Yancey : Yeah. So the organic growth for Q1 was down high single digits. And we had some acquisitions that were in there that related to the reported number being up 10%. And obviously, currency was a big impact in the quarter as well at a down 3%. So high single-digit down comps for March. Paul Donahue : And Daniel, we should mention, and you all know this, but certainly, Europe was hit much earlier with the pandemic than certainly North America. If there\u2019s any good news to report, as we spoke to our teams yesterday, we do believe the worst in Europe is now behind us. We have peaked out. And again, we are now making plans to reopen in France and the U.K. We\u2019ve already reopened and are doing well in Germany and the Netherlands. So the good news is the worst is behind us. The peak, we\u2019ve crossed the peak, and we have better days in front of us in Europe. Daniel Imbro : That\u2019s great. And yes, hopefully, we\u2019ll play out here, too. And then just a follow-up. So really helpful color earlier on the independents and the health of those. But if I recall, one of your plans this year for comp drivers was kind of rolling out the remodel programs across the independent chain. And the capital for that, I think, is fronted by the independent. So any update or color you can share on the pace of what we should expect for that initiative? How the independents are maybe pushing back on that? Any kind of update on how we stand on the remodel program? Paul Donahue : Yeah. And Daniel, it\u2019s a good question. And look, that initiative is still high on our priority list. I would tell you with what we\u2019re faced with and what our independent owners are faced with right now. We have put that essentially on hold. There are a few projects going here and there. But the large-scale rollout we have essentially put on hold, but it\u2019s temporary. And my hope will be that we see that ramp back up in the second half of the year. Daniel Imbro : Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Best of luck. Paul Donahue : Okay. Thanks, Daniel. Operator : We do have Seth back on the line. Well, Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Friedman : Yeah, hi. This is Nathan Friedman on for Seth. Apologies for that earlier. First question is on - regarding your April sales trends. You noted that they were down 30%. Is there any sort of differences between U.S. and Europe versus the rest - versus the chain? Any color there would be appreciated. Carol Yancey : Yeah. The 30% for the automotive, it ranges from a low of 20% to a high of 40%, 20% being Australia, Europe being more in the 40%. Canada being a little bit - Canada is similar to the 30%, U.S. being around 25%. Now that\u2019s the blended month. So in all of our geographies, as we\u2019ve mentioned previously, if the blended number is 30%, that is down something greater than 30%, the first two weeks and down something less than 30%, the second two weeks. Nathan Friedman : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Helpful color. And then my second question is just on the auto operating margins. Can you speak to any sort of year-over-year differences or the rate of declines in the U.S. and Europe versus I guess, the positive change that you reported in Australasia? Carol Yancey : Yes. So our Australasian business in Q1, they actually had favorable comps in the quarter, and they had slight margin improvement at about 20 bps. We mentioned that was the positive bright spot. They operated really well. As we mentioned previously, North American and our Europe business, with the decline in their core sales, primarily in late March related to COVID-19, about half of the automotive margin decline is Europe and about half is North America auto, and that would all be SG&A leverage. And really, again, related to the $140 million or so of sales decline related to COVID-19. Having said that, they held their gross profit dollars. Their dollars were down proportionately, but they held the gross margin and actually had slight improvement. So all a loss of leverage related to the declines in Europe and North America. Nathan Friedman : Great. Appreciate the color and best of luck going forward. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation in today\u2019s earnings call. We appreciate your support of Genuine Parts Company. And we look forward to updating you in the future. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

I will now turn the conference over to your host, Sid Jones, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Sidney Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Today's conference call and webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation that can be found on the Genuine Parts Company, Investor Relations website. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website.  Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including today's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Finally, please note that we've accounted for the Business Products segment, S.P. Richards, as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We hope you are staying safe and enjoying good health. So as we think about our quarterly performance and long-term focus, we want to highlight 4 key messages today. One, we are aggressively managing our company's operations through the challenges of COVID-19 by managing the short-term dynamics while staying focused on our long-term growth initiatives. This includes rigorous cost management as well as targeted investments to successfully position GPC in the recovery period and beyond.  Two, we delivered strong quarterly results amid the challenging backdrop as we executed on our transformation strategy and omnichannel initiatives. Three, with the sale of our Business Products segment and our streamlined portfolio, we are now well positioned to maximize the full potential of our automotive and industrial segments. And four, we continue to strengthen our financial position by reducing our debt and generating stronger free cash flow. We significantly enhanced our liquidity this quarter and remain in excellent position to deploy capital towards high ROIC initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the world in significant ways, both in our personal lives and from a business and economic perspective. We remain focused on prioritizing the health and safety of our employees and their families, our customers and our suppliers. We also want to extend another heartfelt thank you to the health care providers and first responders on the front lines of our fight against this outbreak for their commitment to the care and protection of our communities. We are proud of the tireless work by our associates across the global GPC family. As essential businesses, our operations have generally remained fully operational to fulfill critical customer needs, which required hard work under incredibly difficult circumstances. So a big thank you to our 50,000-plus team members for providing exceptional customer service to our partners around the globe.  Working as a team, we have executed with agility through the pandemic, quickly and effectively adopting new safety protocols to ensure a safe work environment. And as mentioned last quarter, we have stepped up our communications with our global teams and our Board to preempt and prepare for developments as much as possible. Overall, our intensified approach to managing our operations has enabled us to enhance our balance sheet flexibility, achieve meaningful cost savings and advanced operational excellence. During the quarter, we also took steps to advance our ESG initiatives, and we plan to highlight these many enhancements in our annual sustainability report to be issued later this year. Environmental, social and governance best practices are an important priority for GPC. Amid the ongoing effect of COVID-19, the S element of ESG has been paramount over the last several months, given the social unrest in our country and the world. At GPC, we have a long-standing corporate commitment to diversity and inclusion and we pledge to be part of an enduring solution to ensure equality for all. In addition to our progress in these areas, we were pleased to announce the sale of our business products operations, S.P. Richards, on June 30. The sale of SPR represents the culmination of a multiyear strategy to optimize our portfolio and simplify our company. Over the last 3 years, we have reshaped GPC with several divestitures, including Auto Todo, EIS and now SPR and its operations in North America. All in, these divested businesses represent approximately $3 billion in annual revenues, which we have essentially exchanged for higher return investments in our automotive and industrial segments. From here, we move forward with plans to strengthen our focus on sustainable value-enhancing growth and productivity initiatives associated with our faster growing, higher-margin core businesses.  In addition, we will continue to opportunistically expand our global footprint. Our streamlined portfolio has many notable advantages, including scale and volume, the ability to leverage shared services and global branding, as well as synergies associated with common business processes, systems, suppliers and talent. As a more simplified, service-oriented distribution company, we can better maximize the value of GPC and continue to deliver strong results and long-term value.  Now moving on to our financial performance and business update. We entered the second quarter operating in a sales environment pressured by government mandates to prevent the spread of COVID. Broad shelter-in-place restrictions and full lockdowns in markets such as France and New Zealand significantly slowed mobility and overall economic activity. As announced in our May 6 earnings call, April sales were down 30% in automotive and 10% in industrial. And while the industrial segment remained pressured throughout the quarter and was down 12% in June, the automotive group had a strong recovery, down only 2% in June, led by returns to pre-COVID sales volumes in Europe and Australasia.  Total sales for the second quarter were $3.8 billion, down 10.1%, excluding the impact of divestitures, with operating margin of 8.6%, up 40 basis points, and adjusted net income at $191 million, or $1.32 per share. We also delivered improvements in working capital and strong cash flows, which Carol will cover later.  We are pleased to report a 40 basis point improvement in our segment operating profit. This was a significant accomplishment given challenging business conditions and a reflection of the strong leadership, quick decision-making and disciplined execution demonstrated throughout GPC. This approach resulted in continued gross margin expansion and significant actions to adjust our cost structure. And we are well ahead of our original cost savings target for 2020. As we move forward, we expect our teams to maintain this cost discipline and convert many of these temporary expense reductions to permanent and sustainable savings.  So now turning to a review of our business segments. The global automotive group had sales of $2.5 billion in the second quarter, down 10.1% from 2019 and representing 65% of total company revenues. As mentioned earlier, we experienced a sharp decline in sales in April, followed by a strong recovery in both May and June.  In our North American operations, U.S. automotive sales were down 12%, with comp sales down 13.8%. Despite the challenging top line, we were pleased to deliver a 60 basis point improvement in net operating margin. In Canada, total sales were down approximately 13%, with comp sales down 15% and net operating margin up an impressive 400 basis points. For perspective, both regions showed similar recovery trends throughout the quarter with sales improving from 25% to 30% declines in April to mid-single-digit declines in June.  For the quarter, sales to our retail customers continue to outperform through the pandemic, with positive sales growth in the U.S. and Canada. The strength in retail reflects the benefit of stimulus funds and other macro trends, as well as the positive impact of our omnichannel strategy to create an excellent in-store and online customer experience. As examples, we continue to refresh our NAPA stores, train our store associates and build on our loyalty program, while also enhancing our digital tools to grow our DIY business. Enhanced digital capabilities, such as buy online, pickup in store, curbside pickup, ship to home and deliver from store are driving increased traffic to our websites and record online sales in both the U.S. and Canada. We expect to benefit from this positive trend in the future through a continued expansion of our digital offering.  Commercial sales remained under pressure as lower demand from our professional shop customers led to declines in hard part categories such as brakes, chassis, ride control and exhaust. In particular, sales to accounts such as municipalities, state governments and fleets, which commonly distinguish our customer base from the competition, were especially hard hit. Overall, we believe the slowdown in commercial sales reflects the decline in miles driven related to COVID-19. However, we are optimistic that miles driven and other growth drivers will improve as consumers get back on the road for both work and personal travel. Our North American automotive teams have also been busy executing on several transformative initiatives to streamline their organizations. These steps included changes in management structure, further DC rationalization, a sales reorganization and a continued focus on new delivery strategies and digital tools. These actions have already generated incremental cost savings and operational productivity, as evidenced by our improved operating margin in both the U.S. and Canada. We expect these efforts to continue to add value today and over the long term. So as we mentioned in our last call, we have worked closely with our independently-owned NAPA stores and auto care customers to help them benefit from the financial aid available to small businesses, the vast majority applied for and received PPP assistance. In light of their support and current business trends, we remain confident in the lasting financial stability of these key partners.  In Europe, our automotive sales were down approximately 3% in the second quarter, reflecting pressure from COVID-19 and lockdowns in France and parts of the U.K. While our operations in Germany and the Benelux region held up fairly well through the peak of the pandemic, France and the U.K. drove an approximate 40% total sales decrease for this group in April. We had a sharp recovery from the lows of April with the reopening of France in May and the U.K. in June, which produced a surge in demand associated with deferred maintenance and repairs. As a result, total sales in Europe were positive in both months, with high single-digit comp sales growth in June.  The improving business conditions across our operations in Europe are promising. We look forward to building on the positive sales momentum and expanding our operating margin as we execute on initiatives to drive both top and bottom line in the periods ahead. We believe our current footprint in the large and fragmented European marketplace is an important competitive advantage for us. In addition, we see growth opportunities in Europe associated with the ongoing rollout of the powerful NAPA brand. This year, we have been expanding on the 5 product categories introduced in 2019 with the rollout of several new product categories including brakes, filtration, oil and steering and suspension. We are also initiating the development of our omnichannel capabilities in Europe, which will extend the digital platforms already offered in our North American and Australasian operations.  Turning to Australia and New Zealand, we are extremely proud of the exceptional performance from this team in the second quarter. Total sales were up 4.4%, driven by an approximate 2% core sales increase. With these sales and continued cost savings, this team produced a 300 basis point improvement in net profit margin. Our team achieved these results despite aggressive steps by the Australian and New Zealand government to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which generally restricted mobility and related demand for auto parts. In fact, these operations have recovered to pre-COVID sales volumes, driven by strong double-digit retail sales growth and solid commercial sales growth in both May and June.  In Australia and New Zealand, retail online sales continue to grow at greater than 300% from the pre-COVID levels. And through our investment in Sparesbox and other digital capabilities, we are prepared for additional online growth in the future. The execution of key initiatives such as the rollout of the NAPA brand across our trade offering, new NAPA store openings in Australia and New Zealand, and optimized global sourcing have been important growth drivers for our commercial business. So as I said before, we are very pleased with our performance in Australasia and expect to further build on this positive momentum.  Turning now to our global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales were $1.3 billion, down 10.2% excluding the EIS divestiture. Comp sales in North America were down 16.7%, offset by the addition of Inenco in Australasia as well as other acquisitions, which contributed 7% to sales in the quarter. Despite the challenging industrial climate, this group produced a flat operating margin relative to 2019 and is up slightly for the first 6 months in 2020.  Looking further at Motion Industries, the slowdown in sales beginning in mid-March continued throughout the quarter, with mid-teen declines in each month. While we operated in a difficult environment, we had anticipated a lagged recovery in industries such as equipment and machinery, iron and steel, pulp and paper and automotive. That played out accordingly with declines in almost every product category and in every industry sector. Still, we saw positive trends in the second quarter. First, more of our customers are reopening their plants and returning to work, which we expect improved demand for our core industrial categories including power transmission, hydraulics and conveyance, among others.  Second, our customers are beginning to release CapEx orders that were on hold for the past several months.  Third, leading industrial indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers Index and industrial production, pointed to improved industrial activity in June, which we expect to benefit our business in the months ahead. Additionally, the Motion team has been executing on several strategic and transformative initiatives, including the restructuring of their sales organization to optimize their customer coverage and provide for effective remote selling. This team also enhanced our omnichannel capabilities in the quarter with the rollout of a new Motion Industries website, which is expected to drive incremental sales with both existing and new customers. And as in our other businesses, there has been significant focus on aligning Motion's cost structure to drive meaningful savings and more productive operations.  In Australasia, our Inenco team is performing well, with positive total sales growth in June, driven by strong sales in the mining sector. In addition, this team continues to focus on ongoing initiatives to reduce their cost structure. Effective in August, Inenco will further integrate with our North American operations and assume the name MI Asia Pac. The team will utilize Motion's branding and new website and proprietary technology platform to enhance their digital capabilities and drive incremental volume.  Our Industrial Parts Group sells to thousands of customers, representing a diverse cross-section of industry sectors. We continue to expand our products and services in several key areas, including robotics and automation solutions and have plans to bolster our offering through a small bolt-on acquisitions before the end of 2020. So we move forward confident about capitalizing on these additional growth opportunities for our industrial operations in the quarters ahead.  So that's our business update. And now we'd like to make a few comments on our strategic planning for the future. We are excited about the recent actions to reshape our portfolio and focus solely on our automotive and industrial business segments. Both of these businesses have market-leading positions and brands in large and fragmented end markets, strong long-term industry fundamentals and steady 2% to 3% industry growth with consolidation opportunities. As we execute on our near term initiatives, we have also accelerated our strategic planning process to build on our momentum, optimize our readiness for next year and improve our post-COVID recovery rate.  Our strategic growth framework is intended to build out our global branding strategy and further leverage the NAPA and MI brands, capture more wallet share with existing customers and acquire new customers, introduce new products and services, innovate and expand on our digital offering, expand our global geographic footprint, acquire strategic businesses that complement our existing operations, and continuously enhance operational excellence and productivity. We expect to use this framework to focus our teams on driving profitable growth and delivering higher levels of free cash flow and ROIC over time.  So with that, I'll hand it over to Carol to give you a deeper look at our financials for the quarter. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. As mentioned previously, many of our comments, this morning, will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes the goodwill impairment charge in transaction, restructuring and other costs and income.  Total GPC sales were $3.8 billion in the second quarter, down 14.2% from 2019 or a decline of 10.1% excluding divestitures. We're pleased to report our 11th consecutive increase in quarterly gross margin, which improved to 33.8% on a reported basis, or an adjusted 34.1% compared to 33.3% last year, up 80 basis points. The improvement primarily reflects the favorable impact of divestitures as well as acquisitions of higher gross margin businesses. These items, as well as strategic category management initiatives including pricing and global sourcing actions and favorable product mix shifts, were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes. The pricing environment remained stable in the second quarter from relatively high levels of inflation in 2019, which were primarily associated with tariffs in our automotive business. So with supplier price increases of 2/10 of 1% for automotive, and 0.5% for industrial thus far in 2020, the total impact of inflation on our second quarter sales was approximately 1% for both segments. Based on the current pricing trends, we expect only minor price inflation through the balance of the year. Our selling, administrative and other expenses were $971 million in the second quarter on an adjusted basis or down 13.8% from last year. This represents 25.4% of sales, which is up slightly from 25.3% last year. The decrease in operating expenses were due primarily to the positive impact of our cost actions implemented thus far in 2020.  As mentioned on our last call, our teams continue to execute on initiatives related to our $100 million cost savings plan that was announced in 2019. We're pleased to report that we're well ahead of schedule with this plan, having achieved another $40 million in cost savings in the second quarter for a total of $70 million in expense reductions through the 6 months. In addition, our teams have been executing on a number of additional initiatives to adjust our cost structure for the changes in business conditions related to COVID-19. These initiatives contributed more than $150 million in incremental savings in the second quarter.  So in total, we generated approximately $200 million in cost savings during the second quarter driven by reduced headcount and facility rationalization as well as the deferral of merit pay increases, management pay reductions, furloughs and reduced travel related to the pandemic. These savings include approximately $40 million in government subsidies received by our international operations. Looking ahead to the third and fourth quarters, we're on track to show further progress towards our $100 million savings plan, and we expect to exceed this target for the full year. However, we also look for the accelerated cost savings related to COVID-19 to pull back as business conditions improve, sales volumes increase and government subsidies are reduced.  That said, while the sales environment remains uncertain, our focus through the second half of 2020 will be to grow our business while continuing to aggressively manage expenses and optimize our cost structure.  During the quarter, we reported several adjustments to account for a goodwill impairment charge in our European business, restructuring, transaction and COVID-19-related costs and a gain from an insurance proceeds related to a facility fire. These adjustments were $556 million in total, with $13 million accounted for in cost of goods sold and $543 million accounted for as operating and nonoperating expenses. In particular, the noncash goodwill impairment charge of $507 million resulted from the ongoing market volatility and the uncertainty in Europe caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain confident in our growth strategy and the long-term industry fundamentals in Europe.  With these adjustments in mind, total operating and nonoperating expenses were an adjusted $1.05 billion for the second quarter reflecting a decrease of 12.3% from last year, comprising 27.5% of sales.  Our total segment profit in the second quarter was $328 million, down 10% on a 14% sales decrease. Excluding divestitures, our total segment profit declined 6% on a 10% sales decrease, and our segment profit margin was 8.6% compared to 8.2% last year for an increase of 40 basis points. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 24.1% on an adjusted basis and down slightly from the 24.8% in the prior period. Our net income from continuing operations in the second quarter reflected a loss of $364 million, with earnings per share a loss of $2.52. Adjusted net income was $191 million or $1.32 per share, which compares to $215 million and $1.47 per share in 2019 or a 10% decline.  So now let's discuss our second quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the second quarter was $2.5 billion, down 10% from the prior year. Segment profit of $219 million was down 4.3%, with profit margin at 8.8% compared to 8.2% margin in the second quarter of 2019. The improvement in margin primarily reflects solid operating results in our U.S., Canadian and Australasian businesses. As Paul discussed earlier, this was driven by significant cost reductions and the benefit of government subsidies in our international businesses.  Our industrial sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter, a 21% decrease from Q2 of 2019. Excluding the EIS divestiture, industrial sales were down approximately 10%. Segment profit of $109 million was down 20% from a year ago or down 10%, excluding EIS, and the profit margin was flat at 8.2%. So despite the challenging sales environment throughout the quarter, our industrial teams have done an outstanding job of aligning their cost structure with the demand environment and they continue to operate well.  To complete our review of the segments, we're pleased that our July sales results reflect improving business conditions and positive momentum across the automotive and industrial businesses relative to the second quarter. For the month of July, we expect our total sales to be flat with the prior year, representing an approximate 6% sales increase for the automotive segment and a 12% sales decrease in the industrial segment.  So while these sales trends are encouraging, we continue to operate in an environment of significant uncertainty and cannot reasonably forecast the full impact of COVID-19 in the coming months. As a result, we believe it is prudent to not reestablish our formal financial guidance at this time.  So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. Our accounts receivable of $1.8 billion was down 29.7% from the prior year, due in part to the sales decrease for the quarter. In addition, during the second quarter, the company entered into an agreement to sell receivables to a financial institution resulting in a $500 million decline in accounts receivable from last year and serving to further strengthen our cash position. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables and are confident in our collection trends, which we continue to closely monitor in light of the current business conditions. Our inventory at June 30 was $3.4 billion, down slightly from June of last year due to effective inventory management and reduced purchasing volume, offset by the impact of acquisitions.  Accounts payable of $3.7 billion is down 3.5% from last year due to the change in inventory and lower purchasing volumes for the quarter. At June 30, our AP-to-inventory ratio was 112%, which has improved from 110% at March 31.  Our total debt of $3.2 billion is down 17% from $3.9 billion in 2019 and has improved 11% from $3.6 billion last quarter. The cash from the sale of accounts receivable as well as the proceeds from the sale of S.P. Richards were used to pay down debt and strengthen our cash position. At June 30, we remain in compliance with our debt covenants with total debt to a trailing 12-month EBITDA as defined in our credit agreement at 3.2x compared to 3.4x at March 31.  In addition, during the second quarter, we entered into new international credit agreements, which were made available to us increasing our total available credit capacity to $4.8 billion from $4.4 billion at March 31. As a result of these actions, we entered July with approximately $2.6 billion in available liquidity, which is significantly improved from our $1.1 billion liquidity position at March 31.  Thus far, in 2020, we have generated $921 million in cash from operations, which is up significantly from 2019. Our free cash flow is also strong. While we modified our near-term capital deployment strategy in early April to preserve cash during the COVID-19 crisis, we remain committed to several key priorities for cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. These priorities are evident in the $4.3 billion in capital deployed across 4 key areas over the last 3 years. They include the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A growth net of divestitures, share repurchases and the dividend.  For 2020, we reduced our initial $300 million in planned capital expenditures to approximately $150 million to $200 million, and we have suspended plans for further share repurchases and acquisitions other than small bolt-ons. We are prepared to adjust these plans as business conditions improve and as we gain confidence in a sustained recovery. Likewise, we will continue to support the dividend, which we have increased for 64 consecutive years.  So that's our financial update for the second quarter. And while the quarter presented many challenges, our teams did amazing work, especially on the cost structure and balance sheet side. We thank them for that, and we enter the second half of 2020 well positioned for the future. Paul, I'll turn it back over to you. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. We made significant progress in several important areas during the quarter. Our people, portfolio positioning and operational excellence initiatives are driving results and increased confidence at GPC today. To recap the key messages outlined at the beginning of our call, our teams operated well through the challenges of COVID-19, and we continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our GPC associates and customers while executing on our growth initiatives with speed and agility. Our second quarter financial performance benefited from improving sales trends in automotive, continued gross margin expansion and transformative cost actions. All of these efforts, coupled with our strong balance sheet, puts us in excellent position to continue to deliver operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow. And finally, with the steps taken to simplify and optimize our portfolio, we move forward as a more streamlined organization, focused on our automotive and industrial operations and with a well-defined strategic growth framework intended to maximize growth and value creation for all stakeholders.  So despite the economic uncertainty, future impact of COVID-19 and pace of recovery, GPC is well positioned and prepared for the various scenarios that may evolve over the near term. We look forward to executing our strategic plans into 2021 and updating you on our progress. Thank you for your interest in GPC. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Mark Jordan : This is Mark Jordan on for Bret. It looks like the U.S. automotive business has improved from the lows, but it looks like it maybe remains pressured. And I may have missed it in the prepared remarks, but did you provide the July sales trends for the U.S.? Paul Donahue : Mark, this is Paul. We did talk about that, but I'll go ahead and touch on it again. Our sales right now -- and we haven't finalized July, but our sales right now in U.S. automotive are positive in the month of July. Mark Jordan : Okay. And can you talk about maybe the gap between DIY and DIFM? And maybe when we can expect to see some more improvements in the DIFM segment? I know you mentioned it seems like some of the public sector customers are pressured. Paul Donahue : Yes. So as we look at the quarter, Mark, our DIY business was down in April, low single digit and then turned to a positive trend in both May and June. Actually, we're up low double digits in both months, and we're seeing that even strengthen further in July. DIFM was down, I think, close to 25% in the month of April. And was down mid- to high-double digits in above May and June.  We are seeing a little bit of a bounce back as we go into July, but it's still trending down a bit. And so as we look at it, Mark, as miles driven begin to bounce back and they will, DIFM is going to bounce back with it. We still firmly believe that our market-leading position in the commercial segment is the place to be, and it best positions NAPA for long-term sustained growth. Mark Jordan : Okay. Great. And then can you just talk about maybe some regional trends in the U.S. during the quarter? What regions were strongest and what were weakest? Paul Donahue : Yes, sure. So as we've seen in the past couple of quarters, the strongest regions in the quarter were out in the mountain region. So Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, probably the area that was, at that time, least impacted by COVID. The Midwest was strong, again, relatively strong compared to our -- the rest of the results.  And then the areas that were hardest hit, I don't think, Mark, will be a surprise to you, the Northeastern part of the country and then really down the Eastern seaboard. I would point out that as we look across the rest of our business, we saw good growth -- really good growth in Australia, despite the fact that New Zealand was in a full lockdown for the better part of 8 weeks. And we saw a real resurgence in Europe, again, despite the fact that both France and the U.K. were in full lockdown for a portion of the quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore. Michael Montani : Just wanted to ask if I could, on the commercial side. Paul, if you can just remind us the breakdown of the business there between, kind of, NAPA AutoCare now versus the municipal state business and then the core garages, just for a sense of the mix there. And then for some incremental color about how you saw those 3 parts of the commercial segment evolving across the course of the quarter and into July. And then I had a follow-up. Paul Donahue : Yes. So Mike, the NAPA AutoCare program, which we have now approximately 17,000 to 18,000 members in our AutoCare program, is a key component of our commercial business as our -- the major account segment. And then you get into fleet government and the like. As you can imagine, and as I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the most challenged was our municipality fleet and government business. AutoCare was better than the fleet business. And AutoCare, of our total U.S. automotive business, is close to 20%, give or take. That business was pressured. I would say, Mike, what we are pleased with is that we worked with our AutoCare centers as we did with many of our independent NAPA jobbers to secure PPP funding. We worked very closely with them. So those businesses are financially sound. And as miles driven begins to bounce back, again, we have no doubt that business will bounce back as well. Michael Montani : Great. That was -- the follow-up I had was just around the jobber performance during the quarter. So I'm wondering if you can just update us on how many jobbers you all have now versus a year ago? And then, how have their trends kind of compared to some of the U.S. trends that you called out so helpfully already? Paul Donahue : Yes, very consistent in terms of the performance, Mike, and -- with our NAPA jobbers. And certainly, there's outliers as we look around the country. What -- the trends that we're seeing in our -- with our NAPA jobber base is that, certainly, those NAPA jobbers who are larger, better funded, strong entrepreneurs, they're getting bigger and they're acquiring more and more stores, and they're performing just fine. In total, we have approximately 3,000 independent owners that own our 5,000 independent stores.  So the bigger owners, again, as I mentioned, we work closely with to ensure they secured PPP funding. And the majority all did and are in financial leader in good shape. And again, as we emerge from the pandemic, cars get back on the road, our jobbers are going to be just fine. Michael Montani : Okay. The last one I have is just around the pricing environment in the market. And there was some good commentary already there from Carol. But just wanted to understand how rational is the space, both in the U.S. and then also in Europe, where you're rolling out the private label offer? Paul Donahue : Yes. Well, I'll give you my viewpoint. And maybe Carol wants to weigh in as well. Historically, Mike, the -- certainly here in the U.S., North America, the pricing atmosphere has been very same. We -- you generally don't see a big spike because you put brakes on sale in a given month. So we've seen, as we have through the years, a very normalized pricing atmosphere here in North America.  And it's really no different in Europe. There's a few big competitors, one who also reported this morning. And so again, the pricing atmosphere there is solid as well. Did you have anything, Carol, you'd add? Carol Yancey : Yes, Mike, just as a reminder, the inflation that we have had really related to the tariff back a year, 18 months ago, so we've anniversaried those tariffs. And as we go into second half, we really don't foresee at this point -- and again, there's a lot of uncertainty in the second half, we don't foresee much in the way of price increases and inflation.  Having said that, and you guys saw our 11th consecutive quarter of gross margin increases, we're really driving that through a lot of our strategic category management. And whether that's global tenders or global sourcing or pricing initiatives, that's really how we're hanging on to the gross margin improvement that we have. Operator : Our next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : It's Christian on for Chris. I know you mentioned the municipalities, sales in municipalities as a big differentiator versus your competitors. I'm just trying to think with -- given O'Reilly's positive DIFM commentary yesterday, what would you say is the rest of the delta to your competitors? Would it be more on the geography mix front, given you have some more stores in the Northeast was hit particularly hard? Or was it more of a market share issue? Paul Donahue : Well, well, we don't believe it's a market share issue. I'll just make that comment right upfront, Christian. We -- look, they had strong results, which -- congrats to the guys in green. What -- the way we look at that is it's just further indication of the opportunities that we've got for growth in the aftermarket despite the pandemic that we're all operating in, and it bodes well for us over time.  As we see what's occurred in this quarter, certainly, the surge in DIY, there's a lot of stimulus dollars out there. There's a lot of folks who have a lot of time on their hand. We still believe, as I mentioned earlier, the place to be in this -- in the automotive aftermarket is in the commercial segment, and we think that will hold up well for us in the long run.  As we look at our competition, and it's certainly in the big 4. And I'll just remind you, Christian, the big 4 represent about 35% of the industry, maybe 35% to 40%. Our model is different. We're 80% DIFM and just 20% on the DIY side. So we're a different model than what our competitors are. And I would point out that in the month of July, we are seeing our DIFM business begin to recover and come back. And we do firmly believe that as miles driven come back, that we'll continue to see improvement in our DIFM business. Unidentified Analyst : Makes sense. That's very helpful. And then could you also -- I don't know if you've mentioned it in the call, but could you size out the $150 million in incremental savings from initiatives, the reduced headcounts, management pay reductions for low in the rest of that group? Carol Yancey : Yes. So the $100 million of cost savings that we introduced last year, Q4, and we mentioned that we were on track for that, we achieved $40 million in Q2 giving us $70 million year-to-date. We'll actually be ahead of plan on that. And those are permanent cost savings, probably 75% to 80% payroll-related, related to our BRP and some other facility consolidations and we're looking at other areas as well.  The incremental in Q2 cost savings that we talked about really related to mitigating the impact of COVID-19. We put those in place, and we were pleased to see the results in the quarter. Many of those are temporary, about 60% to 65% is payroll-related. We had government subsidies in there, some freight. Of course, travel and entertainment, rent. We're working hard to see what we can make permanent. But as we said before, many of those are temporary. So delaying merit increases, some of the voluntary and involuntary furloughs, things like that. But knowing we're also looking at further structural changes. So we hope to have some of those permanent. But we do expect those to pull back in the second half. But no, we're going to be ahead of plan on the $100 million cost savings that is permanent. Operator : Our next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Daniel Imbro : Paul, not to beat a dead horse. But just one, as we think about the DIFM recovery for the industry and for you guys, you mentioned miles driven mounting back being the biggest driver. There's a lot of uncertainty here, but curious, given your experience, are you assuming that we get back 100% of miles driven? Or is there going to be some kind of lingering impact from work from home, less commuting, anything like that, like what do you think kind of your outlook or your -- like you guys' outlook would be for what \"normal\" looks like into 2021? Paul Donahue : Yes. Yes, Daniel. So what the new normal looks like is anybody's guess at this point. But look, we -- as we look across the automotive aftermarket, and I look at the fundamentals that we have with the average age of the vehicle now moving up to 11.9 years, gasoline prices are down 20% year-over-year. What we see with folks that are going to be, I think, very reluctant as we've -- as -- to jump back on airplanes and travel either on business or vacation, we believe that more and more folks will be utilizing their vehicles.  So look, eventually, we do believe that we'll get back to those miles-driven numbers that we have seen and enjoyed in recent years. But it will most likely take a bit of time. But in the meantime, we're enjoying a nice -- a very nice bump in our retail business, like our competitors are. And we're very pleased with the increases we're seeing outside of the U.S. So I mentioned our business in Australia and New Zealand had just a spectacular quarter. And we've seen a real nice bounce back in Europe as well as they reopen their markets. So all in all, the fundamentals are solid. And we continue to be incredibly bullish about the automotive aftermarket. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That's helpful. That dovetails nicely, next question was going to be on Europe. I think the result is a lot better than feared there, and you mentioned a nice snap back into June. I think you said high single-digit organic growth. Can you parse out what you think is driving that level of growth? Is it just how shut down France was? There's a catch-up spend? Or are you gaining incremental market share in those markets? Kind of what's driving that higher level of growth? Because that's still a pretty heavy DIFM market. So I was surprised by that level of bounce back. Paul Donahue : Yes. It's incredibly heavy on the DIFM side, Daniel, you're spot on. It's 95%, basically, DIFM. Certainly, a good bit of the bounce back is pent-up demand. But what we are encouraged is that the surge that we saw in June has carried over into the month of July. And as I look at our strategy when we entered Europe 2-plus years ago, we're -- our strategy was launching private label. We're in the throes of launching NAPA, as I mentioned, across all of our markets. We've expanded our footprint into the Netherlands, which is a great market for us. We've expanded our footprint in Germany as well.  We've strengthened our management team. We've captured improved payment terms as we've leveraged our relationships with our big global suppliers. We are right on track to deliver on the cost savings that we committed to 3 years ago. And finally, what's exciting as well, Daniel, is that we're in the very early days of developing our online/omnichannel strategy for Europe. And again, we think that will bode well for us as we go forward. So we continue to be very optimistic about our position in that really fragmented market. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That's helpful. And then last one for me, moving to the industrial side. I think, Paul, you mentioned June trends, leading indicators got better. But Carol, during your remarks, I think you said we're still down 12% in July. So can you maybe help me reconcile those 2 things? It feels like you're more optimistic on the outlook, but near term, things are still pretty pressured. So when do you expect to see those indicators come through? And yes, what's kind of the outlook there for that segment? Paul Donahue : Yes. And I appreciate you -- I appreciate the question on industrial, Daniel. It's a really important segment for us. It's a great business that we have at Motion as well as now MI Asia Pac. And I would mention before I go to the U.S., our business in Australia and New Zealand and Southeast Asia, again despite the shutdown in New Zealand, is performing quite well, surpassing our numbers here in the U.S., and we're seeing real strength in the mining sector over in that part of the world. Here in the U.S., what we are seeing an improved trend in July versus what we saw across Q2, we're still down, but we are seeing that trend improve. And what we believe we're going to see happen, Daniel, is that we're seeing right now, factories begin to reopen. Plants are reopening. Some of our big customers are beginning to release CapEx orders that have been on hold. We're seeing the leading indicators, PMI and industrial production showing improved numbers. So look, industrial has lagged the automotive recovery, which we fully expected, we've seen that in the past. But we do believe that we'll see continued improvement in our numbers throughout Q3 as well as Q4 in the industrial segment as factories continue to reopen. Operator : And our final question will be coming from Matt McClintock with Raymond James. Mitchell Ingles : Yes. This is Mitch Ingles, filling in for Matt. So my first question was on your digital investments. Your Sparesbox acquisition last year seems even more timely today, given the leading digital interface and CRM capabilities for the Australian automotive aftermarket. Have you been able to implement these attributes to your other auto regional businesses? Or more broadly speaking, what do you see as a driving force for your digital investments going forward? Paul Donahue : Yes. Well, thanks for the question, Mitch. And I appreciate you bringing up our digital initiatives. Sparesbox, as you mentioned, was a great acquisition for us and a very timely acquisition given what's transpired with the pandemic. And in our Australian business, we've seen a 300% lift. We've been -- and what we are doing, Mitch, is utilizing the skill sets that we've acquired at Sparesbox. They're teaming up with our digital team here in North America. And ultimately, we'll be partnering with our teams in Europe to bring much of that expertise to the European market as well. We've -- a couple of things that I would point out that we've launched. I know I talked about curb side pick up, ship to home, buy online, pick up in store. Most of the things that other businesses are doing around the world, we've also improved. And I think one of the real key factors for us is we've improved our search capabilities across all of our businesses. And we've also delivered new apps for product recommendations. So a number of factors that are leading to really solid, solid growth. And we've also, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've improved and enhanced our online initiative at Motion as well. So we're very pleased. We've got a great team on the digital side, and we're very bullish on that segment as we move ahead. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Sidney Jones : We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's conference call. We thank you for your interest and support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to updating you on our third quarter results. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

Welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today and hope you are staying safe and well. During the quarter, we remained focused on our top priorities, which include ensuring the continued health and safety of our employees, customers, suppliers, and communities in which we operate; execution of our strategic initiatives and cost actions for our global Automotive and Industrial segments to deliver customer value, operational efficiencies and strong financial results; management of our working capital to drive strong free cash flow and pay down debt to further strengthen our financial position, and enhance liquidity; effective capital deployment, including strategic reinvestments in the business, paying a consistent dividend to our shareholders and the repayment of debt as appropriate; and finally, we also advanced our ESG initiatives with the release of our 2020 Corporate Sustainability Report. Carol and I look forward to covering our progress in each of these areas today, and then taking your questions. Our teams continued to execute with agility through the third quarter, aggressively managing each of our operations through the challenges of COVID-19. We are proud of their hard work and commitment to operational excellence, which has required effective measures to maintain a safe work environment, while also providing first-class customer service. Through the quarter, we engaged with our teams at every level and resumed field visits to connect with our employees, customers and suppliers. We can tell you firsthand that through the adaptability and successful execution of our passionate and talented associates, we are fully operational and prepared with comprehensive readiness plans, should a second wave begin to materially affect our businesses. So, a big thank you to our 50,000-plus team members across our global footprint. Upon the divestiture of our Business Products group in June, we entered the third quarter focused on driving profitable growth and productivity initiatives for our streamlined portfolio of our Automotive and Industrial business segment. As you may recall, exiting non-core operations is one of several key steps in the transformation of the Company. In addition, we are also investing in higher return businesses to further expand and strengthen our core. Moving on to our financial results. We achieved a strong financial performance in the third quarter that reflects the resiliency of our businesses and the benefits of our strategic growth initiatives and cost actions taken across our operations. Total sales for the third quarter were $4.4 billion, up 1% excluding the impact of divestitures. This was a significant improvement from the 10% sales decline in the second quarter, due to the impact of COVID-19. Total operating margin was 9%, a 100 basis-point improvement from last year, achieved through solid progress in both gross margin and SG&A, driving margin expansion in each of our Automotive and Industrial businesses. Adjusted net income was $237 million and adjusted earnings per share was a $1.63, up 17%. Our cost savings plan, announced in October of 2019, has generated significant savings across the organization in 2020. Through the first nine months, we have already achieved our $100 million cost savings target for the full year. In addition, cost actions in response to COVID-19 further boosted our operating results. Looking ahead, we remain focused on finding additional cost savings to further improve our cost structure and long-term profitability. Let me mention one example of the many initiatives to improve our operational efficiencies and customer service levels. We were excited to open our newest U.S. automotive distribution center in Nashville, Tennessee just last month. Nashville is a 325,000 square-foot distribution center, equipped with systems equipped with systems and efficiencies to enable high productivity and the service of over 300-plus NAPA stores. By bringing this facility on line, we'll be able to close or consolidate smaller, less productive DCs in the NAPA network. The opening of Nashville and consolidation of these operations has gone smoothly, despite the impact of COVID-19. We would like to thank our operations team for the great work on this important project. We will continue to make additional supply chain investments in the years to come. We also improved our working capital, enhanced our liquidity, while generating another quarter of substantial cash flows. Turning to our business segments. Automotive represented 68% of total sales in the third quarter and Industrial was 32% of total sales. By geography, 76% of revenues are attributable to North America with 14% to Europe and 10% Australasia. Total sales for the global Automotive Group were $3 billion, a 6% increase from last year, and improved sequentially from the 10% decrease in the second quarter. Comp sales also turned positive, up 2.2%, compared to a 12.6% decrease in Q2. A solid automotive recovery on the top-line with a consistent growth pattern in each month through the quarter helped us deliver a 100 basis-point improvement in operating margin. In North America, our U.S. automotive sales were down approximately 1%, which is significantly improved from the 12% decrease in the second quarter. Comp sales were down 2.8% and much improved from the 13.8% decrease in Q2. In addition, we were encouraged by an impressive 60 basis-point increase in operating margin for U.S. automotive. In Canada, sales for the third quarter were up 2.6%, and improved from a 13% decrease in Q2. Comp sales increased by 0.5% and operating margin was up a strong 200 basis points. So, a solid quarter for our Canadian team. Also in North America, sales to our retail customers continued to outperform, up low-double-digits for the third quarter. While retail sales peaked in July, this customer segment remained solid through the quarter as the persistence of COVID continued to drive outsized DIY growth, although we believe this surge in demand is gradually moderating. We continue to strengthen our retail positioning through our ongoing initiatives, such as store refreshes, NAPA rewards program, targeted promotions and enhanced merchandising and inventory. In addition, our growing omni-channel capabilities, including the recent addition of 35,000 new SKUs and direct-to-customer shipping from select suppliers continue to drive exceptional value for the retail customer. This has led to online retail sales that doubled our 2019 volume, and we expect continued strong omni-channel growth at NAPA in the fourth quarter and beyond. Moving on to our DIFM business. Sales to commercial accounts were down low-single-digits in the third quarter, which is much improved from last quarter and an encouraging indicator that consumers are becoming more mobile and getting back out on the road. As miles driven continued their slow recovery, sales trends across each of our customer channels strengthened relative to Q2, with our independent unaffiliated professional repair accounts leading the way and posting positive sales growth. Looking forward, we expect this customer segment as well as our fleet and government accounts, national accounts and NAPA auto care centers to strengthen further in the months ahead. Among these customers, our fleet and government segment remained the most pressured, as many of these operations are running at less than capacity due to slower business conditions and/or budgetary constraints. This is especially true for our customers in the energy and airline industries, which have been significantly impacted by the pandemic. To counter these and other commercial headwinds, our teams are executing on a number of recovery plans designed to optimize NAPA's customer value proposition, sell more parts and gain market share. These plans focus on maximizing the effectiveness of our new sales structure, improvements to key programs such as NAPA auto care, enhance systems and digital capabilities, as well as strategic pricing initiatives and improved inventory availability. While our team has made significant progress in the quarter, we expect our focus in these areas and favorable fundamentals to drive meaningful results in the period ahead. Those favorable fundamentals include the growing number of vehicles in the 6 to 12-year aftermarket sweet spot, and the recent spike in new car sales, low gas prices and continued improvement in miles driven. In Europe, aftermarket sales trends had a strong rebound in the third quarter, and our team did a tremendous job of capitalizing on that. Total sales were up an impressive 16%, which is improved from a 3% sales decrease in the second quarter. And comp sales were up a strong 12%, compared to last quarter's mid-teen decline. Importantly, this quarter's sales growth, combined with our ongoing cost savings initiatives, drove a 140 basis-point margin improvement, marking a significant step forward for this group. In breaking down our overall European performance, we are very pleased that operations in each country recovered with positive sales comp, driven by the broad surge in demand for deferred maintenance and repairs. In addition, the powerful NAPA brand has proven to be an effective growth driver. We have introduced the NAPA brand in the UK and France, and plan to roll it out in Germany this month. We posted our strongest European sales in the UK this past quarter, and NAPA branded products have grown to represent a low-double-digit percentage of total sales in less than one year. As a reminder, we identified the opportunity for private brands in Europe at the time of our initial discussions to acquire AAG back in 2017. We are encouraged by the quick acceptance of the NAPA brand and excited for its growth potential. Likewise, our focus on driving growth with key existing and new accounts, including the larger national account customers also contributed to our recovery. So, again, just a fantastic job by the team in Europe on both the top and bottom lines. Turning now to our automotive operations in Australia and New Zealand. This team reported another quarter of exceptional results, with total sales increasing 16% and comp sales up strong at plus 15%. This follows a 4% total sales increase and a 2% core sales increase in the second quarter. Our strong sales for the quarter reflect a robust sales environment for both, the commercial and retail customer segments in the Australasian region, and our team is well-positioned with a 60% commercial and 40% DIY sales mix. We're encouraged by the current sales climate, despite ongoing headwinds due to COVID-related restrictions in select key markets, such as Melbourne, and the state of Victoria. To drive this growth, our team in Australasia is executing on several growth initiatives. These include the continued rollout of the NAPA brand, and new NAPA store openings, digital enhancements across the B2C and B2B platform, strategic pricing and targeted marketing. These and other initiatives as well as the ongoing cost actions across our operations generated a strong 180 basis-point improvement and operating margin for the quarter. So, in summary, we are pleased with the recovery in the aftermarket, and our automotive performance across North America, Europe and Australasia. So, now, let's turn to our results for the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.4 billion, down 8.7%, excluding the EIS divestiture. Comp sales were down 9.2%, a significant improvement from the comp sales decline of 16.7% in the second quarter. These sales results as well as our ongoing focus to drive meaningful cost savings and optimizing our distribution network drove an 80 basis-point improvement in net operating margin for the quarter. In North America, our total sales were down 9.7% as compared to a 16.7% decrease in Q2. We saw strengthening trends in industrial indicators over the last several months, and an improving sales cadence in each month of the quarter. Specifically, the ISM PMI, industrial production and capacity utilization have all pointed to increasing industrial activity since we last reported, and we expect these trends to continue in the months ahead. We would also add that as customers reopen their plants, we will capitalize on more onsite sales opportunities. We are also beginning to see an increase in CapEx orders among many of our customers, many of which were deferred due to crisis. So, we see a number of positive signs for the industry ahead. Throughout the pandemic, our team has been executing on our growth strategy to further bolster Motion's leading competitive position in the MRO industry. We are focused on initiatives to expand our industrial services and solutions capabilities, enhance our pricing and category management strategy, and optimize the effectiveness of our Motion Industries website, which we re-launched just last quarter. Each of these initiatives has added value for the Company and our customers. For the quarter, our automation solutions group was our strongest operation, posting high-single-digit growth. We are building out this operation to further support the growing mega trend of plant automation and robotics at our customers. In contrast, the southwest region of the U.S. was our weakest due to the significant impact of COVID on the oil and gas sector in that area of the country. We were also pleased to complete three strategic bolt-on acquisitions in North America during the quarter. Two of these businesses specialize in motion control, and automation products and services, including engineering and application expertise and aluminum extrusion, which complement our growing MI automation solutions group. Our third acquisition expands our hydraulics business at Motion Canada. Combined, these operations, further expand our presence in strategic geographies and overall products and service offerings, and are expected to contribute approximately $35 million to $40 million in annual revenues. So, to summarize our North American industrial performance, we were encouraged by the gradual improvement and sales trends throughout the quarter. Our team also operated well and was very-disciplined in applying their cost control measures, which we believe bodes well for continued progress in the months ahead, as the industrial economy strengthens further. Turning to Australasia, July 1 marked the anniversary of our MI Asia Pac acquisition, and this team delivered a low single-digit sales increase for the quarter. While we continue to benefit from the strength of local mining industry, we are also executing on our new branding strategy and other growth initiatives to drive sales and gain market share. In addition, the MI Asia Pac team is operating well and making excellent progress on key cost reduction and working cap initiatives. Another focus area for GPC has been the advancement of our ESG initiatives. To account for our progress in this important area, we issued our first sustainability report back in 2018, and followed that up with a summary update in 2019. On September 30th, we were pleased to issue our 2020 Sustainability Report. This year's report substantially expands our disclosure across the ESG spectrum, such as human capital and diversity and inclusion, among others. In developing our disclosure, we engaged with our top shareholders to ensure our pathway to ESG best practices, aligned with the expectations of these key stakeholders. We invite you to visit our GPC website to view this report and learn more about our company-wide commitment to ESG. As we move forward through the balance of 2020 and into 2021, our teams will execute on a number of strategic initiatives to build on the positive momentum of the third quarter. These plans and initiatives are grounded in a strategic growth framework, focused on maximizing the value of our Automotive and Industrial business segments and positioning GPC for sustained long-term growth and improved profitability. Key elements of the framework include capturing more wallet share with existing customers and acquiring new customers; introducing new products and services, while innovating our omni-channel strategy and expanding digital offerings; building a global branding strategy to further leverage our powerful NAPA and MI brands, which we have initiated via the rollout of the NAPA brand into Europe and Australasia; and the rebranding of our Inenco Industrial Business to MI Asia Pac; expanding our global geographic footprint, including acquiring strategic bolt-on businesses. And finally, our strategic framework includes ongoing transformation initiative to achieve operational excellence as exemplified by our cost actions and other initiatives. So, now, I'll turn it over to Carol for a deeper review of our financials. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Paul. As a reminder, our comments this morning will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which exclude transaction, restructuring and other costs and income. Total GPC sales were $4.4 billion in the third quarter, down 3.4% from 2019 or up 1%, excluding divestitures, which is much improved from the 10% decline in the second quarter. We're also pleased to report our 12th consecutive increase in quarterly gross margin, which improved to 35% compared to 33.4% in the third quarter last year. The 160 basis-point improvement primarily reflects the benefit of sales mix shift to higher gross margin operations, positive product mix, especially in industrial. The broad improvement was driven by our focus on strategic category management initiatives in areas such as pricing and global sourcing. The divestiture of EIS last September 30th was also accretive to gross margin performance. These items were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes. The pricing environment has remained stable thus far in 2020 with limited supplier price increases and very little inflation in our third quarter sales. Based on the current pricing environment, we expect only minor price inflation through the balance of the year. Our selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.1 billion in the third quarter, down 1.7% from last year and representing 26.1% of sales compared to 25.6% last year on an adjusted basis. The decrease in operating expenses reflects the favorable impact of both, our permanent and COVID-related costs actions implemented thus far in 2020, as previously mentioned by Paul. In accordance with our $100 million cost savings plan announced late in 2019, we're pleased to report that we have successfully achieved the $100 million annual target well ahead of schedule. With more than $40 million in savings recognized in the third quarter, our permanent expense reductions totaled over $110 million for the nine months. In addition, our teams have continued to execute on a number of additional savings initiatives in response to COVID-19. These initiatives contributed approximately $60 million in incremental savings in the third quarter. So, combined, we generated approximately $100 million in cost savings during the third quarter, driven by strategic reductions and payroll and facility costs, as well as more temporary savings from furloughs, reduced travel and entertainment, freight changes and other initiatives in response to COVID. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue to execute on our cost actions, and we currently expect to achieve $130 million to $140 million in permanent cost savings for 2020, which will carry over into 2021. We also expect to generate further savings related to COVID-19 but have less clarity here, as these cost savings will moderate as the economic recovery continues and sales volumes increase. Despite the continued uncertainty, we enter the fourth quarter focused on driving growth and aggressively managing our expenses to maximize profitability. Our total operating and non-operating expenses were an adjusted $1.2 billion for the third quarter, reflecting a decrease of 1.5% from last year and comprising 27.9% of sales. Our total segment profit in the third quarter was $392 million, up 9% on a 3% sales decrease. Excluding divestitures, total segment profit, increased 13% on a 1% sales increase, and our segment profit margin was 9.0%, a strong increase of 100 basis points. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 23.4% on an adjusted basis, down from 24.9% in the prior year period, due primarily to the benefit of statute related adjustments. Our net income from continuing operations in the third quarter was $233 million with earning per share of a $1.61. Our adjusted net income was $237 million or $1.63 per share, which compares to $204 million and $1.39 per share in 2019 or a 17% increase. So, now, let's discuss our third quarter results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $3 billion, up 6% from the prior year and sequentially improved from the 10% sales decline last quarter. Our segment profit at $266 million was up 20% with a profit margin of 9.0%, compared to 8.0% in the third quarter of 2019. The 100 basis-point increase in margin was driven by improved operating results across each of our automotive businesses, which was a great job by our teams and a testament to their continued focus on meaningful cost reductions across our operations. Our Industrial sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, an 18.6% decrease from a year ago. Excluding the EIS divestiture, Industrial sales were down approximately 9%, which is a significant improvement from the second quarter. Our segment profit of $126 million was down 8% from a year ago or up slightly excluding EIS, and the profit margin was up 80 basis points to 8.9%. The improved margin for Industrial reflects gains in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses, which was driven by the combination of gross margin expansion and cost savings. We expect to see continued progress in the quarters ahead as the sales environment further recovers. While these sales trends and operating results are encouraging and reflect the recovery from the lows of the second quarter, we continue to operate in an environment of significant uncertainty and cannot reasonably forecast the full impact of COVID-19 in the coming months. As a result, we believe it's prudent to not reestablish formal financial guidance at this time. So, now, let's turn to our comments on the balance sheet. Our accounts receivable of $2.0 billion were down 22% from the prior year, due primarily to the change in sales and the benefit of an agreement to sell $500 million of receivables to a financial institution earlier this year. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables and confident about our collection trends, although we continue to closely monitor receivables in light of the current business conditions. Inventory at September 30th was $3.4 billion, up 2% from September of last year, or essentially flat excluding the impact of foreign currency. This is a function of lower purchasing volumes and our continued focus on effective inventory management. Accounts payable of $4.0 billion is up 1% from last year and a reflection of the change in inventory and the impact of lower purchasing volumes. At the end of our quarter, the AP-to-inventory ratio was 118%, which has improved from 112% at June 30th. Our total debt at $2.9 billion is down 15% from $3.4 billion last year and down 10% from the second quarter. During the third quarter, we further strengthened our liquidity position and we entered October with approximately $2.8 billion in available liquidity, which has improved from our $2.6 billion liquidity at June 30th and $1.1 billion in liquidity at March 31st. For the first nine months of 2020, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations, which is up significantly from 2019. This led to strong free cash flows of over $1.3 billion. As a reminder, we modified our near-term capital deployment strategy back in early April to preserve our cash through the duration of COVID-19. However, we remain committed to several key priorities for cash to serve to maximize shareholder value. These priorities are evident in our improved debt leverage of 2.2 times our total debt to adjusted EBITDA, which compares to 2.5 times at the end of the second quarter, and the $4.3 billion in capital deployed across our four key areas in the last three years. These include reinvestments in our businesses via capital expenditures, M&A growth net of divestitures, share repurchases, and the dividend. For 2020, we reduced our initial $300 million in planned capital expenditures to approximately $150 million to $200 million, and we have suspended plans for share purchases through December 31st. While we've also pulled back on acquisition activity, we've made several strategic bolt-on acquisitions this quarter, as Paul mentioned earlier, and we continue to plan for additional M&A that aligns with our growth strategies for the Automotive and Industrial businesses. And finally, we continue to support the dividend which has increased for 64 consecutive years. So, that's our financial update for the third quarter. We've made significant progress in several key areas. We want to thank our teams for their great work and many accomplishments under these tough circumstances. I'll now turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. Through the continued focus on our top priorities, outlined at the beginning of this call, we were pleased to report a strong financial performance for the quarter. Our results highlight our progress in several key areas, including strengthening sales trends, continued gross margin expansion, transformative cost actions and significant cost savings, operating margin expansion in each of our businesses, and a stronger balance sheet, enhanced liquidity and substantial cash flows. We are excited for the future at GPC, and we look forward to reporting on our progress in the quarters ahead. We thank you for your interest in GPC. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Bret Jordan : When you think about the cadence of the quarter, I guess NAPA U.S. specifically but also maybe Europe as well, as we came out of the COVID lockdown, could you talk about sort of how businesses either picked up with mobility improving or maybe even softened as stimulus money was spent? And then, I guess, within Europe, talk specifically about the strength you've seen there. Obviously, not as much consumer stimulus in that economy yet seeming to outperform, could you maybe give us some color as to is that share gain that's driving your significant comp or is it just the underlying lift in service demand? Paul Donahue : Yes. Thanks, Bret. And let's start with the cadence first, and maybe I'll touch on total Company. In total Company, we were steady throughout the quarter, turning positive. We were pretty much flat in July-August, turned positive in September, total GPC. As we look at automotive again, total automotive, we were consistent throughout the quarter, mid-single-digit all-in July, August and September. Europe, we were really strong in August, but we were double-digit growth in every month and the quarter. And as we look at our turnaround in Europe, I couldn't be more proud of that team over there, Bret. They -- I mean, you guys know what we went through in Q2, most of France was shut down, a good bit of the UK was shut down. And for us, the post that kind of increase that we did in Q3 is strong, and we're seeing it across the board. We're seeing it in every market, which is what's really got us encouraged and we're seeing it across our customer base. So, we saw it in our small independent, unaffiliated shops, but we also saw solid increase with the big national major account. So, do I think we're taking market share in Europe? Perhaps. But, I guess, we'll have to watch that play out. I'd also tell you, Bret, we're really excited about the rollout of our NAPA private label. And I think that really bolstered our sales in the UK this quarter, we're up at 10 different product categories down in the UK. And we're rolling that out in France, and then we'll go into Germany and the Netherlands as well. Bret Jordan : You might talk about the margin lift from private label. Carol Yancey : Yes. The margin on the private label, Bret, as you know, for our private label, we do generally have a more favorable margin when you look at the all-in and consider the terms that we get and the global tenders that we're doing. But generally, we do have a little bit lower price in Europe on that private label. So, it would be neutral in total to Europe on their gross margin. But, the fact is, we're more dollars and we're expanding our market share. And again, when we look at global tenders, there is a GPC benefit, if you will, when you think about global extended terms and putting more volume through our global suppliers. Paul Donahue : And Bret, as I called out in my prepared comments, when we first started talking to the AAG team a few years back, we saw a real opportunity to introduce private brand into our European markets, and it's played out honestly exactly as we had hoped and thought of would. And I'll tell you what I'm most encouraged by is the acceptance and I guess the recognition of the NAPA brand in Europe. Bret Jordan : And I guess, a quick follow-up. Could you talk about any regional performance highlights in the U.S.? And then, Carol you talked about inflation moderating. Do you see anything going on in pricing? And I guess maybe more on the DIY side, I think, there were some comments coming out of zone that they and Walmart have become a bit more competitive. Do you see any pricing changes in the market in general? Carol Yancey : Yes. Pricing has been really rational, and specific to automotive, we cannot say we've seen much in the way of changes whether it's do-it-for-me or DIY, we've had very minimal price increases through the third quarter, 0.1% in automotive, and we really don't expect much at the end of the year. But again, no supplier price increases and a pretty rational pricing environment. Paul Donahue : And Bret as far as the -- your question around regionality, I'm assuming you're talking about the U.S. Much like we saw in the previous quarter, our strongest markets continue to be the Midwest and the mountains. And those two guys are heading are really continuing to do a good job for us, both delivering positive numbers in Q3. Where we're seeing a bit of stress and again, not surprising, the Northeast was down mid-single-digit in the quarter. But I point out, Bret that if you go back to Q2, our Northeastern business, we were down 19% in Q2. We've gone from down 19 to roughly down 4 and change in Q3. Mid Atlantic, similar story, high-double-digit decrease in Q2 to down mid-single-digits in Q3. So, still a bit stressed in those markets. But, what we're encouraged by is just really strong sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter. Bret Jordan : Okay. And it sounded like Europe, UK might be the strongest market with France number two. Paul Donahue : That is correct. Absolutely. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Beth Reed : Hi. Good morning. This is Beth Reed on for Scot. Just wondering if you guys could help us better understand the cadence of the recovery in auto. I believe the July trends were running about 6% -- first, I just wondered if you could clarify is that sales or comp. I think it was sales, but if you could clarify. And at that time, where were U.S. comps trending. And then lastly, on the U.S. side, did you see trends improve sequentially throughout each month? And any color in cadence maybe around those metrics can be great. Paul Donahue : Yes. So, we\u2019ll double team this one, Beth. But, the first response, I think, you asked, and I\u2019m trying to recount your questions. I think, the first one was around, was the 6% that was mentioned back in Q2, was that comp or total. That was total,, not comp. Okay? So, did that answer that question? Beth Reed : Yes. Paul Donahue : Okay. And then, as we look at our automotive business in the quarter it -- again, as I mentioned, our total automotive business was consistent throughout the -- was consistent throughout the quarter, mid-single-digit, and U.S. automotive followed a similar pattern, and it was pretty consistent throughout the quarter. Beth Reed : Okay. So, the U.S. auto comps were down low to mid -- low-single-digit each one? Paul Donahue : Correct. Beth Reed : Okay, got it. And then, just one on the Industrial side\u2026 Paul Donahue : Hey Beth, I would just add to that. That improved in the month of September. Beth Reed : Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. Carol Yancey : July -- and you did say, July was flattish. There was -- and again, August, September weren't quite as much as what July was. But in total, it was -- that's our total number. Beth Reed : Got it. Okay. On the Industrial side, just with the negative trends continuing, and as you guys mentioned, some of the industries are starting to improve. How should we think about trends in that segment as we look over the next few quarters? Paul Donahue : Yes. So, just a little bit of history on Motion, because we've seen the cyclical times before in the industrial business. We generally lag the industrial indicators. So again, that's consistent with what we're seeing again in these recent quarters. What we are encouraged by, Beth, is we saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter. So, September was the strongest month of Q3. And we do believe that as the economy continues to improve, we'll close that gap between our numbers and then what the industrial indicators are showing. So, our -- the takeaway should be, we anticipate improved demand in the coming months. We're seeing really strong results out of our wood and lumber segments of our business, pulp and paper are good. A lot of that is directly tied to the building industry, which is strong. So, we have no doubt Motion will recover and will be in good shape in the quarters ahead. Beth Reed : Alright. Thank you so much. Paul Donahue : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Paul Donahue : Hey, Chris. Chris Horvers : I just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions there. First on the Motion side. You talked about September being the strongest month, obviously down 9% comps for the quarter. I guess, how close are you to getting to positive there? And then, could you also size up maybe the exposure to weaker industries, like energy and travel? Paul Donahue : Yes. Well, the energy comment, Chris, that's definitely a headwind for us. If you look at our Southwest part of the United States was certainly our weakest market in the country, and that is largely driven by oil and gas. So, that's a definite headwind for us going forward. And in terms of looking out, Chris, look, it's challenging. I mean, there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets. There's no doubt. Our expectation is our Motion business will turn positive in '21. But, I would also tell you, our expectation is that we're going to continue to show sequential improvement. Just as we did from Q2 to Q3, we think Q4 will be an improvement over Q3, and then again, certainly positive in '21. Chris Horvers : So, would that mean that like Motion in September was more down, like mid to high single-digit versus high single-digit decline in September? Paul Donahue : That is correct. Chris Horvers : Got it. Makes sense. And then, in terms of, just to clarify on the U.S. cadence in particular. Did -- it seems like DIY slowed? And do-it-for-me got better. But, that was sort of roughly neutral over the three months. Is that right? Because you also mentioned that September got better. So, I was just trying to reconcile all that did -- kind of put that all together? Paul Donahue : Yes. So my, my reference on September, Chris, was in relation to August. September was a better month than what we saw in August. We saw softness in August. And September did improve. Carol mentioned we were flattish in July, and we dipped a bit in September. But again, we're talking just a few basis points from month to month to month. So, not a massive shift. And I'm sorry. I missed -- I forgot the second part of your question, Chris. Chris Horvers : So, the second part was really like, it seems like the mixed bag in there as like DIY slowing down. One of your competitors, talked about a drop off in August and into September on DIY. So, I guess, maybe, is that what drove sort of the keeping the relative trend flat over the quarter? And then, any comment on did -- and this is U.S., both questions. Did do-it-for-me -- how close are we to positive in September in commercial? Paul Donahue : Yes. So, our DIY business, and you hit it, Chris. I mean, we had a huge July in DIY and we were up close to 20% in July and it moderated a bit through Q3. But, I mean -- I don't think anybody expects the kind of DIY increases that we're seeing across the industry to continue. Certainly, we've benefited as did all of our peer group from the stimulus money to the hit the markets. Our DIFM business was pretty steady throughout the quarter in that low-single-digit range. And again, I would point out Chris, just as I did with some of the regionality, as I did with Motion, those down low-single-digit, those numbers are improved from the high-single-digit declines that we were seeing back in May in June. Chris Horvers : Got it, but not -- right, okay. So, but -- so U.S. do-it-for-me was pretty consistent in that down low-single-digit range? Paul Donahue : Yes. Chris Horvers : Okay. Sorry to belabor that. And then, in terms of -- maybe on the on the margin side, really a two-part question. So, first on the on the gross margin, EIS actually helped you. Can you talk about how much that was? But then, vendor allowances also hurt too. So, at the high level, how much, how are you thinking about the potential to continue to drive expanded gross margins going forward? And then, I have a follow-up on SG&A? Carol Yancey : Sure. On the gross margin for the quarter, when you look at our quarterly improvement, I would say this quarter, about a third of that was related to the divestitures. So, two-thirds of our gross margin improvement, like 100 bps is really related to sales mixed shift to higher gross margin operations, specifically our international strong results on automotive, product mix shift, especially in Industrial, and then some of our just pricing and global sourcing initiatives. So, when we look ahead, we do expect to have continued gross margin improvement with a lot of our initiatives that may not be quite at the pace that we've seen. But, we are very encouraged by the gross margin initiatives we have. We've done all that, as you mentioned, with lower volumes. And we have been able to generally offset the lower volume incentives with our lower sales volumes with having our initiatives. So, we\u2019ve anniversaried the EIS divestiture. So, going forward, it will just be the core gross margin improvement. Chris Horvers : Got it. Then on the SG&A side, Carol, I guess, how are you -- you take a lot of cost out of the business, how are you thinking about the potential to add back that COVID expense in 2021 from a dollar\u2019s perspective? Carol Yancey : Yes. So on the SG&A side, what we're really encouraged by is the $100 million permanent cost savings that roughly -- or $110 million through nine months. We expect to be $130 million to $140 million for the full year. The COVID savings were $150 million in Q2. And as we mentioned before, about $45 million of that was government subsidies. That moderated to about $60 million in Q3, which relates directly to the improved, as Paul's mentioned, improvement in our volumes, extending hours, bringing folks back in, and we said a lot of those were temporary things. But, part of why we have a higher $100 million permanent savings is, we shifted some of those things to permanent. So, we are still -- we will still have some COVID savings in Q4. It'll be probably less than what it is in Q3. But, I can tell you, all of our business units have additional cost actions. As we look ahead, there are further opportunities we think we'll have, especially as it relates to facilities and productivity improvements, and again, some further consolidations in some back office areas. So, we're still excited about the work the transformation team is doing as we look ahead. Chris Horvers : Very helpful. Thanks very much. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Hi. Thanks. I have a couple of questions. One, I'd love to follow up. Thanks for all the color around U.S. automotive. Could you just level set us now on the mix of that business between independents, the NAPA auto care group, major accounts and fleet, just given how disparate the performance has been this year? Paul Donahue : So, if we look at the business, and as you just described, Greg, our most challenging segment -- and look, I should point out at the outset, our modest difference, okay, I think -- and you've been around long enough, Greg, you know that. Fleet and government is a big segment for us, and that has been our most challenged segment. And I should point out that, mix in that fleet and government, we have our oil and gas, energy business, we have large contracts with municipalities, school bus contracts, we have contracts with the airlines, ground equipment. So, all of that is in that fleet and government. And as you can imagine, Greg, that has been a challenging segment and has continued. It'll come back, and we think it will come back and it will come back strong. Our major account business and our auto care business was down slightly in the quarter as well. Where we saw good growth and we are encouraged is with our what we would really classify as our all other wholesale business, and that is our independent unaffiliated garages. That business held up well. And we are encouraged by that -- by those numbers. And we think we can continue to build on that in Q4 and going forward. Greg Melich : And if we look at the business, independents and garages, are they now -- are they like half the business or 30% of the business, just -- and fleet and governments may even be down to 20%? Would that be a fair estimate? Paul Donahue : Yes. So, think of it this way, Greg. When we look at our -- at those segments, fleet is -- and I'll give you round numbers, 20% to 25%. And then, you've got the -- that unaffiliated independent garage segment is probably 40% to 45% of the total. And I'm sorry, Greg, you asked about our independent owners as well. Can you maybe ask that again, that question? Greg Melich : Yes. I just want to know, just generally speaking, how the independents are doing. So, what percentage of the mix are they now as opposed to company owned stores? And how are they doing? I mean, how many of them got PPP loans? Are they sort of fully back and up to running the way that you want to versus what they were doing in the second quarter? Paul Donahue : Yes. It's a great question, Greg. And I'm glad you did ask that. Independent owners are -- they represent roughly 60% of our business. And I'm pleased to say, our guys have been out, we've been out meeting with some of our big independents, really just this week. They're faring well. And I would tell you that in terms of PPP money, the vast majority, and I'm talking probably close to 90%, got PPP money. So, from a cash position, our independents are doing just fine. Greg Melich : Great. And then, if I can, so one more question there. You brought up an interesting addition of 35,000 SKUs. That would be direct from vendor. Could you just help us frame what that could mean to sales and sort of expanding the business in a more capital effective way? And I also thought I heard you mentioned some pricing or re-merchandising actions to help gain some share back. But I was\u2026 Paul Donahue : So, let's talk about the SKUs that I referenced, the 35,000 SKUs. Think of that Greg as kind of that whole concept around the endless aisle and taking advantage of our great suppliers and their -- the total extent of their catalogue offering. So today, of course, you think of supplier, Greg and I know Dorman well, a great partner of ours for many, many years. They have a very expansive catalog. We don't -- we do not -- we don't catalog all the SKUs that Dorman has available. But, we're certainly now going to make those available online. And we think that's going to -- it's too early to put a number to it, Greg. We really just launched it. But, that would be an example. Another example would be the WeatherTech line. You know that line, of course, great consumer brand. So, we're excited with what we believe that whole kind of endless aisle can do for the NAPA business. And we're going to continue to expand that opportunity going forward. Greg Melich : And I hear some -- I heard pricing was rational, but I also thought I heard there were some certain actions maybe in particular segments. Carol Yancey : Yes. So, we were talking about rational pricing and really no supplier price increases in automotive. The actions taking both in our Automotive and our Industrial business are really buy side, sell side type pricing, global sourcing type internal gross margin initiatives. Really again, there are no drastic changes in the pricing environment. We've just gotten much more strategic as it relates to both, retail and commercial pricing in our gross margin efforts. Greg Melich : So, these are, just so I understand, more strategic, meaning that you're lowering prices to the customer or end up getting more merch margin based on how you're mixing it? Carol Yancey : No. I mean, Greg, we've had 12 consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement in an environment with lower sales volumes and no inflation and tariffs. And again, we've got pricing, data analytics. We've got investments we've made. Again, we are getting improved gross margin with these initiatives and remaining very competitive. So, the idea is to grow our sales and grow the business. And again, I'm really pleased to see the opportunities and the results that we've gotten in the gross margin area. Greg Melich : That's great. Thanks a lot both of you. Good luck. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Our last person for questions comes from the line of Matt McClintock with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions. Mitch Ingles : Hey, everyone. This is Mitch Ingles, filling in for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. So, most of my questions have already been answered. I just had a quick follow-up on your major accounts group in Automotive. Are these accounts mostly back on line today and purchasing at lower volumes? It sounds like the recovery for Europe for these types of accounts has been relatively solid. Do you expect a similar trend for these accounts in the U.S. in coming months? Any color on the recent trends here would be helpful. Thank you. Paul Donahue : Yes. Matt, we -- I'm sorry. We do expect that business to bounce back and it will bounce back as miles driven bounces back. One thing that hasn't really been talked about this morning, even though there's a whole lot more traffic than the roads and people are backed behind the wheel, which we're happy to see. Miles driven in the last couple of months that I've seen preliminary numbers, it's still down close to 10%. So, as that begins to come back and it will come back, the major account business and all of the commercial business will recover. So, yes, no doubt, you mentioned, our European business and we are very pleased with our major account business in the UK and some of the strength that we saw certainly in Q3 in our European business. And we expect -- quite honestly, we expect that to continue well into 2021. Mitch Ingles : Great. Thanks for the color. And best of luck. Paul Donahue : Yes. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We'd like to thank all of you for your participation in today's call, and we look forward to reporting our year-end results in February. Thank you very much for your support of Genuine Parts Company. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

Finally, consistent with prior two quarters, we\u2019ve accounted for the Business Products segment, S.P. Richards, as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today and hope you are all staying safe and well. Our fourth quarter results reflect the benefit of our ongoing strategic actions, despite the continued challenges of COVID-19. The GPC team was agile and adapting to dynamic conditions and executed on our initiatives to deliver customer value, operational efficiencies and strong financial results. We are grateful to our 50,000 associates for their unwavering commitment to excellence, while responding to unprecedented business and economic conditions, which have continued for nearly 12 months. Our operational focus is on ensuring a safe work environment, supporting our talented workforce and further strengthening our strong culture. In January, we\u2019re pleased to promote Will Stengel to President, and we now welcome Will to this quarterly call. As our Chief Transformation Officer since 2019, Will helped our business units work to achieve a variety of strategic initiatives and significant cost savings in 2020. Will\u2019s vast skill set and relevant experience in his previous career with HD Supply, have added tremendous value to our management team. His exceptional talent, proven leadership and experience make Will an excellent choice as our Company\u2019s next President. And we look forward to his future contributions. You will hear from both Will and Carol later in the call, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. So, now, turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Total sales for the quarter were $4.3 billion, down 1% due in part to the continued challenges of COVID-19. While our Automotive sales were strong in Asia Pac, the pace of recovery slowed in Europe and North America relative to the previous quarter. Industrial sales grew progressively stronger during the final three months of 2020 and were much improved from the prior two quarters. We further improved gross margin, and in fact, the fourth quarter was our 13th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. In addition, we successfully took action to reduce costs, lowering our year-over-year operating expenses. For the quarter, we generated an additional $40 million in permanent cost savings and realized another $40 million in temporary savings related to our response to COVID-19. Our progress in these areas drove a 14% increase in total operating profit and an 8.8% operating margin. This 110 basis-point improvement in operating margin from the fourth quarter of 2019 was supported by margin expansion in both, the Automotive and Industrial segments. Our strong operating performance drove adjusted net income of $221 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, up 20%. Due to ongoing working capital and debt financing initiatives, we also finished the quarter and year with a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and robust cash flow with $2 billion in cash from operations in 2020. Turning now to our business segments. Automotive represented 66% of total sales in the fourth quarter and Industrial was 34%. By region, 73% of revenues were attributable to North America, with 16% in Europe and 11% in Asia Pac. Total sales for the global Automotive Group were $2.8 billion, a 1% increase from 2019, with comp sales down 2%. Segment profit margin was up 130 basis points, driven by improvement in each of our Automotive operations. Fourth quarter sales were led by strong growth in Asia Pac with continued retail and commercial sales momentum driving a second consecutive quarter of mid-teens sales. The Asia Pac team performed well all year and deserves a special shout out on their exceptional results. So, congratulations and a big thank you to Rob Cameron and the entire Automotive team down under. In Europe and North America, the surge in COVID cases led to more restrictions on mobility, and mild weather through most of the quarter pressured sales of seasonal items. A second lockdown in November significantly slowed sales activity across Europe, although sales gradually improved through December, driving flat comps for the quarter. We would add as well that despite the challenging conditions in Europe overall, our UK operations continued to outperform with solid results for the quarter. Additionally, the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives more than offset the sales pressure, and the European team produced a 100 basis-point operating margin improvement. This caps a strong recovery in Europe\u2019s operating performance over the second half of 2020. In North America, our U.S. Automotive total sales and comp sales declined approximately 6%. Despite the sales decrease, the U.S. team generated a 200 basis-point improvement in operating profit margin. In Canada, quarterly sales were down slightly, comp sales declined 2%, and operating margin improved by 40 basis points. Growth in sales for our retail customers continued to outperform expectations, while sales to the DIFM segment remained challenging. Through the quarter, DIY sales were strong, driven by COVID-related shifts in consumer behavior and stimulus payments, and stronger NAPA sales positioning, resulting from several key initiatives. These include our ongoing store refreshes, investment in retail specialists, the benefit of our NAPA rewards program with 12.5 million active members, targeted promotions and enhanced merchandising initiatives. In addition, our growing omni-channel capabilities, including direct-to-customers shipping from select suppliers enabled our team to double our online sales volume from pre-pandemic levels. DIFM sales were down from 2019 as a slow recovery in miles driven, mild temperatures and continued pressure in our large fleet and government customers segment weighed on sales demand. To address these declines and build positive momentum in 2021, our team has focused on several initiatives, including maximizing sales force effectiveness by repurposing our field resources and doubling the number of professional salespeople calling directly on our end customers to professional repair garages, continued enhancement of our industry-leading commercial programs and promotions for the professional customers, including NAPA AutoCare and Auto Pro, improving our inventory availability, utilizing enhanced analytics to ensure more parts for more cars across our store network, strengthening in our supply chain, focusing on our global supplier relationships, as well as ensuring we have multiple suppliers by category. While we are seeing gradual improvement with supply chain service issues, there is more work yet to be done, and finally, further optimizing our network, including DC consolidation, increasing automation in our facilities and additional daily shuttles. In 2021, we will also continue to execute on several global initiatives and invest in our omni-channel strategy, both B2B and B2C to enhance and build new digital catalog and search capabilities, implement strategic pricing initiatives, focus on value added services, and continue our rollout of the NAPA brand in Europe and Australasia. We also have plans to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-on acquisitions, changeovers, and new greenfield stores to enhance our competitive positioning across our automotive operation. These initiatives are designed to deliver customer value, sell more parts, and capture market share. To that end, we are pleased to report a strong start in 2021 with January average daily sales up low double digits in the U.S. and for our global Automotive Group. Backing out the positive impact of FX and acquisition revenues, comp sales were up high single digits in January. We would add that we continue to see little impact of price inflation in our sales, although we expect to see more supplier increases in the coming months and quarters, possibly in the 1 to 3% range for the full year. So, in summary, we believe improving product availability, colder winter weather in North America and Europe, and the gradual reopening of the economy are current tailwinds for automotive business. In addition, favorable industry fundamentals, a growing total vehicle fleet, an increase in vehicles aged 6 to 12 years and expectation for the gradual recovery in miles driven give us confidence in our growth expectations for 2021, despite the ongoing uncertainties due to COVID-19. So, now, let\u2019s discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group are $1.4 billion, down 3.3% from last year. Comp sales were down 4.4%, a significant improvement from the 9% decrease in Q3 and the 17% decrease we saw back in Q2. The steady recovery in sales over the last half of 2020 is consistent with the gradual improvement in the industrial economy, which is evident in indicators such as the Purchasing Managers Index and industrial production. Strengthening conditions combined with our ongoing initiatives to drive growth and lower costs resulted in a 70 basis-point improvement in the segment profit margin and our strongest quarterly return on sales since the fourth quarter of 2007. Sales in North America and Australasia showed similar sales trends for the fourth quarter overall, although December was the strongest month in the quarter in North America. In addition, most key product categories achieved positive sales growth in December with improved month-to-month sales trends among virtually all the industries that we serve. We expect to build on these favorable trends in 2021. As we move forward into 2021, which is Motion\u2019s 75th year in business, the Industrial team will continue to execute on strategic initiatives to drive profitable sales growth, improve operational productivity and deliver customer value. These initiatives include building out our omnichannel capabilities to drive organic sales; optimize the value of the Motion website and accelerate e-commerce growth; growing our services and solutions business to expand our expertise in areas such as repair, conveyance and automation; ongoing disciplined M&A to further boost our products and service offering, while expanding our global footprint and market presence; enhancing our global pricing and product category management strategies to ensure sales excellence, margin effectiveness and a product offering that evolves the Motion brand globally; and optimizing our global distribution network, the enhanced automation and facility rationalization to lower cost, improve productivity and deliver excellent customer service. We are confident that our focus on these key initiatives will optimize our competitive positioning as the industrial markets recover to full capacity. We are encouraged to see releases of capital project orders that were on hold throughout most of 2020, which is a positive sign for our greater plant activity in the months and quarters ahead. In addition, we are pleased that our supplier service levels are strong, despite extended lead times on select items, and our inventories are in good position to meet expected growing demand. Finally, we currently expect another year of reasonable 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers, which compares to inflation of just under 1% in 2020. For additional perspective, we experienced positive sales momentum in January, with average daily sales up 2% for the month. This is better than the sales trends we reported in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 and is a testament to the great work done by the entire Industrial team. So, despite the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 and its uncertain impact on the global economy and our markets, we are confident in our plans for the Industrial segment and look forward to a strong 2021. So, let me conclude by providing an update on our ESG initiatives. At GPC, we embrace our responsibility to innovate in ways that also benefit our environment, our associates and the communities in which we operate. Our ESG practices, including human capital management, and diversity and inclusion are discussed in our 2020 corporate sustainability report. In addition, our Board of Directors adopted a formal human rights policy, which communicates the Company\u2019s commitment to upholding human rights in every location in which we operate as well as our expectation that our suppliers, partners and affiliates also respect human rights. Our Companywide commitment to sustainability is integral to our corporate growth strategy. We invite you to visit our GPC website to view these documents and learn more about our ESG initiatives. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Will for his remarks. Will? Will Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, I want to say that I\u2019m incredibly proud to be a part of Genuine Parts Company. The Company has an impressive history of success, and it\u2019s an honor to be on the GPC leadership team. I\u2019d like to thank Paul and the Board for their vote of confidence. As Paul mentioned, I joined the Company in late 2019 as Chief Transformation Officer. Previously, I held executive leadership positions at HD Supply, including time as President and CEO of HD Supply Facilities Maintenance, and various other strategy and operating roles. My experience in distribution-related businesses fits well with GPC\u2019s portfolio, business model and strategic initiatives, where consistent profitable growth, operating leverage, strong cash conversion, and disciplined capital allocation are all key value drivers, with the dividend an especially important part of the GPC capital allocation strategy. I\u2019m excited about the future potential of Genuine Parts Company. Each of our GPC businesses enjoy leadership positions within attractive fragmented markets with scale and capabilities to win. We have leading global brands and longstanding relationships, based on reliable customer service and value-added expertise. And our unique culture that is based on a clear set of core values and purpose serves as an important common foundation. Strategic actions taken in 2020 accelerated the transformation momentum built over recent years as we work to simplify the business and further define our critical focus areas. The global teams executed well as we navigated the pandemic and demonstrated an ability to act quickly and deliver results. Our strategic actions provided clarity for areas where we want to increase our focus, including profitable organic growth, driving operating productivity through simplification and integration, disciplined and strategic capital deployment and investments in talent to develop and build capabilities. Despite a challenging and unprecedented year, our diverse businesses proved resilient and built solid momentum as we enter 2021. In my new role, I look forward to working with Paul and the global leadership team as we align resources within our focus areas to execute these initiatives and deliver value as a team. I\u2019m also looking forward to spending time in our operations and with our customers and suppliers. In addition, we\u2019ll continue to further refine and advance our longer term strategic roadmap. We\u2019re excited about the numerous potential opportunities that new technologies and emerging trends could present for GPC. As we look to the future, we feel well-positioned to execute our strategic priorities to the benefit of all our stakeholders, and I look forward to working with the leadership team to drive results. Thank you. And I\u2019ll now turn it to Carol for her comments. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Will. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes restructuring, inventory, transaction and other costs and income. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then provide our full year outlook for 2021. Total GPC sales were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 0.7% from 2019. For the full year, sales were $16.5 billion, down 5.6% or down 2.3%, excluding divestitures. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 35%, a 40 basis-point improvement compared to 34.6% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin improved 100 basis points to 34.5% from 33.5% in 2019. Our team has been focused on a number of margin-enhancing initiatives, and the fourth quarter and full year gains represent the 13th consecutive quarter and the 5th consecutive year of improved gross margin for the Company. Our steady progress in expanding gross margin in the quarter and the year reflect a variety of factors, including the favorable impact of sales mix shifts to higher gross margin operations, positive product mix shifts, strategic pricing tools and analytics, global sourcing advantages and strategic category management initiatives. In addition, the full year gross margin also benefited from acquisitions and divestitures, which impacted our results through the nine months. We would add these positive factors were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes. And finally, as we assess the pricing environment in the fourth quarter and 2020 overall, there was minimal impact of price inflation in our sales and gross margins. As Paul mentioned earlier, we\u2019ll see how this plays out in 2021, but we have not had any impact of inflation to this point in the year. Our adjusted selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 2.8% from last year and representing 26.6% of sales compared to 27.2% last year. For the year, these expenses were $4.4 billion, down 3.9% compared to last year and 26.5% of sales compared to 26% in 2019. The decrease in operating expenses for the fourth quarter and full year reflect the favorable impact of our permanent and COVID-related cost actions implemented throughout 2020, as previously discussed. As mentioned on our third quarter conference call, in accordance with our 2019 $100 million cost savings plan, we successfully achieved the $100 million annual target ahead of schedule. We are pleased to report an incremental $40 million in savings recognized in the fourth quarter and $150 million in permanent expense reductions for 2020. In addition, our team continued to execute on a number of additional savings initiatives in response to the impact of COVID-19. These initiatives contributed temporary cost savings of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the full year. Combined, we generated approximately $80 million in total savings during the fourth quarter and approximately $450 million for the full year, driven by transformative reductions in payroll and facility costs, as well as temporary savings from furloughs, reduced travel and entertainment, government subsidies and other initiatives in response to COVID. We expect our permanent cost savings to carry over into 2021, and we\u2019ll continue to manage our expenses to further improve our cost structure and operating performance. Our total operating and non-operating expenses were an adjusted $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, down 3.4% from last year. This represents 28.1% of sales, down 80 basis points from 28.9% in 2019. For the full year, these expenses were an adjusted $4.7 billion, down 3% from the prior year and representing 28.4% of sales. Our total segment profit in the fourth quarter was $374 million, up 14% on a 1% sales decrease, and our segment profit margin was 8.8% compared to 7.7% last year for a strong increase of 110 basis points. For the full year, segment profit was $1.3 billion, up 3% compared to 2019, and our segment profit margin was 8.2% compared to 7.8% in the prior year. This represents our strongest full year segment profit margin since 2015. We had net interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter, and for 2020, net interest was $91 million, which is essentially flat from 2019. In 2021, we expect net interest of $70 million to $72 million, which is down from 2020 due to lower interest rates related to our new debt agreements negotiated in the fourth quarter, as well as the expectation for lower debt levels. The corporate expense line was $33 million in the fourth quarter, down from $37 million in 2019, and for the year, these expenses were $150 million. We currently expect our corporate expense to be in the $150 million range again in 2021. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.1%, an increase from 24.6% in the prior year period. For the year, our adjusted tax rate was 24.5% and in line with 2019. We are planning for a full year tax rate for 2021 in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%. Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was $172 million with earnings per share of $1.18. Adjusted net income was $221 million or $1.52 per share, which compares to $186 million or $1.27 per share in 2019 or a 20% increase. For the full year, reported net income was $163 million or $1.13 per share, and adjusted net income was $765 million or $5.27 per share. So, now, let\u2019s discuss our fourth quarter results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.8 billion, up 1% from the prior year. Segment profit of $240 million was up 19%, with profit margin at 8.5% compared to a 7.2% margin in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 130 basis-point increase in margin was driven by improved operating results across each of our Automotive businesses for the second consecutive quarter, so an excellent job of operating by our Automotive team, and we look forward to continued progress in 2021. Our Industrial sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, a 3.3% decrease from Q4 of 2019 and significantly improved from the sales declines in the second and third quarter. Segment profit of $133 million was up 5% from a year ago, and the profit margin was up 70 basis points to 9.3% compared to 8.6% last year. The improved margin for Industrial reflects gains in both, our North American and Australasian industrial businesses for the second consecutive quarter, so strong operating results for Industrial, which we expect to continue in 2021. So, now, I will turn our comments to the balance sheet. We continue to closely manage our accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable to improve our working capital position. In the fourth quarter, we sold $300 million in receivables for a total of $800 million sold in 2020 under an accounts receivable sales agreement. Our total accounts receivable is down 36% from 2019, and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at December 31, 2020, was up 2% from the prior year and accounts payable increased 5%, improving our AP to inventory ratio to 118% in 2020 from 114% in 2019. We are pleased with the progress our team is making to strengthen our supply chain. And in 2020, these key accounts were a source of cash from operations, and our total working capital was 7% of revenues. We repaid $230 million of debt in the fourth quarter, and our total debt of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020, is down $749 million or 22% from the $3.4 billion in 2019. During the fourth quarter, we further improved our debt position with new public debt and a new revolving credit agreement that provided for expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates. We closed the year with $2.9 billion in available liquidity, which is up from $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Through our efforts in these and other areas, we generated a robust $2 billion in cash from operations in 2020, which is up from $833 million in 2019. Our free cash flow was $1.9 billion, an increase from $555 million in 2019. While we selectively scaled back our near-term plans for capital deployment in early April of 2020 to conserve cash through COVID-19, we were very committed to several key priorities for cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our key priorities include the reinvestment in our businesses via capital expenditures, M&A, share repurchases and the dividend. We have deployed $4.7 billion in capital across these areas over the last four years. In 2020, we reduced our original $300 million in CapEx plan by 50% and invested $154 million in essential capital expenditures, which was down from $278 million in 2019. For 2021, we expect to resume more normal levels of our reinvestments in our businesses and are planning for total capital expenditures in the range of $275 million to $325 million for the year. We also pulled back on M&A activity in 2020, although strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. In 2020, we used $69 million in cash to acquire several small businesses. And in 2021, we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement our global Automotive and Industrial segments. As a reminder, we have not considered any of these future acquisitions in our 2021 outlook. The Company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.26 per share annual dividend for 2021, representing our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 3% increase from the $3.16 per share paid in 2020. In 2020, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock prior to suspending our share repurchases amid the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we were authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million additional shares, and we expect to make additional opportunistic share repurchases again in 2021. Turning to our outlook for 2021, we are reinstating our practice of providing full year guidance. In arriving at our full year 2021 guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends and the global economic outlook. In addition, we consider the continued uncertainty of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 4% to plus 6%. These growth rates assume a relatively neutral impact from foreign currency translation, minimal price inflation and as mentioned before, exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, including plus 3% to plus 5% comp sales growth, and a total sales increase of plus 3% to plus 5% for the Industrial segment, including an increase in comp sales of plus 2% to plus 4%. On the earnings side, we currently expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.55 to $5.75. This represents a 5% to 9% increase compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2020. We move forward into 2021, confident in our strategic plans and initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results and deliver value. In addition, we believe that the underlying industry fundamentals for our global Automotive and Industrial segments are favorable and will continue to provide us with sustained long-term growth opportunities. So, that\u2019s our financial update, and we look forward to reporting on further improvement in our financial performance throughout 2021. Thank you. And I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. Looking back on the quarter and the year, we are proud of our team for their continued focus on executing our strategic growth initiatives and cost actions. The GPC team and our Automotive and Industrial business proved resilient in meeting the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. We closed the year strong with a strong financial performance. We want to thank each of our GPC team members for their continued support, dedication and commitment to serving customers and being the best. We entered 2021 as a stronger, more agile Company, with streamlined operations at a more optimized portfolio focused on the global Automotive and Industrial businesses. We are well positioned with a stronger balance sheet and strategic plan to capture profitable growth, generate strong cash flow and drive shareholder value. We are off to a solid start to the year with global automotive sales growth and ongoing industrial recovery and operational improvements. With the continued rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, we look forward to a global recovery from the pandemic and a strengthening economy. For all these reasons, the GPC team is excited about 2021. And we look forward to reporting on our progress as we move through the year. So, thank you for your interest in Genuine Parts Company. And with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey. Good morning, guys. When you look at the NAPA U.S. trends, I guess, it wasn\u2019t quite clear on the commentary. It sounded as if December ended flattish or December ended up. And I think, could you talk a little bit about regional performance as well as NAPA Company-owned stores versus independents in the fourth quarter? Paul Donahue : Happy to do so, Bret. And, let me start with the Company store versus our independents. Our Company stores slightly outperformed our independents in the quarter. We\u2019ve seen that already reversed in the other direction in January. That\u2019ll flip month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. So, no real big news there. Regionality, what we saw in the quarter was kind of consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing. We saw really good performance out West. I\u2019m really proud of our Western division and the job that group is doing. Our Mountain team, as they have all year, had a solid quarter. And the Mountain, Bret, just FYI, they stretch from Colorado, Montana, all the way down to Texas. We saw some softness in the Southeast. We saw a little softness in the Northeast as well. In relation to your question about the cadence of the quarter and December specifically, we started out the quarter okay. And I\u2019m assuming that question was around U.S. Automotive, Bret? Bret Jordan : Yes. That was U.S. Paul Donahue : Yes. October started out okay, pretty much in line with September. We saw softness in December, -- and then we saw softness in December as well. I think the first couple of months were probably more related to a little bit warmer weather than -- especially in November, plus we saw a little bit of a COVID resurgence in the U.S. December is a bit unique, Bret. And if you remember, we had a big December a year ago, 2019. We were going up against some pretty tough comps. So, that certainly impacted December as well. But look, here is a good news, Bret, for us and the NAPA team is, we had a really strong rebound in January, both DIY and DIFM, which we\u2019re really pleased to see the commercial business bouncing back in January. And that\u2019s carrying into February as well. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And question is on the supply chain. It sounded as if you were saying maybe there is a couple of categories where stock levels could be better. Is there anything to call out there? I mean, it sounds like batteries have been a great category this winter, but maybe some supply constraints there. I mean, are there any standout categories we should be looking at? Paul Donahue : Well, you hit the first one, Bret. We have had -- and we did have a good year in our battery business. And I expect with this cold weather, we\u2019re going to see even a greater surge in our battery business. But supply has been a challenge. And I think you\u2019ve heard that elsewhere. Pleased to say, we\u2019re not seeing that in Europe. We have a strong battery business. We actually just launched the NAPA battery across Europe. We have our suppliers taking good care of us over there. And we\u2019re seeing really good business across Europe in the battery business. But, that would be the call out. There\u2019s a couple of other suppliers that are impacting us. And look, these guys are battling labor shortages due to COVID, some shortages of raw materials. So, I understand they got their challenges, and we\u2019re hoping to see improvement here as we roll into \u201821. Bret Jordan : And I guess, just a quick follow-up on your Europe comment. It sounded as if you said both the U.S. and Europe had sequentially softened a little bit from the third quarter. But, could you talk a little bit how you saw Europe roll through the fourth quarter and maybe there are trends into January? Paul Donahue : Yes. So, Europe, they started out really strong. As you know, they had a great third quarter, mid-double-digit increase, Bret. And we had a good October. They were up high single digits in October. We saw a big reversal in November, a double-digit swing from October as Europe locked down due to COVID. So, we saw the third wave come through and that just kind of knocked the wind out of our sales. December bounced back a bit from that softer November. But again, good news, much like North America, we saw a nice rebound in January, and our European team was up strong mid-single-digit. So, we\u2019re encouraged. And we got a lot of good things going on with AAG. I would really, Bret, call out our UK team. They had a really strong year, despite some pretty severe lockdowns during the course of the year. But, again, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our UK team. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JP Morgan. Chris Horvers : First of all, a follow-up question. So, as you talked about the year-to-date in the U.S., you mentioned, do-it-for-me, the pro business getting better. Did that turn positive so far in January and February? Paul Donahue : Yes, absolutely. Yes. We had a double-digit increase in January, and we saw it on both sides of the counter, Chris. We saw it in DIY, as we did most of 2020, our DIY business was strong, like most in the industry. But, where we struggled a bit in \u201820 was in our commercial business. And our commercial business I think is a bit unique compared to most. It\u2019s very, very heavy commercial fleet, government municipalities, but again, really pleased to see that business turn positive in the month of January. And I\u2019m hopeful, Chris, with this -- some of the weather we\u2019re seeing and the reopening of the economies and the vaccines getting out there that -- and along with a little bit of a lift in miles driven, we\u2019ll see some resurgence in our DIFM business. Chris Horvers : And then, following up there, as you think about the fleet business, how are you thinking about that? Obviously, there\u2019s been some strain on colleges and governments. And are you seeing any sequential improvement in those businesses? Presumably, they remain negative. And, how are you thinking about the outlook in \u201821? Paul Donahue : Well, we do think we\u2019ll see improvement overall in that fleet business in \u201821. And January certainly is a good indicator, Chris. Look, there\u2019s a ways to go. By any stretch, we\u2019re not out of the woods in relation to the upheaval caused by COVID. But, we are seeing green shoots, and we are pleased to see a real solid January. Chris Horvers : Yes, understood. And then, on the Industrial business, if you\u2019re up 2% in January, that\u2019s not stimulus-driven, and you\u2019re guiding, I think, 3% to 5% comps -- or 2% to 4% comps in that business in 2021, and you did it down 8% in 2020. So, is there something that you\u2019re seeing there that provides caution why you wouldn\u2019t expect higher same-store sales in that segment, or is that -- you\u2019re just trying to be conservative given the unknown of COVID? Paul Donahue : Well, look, Chris, there is a little certainly a bit of conservatism built into those numbers. We feel really good about the prospects for a strong recovery in our Industrial business in \u201821. We\u2019ve seen now eight straight months of PMI. We generally trail that metric by a few months. So, yes, we feel good. Especially when you look back at 2020, Q2, we were down 17; Q3, down 9; and Q4, down 3 and then post a positive January. But, that conservatism that you kind of referred to, Chris, again, we\u2019re not out of the woods. We\u2019re still seeing some plants shut down just in the last couple of weeks. We do a big business with the OE automotive plants. We\u2019ve seen a number of those shut down to raw material shortages. We\u2019re still pressured in the Southwest with oil and gas. So, yes, we\u2019re -- we feel good, but we\u2019re also seeing still just a few headwinds out there on the Industrial side. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then, last question is, Carol, can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about gross margin rate in 2021 and as well as SG&A, given you did have a big COVID cost savings number that you\u2019re going to lap against? Carol Yancey : Yes, happy to. As far as gross margin, and look, the team, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with what we\u2019ve done in the gross margin area. We have, and you saw we finally anniversaried the impact from acquisitions and divestitures. So, our core gross profit in Q4, really pleased to see our initiatives working. We do expect, as we look ahead to have continued improvement in gross profit, may not be at the level that it\u2019s been, but we would expect to see continued gross margin improvement. And, we\u2019ve called out the initiatives in that area before from product mix and strategic category management and even our pricing and global sourcing. And then, I\u2019ll make a few comments on SG&A, and then maybe let Will add and talk about what we\u2019re going to see for 2021. And, you\u2019re right. We did have the temporary cost savings, but more importantly our permanent cost savings of $150 million do roll in to 2021. And we expect to -- while some of those, certainly, the temporary savings come back in. When you look at our outlook for 2021 on SG&A, we have improvement when you go back to say the 2019 levels. So, we really have permanently reduced our cost structure, if you will. But having said that, there\u2019s still things we\u2019re working on that. We\u2019re going to see headwinds in terms of payroll and freight. And I\u2019ll maybe let Will talk about a few things we\u2019re doing to maybe offset some of those headwinds. Will Stengel : Yes, Chris. So, maybe just back on gross margin. I mean, gross margin is going to continue to be a focus for us as we move forward. I think, in the prepared remarks, we did a nice job of laying out kind of some of the details in terms of what that means. But category management around pricing, global sourcing, et cetera, will be important priorities for us as we move forward. On the SG&A, there is really kind of two ways to think about it. First is, the importance, as Carol alluded to, of keeping these temporary cost savings out. So, converting them from temporary to permanent, and that\u2019s a daily activity that we work on with the teams here. But then, obviously, very discrete productivity initiatives around the globe around SG&A, ranging from labor productivity in DCs, evaluating and analyzing indirect spend, low-cost country opportunities for back-office functions, et cetera. So, we\u2019ve got a laundry list of very tactical actions. And we\u2019re excited about the momentum that we\u2019ve got. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore. Michael Montani : I also just wanted to offer congratulations to Will on the promotion. Will Stengel : Thank you, Mike. Michael Montani : So, if I could start off -- just was on the SG&A front first off. Is there a way to think about the potential dollar growth year-over-year and/or the kind of organic comps that we would need to see to get natural leverage there? Carol and Will, I think, historically, kind of 2% to 3% was the number organic growth, but if you could give us an update there? Carol Yancey : Yes. Look, we have -- and as you have seen, we are guiding to organic growth at -- in the 3% to 5% range. We certainly expect to have margin improvement with that organic growth. And again, we\u2019re looking at getting ourselves back to certainly to a sales level at where 2019 was but a profit and operating margin level that\u2019s greater than that. So, I think, it\u2019s at the low end of the 3% that we can have margin improvement. And I certainly think that you\u2019ll see that with some of the initiatives we talked about. Michael Montani : Okay, great. And, if I could, just on the NAPA front, just wanted to parse out, in the fourth quarter, if there\u2019s any extra color you can share, Paul, on DIY versus DIFM comps? And then, if you could help us just to understand the traffic and ticket split for the comp. Paul Donahue : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Let me take the latter part of that question first. As we look at ticket comps and we look across the globe, I\u2019m really pleased with the trends we\u2019re seeing in Australia -- our Asia Pac business was up strong in both average ticket size and traffic. Canada, we were up both average ticket size and traffic. U.S., our average ticket was up, which has been a trend we\u2019ve seen for a number of quarters now. Traffic was down a bit in the U.S., again, not a surprise because we saw a real surge in our digital online, deliver-to-store, pick up at curbside. So, folks are still a little bit reticent I think to walk into stores. And then, the other question, Mike, you asked was around DIY, DIFM in the quarter, in Q4. What we saw was much like we had seen throughout the year with -- or the latter part of the year, I should say, with DIY held up strong and DIFM was certainly pressured in the quarter. But again, as I think I mentioned earlier in a question, really pleased to see both trending up in January. So, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we\u2019re going to see our DIFM return to solid growth in 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Beth Reed : Hey, guys. This is Beth Reed on for Scot. I just had a question on the acceleration in the U.S. auto business that you\u2019re seeing into January and February. Is there any way to kind of quantify the impact of stimulus on that acceleration? And any other factors you would call out that you think are the main drivers? Paul Donahue : Yes. Thanks, Beth. Look, stimulus monies are definitely impacting the DIY business, I think, not only for us, but our peer group. But, we are a dominant DIFM business. That\u2019s 80-plus-percent of our business at. So, I don\u2019t really believe we see much impact, if any, stimulus on our DIFM business. Yes, I think, if I were to point to perhaps some of the lift that we\u2019re seeing early in the year. Look, the weather is a factor. There is just no two ways about it. And, we\u2019re seeing a return to a more normalized winter that we haven\u2019t seen in a few years. What\u2019s unfortunate, Beth, and we don\u2019t want to take this lightly. There are lots of folks out there in the Texas region that are without power. They\u2019ve been without power for a couple of days. So, we don\u2019t mind seeing winter. I just wish it wasn\u2019t quite as extreme and the impact that it\u2019s having. We\u2019ve got a number of distribution centers, branches, stores that are closed throughout Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama. So, it\u2019s definitely taken a toll here this week. We\u2019ll see the long-term impact of a really cold weather, and it will show up months down the road when parts begin to fail as a result of some of this really brutally cold winter. Beth Reed : All right. Got it. And then, just a quick clarification. Did you say January trends have largely kind of continued into February? Paul Donahue : Well, they certainly did. But, what we\u2019re seeing right now is with the number of DC closures were across Texas and the other states I just mentioned, along with many of our Industrial branches. I think the number I saw yesterday, Beth, we had about 90 of our Industrial branches were closed. So, it\u2019s going to have a little bit of an impact probably for a couple of days. But, again, we\u2019ll recover. And I expect that will have a positive impact longer-term on our business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. And yes, I\u2019ll pass my congrats on to Will. Will Stengel : Thanks, Dan. Daniel Imbro : Carol, I wanted to start -- and apologies if I missed this, trying to screw away the cost cutting last year with maybe some of the organic growth slowing. You targeted $100 million. Obviously, you exceeded that meaningfully. I think, you said $150 million in permanent cost cuts. As you look back with hindsight, is it possible, in some places, you may have cut too deep, and that\u2019s part of the reason for the organic growth slowdown? And then, if not, can you maybe share some detail on where you did remove the cost, so we can better understand why that isn\u2019t impacting service levels? Carol Yancey : Yes. Look, we -- as you look at our cost savings, and again, this was done early on in response to the very-drastic declines in volume that we saw from Europe starting at the end of Q1 to North America and other geographies. We had -- Q2 was one of our worst quarters ever in the Company\u2019s history. And with that, there was actions that needed to be taken. And as related to reducing payroll, reducing positions, we had furloughs, we had deferred travel and entertainment, we looked at facility and lease reductions, we looked at our facility costs, we looked at -- I mean, we looked at anything and everything. And it was -- again, we did that without impacting our service, but we did it to adjust to the lower volumes. And then, as volumes have come back, we looked at those costs. Again, some of those costs had to come back in. During this time, we also didn\u2019t let up on our investments in productivity and automation. So, we had a number of automation projects that we continue to work on that would help us with productivity improvements, where we rationalize facilities and put in more automated conveyor systems. That helped us as well. So, again, we -- the permanent savings go back to a year ago. Those were largely payroll related, the $150 million. Again, we were very comfortable to how those were done. The temporary ones were just that. They were temporary in nature. And remember, part of that temporary was government subsidies. So, again, we had about $60 million in government subsidies that are nonrecurring. The fact of the matter is we go into 2021 with a lower overall cost base and excitement about the initiatives we have in place to keep our cost structure down. Paul Donahue : Hey Daniel, I\u2019ll just add a comment to that as well because it\u2019s been mentioned before, and I touched on it in my prepared remarks. But just to call out, in our NAPA business here across the U.S., we have over 3,000 sales professionals between our Company stores and our independent stores that are working with our shops and professional garages every day. So, the thought of did we cut too deep, we don\u2019t believe so. And again, I think, what we saw were some transitory challenges in \u201820 that are going to bounce back in \u201821. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys for that. And then, I wanted to ask a clarifier on the comp growth you said earlier, Carol. I think, you said within Auto, 3% to 5% comps with 4 to 6 total revs, and then Industrial is 2 to 4 with total revs in 3 to 5. Most of those would imply roughly only 100 basis points of FX headwind. I guess, can you help me understand how they have a similar amount of headwinds between the segments when Automotive has a much larger European footprint? So, I would think, FX is more of a tailwind to the Auto business. So, trying to reconcile, yes, the magnitude of FX impact. Thanks. Carol Yancey : Yes. Just to be clear, the same-store sales guidance that we gave in relation to the total sales is more of the impact of the carryover of acquisitions from 2020. So, we had a number of bolt-on acquisitions in the automotive space and then we also had three Industrial acquisitions late in 2020. So, the 1% differential is the carryover of M&A. Our implication for foreign currency is really neutral. And we also have inflation neutral in these numbers. As Paul mentioned, we expect we will see some inflation at some point. But, this is truly just what we know today as far as organic growth, plus a little bit of carryover from acquisitions that\u2019s in that guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. David Bellinger : I want to follow-up on January, but a bit of a different context. So, a few of your auto parts competitors have indicated comparable sales accelerating into the double digits, maybe since its January. It seems as though NAPA comp sales are up high single digits at this point. So, is there anything that\u2019s changed versus your peers from the last few quarters? Is there something strategic on your part that helps them to narrow the gap versus competitors, or is it really the mix of business that\u2019s driving that better delta now? Paul Donahue : Well, look David, it\u2019s a reasonable question. We\u2019ve been working on a number of initiatives throughout the course of 2020 that I would tell you I think are really beginning to take hold. We are not nearly as weighted towards the DIY side. So, even though we\u2019re seeing some nice lift in DIY, it\u2019s not going to move the needle for us like DIFM. So, what I would point to and how we\u2019re narrowing that gap is the slight recovery we\u2019re seeing from COVID, markets opening back up, I think, we\u2019re going to see miles driven tick back up. We haven\u2019t seen any official numbers out of December, January yet. But that coupled with some winter weather is all going to help spike our DIFM business. And again, we\u2019re really, really pleased to see that spike in the month of January. David Bellinger : Got it. Okay. And then, my follow-up here, how are you thinking about the pace of parts inflation throughout 2021? You mentioned a limited benefit last year, maybe a low single-digit rate coming this year. Are you getting ahead of that now and flowing some price to both DIY and commercial, given strengthening demand? And, do you expect to fully offset any cost increases through price this year? Carol Yancey : Yes. Look, we are getting early indication from our suppliers. I mean, look, our suppliers, as Paul mentioned, they\u2019re facing raw material increases, freight and ocean cargo and just the significant increases that our suppliers are facing, labor shortages, labor inflation. We are hearing that our suppliers are discussing price increases, we believe, certainly in Automotive, it\u2019s been very rational. And as these price increases come that they will get passed through. Also on the Industrial side, our teams are trying to stay ahead of that and doing a lot of things to make sure that those can -- when they do get the pricing, they can pass them along. I would tell you that will probably be more second half weighted. Again, some of this is managing through the uncertainty right now, but probably more second half weighted. So, the 1% to 2%, 1% to 3%, if you will, is on a full year basis, but probably more second half. But again, that\u2019s not in any of our numbers. And the last thing I would just add, and you heard Will talk about it, our teams have so many terrific initiatives going on in the gross margin area, especially in terms of pricing. So, we\u2019re a lot more agile today. We have a lot more analytics and a lot more strategic pricing initiatives that will help us offset this as well. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation in our year-end and Q4 conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest and support of Genuine Parts Company. And we look forward to reporting out to you on our first quarter results in April. Thank you. And have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

Welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today and hope you're staying safe and well. We are pleased with the strong start to 2021 and ongoing recovery in our automotive and industrial businesses.  The GPC team remain focused on solid execution and in delivering strong financial results through improving sales trends, increasing operational efficiencies and enhancing customer value. Through the quarter, we operated thoughtfully, with the physical and mental well-being of our employees the top priority as our 50,000-plus GPC teammates are the core of our success. Turning now to our first quarter financial results. Total sales for the quarter were $4.5 billion, up 9% from last year, and significantly improved from the 1% sales decrease in the fourth quarter of 2020. Gross margins was also a positive, representing our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion. And our teams in the field continue to do a great job of managing our expenses through ongoing cost actions and the carryover of expense reductions implemented last year. These results drove a 41% increase in operating profit and an 8.1% operating margin, which is up 180 basis points from the first quarter of last year. Our strong operating performance drove net income of $218 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.50, up 88%. We also continued to fortify our balance sheet, ensuring ample liquidity and solid cash flow. We are proud of our teams, and we are encouraged by our results, and we intend to build on this momentum throughout 2021.  Turning now to our business segments. Automotive represented 66% of total sales in the first quarter, and industrial was 34%. By region, 73% of revenues were attributable to North America, with 16% in Europe and 11% in Asia Pac.  Total sales for global automotive were $3 billion, a 14% increase from 2020 and much improved from a 1% increase in Q4 of 2020. Comp sales were up 8%, improved from a 2% decrease in the fourth quarter, and segment profit margin was up 250 basis points, driven by strong operating results in each of our automotive operations.  Sales were driven by positive sales comps across all our operations, with 15% comps in Europe and Asia Pac, 7% comps in the U.S. and 3% comps in Canada. The ongoing global economic recovery, including financial stimulus in the U.S., improving inventory availability, favorable weather conditions and our focus on key growth initiatives were all sales drivers in the quarter. We would add that while we continue to expect a reasonable level of inflation as we move through 2021, price inflation was not a factor in our first quarter sales.  In Europe, sales were much improved from Q4 as our team capitalized on the strengthening sales environment despite lockdowns throughout the region. In addition, initiatives to grow key accounts enhance inventory availability and the ongoing launch of the NAPA brand continue to prove effective in driving profitable growth and market share gains. For the quarter, our teams in France and the U.K. outperformed in the region with strong double-digit sales comps. We would also call out a much improved performance by our team in the Benelux region. The strong sales recovery, combined with excellent expense controls, produced a 500 basis point improvement in operating margin, so a terrific start to the year for our European operations.  In Asia Pac, our automotive sales remained in line with the mid-teens growth we experienced through the second half of 2020. For the quarter, both retail and commercial sales held strong as the region operated through multiple lockdowns associated with the pandemic. Retail sales, which represent over 40% of our total sales volume through our Repco stores continue to outperform, posting a 33% increase in March and plus-24% in the quarter.  Our commercial sales continue to accelerate as well, posting double-digit sales growth in the quarter. We continue to benefit from the strength in online sales, which reached record highs at 3x pre-COVID levels. Finally, building on the NAPA brand name has been well received, and we remain focused on growing our NAPA presence in the region.  Summing it up, this group continues to perform at a very high level on both the top and bottom lines, resulting in 150 basis point improvement and profit margin for the quarter. In North America, comp sales in the U.S. were up 7%, helping this business post a 180 basis point increase in profit margins. In Canada, we operated through a variety of regional lockdowns, which impacted our larger markets of Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec. Comp sales were up 3% and operating margin was up 130 basis points.  Sales in the U.S., which posted its strongest quarterly comp since the first quarter of 2015, were driven by solid growth in both the retail and commercial segments. This was our first quarter of positive commercial comps since pre-pandemic, and our team produced record sales volumes in the month of March. In addition, both ticket and traffic counts were positive on both our retail and commercial transactions, marking our first increase in traffic counts in several quarters.  By region, the Atlantic, Midwest and West groups posted the strongest growth, although we would also call out our Northeast group, which produced solid growth in the quarter. This is notable that this region of the U.S. has been most affected by the COVID-19 lockdowns over the past 13 months. Likewise, we would add that product sales in categories such as batteries, tools and equipment and brakes were strong this quarter. We are especially encouraged to see the rebound in our brakes business, which generally is a positive indicator for our commercial business.  On the retail side, which continues to outperform with strong double-digit growth, we continue to drive sales via investments in retail specialists and store refreshes as well as targeted promotions. We would also call out our ongoing omnichannel investments and the increase in B2C online sales, which reached record levels in the quarter and were up 150% from the prior year.  For commercial sales, our other wholesale category of independent garage customers, continued to generate strong growth. We have been encouraged by the number of new accounts we are serving. Clearly, our investments in increasing the number of professional salespeople on the Street has been effective in attracting new customers to NAPA.  We were also pleased to see improved sales with our NAPA Auto Care and major account customers, which posted positive sales growth for the first time in several quarters. Sales to the fleet and government group were down year-over-year, but sequentially improved from the fourth quarter. And we look for further improvement in sales to this segment. As we look ahead, we are excited for the growth opportunities we see for our global automotive segment. We expect further improvement in aftermarket fundamentals such as increased miles driven, a growing vehicle fleet and an increase in vehicles age 6 to 12 years, all favorable for the industry. We can assure you we remain focused on our initiative to deliver customer value and ultimately, sell more parts for more cars. These plans include further enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening our supply chain, and investing in our omnichannel capabilities. In addition, we expect to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-on acquisitions, changeovers and new greenfield stores to further enhance our competitive positioning. So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.5 billion, flat with last year. Comp sales were down 2%, improved from a 4% decrease in Q4 and reflecting the third consecutive quarter of improving sales trends. March was a breakout month with the North American Motion team posting a 7% increase in average daily sales and achieving record sales volumes. This was a tremendous accomplishment and another turning point for GPC and our emergence from the pandemic. The ongoing recovery over the last 9 months is in line with the continued improvement in the industrial economy, which you can see in several key indicators for our business. For perspective, PMI was 64.7% in March, an increase of 4.2 points from December 31. In addition, industrial production increased by 2.5% in the first quarter, the third consecutive quarter of expansion following the significant downturn in the second quarter of 2020.  Importantly, we can see these positive indicators translating to more activity with our customers, which are operating at higher run rates as well as releasing capital project orders. The strengthening sales environment, along with our initiatives to drive growth and control cost, produced an 80 basis point margin improvement with segment profit margin at 8.3% versus 7.5% last year. Diving deeper into our Q1 sales, we would start by saying that inflation remains a nonfactor in our numbers thus far. That said, we are seeing more pricing activity and expect another year of 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers. For the quarter, we experienced improving sales trend among virtually all product categories and industries third. We were especially encouraged by the recovery in the equipment and machinery, aggregate and cement, and wood and lumber sectors, all key industry groups for us.  In addition, we continue to benefit from the build-out of our omnichannel capabilities, with digital sales up 2x from the first quarter in 2020. A key driver of our digital growth relates to our inside sales center, which is generating incremental sales to new Motion customers. While still a relatively small percentage of total sales, we are excited by the potential for future sales growth.  We also remain focused on growing our services and solution businesses to expand our expertise and sales opportunities in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. We have made several bolt-on acquisitions to build scale in these areas, and our services and solutions capabilities remain a key consideration in our overall M&A strategy for the industrial business.  To further ensure profitable sales growth, we continue to enhance our pricing and category management strategies. In addition, we plan to continue to optimize our supply chain network and further improve our productivity while delivering exceptional customer service.  Closing out our industrial comments. We remain bullish about our Motion business, and we are excited to see this team moving back into a growth mode.  So now I'll conclude my remarks by providing a brief update on our ESG initiatives. As outlined in our corporate sustainability report, GPC embraces our responsibility to innovate in ways that provide for our environment, our associates and the communities in which we operate. In Q1, we expanded our training and development programs to ensure personal growth and enhance our comprehensive well-being program focused on the emotional, financial and physical health of our GPC teammates. Additionally, we continue to make progress in the advancement of our corporate commitment to diversity and inclusion. We are actively recruiting talent that is representative of the communities we serve, training our teammates to mitigate unconscious bias and model inclusive behaviors while strengthening partnerships that support our D&I initiatives.  Finally, we remain focused on our mission to be good corporate citizens where we both work and live. Since 1928, we have been giving back to communities and causes that make a difference, and that legacy continues in 2021. So now, I'll turn it over to Will for his remarks. Will? William Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, I want to congratulate the global GPC team on the performance this quarter. I'd also like to thank our customers for their loyalty and our suppliers for their partnership. As Paul mentioned, our team delivered solid performance in the first quarter and had strong momentum. The environment has improved compared to 2020, but we remain cautious as global uncertainty continues to be a part of doing business each day. Areas of attention for us include COVID-19, inflation, global logistics and product and labor availability. We also have more challenging year-over-year comparisons that will require sustained momentum during the second half of the year. Despite the uncertainty, the GPC team is energized and focused to deliver performance. I'll now share some additional perspective on our strategic initiatives in progress. The foundation of our priorities is based on the customer experience and understanding their needs and working to exceed their expectations. We are analyzing and listening to customer feedback and our corresponding strength and opportunities. In the simplest terms, our customers need us to be easy to do business with, reliable and helpful. This independent data reinforces our priorities and serves as a guiding principle in terms of required action and strategic investments. To deliver a best-in-class customer experience, we have opportunities to simplify and integrate our existing operations. The global teams are executing multiyear plans to realign teams, streamline processes, improve operational productivity and reduce costs. These initiatives will not only create operating efficiency but also enable faster team executions, deliver a better customer experience and accelerate profitable growth. I'd like to highlight a few initiatives that illustrate our efforts to simplify and integrate.  For example, we're working to optimize facilities footprint and coverage, simplify and integrate disparate legacy IT systems, streamline back-office support functions, offshore noncustomer-facing functional activities and centralized GPC indirect sourcing processes as a few examples. As we simplify and integrate, we're simultaneously investing in our core business and positioning for the future. Our strong cash flow, solid capital structure and disciplined capital allocation provide the flexibility needed to continue to make these investments. Key pillars of our core investments include talent, sales force effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging vehicle technologies.  A few highlights of our progress across the key pillars during the quarter include : one, talent. We continue to take deliberate action across the globe to recognize high-potential talent, infuse new capabilities into the organization and recruit diverse talent that is representative of the communities we serve. Examples include category management, digital, emerging vehicle technology and field leadership roles to name a few. Talent will always be a priority area of investment as we strive to be an employer of choice for teammates that share our DPC values and want to play a leadership role in our exciting future.  Two, sales force effectiveness. Data and analytics to understand our unique customer segments, the different needs of each segment, and associated strategies to serve the segment is a foundational element of sales force effectiveness. The sales efforts reflect our omnichannel initiatives and include an increasing mix of both traditional selling and digital strategies. As an example, the U.S. automotive team revamped its sales intensity with new reporting and tools to track customer visits, digital tools to communicate with field sales teammates and enhanced virtual product and skills training. In addition, in 2021, the U.S. automotive team adjusted compensation programs to better align incentives with profitable growth.  Three, digital. As I mentioned, digital is a foundational priority as we deliver a best-in-class customer experience and accelerate profitable growth. Our businesses delivered excellent performance via digital channels in the quarter. We continue to see strong increases versus prior year across our global digital channels. Digital still represents a relatively small portion of our total sales, and we're excited about the compelling digital vision our teams are executing. Related, we continue to invest in foundational digital elements, including catalog, search and other critical customer experience elements such as ease of ordering, pricing and analytics. Four, supply chain. Our supply chain initiatives are focused to ensure we have the right product available in the right market at the right time. We're continuously executing inventory, facility, productivity, logistics and technology strategies to achieve this goal. One solid example is the success the U.S. industrial team enjoyed with recent facility automation investments that delivered a 500% labor productivity improvement. Other select examples would be enhanced workforce management and delivery tracking tools in the U.S. automotive business.  Lastly, emerging vehicle technologies. We aspire to lead as it relates to the opportunities that emerging vehicle technologies present for our automotive industries. We believe we have a unique position to leverage, including our scaled global footprint, diverse portfolio, leading global brands, established customer supplier relationships and One GPC team approach. Through our planning process, we developed a multidimensional strategy to address electric vehicle trends. A few select highlights include : the alignment of talent 100% dedicated to developing and executing EV strategies, product and category management strategies with existing and new SKUs, global supplier councils with existing strategic partners, advisory groups leveraging our 25,000 global repair center relationships and partnerships with strategic EV market participants. While we acknowledge the focus on critical initiatives that deliver near and medium term performance, we're taking action to build out and act on an exciting future vision.  Lastly, strategic bolt-on acquisitions are a key part of our GPC growth strategy. We utilize acquisitions to acquire new customers, further penetrate existing priority markets and our new geographies, acquire product and service capabilities and acquire talent. We also believe our acquisition capabilities position us well as we selectively consider and test new business models. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and actionable given the fragmentation of our markets. We believe our scale, market-leading brands, global footprint and unique culture position us to be an acquirer of choice. We will remain selective and disciplined as we execute this important part of our strategy.  Similar to the approach utilized for our 2019 cost savings plan, the global teams developed tools in a monthly cadence to create visibility and status on initiatives. This approach not only helps drive performance, but also helps to share best practices around the globe as One GPC team.  In summary, I hope today's remarks reinforce our sense of focus and global teamwork. We will remain agile as the global environment continues to evolve, and we will remain focused on what we can control as we execute through the balance of the year and beyond.  Thank you, and I'll now turn it to Carol to review the financial performance details. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Will. We will begin with a review of our key financial information, and then we will provide an update on our full year outlook for 2021. Total GPC sales were $4.5 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from last year and improved from the 0.7% decrease in the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 34.5%, a 60 basis point improvement compared to 33.9% in the first quarter last year. Our steady progress and improving gross margin continues to reflect the positive impact of a number of initiatives, including our pricing and global sourcing strategies, and we also benefited from a sales mix shift to higher gross margin operations. We would add that the level of supplier incentives in the quarter were in line with last year and neutral to gross margin. And as Paul mentioned earlier, there was minimal impact of price inflation in our first quarter sales, and this is true for gross margin as well.  As we move through the year, we will continue to execute on our initiatives to drive additional gross margin gains via positive product mix shift, strategic pricing tools and analytics, global sourcing advantages and also strategic category management initiatives. Our selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.2 billion in the first quarter, up 4.6% from last year or up 5.3% from last year's adjusted SG&A. This reflects an improvement to 26.8% of sales this year, which is down nearly 100 basis points from 27.7% last year. So tremendous progress and primarily due to the favorable impact of our cost savings generated in 2020 as well as ongoing cost control measures and also improved leverage on our stronger sales growth. Our progress in these areas was slightly offset by rising costs in freight expenses, which we're closely managing; and planned increases in our technology spend, which supports our strategic initiatives, as Will covered earlier.  Our total operating and nonoperating expenses were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, up 2.2% from last year or up 2.1% compared to last year's adjusted expenses. First quarter expenses include the benefit of approximately $20 million related to gains on the sale of real estate and favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments that are reported to the other nonoperating income line. All in, our total expenses for the quarter improved to 28.1% of sales, down 190 basis points from 30.0% in 2020.  Total segment profit in the first quarter was $361 million, up a strong 41% on the 9% sales increase, and our segment profit margin was 8.1% compared to 6.3% last year, a 180 basis point increase. In comparison to 2019, our segment profit margin has improved by 100 basis points. So solid improvement and our strongest first quarter profit margin since 2015, a reflection of the positive momentum we're building in our businesses.  Our net interest expense of $18 million was down from $20 million in 2020 due to the decrease in total debt and more favorable interest rates relative to last year. The corporate expense line was $31 million in the quarter, down from $55 million in 2020, due primarily to the favorable real estate gains and retirement plan adjustment discussed earlier. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8%, in line with the reported rate last year and improved from the prior year adjusted rate of 26.5%. This improvement primarily relates to the favorable tax impact of stock options exercise as well as the previously mentioned real estate gains and retirement plan adjustments.  Our first quarter net income from continuing operations was $218 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.50. This compares to $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year or an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.80 for an 88% increase.  So now let's turn to our first quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the first quarter was $3 billion, up 14% from the prior year. Segment profit of $236 million was up a strong 65% with profit margin at 8.0% compared to 5.5% margin in the first quarter last year. The 250 basis point increase in margin was driven by the continued recovery in the automotive business and the execution of our growth and operating initiatives. We were pleased to have each of our automotive businesses expand their margins for the third consecutive quarter. In addition, we're encouraged that our first quarter margin also compares favorably to the first quarter of 2019, up 120 basis points. So a broad recovery across our operations, and we look for continued progress in the quarters ahead. Our industrial sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, flat with last year, and improved sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, which is consistent with the strengthening industrial economy. Our segment profit of $125 million was up 10% from a year ago, and profit margin was up 80 basis points to 8.3% compared to 7.5% last year. The improved margin for industrial reflects the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses, and is also up by 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2019. So another quarter of strong operating results for industrial, which we expect to continue with stronger sales growth projected through the remainder of the year.  So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. We continue to operate with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity and the financial strength to support our growth strategy. At March 31, total accounts receivable is down 27% from last year, which is primarily a function of the $800 million in receivables sold in 2020. Our inventory was up 6% from the prior year, and accounts payable increased 14%. And our AP to inventory ratio improved to 124% from 116% in the last year. We are pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position, and we continue to believe we have opportunities for further improvement. Our total debt is $2.6 billion at March 31, down $1 billion or 28% from last March and down $60 million from December 31, 2020. We significantly improved our debt position throughout the course of 2020 with the issuance of new public debt and a new revolving credit agreement that provides for expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates. With these positive changes to our debt structure, our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.8x from 2.5x last year. Additionally, we closed the first quarter with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, which is up from $1.1 billion at March 31 last year and in line with December 31.  We also continue to generate strong cash flow, generating $300 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, which is up from $28 million in the first quarter last year. With a strong start to the year, including the increase in net income and the improvement in working capital, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range, and free cash flow of $700 million to $900 million.  Our key priorities for cash include the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, the dividend and share repurchases. We invested $48 million in capital expenditures in the first quarter, an increase from $39 million in 2020. Looking forward, we have plans for additional investments in our businesses to drive growth and improve efficiencies and productivity. We continue to expect total capital expenditures of approximately $300 million for the year. As you heard from Will earlier, strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. We continue to cultivate a strong pipeline of targeted names, and we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement both our global automotive and industrial segments in the months and quarters ahead.  In the first quarter, we paid a cash dividend of $114 million to our shareholders. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928, and our 2021 dividend of $3.26 per share represents our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. We have actively participated in a share repurchase program since 1994. While there were no repurchases in the first quarter, the company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million additional shares, and we will resume share repurchases in the months and quarters ahead.  Turning to our outlook for 2021. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 17, 2021. In arriving at our updated guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends, the potential for foreign currency fluctuations, inflation and the global economic outlook. In addition, we consider the continued uncertainties due to market disruptions such as with COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus-5% to plus-7%, an increase from our previous guidance of plus-4% to plus-6%. As usual, these growth rates exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus-5% to plus-7% total sales growth for the automotive segment an increase from plus-4% to plus-6%; and a total sales increase of plus-4% to plus-6% for the industrial segment, an increase from plus-3% to plus-5%.  On the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $5.85 to $6.05, which is up 11% to 15% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $5.55 to $5.75. We enter the second quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results and we look forward to reporting on our financial performance as we go through the year.  Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. Looking ahead, the GPC team is excited for the ongoing recovery in the global economy and the growth prospects we see for both auto and industrial. Our strong balance sheet provides us the financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities, and we remain focused on executing our plans to capture profitable growth. Generate strong cash flow and drive shareholder value. As a result, we are optimistic that we can deliver strong financial results in the quarters ahead.  So in closing, we want to thank each of our GPC teammates for their continued support, dedication and commitment to being the best.  So thank you for your interest in Genuine Parts Company. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Can you talk about, well, I guess on a comp basis, I think you have 1 less day. So the reported comps, does that reflect -- are you including that as a headwind? And how would you size it up for each segment? And then just as a follow-up, you talked about record selling performance in Motion in March, I think it was plus 7 on a per day basis. Was there something unique about that performance? And what do that sort of March comp look like on a 2-year basis? Carol Yancey : Yes, Chris. On -- you're right. We did have 1 less day in the quarter, and we did not reflect that in our comp sales numbers that are provided. So it would be about 1.5 points for each of our segments equally. The good thing is the rest of the year, we really won't have that. We will close the full year with the 1 less day. But we have not shown that or adjusted for it, if you will, in any of our comp numbers. Paul Donahue : And Chris, relative to your question regarding Motion, and thanks for your question on Motion. We always like to talk about our industrial business. We had a breakout month in March. We've been waiting for it, honestly. If you look at all the indicators from PMI to industrial production, they've all been going up into the right. So we knew it was just really a matter of time. Motion got -- they got sidelined a little bit in February with the storm. It's knocked out a lot of our business down in the south, but they came roaring back in March. And honestly, this trend, and we've seen it before with Motion, when they get on a positive trend as they are now, our expectation, that's going to carry through the balance of the year. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then, Carol, on the gross margin, 34.5% in the first quarter and up on a two year basis, some of that is divestiture and so forth. But can you talk about the puts and takes going forward? Do you think gross margin could still see some modest expansion over time given the initiatives that you laid out? Or does DIY versus commercial mix and inflation, keep that more in check? Carol Yancey : Yes. Chris, I would tell you, we fully anniversaried all the impact of divestitures and discontinued. So that is true core gross margin impact. And we are actually modeling and have been -- given what we did at our February call, continue to model improvement in gross margin for the full year 2021.  It is a function of our initiatives. I mean, you heard Will and myself talk about the number of initiatives. So we have had some great progress in strategic pricing tools and analytics. Our category management, global sourcing. We've had some product mix shifts as well. Our industrial team has done a tremendous job of just quarter-after-quarter increases. Our global sourcing teams, global tenders are really working out well. And we had really kind of a neutral impact on rebates for the quarter. So our full year, we do believe that gross margin will continue to improve and will be up for the full year. Christopher Horvers : Okay. Then one last quick one. Looking at the balance sheet, I mean, that's -- you haven't -- I don't -- I'd have to look back, but I don't know if you've ever had that much cash sitting on the balance sheet. So typically, you target $50 million to $100 million kind of bolt-ons. Are you thinking something bigger there? Or how are you thinking about the potential to be more aggressive around share repurchase? Carol Yancey : Yes. Chris, great question. And I think you're spot on, none of us recall having that much cash on the balance sheet. But as was prudent in 2020, we did look at conserving our cash and sort of prudently got ourselves in a great position. We do expect to return to more normal capital allocation. It is a little bit of a timing thing right now. So you will see our M&A pipelines, as Will talked about. You will see the bolt-on type acquisitions that will come in. You're going to see our CapEx getting up to the $300 million.  And share buyback, again, we were somewhat precluded from buying in our shares with some of our debt agreements and where we had found ourselves. We expect to be in there buying, honestly, right away. We will do our normal share repurchase. And if we have the opportunity to do more, we'll certainly do that. So more normal capital allocation, and you'll see us putting that cash to use as we move ahead. Operator : And our next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Gregory Melich : I had two questions. I wanted to start with the cost reductions. I heard a 500 basis point improvement in labor productivity. And just wanted to sort of understand that and sort of what part could be sustainable if we think about what the sustainable operating margin of the business could be? William Stengel : Yes. It's a great question. Thanks for asking it. That was a great case study in using technology inside the four walls of a distribution center. As we think about getting more productive with the number of people we have doing the work relative to technology. So think vertical lift modules, et cetera. And that's completely sustainable. That technology and that investment is in the building, and it will continue to improve as we move forward. Carol Yancey : And Greg, I would just add a comment on the operating margin improvement. I mean, again, our operating margin outlook in long-term is sort of the 8.5% to 9% operating margin. We're implying about 30 basis point improvement this year in our 2021 results, and that is coming from a combination of gross margin and SG&A. And honestly, that's probably a 50 to 70 basis point improvement over 2019 as well. Gregory Melich : Right. That's a structural part, effectively, it sounds like. That's great. And to pivot a bit on inflation, I think you mentioned it really wasn't material in the first quarter, but obviously, there's a lot of rise in input costs out there. So I'd just like to know what inflation are you seeing in the COGS or in your guidance are you assuming? And what would you expect that also, what inflation numbers in the top line? Carol Yancey : Yes. You're right, we had pretty modest inflation for Q1 and really no impact on our sales or gross margin. As we look ahead, we do think that's going to come and probably more second half-weighted. We're looking at a 1% to 3% on the automotive side and a 1% to 2% on the industrial side. But quite honestly, with our initiatives, we believe we'll be able to continue to deliver on our improvement in gross margin and be able to pass that through. But we have not modeled that, if you will, into our guidance on sales. Quite honestly, if it hasn't hit us yet, we'll look forward to that being a tailwind as we move ahead. Gregory Melich : Got it. So that's what you think, but it's not in the guidance that by the back half, it would be presumably at the upper end of those ranges you just gave? Carol Yancey : That's correct. And you know our back half, we have sort of more normalized growth in the back half. And it's also not modeled into the cost side as well. So we'll update you as we move ahead on what we're seeing on the quarterly inflation, but we do expect it's coming. William Stengel : Greg, it's Will. I might just add on the cost side. I mean, I alluded to it in the prepared remarks. But like everybody else, we're watching and seeing SG&A inflation in different parts of the world and in different parts of the business, ranging from wage inflation in selective geographies. You've got global logistics inflation. You've got commodity inflation. So we're watching that and doing good work around being cost productive to offset some of that inflation, but that's definitely something that we're working on actively every day. Operator : Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Katharine McShane : I wondered if I could just ask about some of the contributors to comp. I know there was improvement in the fleet business. However, it was a drag. If you were able to quantify that.  And you didn't call out regional performance in the South East. And I just thought that would have been a place maybe where you would see more strength, given that it seems more open than the rest of the country at this point. So just wanted to get your comments on that. Paul Donahue : Yes. Kate, thanks for your question. In terms of the breakdown, fleet did come back in Q1, which I think we referenced that in our last call, we did see an improvement. Our expectation is that fleet will turn positive in Q2 and remain positive through the balance of the year. As you break down the various segments, our retail business was off-the-charts strong. What we were really encouraged by is seeing our both major accounts and NAPA AutoCare center business turn positive, both close to mid single-digit growth in those categories. So yes, we really saw improvements across the board and are especially encouraged to see our heavy-duty fleet business government municipalities turning to a positive in Q2. And as far as regionality, Kate, I think I called out our northern regions. I would also call out -- in that mix, it includes our Atlantic division. Our Atlantic division really led the way in Q1 for us. And Atlantic comes down to the Carolinas, Virginia. So that is close to the south. Our southeast performed just fine, but just was not as strong as what we saw in our northern regions as well as our western region. Katharine McShane : Okay. And I was wondering from a, just a follow-up question, you had mentioned that you were successful at signing up more commercial accounts, thanks to your new sales effort. Is there a way to quantify that or compare it to what you've seen in the last couple of quarters? Paul Donahue : Well, if you look at our -- what we term other wholesale, Kate, that's -- some describe it as the up and down the street, smaller garages 1, 2 bays. That business was up 7% in the quarter. And again, we have not seen that kind of growth in some time. We know -- we made significant changes and enhancements to our sales force coming out of 2020. We literally have doubled the touch point. And we're getting out and we're seeing those customers, and it's reflected in our business. So we're bullish going forward and really pleased to see the DIFM category bounce back, as we expected it would in '21. Operator : And our next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Scot Ciccarelli. I guess as a follow-up on Kate's question, would you, or maybe more importantly, your customers, attribute improved commercial business that you guys are seeing or saw in the quarter to better consumer mobility? Or given your regional commentary, because it seemed like it was more affected by weather patterns and like the harsh winter, et cetera, that we had? Paul Donahue : Yes. I think it's all of the above, Scot. It -- as you know, in these calls, we tend to talk a good bit about weather, and we did see a more normalized winter this year. Certainly, that has an impact on our business. The bounce back in miles driven, while still not anywhere near the levels it was 2 years ago, it is coming back from where we were last year. And then I think the efforts that our NAPA team is making that Will touched on, with the many changes we made in our sales force and how we're going to market. So I really think it's a combination of our sales strategy. Our inventory availability at the street-level has improved. So it's really -- it's not one thing that I would point to. It's really a combination of really positive factors hitting at once. And what I think I'm most encouraged by, Scot, is we had this kind of quarter despite still being in COVID-related lockdowns in many parts of the world. Canada right now, Scot, is, as you would know, is in full lockdown. And yet our business still trended positive in the quarter. Our service levels and our supply from our suppliers is not where it would traditionally be. So look, we're quite proud of the quarter we had, but I would tell you, I think there's even upside when a few of these more headwinds we put behind us. Scot Ciccarelli : Yes. That's super helpful. And then I know we kind of dug into gross margin, s G&A. I guess my question is, it maybe a little bit more broad here. You guys have had a combination of both permanent and temporary cost reductions. Are there some cost reductions that kind of need to be layered back in? Like you cut back for a period of time. Now that the business is recovering, we got to layer some certain expenses back into the P&L. Carol Yancey : Yes. We had -- and it's a great question. As volume comes back, I mean, there is a level of variable expenses that do come back in. But we did permanently lower our cost structure with the 2019 plan that we put in place. And those permanent cost savings, again, we capitalize on those and converted some of the temporary to permanent. So we had about a $20 million benefit in the quarter that was a carryover from those savings. Team's done a tremendous job on payroll. But again, contemplated in our outlook, and I think -- when we came out in February, we had sort of flattish SG&A. And now with the improvement we've seen in Q1, we've contemplated in our operating margin that SG&A does remain and is improved as we go throughout the year. William Stengel : Scot, it's Will. I might just add another kind of philosophical point, which is as we do productivity, SG&A productivity work, I mean, our intent is to reinvest some portion of that into growth initiatives and talent, as an example. So we're not solely focused on driving productivity without reinvesting in the business philosophically. Operator : And our next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : When you talked about the strength in digital, are you seeing a change in consumer behavior where they're buying online and waiting for shipment? Or is this buying digitally and still expecting either a delivery or a pickup in store? William Stengel : I think it's both. I think the -- coming out of COVID, I would say, there has been a dramatic change in the use of digital in every dimension. Meaning frequency, the way in which you use it, and that whole concept of being easy to do business with. And that means different things to different customers. But the foundation of it is having the digital skills to meet those needs as they differ across the customer segment. So I would say it's a mix of everything, and we've done really good work around setting up the foundation of meeting those different needs, and we're going to continue to invest in it. Bret Jordan : Could you maybe talk about like what percentage of digital is actually still going out the door versus in a box being shipped? William Stengel : I'm not sure I have that number in front of me. Let me circle back with you. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a question on supply issues, and With both Motion and auto I think there have been some -- whether it's batteries or filters, in the first quarter. Are you seeing any stock and availability issues impacting? Or is that pretty much behind us? Paul Donahue : No, it's not. I wish it were behind us, Bret. I know you and I talked last quarter and we specifically called out batteries. While that's gotten better, and we had a great quarter in our battery business, there's still some pockets where we're struggling. Filters, you mentioned, could be a whole lot better in terms of our in-stock levels. But we're seeing it in other product categories as well. So that's what I mentioned earlier. I know our -- look, I know the challenges some of our suppliers are up against with raw materials, with the global supply chain, labor issues. When that comes back up to more normal levels, that's just going to be increased upside for our business. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then 1 just housekeeping issue. I guess you talked about off the charts retail. What was the percentage of retail versus commercial, I guess, in U.S. NAPA this quarter? Paul Donahue : In terms of -- well, in terms of our percentage increase, Bret. Our retail business was up greater than 20% in the... Bret Jordan : Just as a percentage of the sales, sort of how the pie gets carved up? Paul Donahue : Percent of total, it's still 20-plus percent. It's -- look, we're still going to live and die on the DIFM side, Bret, but it is great to see that retail DIY business continuing to accelerate. And look, we -- as you know, we put a hell of a lot of effort into improving our stores, improving our layouts in our stores, our store hours, our folks in the stores. So we've put a lot of effort behind it, and we've talked a lot about it on these calls through the years. So it's really great to see that segment continuing to perform really well. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush. Paul Donahue : Maybe we can come back to Seth at the end here. We can keep moving. Seth Basham : Can you hear me? Paul Donahue : We got you now. Seth Basham : Paul, my question is around market share. I don't know if you can quantify how you think that your core NAPA business ex fleet is doing in the U.S. this quarter relative to recent quarters? Paul Donahue : Well, look, it remains to be seen, right? So we're the first one out this quarter. We're pleased with our performance and certainly pleased as it stacks up against 2020. We've been waiting for our commercial business to bounce back and really pleased to see that happen in the quarter. So I do believe that was a solid performance. The retail business, I already touched on with Bret, that was solid. What we're pleased to see what we're pleased to see, Seth, is that the fleet business and what we referenced as our IBS business really beginning to bounce back. So I think we're doing quite well, and I'm really proud of the NAPA team for the quarter they put up. Seth Basham : Got you. And I presume that you saw a balance in sales around some of the stimulus check distribution in January, and probably even more so in March for your DIY business. But was there a pronounced bounce around those stimulus check distributions for your do-it-for-me business as well, particularly as you look at the sales trends versus 2019? Carol Yancey : Yes. I guess one comment I would say is the trends, and Paul alluded to it, January started off really strong, February was a little softer. March was our strongest month in the quarter, and it was pretty even between the commercial and the DIY. So I think you laid it out as it happened. Operator : And our next question is from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli Asset Management. Brian Sponheimer : I'll be really quick. I just want to say hello, but also the investment for next-generation vehicles, be it electric or otherwise, would this also include potentially investing in ways to help with charging stations and support for the fleet as well? William Stengel : It does. Yes. I think we're doing a lot of work around all of our choices on this topic. And I think it's important to note, though, just to reemphasize that we are intensely focused on the part that we serve today, the ice engine, is going to be the main focus for us as we move forward. We just think it's prudent to be doing work and understanding the facts and developing strategies as the business evolves. So we're open and looking at everything and refining the strategy as we move forward. Paul Donahue : And Brian, I would just add. And first off, good to hear from you again. welcome back. We -- with our presence in Europe, it's -- and the European Union having doubled down on EVs, as Will rightfully pointed out, we're still, majority of the time, focused on our business at hand today with the internal combustion engine. But we do have an eye towards the future. And our European team will be leading -- certainly leading that effort because we believe we'll see it, the shift, the tipping point, if you will, in Europe, most likely before we see it here in the U.S. Operator : Our next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc. Daniel Imbro : Carol, I wanted to start on a follow-up on the guidance. I think you raised full year by about 100 bps. I want to say -- please correct me if I'm wrong. I think the last guidance didn't include any FX tailwinds, which were obviously a nice tailwind to 1Q. So can you maybe just parse out how much of the guidance raise is FX? And then maybe digging into it, have you made any changes to your underlying organic growth guidance for each segment based on the first quarter results? Carol Yancey : Okay. Yes, great question. So really talking about our guidance. So the stronger sales and earnings for the full year really reflects our accelerated recovery in the first quarter. So we did consider the favorable FX. We considered some of the other unusual items in the quarter. But we did not, if you will, assume what occurred in Q1 would be baked into those full year numbers for the rest of the year. So we have really taken sort of a more conservative, cautious approach, if you will, on the currency and not model that in. So again, that is contemplated. And then you asked about the same-store sales guidance. So if you look at raising at 100 bps for -- in total and for each segment, we did the same thing on the comp store sales. So plus 4% to plus 6% on automotive and plus 3% to plus 5% on industrial for the same-store sales. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe following up on industrial, Paul, I know you love to talk about it. I think you said last quarter, January was up 1%. I think you guys just said March was up 7%. To get the full quarter down to -- I mean, February was down meaningfully. Is that all just weather driven? Or was there anything else that happened in February as we look at the first quarter industrial results? Paul Donahue : Yes. There's not much else for us to point to, Daniel. When -- again, when you look at January, we got out of the gates pretty good, low single-digit increase. And as we mentioned, March was a record month for the Motion team.  February, we were hit hard. We had over 100 branches that were shut down. And I think maybe a better way to look at it is if you were to combine Feb and March together, and that's probably a true picture of the first quarter. But as I mentioned earlier, we've been through this cycle many times with Motion. And when that business turns, the CapEx projects start to move, plants start to reopen, that business really, really takes off. And I will tell you, we're off to a good -- a very good start in April. And our expectation is it's going to continue through the balance of the year. Operator : And our last question will be from David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. David Bellinger : Just to follow-up on that. Yes, just to follow-up on my last question on the industrial side. It seems as though that segment has started to turn the corner in March. Can you talk about the line of sight you have into customer demand over the next several quarters? And are these potential supply constraints allowing for that growth expectation to extend out even into 2022 at this point? Paul Donahue : Well, our line of sight, as you know, many of these CapEx projects, there's long lead times with many of these projects. But they are rolling in. We -- I was actually out in the field with our industrial team a couple of weeks ago, first time we've really been out visiting customers. And the universal feedback we get as we visit customers is factories are, right now, they're humming. And if that's happening and they're moving back into full production, that's generally all very, very positive for the Motion business. So our expectation as we look forward with Motion is that we're going to have a solid year. And it's going to continue and should continue on really into 2022. And that's further verified, David, when we look at the PMI numbers and the industrial production numbers all just further support the kind of growth numbers that we believe we'll continue to produce in '21. David Bellinger : That's very encouraging. And then just on the Auto Parts business, in your prepared remarks, improved inventory availability is noted again this quarter. So can you give us more detail behind that and any ongoing initiatives there? Is there some way to quantify the improvement, either in terms of parts availability or the subsequent lift to sales that you're seeing? William Stengel : Yes. It's a great question, and it obviously continues to be a priority focus for us, making sure, as I said in prepared remarks, that we've got the right product in the right market at the right time. So it's absolutely an ongoing initiative.  We are watching and studying improvements in the global supply chain. We are encouraged that it's getting better. And so we are really watching that to improve as we think about, by category, all of the efforts to make sure that we got the right product. So it's getting better, but we're going to have to stay focused on it. Paul Donahue : I would also add on to that, David, that we haven't really talked much about our business in Europe here this morning, but our European team had a great quarter, up 15%. And we're making great strides, great inroads across Europe. But I would tell you that I believe one of our -- one of the real pluses for us this quarter was we had product, and we had plenty of inventory, and we had it, as Will said, at the right place at the right time, which I think enabled us to potentially grow outside of what the overall market grew in Europe in Q1. So really pleased with the progress we continue to make in that part of the world. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey : Thank you. We'd like to thank all of you for your participation in the Q1 earnings call today. We look forward to reporting out to you on our Q2 results, and we appreciate your interest and support of Genuine Parts company. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a great day.",

Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today. We are pleased to report terrific financial performance driven by the consistent execution of our strategic priorities and the ongoing recovery in the global market. In summary, the quarter was highlighted by continued strong sales trends, which we believe led to market share gains, gross margin gains and improved operational efficiencies that drove margin expansion and record quarterly earnings and the effective deployment of capital for growth and productivity investments, bolt-on acquisitions, the dividend and share repurchases. Taking a look at our second quarter financial results, total sales were $4.8 billion, up 25% from last year and improved sequentially from plus 9% in the first quarter. For your additional perspective, our second quarter sales were 12% higher than in Q2 2019. Gross margin was also strong representing our 15th consecutive quarterly increase, and we further improved our productivity with the ongoing execution of expense initiatives. As a result, segment profit increased 35% and our segment margin improved 65 basis points to 9.2%, which represents our strongest margin in two decades. Adjusted net income was $253 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.74, up 32%. Total sales for global automotive were a record $3.2 billion, a 28% increase from 2020 and up 15% from the second quarter of 2019 and marks the first quarter in our 93 year history with auto sales exceeding the $3 billion mark. On a comp basis sales were up 21% and on a two year stack comp sales were up 8.5%. Our comp sales in the second quarter were driven by double-digit year-over-year comp sales in each of our automotive operations. Automotive segment profit margin improved 9.1%, up 30 basis points from 2020 and an increase of 90 basis points from 2019. This expansion was supported by strong operating results across all of our operations. The automotive recovery reflects our focus on key growth initiatives as well as several market tailwinds and these include the broad economic recovery and strengthening consumer demand, favorable weather trends, inflation and our ability to pass along price increases to our customers. Finally, solid industry fundamentals, which have been further accelerated by a surge in used car market and improving miles driven. While these market tailwinds are encouraging, we also see continued headwinds, which we continue to closely monitor. These would include the spread of the deltacoronavirus variant and its potential impact on the global economy, global supply chain disruptions, ongoing labor shortages in our operations and the impact of inflation on our costs such as wages and freight. Turning next to our regional highlights, our GPC teammates in Europe built down there excellent start to the year, achieving the strongest sales growth amongst our operations with comp sales up 34%. Each country posted substantial sales growth, while our UK team continues to outperform. The positive momentum in Europe reflects improving market conditions and favorable weather trends as well as our focus on key sales initiatives, inventory availability, and excellent customer service. In particular, we have seen exceptional results from our key account partners and the ongoing expansion and rollout of the NAPA brand. In our Asia Pac business sales were in line with the mid to high teen comps we have had in this market now for four consecutive quarters. Commercial sales outperformed retail, although both customer segments posted strong growth. The Repco and NAPA brands performed well and collectively are capturing market share. The NAPA network continues to build, and we have now more than 50 NAPA locations operating across Australia and New Zealand in addition to our 400 plus Repco stores. In North America, comp sales increased 20% in the U.S. and we're up 12% in Canada where lockdowns in key markets such as Quebec and Ontario have been headwinds for several quarters now. Sales in the U.S. were driven by strong growth in both the commercial and retail segment with DIFM sales outperforming DIY for the first time, since before the pandemic began to take hold in Q1 of 2020. The strengthening commercial sales environment is significant for us as it accounts for 80% of our total U.S. automotive revenue. The strong recovery in the commercial sector contributed to record average daily sales volume and our U.S. automotive business in June. Our sales drivers by product category include brakes, tools and equipment and under car, which all outperformed. In addition, both retail and commercial ticket and traffic counts were strong for the second consecutive quarter, so another really positive trend. By customer segment, retail sales remained strong throughout the quarter with low double-digit sales growth on top of a healthy sales increase in the second quarter of last year. While the DIY market is pulling back from the highs of 2020, we are optimistic our ongoing investments will create sustainable retail growth. For commercial sales, each of our customers segments posted double-digit growth, which we attribute to the broad automotive recovery and investments in our sales team, our sales programs and our supply chain amongst other initiatives. This quarter, our strongest growth was with our major account partners and NAPA AutoCare centers. We were also pleased with the growth in sales to our fleet and government accounts. This was the first quarter of positive year-over-year sales growth for this group, since before the pandemic as a lag the overall automotive recovery in the U.S. We view this improvement as a meaningful indicator for further growth in the quarters ahead. As the automotive recovery continues, we expect our commercial sales opportunities to outpace retail consistent with the long-term growth outlook for the aftermarket industry. We are confident in our growth strategy and our initiatives to deliver customer value and sell more parts for more cars across our global automotive operations. We also remain focused on enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening in our supply chain and investing in our omni-channel capabilities while expanding our global store footprint to further strengthen our competitive positioning. So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.6 billion, a 20% increase from last year, and up 7% from 2019. Comp sales rose 16% and reflect the fourth consecutive quarter of improving sales trend. A strong sales environment combined with the execution of our operational initiatives drove a 9.5% segment margin, which is up 130 basis points from both 2020 and 2019. The ongoing market recovery over the last 12 months is in line with the strengthening industrial economy and the overall increase in activity we have seen across much of our customer base. The Purchasing Managers Index measured 60.6 in June, reflecting healthy levels of industrial expansion and marrying trends we have seen throughout the majority of this year. Likewise, industrial production increased by 5.5% in the second quarter representing the fourth consecutive quarter of expansion. Diving deeper into our Q2 sales, we experienced strong sales trends across each of our industries served and our product categories other than safety supplies, which add extraordinary sales in 2020 due to the pandemic. Several industry sectors stood out as their sales increased by 30% or more over the last year, including equipment and machinery, automotive, aggregate and cement, equipment rental and oil and gas. In addition, our newly added fulfillment and logistics industry sector experienced tremendous growth. In the past several years of expanding this segment, we have found our broad offering of products and services fits well with the needs of these customers. To drive this growth, we remain focused on several strategic initiatives, which include the build out of our industrial omnichannel capabilities with solid growth and digital sales via motion.com. Our new inside sales center, which was established in 2019, is generating incremental sales from new Motion customers and we see room for further growth. The expansion of our services and value-add solutions businesses in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. Over the last few years, we have made several bolt-on acquisitions to build scale and continue to target additional M&A opportunities to further enhance our capabilities in these key areas, enhanced pricing and product category management strategies to maximize profitable growth, the further optimization and automation of our supply chain network to improve operational productivity, while delivering exceptional customer service. We are encouraged by industrial strong financial performance in the second quarter and the positive momentum we see in the overall industrial markets. We believe the Motion team is well positioned to capitalize on this momentum and enhance our market leadership position. So in summary, each of our businesses did an exceptional job of operating through the quarter and we couldn't be more proud and grateful for their strong Q2 performance. So, now, I'll turn the call over to Will. Will? Will Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning everyone. First, let me reiterate Paul's comments to acknowledge the strong performance this quarter. I'd like to personally congratulate the entire global GPC team for the hard work and impressive results. The teams continue to build momentum and execute well. We remain focused on our defined strategic initiatives and despite the global uncertainties that continue to impact our operations. We're pleased with the strong sales growth, operating leverage and cash flow performance this quarter. Last quarter, we outlined our plans to create value as we leveraged GPC global capabilities to simplify and integrate our operations. We do so to improve the customer experience, to increase the speed and efficiency of execution and to deliver winning performance. This includes continuous investments to position GPC for near and long-term profitable growth. The key pillars of our investments include talent, sales effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Around the globe, the teams executed well against our strategic priorities. For example, on talent, we announced last month that Naveen Krishna joined the company as Chief Information and Digital Officer. Naveen will help lead our strategy and execution for all technology and digital initiatives. He comes to GPC with more than 25 years of technology experience with companies such as Macy's, Home Depot, Target and FedEx. We're excited to welcome Naveen as we continue to innovate on the customer experience, accelerate the pace of technology execution and build capabilities that advance our long-term strategy. Other examples of recent talent investments include category management, field sales and services, indirect sourcing, pricing, diversity-equity inclusion, digital data and inventory leadership to name a few. Investment in our people is always a priority as we execute our mission to be an employer of choice. To highlight other examples of our initiative momentum and local execution, Paul and I recently had the opportunity to spend time in person with our European teammates and they showcase great examples of the strategic initiatives and winning team performance. For example, we discuss details of the growth plans for a recent bolt-on investment Winparts an online leader of automotive parts and accessories. We expect this investment to provide new capabilities and accelerate our European digital vision. We visited a best-in-class distribution facility in the Netherlands that increased operating productivity by approximately 20% over the past few years with automation investments and process excellence initiative. We received an update on the consolidation of 10 back office shared service centers in France to one national location in France to drive costs and process efficiencies. And we saw firsthand the power and differentiation of the NAPA brand in the local market. Although these are only a few select examples in Europe, in each of our automotive and industrial businesses we see similar examples of focused strategic execution that are delivering results. We also executed well on our acquisition strategy during the quarter. The M&A environment is active and we remain disciplined to pursue strategic and value creating transactions. For example, in addition to Winparts, we completed several other bolt-on acquisitions to deliver growth, add capabilities and create value. The North American and European automotive teams completed various store acquisitions that increase our position in key strategic geographies and extend existing customer relationships. Our automotive team in Asia-Pac also executed to bolt-on strategic acquisitions, including rare spares, a market leader in the niche segment of automotive restoration parts and accessories and PARts DB, a leading cloud-based product and supplier data platform that will enhance our e-commerce and data capabilities. We enter the third quarter with strong momentum as our automotive and industrial markets recover and we execute our plans. We continue to analyze and respond to areas that challenge our daily operations such as COVID-19, inflation, global logistics and product and labor availability. For example, the global and local procurement teams partner closely with all levels of our suppliers to effectively assess product availability and delivery trends. We have processes in place backed with data and analytics to create visibility into direct and indirect inflation trends. We utilize GPC scale and relationships, including dedicated GPC resources in Asia to address our global logistics needs. And we continue to address labor challenges with competitive pay and benefits, flexible work programs, creative incentives to attract talent, a differentiated culture and compelling career opportunities. We believe our team's well-positioned to remain agile as we focus on what we can control and navigate these macro global headwinds. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance through the first half of the year, and look forward to sharing our continued progress next quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Carol to review the financial details. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Will. Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the second quarter, up 25%. Our gross margin improved to 35.3%, an increased from 33.8% last year or up 120 basis points from an adjusted gross margin of 34.1%. Our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives. Although we also continue to benefit from channel and geographical mix shifts, positive product mix, strategic category management initiatives including pricing and global sourcing strategies. In the second quarter, there was significant pricing activity with our suppliers resulting in product cost inflation. We were positioned to pass these increases onto our customers and the impact of price inflation was neutral to gross margin. We estimated 1.5% impact of inflation in automotive sales for the quarter and a 1% impact in industrial. Based on the current environment, we expect this to increase further through the second half of the year. Our total adjusted operating and non-operating expenses were $1.3 billion in the second quarter, up 28% from last year and 28.1% of sales. The increase from last year reflects the impact of several factors, including the prior year benefit of approximately $150 million in temporary savings related to the pandemic. The balance primarily relates to the increase in variable costs on the $1 billion and additional year-over-year sales. And to a lesser extent, we experienced rising cost pressures in areas such as wages, incentive compensation, freight, rents and health insurance, which we are managing. We also invested in projects associated with our transformation and other initiatives to drive growth and enhanced productivity. So overall, we continue to operate in line with our plans for the year, and we remain focused on gaining additional efficiency in the quarters ahead as you heard from Paul and Will. On a segment basis, our total segment profit in the second quarter was $441 million, up a strong 35%. Our segment profit margin was 9.2% compared to 8.6% last year, a 65 basis point year-over-year improvement and up 100 basis points from 2019. So strong operating results and a reflection of the work we have done to streamline our operations and optimize our portfolio over the last several years. We would add that for the full year we continue to expect our segment profit margin to improve by 20 basis points to 30 basis points from today 2020 or 60 basis points to 70 basis points from 2019. This would represent our strongest margin in five years. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 27.2% on an adjusted basis, up from 24.1% last year. The increase in rate primarily reflects a higher UK tax rate, partially offset by stock compensation excess tax benefits. Second quarter net income from continuing operations was $196 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.36. Our adjusted net income was $253 million or $1.74 per share, which compares to $191 million or $1.32 per share in the prior year, a 32% increase. Turning to our second quarter results by segment; our automotive revenue was $3.2 billion, up 28% from last year. Segment profit was $291 million, up 33% with profit margin improved to 9.1%, up 30 basis points from 2020 and a 90 basis point increase from 2019. We attribute the margin gain to the positive market conditions in our automotive business, and our team's intense focus on the execution of our growth and operating initiatives. We're encouraged by the positive momentum we will carry into the balance of the year. Our industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 20% from 2020. Segment profit of $150 million was up 38% from a year ago and profit margin improved to a strong 9.5%, a 130 basis point increase from both 2020 and 2019. So with this strengthening sales environment and continued operational improvement, this group continues to post excellent operating results, and we expect industrial perform well through the balance of the year. Now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. At June 30th our total accounts receivable is up 4%. Despite the strong sales increase, this is primarily due to the additional sale of $300 million in receivables in the second half 2020. Inventory was up 10% consistent with our commitment to provide for inventory availability and our accounts payable increased 26%. Our AP to inventory ratio improved to 129% from 112% last year. We remain pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position. Our total debt is $2.5 billion, down $700 million or 22% from June of 2020, and down $160 million from December 31, 2020. We closed the second quarter with $2.5 billion in available liquidity, and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.6 times from 2.9 times last year. Our team has done an excellent job of improving our capital structure over the last year. We continue to generate strong cash flow with another $400 million in cash from operations in the second quarter and $700 million for the six-month. For the full year we expect our earnings growth and working capital to drive 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, the dividends and share repurchases. We have invested $90 million in capital expenditures thus far in the year, and we expect these investments to pick-up further in the quarters ahead as we execute on additional investments to drive organic growth and improve efficiencies and productivity in our operations. As Will mentioned earlier, strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. We've used approximately $97 million in cash for acquisitions through the six months. And we continue to cultivate a strong pipeline of targeted names and expect to make additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions to compliment both our global automotive and industrial segments as we move forward. Consistent with our longstanding dividend policy, we have also paid a total cash dividend of more than $232 million to our shareholders through the first half of this year. This reflects the 2021 annual dividend of $3.26 per share and represents our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. Finally, as part of our share repurchase program, we have been active with share buybacks since 1994. In the second quarter, we used $184 million to acquire 1.4 million shares. The company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 13 million additional shares, and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead. Turning to our outlook for 2021, we are updating our full-year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on April 22nd of 2021. In arriving at our updated guidance we considered several factors including our past performance and recent business trends, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, the potential for foreign exchange fluctuations, inflation and the global economic outlook. We also consider that consider uncertainties due to the market disruptions, such as with COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 10% to plus 12% and increase from our previous guidance of plus 5% to plus 7%. As usual this excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business we are guiding two plus 11 to plus 13% total sales growth for the automotive segment, an increase from the plus 5% to plus 7% and a total sales increase of plus 6% to plus 8% for the industrial segment, an increase for the plus four to plus 6%. On the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $6.20 to $6.35, which is up 18% to 20% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $5.85 to $6.05. We enter the third quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results, and we look forward to reporting on our financial performance as we go through the year. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. We are pleased with our progress in capturing profitable growth, generating strong cash flow and driving shareholder value. This quarter's 25% total sales growth reflects the benefits of a strengthening global economy and positive sales environment in both our automotive and industrial businesses. Importantly, this dual recovery allows us to leverage the full scale of one GPC, which we believe creates significant value. Our team also executed well and produced our 15th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, while further improving our productivity via ongoing expense initiatives. Our global team network and disciplined focus in these areas enabled us to report strong operating results and record quarterly earnings. Our exceptional balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities, the investments and organic and acquisitive growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividends and share repurchases. The GPC team is focused on executing our growth strategy and operational initiatives to further enhance our financial performance in the remainder of 2021 and beyond. We thank you for your interest in GPC, and also thank each of our GPC teammates for their continued dedication, passion and commitment to be in the best in serving all our company's stakeholders. So with that, let me turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Chris. Carol Yancey : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Horvers : So can you \u2013 it looks like, is it fair to say you're just assuming sort of the two year comp stacks hold in both divisions for the balance of the year and in related to the Motion side, Motion is not yet positive on a two year basis. What would \u2013 what's going to be the inhibitor that would not allow that to pause turn positive on a two year basis? Carol Yancey : Yes, I think, Chris you're spot on. I think Motion is not positive on a two year stack yet. We are really encouraged by the fundamentals as Paul mentioned and the lag that we see in that business. We're encouraged by the activities going on. We are implying a similar trend for them in the second half, so on a \u2013 second half, mid-single digit, on a comp basis for them, but that still is just flattish to slightly up on a two year stack basis. And I think on the automotive side, I mean, I think again you're spot on sort of the second half mid-single digit on the automotive comps that we would be a bit higher than that in the U.S. So again, on a two year stack basis more normal mid-single digit on a two year stack basis, so similar to where we are now, but a bit better certainly in U.S. automotive. Paul Donahue : Chris, I would add specifically to Motion. We and I think you've alluded to it in the past this recovery that we're seeing in both automotive and industrial. When you look at U.S. manufacturing, our customers are operating at higher run rates. They're accelerating CapEx, plants are returning to full production. If you look at the PMI numbers, you look at industrial production, all is very, very positive. So when you couple that with what we're seeing on capital projects really gaining steam, we're very, very bullish about our industrial business moving forward. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then as a follow-up, you talked about record average daily volumes. I think you were referring to U.S. NAPA in the month of June and you referred to momentum in the business. Maybe can you expand on that a little bit? And within that I think there is a lot of concerns out there on the DIY, DIY is not immaterial. It is 20% of the business. So could you perhaps talk about what you're seeing on the DIY side of the business in the U.S. as well? Paul Donahue : Yeah. First, let me just comment on the specific numbers, Chris. So, we wrapped up Q1 with a record sales month for us in March. That momentum carried into Q2. We had a really solid quarter with May, June being our strongest, June being the strongest month and a record month again. And then as we moved into July again pleased to say that that's holding up. So we're really, really encouraged by what we're seeing in U.S. automotive. And specifically to DIY, we're not seeing a pullback in our strong DIY business. We're up low double-digits in Q2 and our two year stack I think raises well over 20%. So our teams have \u2013 as you know, and we've talked about this in the past, we've worked incredibly hard to get our retail footprint in what we believe to be much better in a much better selling mode than we've ever been. So could it pull back a little bit with the lack of stimulus money in the economy, it could be. I think we'll see that perhaps in some of the more retail focused competitors, but now we feel good, we feel good about our DIFM business and our DIY business going forward. Christopher Horvers : Understood. Best of luck. Paul Donahue : Yes. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Jordan, your line is live. Sorry. Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on your commentary with regards to inflation that you had mentioned that you've seen about 150 bps of inflation in automotive and 100 in the industrials. How much of that is from just higher product costs versus transportation and labor? And how would you categorize this period of inflation versus 2019 with tariffs and the ability to manage it? Carol Yancey : Yes look, if we look at our inflation, I would tell you first of all it is a bit unique and unprecedented as it relates to U.S. automotive for inflation. We haven't seen this kind of activity for a decade, if you will. And it is \u2013 as you mentioned, it's sort of similar to tariffs and that the pace that they're coming. Look, it is driven by what you said a combination of raw materials and freight and labor. And our teams work very closely from a category management perspective to work with the suppliers to look at commodity tracking and the cost model and the supplier line reviews. And while we don't break out specifically, how much is each component, trust me, the teams work with the suppliers on that. On the industrial side, it's more normal. So I would tell you their inflation is definitely more normal. And so what we do think is that second half will be more active than Q2. So we could see as much as two times the second quarter inflation rate in our second half, but again, couldn't be happier with the teams and all of our businesses and the work they're doing to pass those through to our customers and be able to get greater gross profit dollars, but maintain our gross margin rate. So we're working hard on that, and we are definitely optimistic as we look ahead that we'll be able to do that again in the second half. Kate McShane : Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is just around the global supply chain. Could you remind us if you have any meaningful exposure to Vietnam since that seems to be an area of the world that's having trouble dealing with the Delta variant right now? Paul Donahue : Kate, we have no material exposure to Vietnam. Kate McShane : Thank you. Carol Yancey : And Kate, I would just add one other thing. We have our geographic diversification, if you will, is really great protection for us. So whether we have domestic suppliers we have European suppliers, we have Asian suppliers, we have the ability to have protection with a broad diversification amongst our geographies and supplier base. Kate McShane : Thank you. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll go back to the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hi, is it working this time? Carol Yancey : Yes, it is. Paul Donahue : Yes, we hear you, Bret. Bret Jordan : I have a lot of phone problems on this call today. But I guess a question, did you give us the U.S. NAPA comp against the 2019 second quarter, I might have missed that. Carol Yancey : Yes, the U.S. comp two year stack is mid-single digits. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then, I guess, question on the wage inflation that you're seeing, and I guess, a) the transitory, and b) what kind of cost increases are you seeing at the store level? Carol Yancey : Yes, Bret, I think, what we would talk about on the wage inflation again similar to on the inflation on the product side this is a big factor in what we're seeing. I mean, all companies are seeing rising costs and inflation, certainly in wages and freight and as we mentioned some other categories. We do think when we looked at our SG&A this quarter that our inflation in our SG&A was certainly greater than the product inflation, so more like a 2% in our cost. And that ended up being about 50 to 60 basis points on our SG&A. And we certainly didn't have that in Q1, so we did have that in Q2. But look we're working hard with investments and projects and again weather, Will mentioned it, whether it's transformation or strategic investments in productivity, but we do think this inflation in wages stays with us. We don't believe it's necessarily transitory for this year. We're going to continue to work hard on it, but we think it stays with us for a bit. Bret Jordan : Okay. Paul Donahue : Hi, Bret, I would also add that it's a very surgical approach by geography, by job type. So we've done a lot of really good thinking and analytics to make sure that we're hitting the areas of the business that are most impacted, but just want to share that perspective. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then a question on regional performance, I think you called out weather as one of the positives. Could you talk about sort of in the U.S. auto market, about the highlights and the low lights and maybe the spread in the comp between the peak and the valley? Paul Donahue : Yes, this quarter, Bret, was unprecedented with the strong double-digit growth we saw across all six of our divisions leading the pack for us as our guys up in the Northeast. But they were impacted the most last year. So it does stand to reason a bit, but really strong performance in the east, going down to the Atlantic. Also pleased though out West in the mountain division, these guys continue to deliver. So top to bottom, the division out of the sixth the \u2013 of the sixth, we had a spread anywhere from 25% to 26% on the top end and 20% on the bottom, so all really, really strong performance across the U.S. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Paul Donahue : You're welcome, Bret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I have really two questions. Let's start on inflation just to make sure I'm getting this right. The 150 is in the product COGS, but then there is also SG&A inflation. I guess, asked another way, what sort of a top-line benefit or do you expect to see indeed the pass through? Is it 3% or 4% to offset all the areas of costs inflation that you're getting either yourself or with the jobbers? Carol Yancey : Yes. Look because of our transformation work that we did and some of the cost saving work that we've done, we think it's less than 3% that we would have to have if you will to pass through. But it's \u2013 definitely this is more specific to U.S. automotive. So we want to make sure that again as we've talked about this product inflation and honestly even to a same extent, the inflation and wages and whatnot, it is a little more prevalent in U.S. automotive. So it's, again, we are able to leverage our costs with less than 3% comp. So that's something that we achieved with our cost savings. So we're just going to keep again, we've got a lot of initiatives in place. I want to just remind you though we still have full year operating margin improvement, in our full year we've got the 20 to 30 basis points operating margin improvement. So we still feel good about being able to deliver that this year. Greg Melich : Got it. And then may be linked to that on the margin side, you mentioned vendor bonuses helping. Is that more relevant to automotive or industrial? Carol Yancey : Yes, actually that's on the gross margin side. And so our gross margin improvement in the quarter, the 120 bps, about a third of that was volume incentives. That's both on automotive and industrial, and it's directly related to the additional billion dollars of revenue that we had and tied to the product purchases. So about a third of the gross margin was improved volume incentives, a third of it was from mix, we've talked about geographical mix, product mix, customer mix, and then a third is just from our strategic category management initiatives and pricing initiatives. So again, feeling good about gross margin as we look ahead. Greg Melich : And I'm going to sneak one end, if I could. You said July call was as strong as June, is that\u2026 Paul Donahue : July \u2013 go ahead, I'm sorry, Greg. Greg Melich : Is that equal in both commercial and for DIY? Or is one sort of taking the lead on that? Paul Donahue : Yes, our DIFM business, Greg, as you heard, is very, very strong and that goes across our major account business, which has really, really bounced back strong. Our AutoCare \u2013 NAPA AutoCare business has really strong. What we're really pleased with Greg is our government in fleet business, which has lagged behind our AutoCare and major account recovery. That business has bounced back with high single-digit growth. So DIFM really continues to carry the load, which by the way we fully expected as the economy bounced back as miles driven really began to ramp back up. Our \u2013 there's so much pent-up demand out there. Our garages are as busy as we have seen them in quite some time. So DIFM continues to carry the weight. And we think as, as we have seen in recent years, DIFM is going to continue to be really strong. Greg Melich : That's great. Well, good luck everyone. Have a great one. WillStengel: Okay. Thanks, Greg. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. I guess my first question is around something like global supply chain challenges that you and most are facing. Do you feel like you're missing sales because you're out of stock of certain products or product categories? WillStengel: Look, here's what I would say that the \u2013 we're all dealing with supply chain issues. All of our peers are as well-documented as you said. Our primary challenge is not in the industrial business, it's not in our international business. It's primarily a U.S. automotive business issue, which is just as a reminder about a third of our overall. I've got a tremendous amount of confidence in our global sourcing team and we're very confident they're doing everything they can. I would tell you, Seth, that at this time being a global player having the size and scale that we have, we do believe that that we're getting as good of supply as anybody in the automotive aftermarket and our team is working incredibly hard to ensure that that remains the case. We're missing sales here and there, you would have to \u2013 you would certainly have to believe we are, but we also believe that that will come back and our suppliers, we think it's transitory. We know it's transitory. They'll get it together. And we fully expect that to come back probably later in the second half could even \u2013 could even carry a bit into 2022. Seth Basham : That's helpful color. And I am thinking about your guidance and the implied operating margins for the balance of the year. It seems like you're expecting incremental margins to not be quite as strong going forward with very strong improvement in your sales outlook and limited improvement in your margin outlook. Is there a reason for that that you could help us understand? Carol Yancey : Yes. Look, I think our implied margin outlook for the rest of the year, the full year, and compared to what we had last quarter, it would be similar. I mean, we are and again, we have considered some of the factors as we've talked about inflation on our costs, but we'd considered the stronger growth, we've considered the stronger top line. And I think when you look at our margin improvement, I mean, it's the two-year basis when you go back to 2019, having that stronger margin improvement year-over-year is something that we expect to deliver. So I think again we have a little bit of cautiousness as we look ahead, but it's still improved margin for 2020 and on a two-year basis it's 70 basis points to 80 basis points for 2019. Seth Basham : Got it. Thank you very much. WillStengel: Thanks, Seth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. Just I guess, since we've now lapsed a periods last year that were most severely impacted, which specific customer groups or regions do you think are still running below normalized levels or are still being negatively impacted by the pandemic? WillStengel: Well, Liz, great question. I would tell you that I mentioned earlier our great bounce back in our major account business, out AutoCare business, [indiscernible] government that, that segment while up high-single digits in the quarter is still trending a bit behind some of the other categories. So that, I guess that would be the one that I would call out. But it's hard \u2013 it's hard to call out our team when they're delivering a high-single digit increase in that product or in that customer category. Liz Suzuki : Yes. I mean, fair enough. Is it the same \u2013 in the case of the industrial group, what do you think are the customer groups that are still pretty far below normalized levels. They're still have the most potential room for recovery? WillStengel: Yes. So on the industrial side if you look at the one area where we were lagging a bit year-over-year was in the safety type products. But if I look across the industries just about everyone is putting up tremendous numbers. I've mentioned equipment and machinery as really being strong. A new category that we're looking at fulfillment and logistics, which is all distribution center, related is really strong. We've had some challenges on the OE automotive primarily due to shortage in the chips. But that's going to \u2013 that's going to come back. So again, all in all our motion team is performing at an incredibly high level and had a great quarter. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. WillStengel: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Thanks, I appreciate you give in. I wanted to go back to the SG&A outlook you touched on Carol. I get things are inflationary and you noted that's accelerating, but I think you also mentioned some of the leverage was from investments in specific projects for future transformation. Can you provide any more color on what that is? And then a related question, obviously you removed a lot of costs last year with the business. How has the pace of bringing those costs back been this year relative to your expectations? Have you been able to keep some of those structural costs out? Carol Yancey : Yes. So when we look at our SG&A and I'll go about it a couple of different ways for the quarter. So this quarter the comparison to last year was our highest level of temporary cost savings. We had over $150 million costs \u2013 temporary cost savings last year in Q2, significant portion was government subsidies, payroll deduction, delayed merit increases, furloughs. So we knew this would be our toughest quarter on those. So that's honestly about half of the increase in the dollar increase in SG&A. The increase in variable costs, as I mentioned, I mean, we have incremental $1 billion more in sales. So about a third of the increase was related to bringing back the variable costs to handle the volume. And then the investments in projects, a relatively small amount but an important amount. So that is investments, Will mentioned some of the productivity improvements we're doing. We've got in our industrial business automation in their warehouses, in our automotive business, consolidating facilities and putting in further automation, investments in pricing, and digital initiatives. So that was roughly say 5% of the dollar increase. And then the, the remaining amount roughly 10% of the dollar increase was the rising cost and inflation. What I would tell you is we have kept the permanent cost savings that we had last year, which ended up being $150 million on a target of $100 million. And in bringing back these costs, I mean, we had just a surge in growth. And so you do have to bring in those variable costs. What we didn't really expect was the rising costs and inflation, but thank goodness we did the work we did on the transformation team. And again, we continue to see some investments and projects as we look ahead. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That's helpful color. And there's a follow-up on the M&A. Obviously things seem like they're picking up as we hopefully further away from this pandemic. Can you talk about what cellar multiples are and maybe by geography, it looks like you bought a little bit kind of across the automotive landscape, but given maybe some of these customers had elevated results last year, maybe some were weaker. Are sellers coming to the table with reasonable multiples or how hard is it to find a deal that you actually like right now? WillStengel: Yes. It's a great question, Daniel. I would say you're right. The M&A environment is very active. I would say that the market is working through the expectations of sellers. You're right in thinking that those expectations are pretty high. I think for us the key takeaway for everybody to hear is the discipline that we have around doing the right deal. So we look at a lot of deals to do a few and do the right ones where we can create a ton of values. So you're right though, we're actively working the pipeline. We will continue to work the pipeline, but we're going to stay very disciplined on doing the right deals for ourselves. Paul Donahue : Hey, Daniel, I would also mentioned, we're very selective in our M&A targets and I think a couple that were called out were Winparts, which is a online \u2013 a leading online player in Europe and that \u2013 that's \u2013 it's very targeted. We want to further our online presence across our European markets and we found a great partner in Winparts and so more to come on that later. Will and I were actually in the Netherlands last week. Our first international trip in 18 months, spend a half day with this group and very impressive and we think nice upside in the future. Daniel Imbro : And here's the quick related follow-up. Can you disclose what kind of multiples you typically try to pay for these kinds of assets in the automotive segment? WillStengel: Daniel, we're not going to disclose that at this time. Daniel Imbro : Okay. Thanks a lot guys. WillStengel: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question today comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. David Bellinger : Hey everybody. Thanks for taking the question here. So I believe you mentioned a stronger ticket in U.S. automotive that's actually due to inflation, but is there anything else behind that on the consumer side that really stands out? Just to give a larger ticket repairs, shift older used vehicles, anything else there and just how sustainable can that trend be? WillStengel: Yes. David, we've seen a nice bounce up in our average ticket size and we've been watching that for a number of years. Our ticket count was a little bit of a concern where we saw bit of a decline in recent years. What we're really excited about these past couple of quarters is we're watching both ticket count and average ticket size go up. And in this past quarter both were up high-single digits. So we think that's a long-term trend as parts continued to get more and more expensive. And as repair orders continue \u2013 the average repair order continues to move up. So again, we're pleased \u2013 especially pleased to see our traffic up, but also ticket up and both going in the right direction. David Bellinger : All right, appreciate that. Then my follow-up here; can you expand upon some of the earlier comments around labor constraints that we're talking about? Are you raising wages in the U.S. NAPA stores and DCs now? Is there more overtime given worker shortages, maybe just walk us through what you're seeing and any quantification of higher costs if you can? Carol Yancey : Yes. David, the answer is yes to all those things. I mean, again you've got an extremely tough labor market in the U.S. There are labor shortages everywhere, and whether it's stores, it's warehouses, it's delivery drivers, our teams are working tirelessly and there is additional overtime, there's temp help, there's contract labor, and you don't have 20% increases in volume. As Paul mentioned 20%, 25% increases in volume across these geographies with a labor shortage. And so we're doing all we can to take some burdens off our team and to make sure that we can properly service our customers. But it is we are raised raising wages in certain areas and certain categories. And I think as we mentioned, I mean, it was roughly 50 basis points to 60 basis points when you look at overall inflation on our SG&A. Wages being the biggest part and freight being the secondary component. WillStengel: Hey, David, I would also just tag onto that to say that, and to clarify that the issue is primarily in our U.S. automotive business and it's in the retail stores, it's roles like delivery drivers that are coming a bit under pressure. We're not seeing this type of pressure in our industrial business, nor are we seeing it much on the international side. So again the one-third of our business, U.S. automotive is where we're feeling the impact and primarily in our retail stores, delivery drivers, those type \u2013 those type roles. David Bellinger : Yes. Yes. Very helpful. Thanks again, and best of luck as you go through the rest half year. WillStengel: Thank you. Appreciate it. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to management for any final comments. Carol Yancey : We'd like to thank you for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest in support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next call for Q3. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now, I will turn it over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report strong financial results again this quarter, which reflects the consistent execution of our strategic priorities as the global markets continue to recover. As we size up the business climate and how we are managing through the recovery, we can report the GPC team is generating positive momentum in both our sales and operating results. And we are well positioned for both near and long-term growth. Despite inflationary pressures, our margins reflect the success of our category management initiatives in cost control efforts which have offset these increases. And finally, our strategic efforts with our global supplier partners have prevented significant shortfalls and our overall inventory levels allowing us to deliver quality customer service. Taken a look at our third quarter financial results, total sales were 4.8 billion up 10% from last year and up 11% from Q3 of 2019. We also produced our 16th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion.  And we further improved our productivity and customer service capabilities with the ongoing execution of our operational initiatives. As a result, segment profit increased 14% and our segment margin improved 30 basis points to 9.3%. This represents our strongest margin in 2 decades and confirms our key initiatives are driving meaningful improvements. Net income was 229 million or a $1.59 for diluted share and adjusted net income was 270 million or a $1.88 per share.  This is a 15% increase from 2020 and establishes a new record for GPC's quarterly earnings, so just an outstanding job by the GPC team. Total sales for global automotive also set a new record at 3.2 billion for the quarter. This represents an 8% increase from Q3 2020, and a 15% increase from Q3 of 2019. On a comp basis, sales were up 5% from last year and up 7% on a two-year stack, with our strongest year-over-year automotive comps coming from the U.S. business.  In addition, from a cadence perspective, sales held up well through the quarter with the strongest average daily sales volume in each of our geographies coming in September. The broad strength in our global automotive sales reflects a number of factors. First, we're proud of our team's efforts to shore up our supply chain amidst the difficult backdrop of product delays and logistics challenges. Supply chain disruptions have been more substantial for U.S. automotive than in our international or industrial operations.  And we continue to work closely with our global suppliers to manage through these issues and ensure we have the right inventory available for our customers. We are confident in the effectiveness of our global sourcing team and believe we are well-positioned in the industry. We also continue to benefit from our key growth initiatives and market tailwinds. Among our growth initiatives, our emphasis on innovative sales programs and sales force effectiveness are positively impacting commercial sales.  As examples, we recently finalized an exclusive partnership in the education space for technician recruitment with over 10,000 active tech students in the process of earning their credentials. We're also excited that NAPA and AAA have executed an agreement for NAPA to be the exclusive auto parts supplier for the new AAA branded premium battery. This battery will be available to all consumers with a focus on the over 62 million AAA cardholders and 5,400 approved auto repair centers. We're also equipping our sales team with incremental resources, training and development, which have led to more productive, customer-facing calls. In addition, our omni -channel investments continue to drive strong B2B and B2C digital sales. And finally, the international rollout of the NAPA brand is driving significant growth in both our European and Asia-Pac operations.  So now turning to the market tailwinds, these macro drivers include the following : The ongoing reopening of the economy, and improving miles-driven which generate the need for more repairs and more maintenance. A robust used car market, that is keeping more cars on the road longer. And improving the aftermarket fundamentals, such as the growing and aging vehicle fleet, which will continue to benefit the industry over the long term.  Looking next at our automotive highlights by region, total U.S. sales were up 9%. Comp sales increased 8% from last year and are up 5% on a 2 year stack. In Canada, total sales were up 1% with comp sales essentially flat both year-over-year and on a two-year stack as lockdowns in major markets have slowed the recovery. it's been encouraging to see these restrictions of easing of late, which should lead to stronger demand through the final 3 months of 2021.  Our U.S. sales were driven by strong demand for product categories such as exhaust, ride control, brakes, tools, and equipment which all outperformed. In addition, both retail and commercial ticket and traffic counts were positive for the third consecutive quarter. By customer segment, sales to both commercial and retail customers held strong, with DIFM sales outperforming DIY for the second straight quarter. We do remain pleased, however, with the continued strength of our DIY business and believe we can drive additional growth with ongoing initiatives, such as B2C digital investments. These include new search features, improving catalog functionality, and enhanced payment options, such as, buy now and pay later. NAPA online, B2C sales continue to grow at a rapid pace, up over 40% from the third quarter, and up 2x from 2019.  The strength in commercial sales in the quarter was driven by several of the initiatives mentioned earlier, as well as the ongoing economic recovery in the U.S.. Sales to our major account partners were strongest with mid-teen growth, followed by sales for our NAPA AutoCare customers, which were up low double digits. We would add that our NAPA AutoCare membership has surged with the reopening of markets and includes nearly 400 shop upgrades thus far in 2021.  So really terrific momentum for our premier independent garage program. Rounding out our commercial segments, fleet, and government and other wholesale customers, also posted high single-digit growth for the quarter. So really strong results across all of our commercial accounts. These are encouraging trends and as we look ahead, we remain confident in our growth strategy and our key priorities to deliver customer value. and ultimately sell more parts for more cars.  Our AAD team in Europe continue to perform well with total Q3 sales up 8%, were up a strong 23% on a two-year stack. Comp sales increased 2.5% from last year and were up 14% on a 2-year stack. While the UK and Benelux continue to stand out with really strong results, we were pleased with the solid results in each of our 7 European markets. A reflection of stable market conditions and execution of our key sales initiatives. These include the continued roll-out of the NAPA brand and ongoing emphasis on key account development, which are driving market share gains. Now looking at our Asia-Pac business, total sales were up 2% from 2020 and up 18% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales were up slightly from last year and up 15% on a 2-year stack. With both commercial and retail sales up double-digit, driven by positive growth with both the Repco and NAPA brand.  We're really pleased with these results given the severe lock downs and the major markets of Sydney, Melbourne, and Auckland during much of the quarter. We're energized to see the reopening of these markets is finally getting underway, and we expect a surge in demand in the coming month. So now let's discuss the Global Industrial segment. Total sales for this segment were 1.6 billion, a strong 15% increase from last year, and a 5% increase from 2019. Comp sales were up 13% and up 4% on a 2-year stack.  Through the quarter, average daily sales in July and August were in line with the second quarter, while our strongest results were in the month of September. This quarter's positive momentum and industrial exceeded our expectations, which is a reflection of the great work by our motion team, and the strengthening of the industrial economy. Both the PMI and industrial production were positive for the quarter and these indicators correlate closely to the overall healthy state of the industrial sales climate.  For the second consecutive quarter, we had positive sales growth across each of our industries served. The industry's sectors that stood out with double-digit growth include our largest customers segment, equipment and machinery, as well as iron and steel, automotive, aggregate and cement, lumber and wood, fabricated metals, equipment rental, and oil and gas. In addition, our newly added fulfillment and logistics industry experienced tremendous growth. So as you can see, the current growth in our industrial business is quite broad across the markets we serve. As we have conveyed in our prior calls and in our industrial Deep Dive event on September 15, our Motion business is a market leader in the industrial distribution space in North America and Australasia. DMI team strive to be the preferred industrial solutions provider in the industries we serve. We partner with the best manufacturers in the industry to provide Tier 1 brand, our customers demand.  In addition, we are constantly broadening our product offering, as well as our service capabilities to maximize our sales potential and drive market share gains in a very large and fragmented market. With these fundamentals of our business in mind, our focus on continued profitable growth in this segment remained grounded in 5 key initiatives. An omni -channel build-out to accelerate e-commerce growth and drive sales with new customers.  As examples, Motion.com and our inside sales center, which has grown from 15 to now, 35 reps in just 6 months continue to drive incremental sales from new motion customers. The expansion of our industrial services and value-add solutions in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance, and automation.  Strategic M&A to generate significant growth in new markets and new products, and services as an industry consolidator. Enhanced strategy to create a dynamic pricing environment that provides us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. And lastly, network optimization and automation to further improve our operating efficiencies and productivity. We're pleased with the progress from these initiatives, thus far, and we are excited for the opportunities ahead.  Another third quarter highlight, is the publication of our 2021 sustainability report update. Our initiatives and activities over the past year have lead to continued progress toward our goal of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. We've also taken steps to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations by reducing energy and emissions while increasing recycling opportunities across the globe.  2020 tested all of us and accentuated the importance of supporting our people and our communities. We're really proud of our GPC teammates around the world for their resilience and contributions to further in our sustainability goals. We invite you to learn more about these initiatives and our full report which you can find on the GPC website. So in summary, we made great progress in several important areas during the third quarter. And we're very pleased with the strong result in our automotive and industrial businesses, and the continued improvement in our sales and operations. We could not be more proud of the GPC team. Now, I will turn the call over to Will. Will? Will Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, let me reiterate Paul's comments and acknowledge the continued strong team performance this quarter. It's always a proud moment to have the opportunity to showcase our global teams hard work, relentless customer service, and winning performance. It's a challenging environment and teams have done an exceptional job to adjust and deliver results.  We continue to remain focused on our key pillars, including talent, sales effectiveness, digital supply chain, and emerging technology. Teams are executing initiatives well and consider s strategic initiatives a central part of our operating cadence. The teams have rigor around measurement and progress visibility. We measure unique global initiatives and are ahead of our 2021 plan established at the beginning of the year.  As we execute our GPC strategic planning process for the upcoming year, we reflect on learn from and refine our priority initiative execution. In addition through the year, we share best practices around the globe for common strategies to help us continuously learn and improve as one GPC team. While our geographies and end markets are diverse, we share similar GPC global initiatives, all designed to deliver profitable growth in excess of market growth, operating leverage, and free cash flow. Despite a challenging environment, we're pleased to see more normal team activities and customer activities starting to be possible in most of our geographies. We recently had the opportunity to meet in person with the U.S. Automotive Executive and Field Management team in Atlanta. We listened to field feedback, shared performance trends, enjoyed team camaraderie, introduced new talent, and collaborated on strategic priorities for the upcoming year.  Similarly, approximately 70 of our motion Executive and field leaders from around the country, recently had the chance to meet in person for the first time since early 2020, to detail business performance and review strategic initiatives priorities. In Europe, our AAG executive leadership team recently met together in person for the first time in nearly 2 years.  Our Atlanta-based GPC and U.S. NAPA field support teams also hosted an employee appreciation event for 400 teammates, that included a well-received visit from our celebrity NAPA racing teammates, including Chase Elliott. We're cautiously optimistic our teams in Australasia will soon be able to exit lockdown in November and also return to a more normal in-person routine.  At each of these events, it's energizing to see the positive attitudes, strong team alignment, and visible excitement about our GPC momentum and vision. It's also reassuring to see our differentiated GPC culture up close and intact. Paul and I have also had the opportunity to spend time in person with customers and vendors this quarter. These discussions are critically important as we share our growth visions, listen to feedback, and explore ways to deepen our strategic partnership.  These conversations not only reinforce our GPC core strategic priorities, talent, sales effectiveness, digital and tech, supply chain and emerging tech; b but also always affirm the unique customer value propositions across our GPC businesses. Growth, technology solutions, supply chain excellence, products and technical expertise, and long-standing local relationships are always key themes. As an example, we recently visited with an industrial customer who is enjoying exponential growth. Our Motion teammates co-locate associates at the customer facility to provide real-time expertise on the plant floor to ensure the facility is operating to its potential. Part of the discussions with this customer explored the use of embedded technology solutions that will make customer ordering from motion easier and faster.  We're building plans to triple the size of this customer relationship over the next few years. In our customer discussions or recent common theme is the supply chain challenges that face all Company. We explained, we believe our global scale in-country resources, data and analytics, investments in our supply chain, strategic inventory actions, and proactive daily team approach, position as to navigate the headwinds relative to others. We're in constant discussion with highest levels of our supplier partners, many of which for whom GPC represents a large and important global customer.  Over the past quarter, we've held numerous top-to-top meetings with our global executive leadership and vendor partners to review progress and jointly problems solved. It's a challenging environment, but our global teams and partners are proactively acting each day to navigate it. Turning to our focus on talent, we recently completed an end-to-end strategic review of our global GPC employee value proposition, and talent initiatives. This disciplined work ensures we have the right capabilities aligned to our current and future business strategies. The work also ensures we're constantly striving to be an employer of choice in this dynamic and competitive talent environment. Around the globe, we continue to take deliberate actions to lead, recognize and ensure the well-being of our teams.  For example, we recently streamlined recruiting processes to move faster to attract talent, introduce new wellness incentives, improved holiday schedules, enhance vacation eligibility and flexibility, invested in healthcare costs to reduce the burden on our associates, improve tuition reimbursement programs, and relaxed dress code policies to name a few. And talent's our most important advantage, we'll always work to take care of and invest in our people. We also continued to execute well against our broader digital and technology initiatives. During the quarter, the teams have made exciting progress under leadership of our new Chief Information and Digital Officer, Naveen Krishna. We're focused on building high performing teams that engineered technology to solve customers problems at scale. In addition, we'll optimize human and financial resources to focus on the most critical and impactful activities.  Our emerging technology initiatives, including electric vehicles and related technologies also continue to advance. The global teams are partnering well to execute a disciplined and coordinated strategy. We're pleased with the team momentum and will continue to dedicate resources to this exciting effort.  Last, the teams are executing our M&A strategy with discipline. For example, we added several store groups to our North American and Europe an automotive network to increase local market density and we announced the acquisition of J&S Automotive Distributors, a leading automotive parts distributor in Ireland. This new geography represents the 15th country in which GPC operates. In addition, we were pleased to recently sign a definitive agreement to acquire AutoAccessoriesGarage, a leading U.S. based digital platform specializing in automotive accessories.  This strategic digital acquisition adds new capabilities and accelerates a strategic product category for the U.S. automotive team. The acquisition pipeline is active and we remain disciplined to prioritize transactions we believe meet all of our GPC strategic and financial criterion. We are thrilled to welcome our newest teammate to the global GPC family. Overall, we are really pleased with the record -setting team performance.  Despite uncontrollable headwind, the teams continue to rally together each day to service customers and deliver performance. We look forward to working hard to close the year strong and build on our solid momentum as we move forward into 2022. With that, I will now turn the call over to Carol to review the financial details. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very pleased with our third quarter financial performance and we look forward to sharing a few additional details with you. Recapping revenues, total GPC sales were 4.8 billion in the third quarter, up 10%. Gross margin improved to 35.5%, an increase of 50 basis points from 35.0%, last year. Our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives due to improved volumes and the positive impact of strategic category management initiatives. In the third quarter, we had continued pricing activity with our suppliers as anticipated, resulting in additional product cost inflation. Our team was positioned to address these increases with effective pricing and global sourcing strategies and price inflation improve neutral to gross margin.  On a total Company basis, we estimate a 3% inflationary impact on Q3 sales, consisting of 3.5% inflation in global automotive, and 1% to 2% in industrial. Based on current trends, we expect to see additional price inflation in the fourth quarter, and we will utilize our strategies to protect our gross margin as appropriate. Our total adjusted operating and non-operating expenses were 1.35 billion in the third quarter, up 11% from 2020 and at 28% of sales.  The increase from last year is due to several factors, including the prior-year benefit of approximately 60 million and temporary savings related to the pandemic. Additionally, our third quarter expenses reflect the increase in variable costs on the 450 million in additional year-over-year sales, as well as cost pressures in areas such as wages, Incentive compensation flight, rent, and health insurance. We continue to execute on our ongoing initiatives to control expenses and improve our operations.  While pleased with our progress, thus far, we see room for further improvement in the quarters ahead. Our total segment profit in the third quarter was 447 million up 14%. Our segment profit margin was 9.3% compared to 9.0% last year, a 30 basis point year-over-year improvement, and up a 130 basis points from 2019. So we're really pleased with the continued improvement and the excellent work by our team.  Looking ahead, we raised our margin expectations for the full year and we currently expect segment profit margin to improve 40 to 50 basis points from 2020 or 80 to 90 basis points from 2019. This would be our strongest full year margin in more than 20 years. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 24.9% on an adjusted basis, up from 23.4% last year, with the increase in rate primarily related to income mix shift to higher tax jurisdictions.  Our third quarter net income from continuing operations was 229 million, with diluted earnings per share of a $1.59. Our adjusted net income was 270 million or a $1.88 per diluted share, which compares to 237 million or a $1.63 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year, a 15% increase. So turning to our third quarter results by segment, our total automotive revenue was 3.2 billion up 8% from last year.  Our segment profit increased 6% to 281 million with profit margin as solid 8.8%. While down 20 basis points from 2020 due to the prior-year benefit of temporary savings, this represents an 80 basis point margin improvement over 2019 and reflects the underlying progress in our operations. For the 9 months profit margin is 8.6% up 80 basis points from 2020 and up 90 basis points from 2019, driven primarily by margin expansion in our U.S. and European operations. Our industrial sales were 1.6 billion up 15% from 2020. Segment profit of a 166 million was up a strong 32% from a year ago and profit margin improved to a 10.3%. This is a 140 basis points from 2020 and up 220 basis points from 2019 and the first double-digit margin for industrial since the Fourth Quarter of 2006. Year-to-date profit margin for this segment is 9.4% up a 120 basis points from 2020 and up a 150 basis points from 2019. So this group is executing very well and posting excellent operating results through the industrial recovery. So now, let's turn our comments to the balance sheet.  At September 30th, total accounts receivable is down 3.5%, primarily due to the timing of the 300 million in accounts receivables sold in October of 2020. Inventory was up 10% in line with our sales increase and a reflection of our commitment to having the right parts, in the right place, at the right time. Accounts payable increased 20% from last year due to the increase in inventory and favorable payment terms with certain suppliers. Our AP to inventory ratio improved to 129% from 118% last year.  Our total debt is 2.4 billion down 474 million or 16% from September of last year, and down 245 million from December 31 of 2020. We closed the third quarter with available liquidity of 2.4 billion and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.5 times from 2.2 times last year. So our teams continue to do an outstanding job of optimizing our working capital and our capital structure. We also continue to generate strong cash flow with another 300 million in cash from operations in the third quarter and 1 billion for the 9 months. For the full year.  We expect our earnings growth and working capital to drive 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion in cash from operations. And free cash flow of 950 million to 1.15 billion. Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, share repurchases and the dividend. For the 9 months we have invested a 138 million in capital expenditures, and we have plans for additional investments to drive organic growth and improve efficiencies and productivity in our operations through the balance of the year.  In addition, we have used approximately a 143 million in cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth. These investments includes several automotive store groups across our markets, included in the entry into Ireland discussed earlier. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions in both automotive and industrial segments. This would include Auto Accessories Garage as mentioned before, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Consistent with our longstanding dividend policy, we have also paid a total cash dividend of more than 349 million to our shareholders through the 9 months. The Company has paid a dividend every year since going public in 1948 and has increased the dividend for 65 consecutive years.  And as part of our share repurchase program, we have also been active with share buybacks dating back to 1994. In the third quarter, we used a $100 million to purchase 800,000 shares, and year-to-date we have used 284 million to purchase 2.2 million shares. The Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 12.2 million additional shares, and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead.  So turning to our current outlook for 2021, we are raising our full-year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on July 22nd of 2021. We expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of +12 to +13%, an increase from our previous guidance of +10 to +12%. As usual, this excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to +14 to +15 total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an increase from +11 to +13% and a total sales increase of +10 to +11% for the industrial segment. An increase + plus 6% to +8% On the earnings side, we're raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $6.60 to $6.65, which is up 25% to 26% from 2020.  This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $6.20 to $6.35. So we're encouraged by the strength in our financial results for the third quarter and the nine months. And we enter the fourth quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed our outlook for the year. We look forward to reporting on our financial performance for the fourth quarter in full year in February. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. As we close out another strong quarter, we are pleased with our progress in driving profitable growth, strong cash flow, and shareholder We attribute the positive momentum in our business to our global team work and disciplined focus across all of our operations. Our team has confidence in the strategic plans we have put in place to capture long-term growth and margin expansion. Our strategic plans combined with an exceptional balance sheet position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities via investments at organic and acquisitive growth. While also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. So as we look ahead, we are encouraged to see the impact of the global pandemic subsiding. while the fundamentals of our two global businesses remained rock solid.  Our GPC teams around the world are stepping up under challenging circumstances and taking great care of our customers. That we thank you for your interest in GPC. and we thank each of our GPC teammates for their passion, their dedication, and their hard work. So with that, let me turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris Horvers of JP Morgan, please state your question. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Carol Yancey : Good morning. Chris Horvers : My first question is, you talked about September being the best average daily volume in the automotive business and obviously Motion has a very strong two-year acceleration. So can you talk about the potential outcomes on the fourth quarter on the comps in both businesses and given that commentary, would you expect that the two-year trend could accelerate in the fourth quarter on comps? Paul Donahue : Well, Chris, first off, thanks for your question. You've hit it when you look across all of our businesses, the quarter the third quarter got stronger as we progressed with September being our strongest month. And what we can tell you is that the trends that we saw in September are carrying over into the month of October.  So we're feeling good about where we are. And we certainly feel really good about the projections that we put out there for Q4. So yeah, right now everything is looking pretty solid. Chris Horvers : Excellent. And then, Carol, can you diagnose maybe the 50 basis points of gross margin expansion? Some of that -- it was vendor allowance -- some of those vendor allowance, some of those are vendor allowance, some are pricing. How much of that is perhaps not sustainable on the vendor allowance side, and then how does that sort of parlay into your views about Motion's operating margin over time? Thank you. Carol Yancey : I Know, look, we couldn't be more proud of the team and the work that was done in gross margin, I really want to give thanks to our procurement teams and all of our teams because there has been a ton of efforts related to gross margin. So when we think about the inflationary impacts and having to deal with that, but honestly our initiatives, category management initiatives, global sourcing, pricing strategy.  It was vendor allowances, but quite honestly, in addition to that and especially when you look at the year-to-date numbers, it is the benefit -- the ongoing benefit of all our category management initiatives, which includes pricing and global sourcing. So I think in the quarter you did have more of an impact related to volume incentives. But I think again, taking into account everything and inflation quite honestly was neutral to our rate.  So as we look ahead, we're not concerned about gross margin in Q4. And in fact, contemplated in our guidance and our outlook is that we would continue to have a positive impact in Q4, which would have us be positive for the year and then also extremely positive on a 2-year stack basis. Chris Horvers : And then on the motion operating margin? Carol Yancey : Yeah. The motion operating margin, I think where you see them through the 9 months, which just, again, incredible operating performance for them. And it is both gross margin and expense leverage. And they have really permanently lowered their cost structure, but I think we will see continued improvement in Q4, for the Industrial operating margin and that would give them, sort of an implied 80 to 90 BPS improvement for the full year, which is just outstanding, and again, much stronger than that on a two-year stack basis. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thanks so much. And have a great fourth quarter. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Chris. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please state your question. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Carol Yancey : Morning. Paul Donahue : Hi, Bret. Bret Jordan : You commented about share gains in Automotive and, I guess, as it relates to the U.S-- are you seeing the share shift sort of smaller WDs giving up share or are there real shifts amongst the larger players in the space? Paul Donahue : I'll take a shot at that Bret, thanks to your question, it's -- look it's hard to say where we're gaining this year. I can tell you with some of the product category that we look at and the growth that we're seeing in Q3. And on top of a really solid Q2, we have to be up outpacing the general market. But we're also the first one out, Bret, so we'll see what the numbers look like here going forward. Bottom line is, as we all know, the automotive aftermarket is incredibly fragmented. We like where we're at, we like the performance by our NAPA team and they had a terrific quarter and actually had terrific back-to-back quarters. And as I mentioned in the initial question, we're out of the gates in great shape in the month of October, so we expect that to continue. And I would also comment Bret that, we feel the same way about our international automotive businesses in our European team as well as our Asia-Pac team continue to perform at a high level. Will Stengel : And I guess my follow-up question relates to the European team, I guess, what you are saying is you rolled out the NAPA private label program in Europe, is that gaining traction? And maybe you could give us a feeling for how the margin benefit of private label looks over there. Paul Donahue : Yeah, I'll touch on the acceptance part, maybe Carol you weigh in on the margins. The acceptance Bret, I have to tell you is beyond our expectation, so much so that we are accelerating our -- the number of product lines. And we're accelerating the pace with which we're rolling those out. So as you look across our European aftermarket business, we really started in the UK and our UK business continues to outperform. And now we've rolled that out into the other market. And I have to tell you it's really surpassed our expectation. So really pleased and I would also say we are rolling it out in Australia and New Zealand as well with similar results. Carol Yancey : Yeah. So on the margin standpoint, the product labels, specifically for Europe is neutral to their gross margin rate. Having said that it is favorable from a working capital standpoint, because many of the private label comes with extended terms. So the team has been able to see the benefit of that. And in turn, they're taking their working capital improvements in reinvesting an additional product offerings and additional M&A such as [Indiscernible] that Paul and Will talked about earlier. Bret Jordan : What do you say, as a percentage of your inventory mix being private label over there? Carol Yancey : We haven't really given that out yet. I mean, it's starting off slow with a number of product lines and we haven't given out a target. It's not going to be something. It's not ever going to be like what you see, certainly in the U.S. but going to a 10% and incremental improvement year-on-year out. I think you can expect that. Bret Jordan : All right, thanks. if you, Brent, if you go back in time, Brent, when we first went into Europe back in 2017, there was very little, if any, private brands have sold through the AAG network. So everything that we're moving through right now and the NAPA brand is all incremental. And as Carol said, we're targeting 10%. We think that's a good number, but we could certainly increase that in the years ahead as we expand into new product categories. Bret Jordan : Great, thank you. Paul Donahue : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Please state your question. Greg Melich : Thanks. My first one was on inflation. The 3% that you saw in third quarter sales. What should that accelerate to or doesn't need to accelerate into the fourth quarter to keep it neutral on a margin standpoint? Carol Yancey : Yes. We think that fourth quarter is probably in the 3 to 4% range. We would say that that would be 3 to 4% for our Global Automotive and 1 to 2% for industrial. It's slightly higher on the us automotive than it is on international automotive. Then Greg, having said that and again, I couldn't be more pleased with our teams. They are doing a tremendous job and we do not think despite having incremental inflation coming in Q4, we're confident in our ability to manage through that and be able to continue to deliver gross margin improvements. Greg Melich : And has there been any shift in mix or any demand destruction. This is accepted by the customer? Carol Yancey : Well, Greg. I guess just generally what we would say when you look at our top-line results and you look at the strong demand, whether it's industrial or automotive. I mean, at this point, we haven't seen the push back, and part of it is the nature of our business that is non-discretionary. So we haven't seen necessarily the push back, pricing has stayed rational and inflations in all sectors, all industries. So really haven't seen that yet. Greg Melich : Got it. Make sense. And then the second was a little more strategic. Will, you talked about the M&A out there and some of the strategic things you've added. I know, historically, you guys have had a nice model paying 8 times EBITDA for things and getting some synergies and then rolling it in. What's the current environment now in terms of just finding the right opportunities and paying what you are used to paying for acquisitions? Paul Donahue : Yeah. Greg. It's a good question. Thanks for it. It is certainly a dynamic M&A market. I think as we alluded to, we have a very disciplined approach to thinking about deals. Whether it's financially, operationally, strategically, etc. And for us, it's all about the value creation potential.  And I think on our Industrial Conference, I made a comment talking about creating value so that the eight or nine times becomes something lower than that. And so that's how we think about [Indiscernible]. What does this business look like? And how much value can we create when we bring it into the GPC family. Greg, I would also add on to that one. When we look at our bolt-on acquisitions in the automotive space, whether it's in Europe or here across North America. Those continue to be very reasonable and rational, and are very close to our historic kind of valuations. But as Will said, we'll -- we will continue to be incredibly disciplined as we look at M&A here going forward. Greg Melich : That's a great summary. So thanks, congrats to you all and good luck. Paul Donahue : Thanks. Will Stengel : Thank you Greg. Carol Yancey : Thank you Operator : Our next question is from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Daniel Imbro : Thanks for taking my question. This is Andrew on for Daniel. So on the industrial side of the business, September PMI stepped up a bit. It's a nice surprise. How are you -- are you able to meet the demand in the market today? Have you had any issues with the risk? Paul Donahue : Our industrial business has held up -- well, you see the numbers Andrew that our industrial numbers are as strong as they've ever been. We had a terrific -- the team had a terrific Q3. We're not seeing that type of supply chain disruptions on the industrial side as we're seeing across the automotive -- North America automotive sector.  So they are in good shape, not to mention our industrial team going into 2021 did not trim back their inventories. They were in a good place, an inventory. And that is largely held up throughout the course of the year which has led to that great sales increase, they popped in Q3. So all is good on the industrial front. Daniel Imbro : Excellent. On the call through, you mentioned adding in some buy now pay later. Is that something you are just rolling out on the DIY side or do you see an opportunity to maybe roll that out to the DIFM channel to help out with affordability on repairs? Will Stengel : Yes, it's a great question. It's mostly on the DIY side and it's early days with the pilots that we're testing, but I'll tell you, is a good example of kind of understanding and listening to the customer, and then coming up with some solutions that meet these needs. So it's early days, but online retail is probably the place where that's most relevant. Daniel Imbro : Perfect. Thanks. That's all from me. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Please state your question. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot. And good morning. My question is on the U.S. Auto business and acceleration and growth that you saw in September, was that just a function of the comparison or is there something else that might have driven the acceleration in September and into October? Paul Donahue : Well, I would tell you, Seth, that I think it's a combination of factors. I think our U.S. automotive team continues to get their legs under them. The year, continues to get better as we go. I mentioned October is looking strong. It's looking strong across all regions of the country. It's looking strong in both DIY and DIFM.  And we don't -- we don't see it slowing. I would also comment that we had our best month, our best quarter with our big partners on the major accounts side, our AutoCare business continued strong and, Seth, our DIY business continues strong. So it's really across the board, it's held up well and we're seeing that trend continue on the month of October as well. Seth Basham : Got it. And just as a follow-up, when you think about new customer growth, have you seen an acceleration there or is it more about growing business with existing customers and the major accounts and NAPA AutoCare? Paul Donahue : It's really both Seth and I. And again, I would give our team high marks on the strategy they put together going into 2021, which was all around sales team effectiveness and putting more sales reps out on the street and getting them focused on the end-user customer. And even when you look at our So kind of what we deem as our all other wholesale business, which is a significant chunk of business that was up high single-digits, year-over-year. So I think a combination of growing business with existing customers, but also kind of restructuring our approach to the customers with our sales team and really driving a lot of new business as well. So very pleased with the NAPA team and where we find ourselves. Seth Basham : Great to hear. Thank you. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Seth. Operator : Our next question is from Liz Suzuki of Bank of America, please state your question. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thanks for fitting in my question. So Will had mentioned a number of enhancements to employee benefits with a focus on being a global employer of choice. Can you quantify the cost of these initiatives? Or if you can't, explicitly break out how much you think SG&A would be impacted, do you think it's fair to say that growth in wages and benefits is likely to be elevated compared to historical growth rates for the foreseeable future? Carol Yancey : I guess I would comment and again, these are just great things they're really important to our teammates and they are important for the work force. And yet having said that, they don't come with significant costs. I mean, what we would point to that is just more relevant on the SG&A is just the true labor and wage inflation that we're seeing. Part of it is making sure that you have competitive benefit programs and things like that, we've talked about healthcare and some of those things, paid time off vacation.  But I think more important and more significant is just the true wage inflation that we're seeing. Having said that though, we couldn't be more pleased with the team's hard work in really permanently reducing our cost structure and being able to offset a lot of that inflationary impact with some of our initiatives. So I would not say that you need a model anything in there for the incremental benefit of those types of programs. And all that is contemplated in our full-year operating margin improvement that we've kind of models. So we feel good about it going forward. Liz Suzuki : Got it. Then on a follow-up to that, just given the increase in the guidance for the year, I'd imagine that the quarter came in ahead of your expectations and that there are some encouraging leading indicators that make you feel increasingly optimistic about the fourth quarter. So I'm curious where the results have most surprised to the upside versus your prior estimates. Carol Yancey : Yeah. I think look there weren't any major surprises. Our results were really due to the stronger sales and continued recovery in automotive and industrial. The 16th consecutive quarter of gross margin gains with a highly inflationary environment, but having cost controls to really drive improved margins was important. We had terrific cash flow in the quarter, and again, with all the supply chain disruptions.  So having that higher volume and really the industrial recovery has been coming quicker each quarter. So that went into our thinking as we look at the rest of the year, but we feel really good about Q4. But again, it's been a great team effort. And I think as we've seen each quarter, recoveries and the reopening of economies and the fundamentals have gotten better each quarter. Liz Suzuki : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Our last question comes from David Bellinger of Wolfe Research. Please state your question. David Bellinger : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. And very nice results today. To on -- the 350 basis points of inflationary benefits within Automotive, you're expecting a similar rate in Q4. Are there any -- are the majority of those price increases fully rolled out at this point, or is there still some room to go into next year? Are you taking any pricing actions that are different from your competitors at this point? Carol Yancey : Yeah, look, I mean it's a very fluid environment with these price increases. I mean, as they're presented to us and again, the global sourcing and supply chain and procurement teams work very closely with the vendors and they look at timing and we look at areas that we can have time to work into those price increases. We look at accelerating purchases. I mean, there's a lot of work that's being done and the timing of when they go to market is a factor in that as well.  There will be some that carries over. Brenda next year, certainly, but it's a day-to-day, week-to-week negotiation right now. It is more normal inflation and industrial, so keep that in mind, the 1 to 2% is just more normal inflation for them. It's really the us automotive that's got the heightened inflation. Again international automotive a little more normal. We will have some that goes into next year. But again, teams are doing great job to work through that and have improvement. David Bellinger : Got it. And then I also want to ask buy now pay later feature. Is there any way you could frame the potential size of that opportunity? Is it really aimed at widening the NAPA customer base in some way? And just given that initiative and the acquisition you announced today, are you expecting that elevated online percentage of the business remains peaking in the coming years? Paul Donahue : I'll take a shot at the first part of that. David, the Buy Now, Pay Later pilot, we're in about 250 NAPA stores. And look, I give our team credit for jumping on the opportunity. It's so early yet. It's -- I would misspeak if I tried to put a number to it. It's something new. We'd never done it before. We're not doing it anywhere else in the world at this point. I would just tell you kind of stay tuned and certainly more to come on that initiative.  And then I'm sorry, the second part of your question online. Certainly, the acquisition that was announced, Automotive Accessories Garage, we're excited about that acquisition and it really goes hand-in-hand, David, with recent strategies where we acquired wind parts in Europe, we acquired spares parts in Australia, a few years back. And it's really just broadening our knowledge base and expertise into all things online.  I would certainly expect that this initiative here in the U.S. will follow in a same track that we've done in the international markets. And I'm very pleased to tell you that, they have exceeded our expectations. It's still early at wind parts in Europe, but I would tell you that, early results are very, very, very favorable. And we expect to see the same as we really just expand our knowledge base in selling products online. David Bellinger : Great. Thank you very much. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Operator : We have reached the end of the question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's earnings call. We look forward to updating you on our year-end and fourth quarter results in February, and thank you for your support. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The GPC team finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, further building on the positive momentum of the first nine months of 2021. We are proud of our progress through the year and thankful to our 52,000 teammates for their hard work and ongoing commitment to excellence. With a tailwind of strong industry fundamentals, we executed on our key strategic priorities to accelerate sales, improved gross margin and enhanced operational efficiencies, which resulted in double-digit sales and earnings growth for both the quarter and full year. Our earnings growth and continued focus on working capital improvements also helped us to deliver strong cash flow. So just a tremendous effort by our global teams. They were laser-focused throughout the year and successfully navigated the ongoing challenges of the global supply chain, COVID disruptions and inflationary pressures. In early January, we successfully closed on our acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group, an industrial distributor of power transmission, automation and fluid power solutions. We are integrating this highly synergistic acquisition into our Motion business to enhance our scale and further strengthen our market-leading position. We are pleased to welcome the Kaman team to GPC and we look forward to creating significant shareholder value as a premier leader in industrial solutions. Turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Total sales were $4.8 billion, a 13% increase from last year with broad strength across all our businesses. We delivered our 17th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and our teams drove cost initiatives to enhance productivity and offset inflationary pressures. These efforts led to an 18% increase in the quarter in adjusted earnings per share. Total sales for the Global Automotive Group were $3.2 billion for the quarter, a 13% increase from 2020. On a comp basis, sales were up 11% from 2020 with our U.S. business posting the strongest year-over-year comps and each of our international operations achieving high single-digit sales comp. In addition, we experienced a steady sales cadence throughout the quarter with double-digit total sales increases in all three months. The ongoing economic recovery has led to strong customer demand. Improving miles driven, delays of new car production and rising used car prices are keeping more cars on the road longer, generating increased repairs and maintenance. Our strategic growth initiatives are proving effective as well. We continue to work closely with global suppliers to manage through product delays and logistical challenges to improve inventory availability. Additionally, our pricing actions have contributed positively to sales and maintain margins throughout the inflationary environment in the latter half of 2021. In the fourth quarter, we also added 130,000 SKUs to our e-catalog with the integration of Auto Accessories Garage. We were also pleased to expand our global store footprint with the addition of several bolt-on acquisitions. In total, we added more than 50 net new stores across our network, with most of these coming in the fourth quarter. Finally, as we look ahead to April, we are excited for the launch of the new AAA-branded premium battery. This battery will be available to all consumers with a focus on the 62 million AAA cardholders and 5,400 approved auto repair centers. Looking next, at our Automotive highlights by region. Total U.S. sales were up 15%, with comp sales up 13% from last year. In Canada, total sales were up 11% with comp sales up 9% from 2020. The growth in Canada was much improved from the third quarter as the easing of lockdowns drove strong demand throughout the end of the year. In the U.S., sales to both commercial and retail customers were up double-digits, with positive ticket and traffic counts for the fourth consecutive quarter. Likewise, sales were strong across a broad range of products with categories such as chassis, exhaust, brakes and ride control all outperforming. Our DIY business remains strong, trending well above historical growth rates for the past several quarters. While initially driven by the increase in DIY demand due to COVID, we have sustained that growth through a number of initiatives, including enhanced in-store merchandising, training and development, and the continued rollout of customer services such as AfterPay, which offers existing and new customers buy now, pay later option. This program is in 1,200 stores today and currently available for all online purchases. NAPA online B2C sales continue to be our fastest-growing sales channel, up over 40% in Q4 and 53% for the full year, a 3x increase from our 2019 volume. The strength in commercial sales was driven by high-teen growth to our major account partners and sales to our NAPA AutoCare Center customers were up low-teens. The surge in members continued through the fourth quarter, and we ended the year with nearly 18,000 NAPA AutoCare Centers, an increase of over 800 shops from 2020. Rounding out our commercial segments. Fleet, government and other wholesale customers posted low double-digit sales growth for the quarter, so strong results across all our commercial accounts. In Europe, our AAG team continued to perform well with total sales up 14% and comp sales up 7% from last year. Our team delivered solid results across each of our seven markets, with the UK and Benelux each posting 20%-plus growth. Our teams on the ground continue to expand our market share across all important key account segment as well as accelerating the rollout of NAPA-branded products. In addition, we are pleased to report our 2021 acquisitions of Winparts, an online provider of parts and accessories; and J&S, a multi-store operation based in Ireland, both are performing above expectations. In our Asia Pac business, total sales were up 11% from 2020, with comp sales up 9% from last year and up a strong 25% on a two-year stack. Both commercial and retail sales continue to perform well, with growth for the Repco and NAPA brands driven by accelerated digital strategy, NAPA store expansion and the Q4 reopening of key metro markets. So now, let's discuss the Global Industrial segment. Total sales for this group were $1.6 billion for the quarter, a 13% increase from last year, with comp sales up 12% from 2020. This is our third consecutive quarter of double-digit comps for this segment, driven by strong growth in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses. The sales cadence was consistent through the quarter with double-digit sales growth in all three months. The continued improvement in our Industrial sales trends reflects the benefits of our growth initiatives and ongoing strength of the industrial economy. Our Industrial team delivered positive sales growth across virtually all major product categories and industries we serve, including double-digit increases in the majority of our industry groups. These include sectors such as equipment and machinery, iron and steel, automotive and aggregate and cement, among others. Our Industrial team continues to execute several initiatives to drive profitable growth. Our omnichannel build-outs of accelerated e-commerce growth and is driving sales with new customers. We are encouraged by the incremental sales for our inside sales center and on motion.com. We have expanded our industrial services and value-add solutions capabilities in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. And our enhanced strategy to compete in a dynamic pricing environment provides us a competitive advantage while also helping us offset inflationary pressures. Our Motion team made tremendous progress with these initiatives in the quarter and the year, and we expect to make further progress again in 2022. In addition, we continue to look for strategic M&A opportunities to further boost our products and services offerings and expand our footprint. The added scale, presence and capabilities through the KDG acquisition is a great example, checking several boxes with its core power transmission and bearings business, and automation and fluid power industrial services and solutions. KDG's highly complementary growth and productivity strategies, product offering, and value-added services provide tremendous synergies and growth prospects. Our Motion team is actively bringing together the world-class talent and industrial expertise of these two organizations to build an even stronger business. In 2021, we remain focused on the positive impact of sustainable business practices. We updated our 2021 sustainability report, highlighting our progress in promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, and reducing the environmental impact of our operations. Today, we are in process of measuring our global emissions and building a strategy for targeted improvement. We will be sharing additional highlights as we move through 2022. Finally, as most of you are probably aware, we announced last month that Carol will be retiring in May after an exceptional 30-year career. As our CFO for the pastnine years, Carol's leadership and countless contributions were integral to the significant growth and strong financial performance of the company. She will be greatly missed by all of us. We were pleased to announce that Bert Nappier will be stepping in as our next CFO. Bert is a strategic financial executive with a diverse background spanning 25 years, including the past 16 years with FedEx serving most recently as EVP Finance and Treasurer. Bert has also served as President of FedEx Express Europe and CEO of TNT Express. We are confident Bert's strong financial background along with his extensive international experience will make him a great addition to the GPC team. Carol and Bert will work together over the next few months to ensure an orderly and seamless transition. Carol will be with us for our first quarter earnings call in April, and Bert will join us on the call as well. We look forward to introducing Bert to all of you in the months ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Will. Will? Will Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. As we reflect on 2021 and pivot to 2022, I'd like to reiterate Paul's comments and thank the global GPC teams for an amazing performance in 2021. Passion for our customers, a team approach and relentless hard work translated into impressive results. We're incredibly proud of the entire GPC team. We also want to thank our strategic suppliers who closely partner with us in a challenging environment. As we discussed entering 2021, we wanted to catapult out of 2020 to deliver a great year. We're proud that each of our global business units delivered exceeding initiative and annual financial commitment in 2021. Our strong global performance is a great example of the power of one GPC team. When we focus on key priorities and collectively execute as a team. We enter 2021 with a clear strategy and focused business mix. Across the company, we identified strategic initiatives to further simplify and integrate our operations. We do this to enable a better customer experience and move at a faster, more efficient team pace. Our 2021 plans are part of a strategic vision that extends our leadership positions in attractive, highly fragmented markets. As part of our vision, our foundational priorities remain talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, including data and digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Each business unit and functional teams are executing multiyear plans across these pillars. As Paul highlighted, 2021 offered numerous examples of great progress. Progress to simplify include our action to optimize facility footprints, realign team structures, offshore field support activities, reduce IT system complexity, streamline back-office processes, leverage shared global vendor relationships and centralized indirect sourcing activities to name a few. In each example, we reduced cost, increased efficiency and better positioned our business to scale growth. Our One GPC team approach enables us to leverage GPC's scale and create value together. As we simplify our customer experience continues to be at the center of our daily action, we continue to listen, understand and act. As an example, the US Automotive team revamped our Voice of Customer Program to create more actionable data-backed customer feedback. We've seen a 40% reduction in customer issue tickets, 50% reduction in time to resolution and 90% reduction in unresolved issues. Our long-term success starts first with talent and culture, attracting and promoting talent to lead high-performing diverse teams. We made impressive progress in 2021. A few examples include the addition of merchandising and supply chain leadership at US Automotive, technology leadership in North America Automotive, field leadership and sales promotions in North America Industrial and executive leadership promotions in Australia and Europe. Despite the challenging talent environment, we believe our recent progress supports the differentiated and inclusive employee value proposition GPC offers. As an example, in our Atlanta headquarter office, over 60% of our current teammates represent diverse talent and 75% of our new hires in 2021 represented diverse teammates. We are committed to our GPC culture advantage. Our sales effectiveness initiatives delivered exciting wins in 2021 as the teams achieved broad-based profitable growth. We make sure we adjust our resources and strategies to serve our customer segments profitably and efficiently. Examples of our actions include inside sales coverage, corporate account disciplines, digital marketing strategies, strategic promotional activities and feet on the street to name a few. We complement these selling efforts with data-backed pricing and sourcing initiatives to ensure we deliver profitable growth. Technology enables this disciplined approach to sales excellence. Our technology initiatives also delivered returns in 2021. In North America Automotive, we made progress across digital, store systems, supply chain and data platform initiatives. Examples include; enhancements for competitive pricing intelligence, customer relationship management tools, product catalog and site search, and customer-specific system integrations. We accelerated third-party technology partners that offer faster path to delivering new capabilities and impact. We also made good progress to standardize and simplify our foundational tech infrastructure. These investments support a seamless omnichannel customer experience and are enabling above-average growth across all our digital channels. We also made progress with supply chain initiatives. The challenging global supply chain reinforced our focus on operational productivity investments. Our investments in supply chain talent, inventory, technology, labor and freight productivity, facility automation and network optimization are gaining traction. Our focus on emerging technology accelerated in 2021 with talent, analytics, strategic planning and global teamwork. Examples of progress include commercial partnerships with emerging technology companies such as Arrival and Wallbox, focused partnerships with key strategic suppliers and merchandising strategies for existing EV repair needs, to name just a few. M&A execution was also active in 2021. We completed various U.S. automotive and international bolt-ons that extend leadership positions in key local markets. We closed the year with the announcement of the KDG acquisition, which extends the market-leading position of our North American industrial platform. As Paul mentioned, the integration efforts are well underway and we remain bullish on the outlook for the combined business and the synergy plans. As we pivot to 2022, we have the same level of focus. Our 2022 priorities remain unchanged, as we look to continue the momentum. The global GPC teams have a strong resolve to take on uncontrollable challenges. And we're confident in our ability to continue to remain agile and earn success. Before I turn it over to Carol, I'd like to acknowledge her amazing career at GPC. Carol, on behalf of the extended team, we appreciate all you have done for GPC and for all our GPC stakeholders over the years. With that, I'll turn it over to Carol to detail the financials. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on quarterly and full year adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes the unusual items outlined in our press release. Recapping revenues, total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 13% from 2020. For the full year, sales were $18.9 billion, up 14%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 35.3%, a 30 basis point improvement compared to the fourth quarter last year. For the year, gross margin improved 70 basis points to 35.2% versus last year. For the quarter and the full year, our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives due to strong sales volumes and the ongoing positive impact of strategic category management initiatives. Our total operating and non-operating expenses were $1.36 billion in the fourth quarter, up 14% from 2020 and at 28% of sales. For the year, these expenses are $5.31 billion, up 13% and also at 28% of sales. The increase in expenses for the quarter and the full year primarily reflect the increase in variable costs on our strong sales growth, including the impact of higher incentive compensation. In addition, we experienced inflationary cost pressures in areas such as base wages, freight and health insurance. And finally, our prior year results included benefits of temporary savings related to the pandemic. Our permanent cost savings achieved in 2020 helped to offset rising costs and difficult year-over-year comparisons. And as we've shared today and throughout the year, we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives to further reduce our expenses and to improve our operational efficiencies. This will be important in managing through the continuing inflationary pressures on costs in 2022. Our segment profit in the fourth quarter was $420 million, up 12% and our segment profit margin was 8.7% compared to 8.8% last year. This slight decline was expected and primarily reflects the impact of prior year temporary savings and the year-over-year increase in incentive compensation. Our 8.7% margin reflects a 100 basis point improvement from 2019. For the full year, segment profit was $1.7 billion, up 24% on a 14% sales increase and our segment profit margin was 8.8% compared to 8.2% last year, a 60 basis point increase from 2020 and 100 basis points from 2019. This represents our strongest full year segment profit margin since 2000. So we're very pleased with the improvement in margin and the tremendous work by our teams. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.6% compared to 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020, with the decrease in rate primarily related to a geographic shift in income. For the year, our tax rate was 24.9% compared to 24.5% in the prior year and primarily due to the increase in certain international tax rates throughout the year. Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations on both a reported and adjusted basis was $256 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.79. This compares to $221 million or $1.52 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year or an 18% increase. For the full year, reported net income was $899 million or $6.23 per share, and adjusted net income was $997 million or $6.91 per share, a 31% increase from 2020. So now turning to our fourth quarter results by segment. Total Automotive revenue was $3.2 billion, up 13% from last year. Our segment profit increased 11% to $266 million, with profit margin at 8.3%. While down 20 basis points from 2020 due to higher incentive compensation and the prior year benefit of temporary savings, this represents a 110 basis point margin improvement over 2019 and reflects the strong underlying progress in our operations. For the year, profit margin was 8.6% up 60 basis points from 2020 and up 100 basis points from 2019. Our Industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 13% from 2020. Our segment profit of $154 million was up 15% from a year ago, and profit margin improved to a strong 9.5%, up 20 basis points from 2020 and up 90 basis points from 2019. For the full year, profit margin for this segment is 9.4%, up 90 basis points from 2020 and up 130 basis points from 2019. So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. At December 31, our total accounts receivable were up 15%, primarily due to the increase in sales and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory was up 11%, a function of the sales increase and our commitment to having the right parts in the right place at the right time. Accounts payable increased 16% from 2020 due to the increase in inventory and extended payment terms with our global suppliers. Our AP-to-inventory ratio improved to 124% from 118% in the prior year. Our total debt at December 31 is $2.4 billion, down 10% from December of 2020. We closed the fourth quarter with available liquidity of $2.2 billion, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.4 times from 1.9 times in 2020. In early January this year, we issued $1 billion in new public debt in connection with the KDG acquisition. This consisted of a three-year $500 million bond at a 1.75% interest rate and 10-year $500 million bonds at a 2.75% rate. This raises our total debt to approximately $3.4 billion and our forecasted debt-to-EBITDA to 1.8 times, which is well within our targeted range and maintains our investment-grade rating. We generated $250 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter, and our earnings growth and working capital drove $1.3 billion in cash from operations for the full year. Our free cash flow was $992 million. For the year, capital expenditures totaled $266 million for a broad range of investments such as supply chain projects at our distribution centers, including automation and other equipment for added efficiencies, digital initiatives and IT systems and software development. We will continue to reinvest in our business to drive organic growth and to improve the productivity in our operations in 2022. We also invested $284 million of cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth. These investments primarily consisted of various automotive store groups across our geographies as well as online and Internet businesses, which provides us with expanded market coverage and a high return on investment. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions in both the Automotive and Industrial segments, and we look forward to the benefits of the Kaman Distribution acquisition. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1948. And in 2021, we paid total cash dividends of approximately $466 million. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.58 per share annual dividend for 2022, representing our 66th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 10% increase from the $3.26 per share paid in 2021. Additionally, we have an active share buyback program dating back to 1994. In the fourth quarter, we used $50 million to purchase 400,000 shares. And for the year, we used $334 million to purchase 2.6 million shares. As of December 31, we were authorized to repurchase up to 11.9 million shares, and we continue to be active in this program in 2022. So turning to our outlook for 2022. We expect total sales for 2022 to be in the range of plus 9% to plus 11%. These growth rates include an estimated 2% headwind from foreign currency translation and exclude the benefit of any future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, including plus 5% to plus 7% comp sales growth which is before the impact of acquisitions and FX. And a total sales increase of plus 20% to plus 22% for the Industrial segment which includes the addition of KDG and a 4% to 6% comp sales increase. On the earnings side, we currently expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.45 to $7.60 and this represents an 8% to 10% increase compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2021. So that's my financial update. And throughout the quarter and full year, our teams were focused on driving strong sales, improved margins, exceptional cash flow, and they delivered on every count. We're thankful for all the great work by our teammates. And as we move forward in the new year, there is tremendous momentum in our businesses. We look forward to reporting on our first quarter 2022 performance in April. As Paul mentioned earlier, the April earnings call will be my last as CFO. It was a difficult decision to retire from the company that I love, but the timing was right, and we're in capable hands with a talented team in place to support Bert. He is well qualified and his experience and skills make him the right person to serve as our next CFO. I'm excited to work with Bert over the next few months to ensure a smooth transition. Thank you and I'll now turn it back over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol. With the fourth quarter now behind us, we can safely say that 2021 was an exceptional year for GPC. Throughout the year, our team focused on advancing the strategic priorities for our global Automotive and industrial businesses. With the backdrop of our multiyear portfolio optimization strategy, the economic recovery and strong industry fundamentals, we generated double-digit sales and earnings growth and significantly improved our profit margin. We are proud of our strong financial performance and the many accomplishments of the GPC team. Our results drove strong cash flow, which further supported our balance sheet strength. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be investing for enhanced productivity and growth through capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. In total, we were pleased to effectively deploy $1.35 billion for these key priorities in 2021. So now turning to 2022, we are confident in our plans for accelerated growth and profitability as we build on the underlying momentum in both our Automotive and Industrial operations, and realize the benefits from our acquisition of KDG. We are well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth plans and provide for disciplined, value-creating capital allocation, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you. We thank you for your interest in and support of GPC, and we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering a terrific year for GPC. So with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, sir. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Just -- I guess, Paul, my question is, given the different levels of openness that we've seen in various states and geographies, have you seen a lot of variability in sales cadence across your business? And then related to that, does the Industrial segment also experienced regional variability or sales variance is usually driven just by end market activity? Thanks. Paul Donahue : Hey, thanks, Scot. And hey, Scot, welcome back. Glad to have you back on the call. What I would tell you about US Automotive, Scot, when I go through region-by-region, first off, every region in Q4 was up double digit, which I don't recall that in a number of years. Both coasts were the strongest. When I look at the East Coast, up and down the East Coast, from Atlantic, Northeast, Southeast, all strong, West, really strong. But even that, it's hard to single out one of our regions, all were up double digits. So really, really terrific performance up and down. On the Industrial side, again, double-digit increases every month in Q4. And we really don't see much regionality on the Industrial side, either. It was, again, every region performed extremely well. And I will tell you, Scot, I couldn't be more proud of our team. In a pretty challenging environment, the increases they delivered were just outstanding. Scot Ciccarell : And then Paul, when you assess the growth that you're also seeing in a bunch of your international markets, are there any nuances about the US market that might be a little bit different than international, whether it's rate of increase of used vehicle prices, et cetera, that is continuing to boost the US a little bit higher than what we're seeing here nationally right now? Paul Donahue : Well, I would -- I guess what I would call out, Scot, if you look and compare the US and let's call out Europe. Europe is such a dominant DIFM market, 90% to 95% of our business in Europe is DIFM. So very, very little DIY business. And as we all know, we really saw the DIY segment spike during COVID and with all the monies that were being pushed out into the marketplace to consumers. So -- but I would also tell you Scot, we're seeing a bit more supply chain challenges in US Automotive than we're seeing either in Australia or Europe. So that would certainly be a callout. But look, again, I'm really pleased to tell you that while the US Automotive group led the way, we saw once again really strong performance in both Europe and Asia Pac as well. Scot Ciccarell : Excellent. Thanks a lot, guys. Paul Donahue : Yes. Thanks, Scot. Operator : The next question comes from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Horvers : Thanks and good morning and congratulations, Carol, on your retirement. It's been a pleasure working with you all of these years. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Chris. Christopher Horvers : My first question is a bit of a follow-up to Scot. As you think about 2022, how do you think about the relative comp potential in the different geographies in the NAPA business? And then specifically in the US, how are you thinking about your DIY business relative to the commercial business? Do you think DIY could be up? Obviously, you're very heavily weighted towards the commercial side. Paul Donahue : Yes. So let me just clarify, Chris. When you talk about the different geographies, are you talking different geographies in the US or US compared to Europe and Asia Pac? Christopher Horvers : Yes, the global regions. Paul Donahue : Yes. So as we look at our outlook for 2022, we're -- our expectation is we're going to continue to see solid growth across all of our markets. And I would tell you that while it's very early, we're six weeks into the year, we are seeing those trends carry over from 2021 into 2022. So -- but overall, our expectation is that we come in the year in all of our markets, somewhere in that five to seven range, which has kind of been our historical targets. So, -- but it certainly could be a bit stronger than that here in the U.S. And then your question, Chris, around DIY and DIFM -- and you mentioned it, our strength is certainly DIFM, and we had a terrific year in DIFM in 2021, both our NAPA AutoCare Center business, our major account business, our fleet business, all up double-digit. Our DIY business performed very well again. But we always remind ourselves, we're coming off a really small base. But I think some of the actions that our team has taken over the last couple of years in terms of really improving our store assortments, our store training, our hours all has really gone a long way in spiking our retail business. And we expect that to continue really strong as well. Christopher Horvers : And then, just as a follow-up to that, did you see -- you lapped through but just stimulus in January for the consumer. Did the DIY business see pressure during that period? Likewise, did it come down? Paul Donahue : Not at all, not at all which gives me a lot of confidence as we move throughout the year. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then, my last -- I have a ton of questions, but my last question here is, did you talk about what the inflation was in NAPA and in Motion in the fourth quarter? And how you're thinking about 2022? Carol Yancey : Yeah. Happy to, look at that. When we look at Q4, and again, it was similar to what we alluded to when we came out of Q3 that it was certainly a little bit heavier in the quarter with a mid-single digit for Global Automotive and a little bit stronger, obviously, on the U.S. Automotive than International Automotive, giving us around a 3% for the full year. And it was low-single digit for Global Industrial. Again, theirs was pretty normal throughout the year. As we look ahead, we certainly see a planned carryover impact from Q3 and Q4 going into 2022. So we think first half 2022 will be similar to what we saw coming out of second half 2021. And then it moderates into the second half. So again, a bit stronger in the U.S. Automotive but -- and more normal in our international Automotive and Industrial, so you may see something like around a 3%-ish or again, a bit more than that in the U.S., and that's what we're contemplating in our 2022 numbers. Christopher Horvers : Got it. Thank you very much. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Chris. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ethan Huntley : Hey. Good morning. This is Ethan Huntley on for Bret. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just one here, surrounding market share within the Automotive Segment, I know one of your peers mentioned sort of taking price in an effort to gain share. Can you just sort of comment on sort of general industry dynamics you're seeing there and what you expect to see from a market share standpoint? Paul Donahue : Yeah. Sure, happy to, Evan. We -- look, we have historically had a very rational environment across the automotive aftermarket in the U.S. And honestly, we don't expect that to shift in a dramatic way one way or the other. But that said, I would tell you that our teams are always looking at prices across the markets and market dynamics, and we'll look down to the SKU level and category level. But I would tell you at this point, Evan, we're focused on our actions. We intend to take good care of our customers. And we'll continue to compete in the marketplace on certainly, our NAPA product quality, our availability and really our great people that we've got in our stores and just continuing to deliver outstanding customer service to all of our great customers. Ethan Huntley : Great. That's helpful. And then just lastly here, on the European NAPA private label business, can you just sort of touch on how that's going? Are you sort -- continuing to see strong traction there and then maybe how inventory is faring related to the private label business? Paul Donahue : Yes. Maybe Will and I tag team that. I would just give you from a high-level view, and we were over in Europe with the team a couple of weeks ago, the NAPA rollout continues very strong. As you may know, we kicked it off in the UK a couple of years ago. And we've now rolled out a number of product categories. We continue to expand into new product categories. So we're in chassis, brakes. We're looking at launching oil, have launched oil, steering calipers, toolboxes. So we continue to expand the offering, but we're also expanding into new markets. So we've gone beyond the UK into France. We've launched now Germany, Netherlands, and continues to perform very, very well. So I don't know, Will, is there anything you would add? Will Stengel : No. I would just say from an inventory perspective, we continue to feel good about having access to product in all of the markets that we're rolling now. So, continued success and exciting outlook for the future. Ethan Huntley : Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. So Carol thanks for all the help, and I'm going to ask you for a little more help. Carol Yancey : Okay. Thanks. Greg Melich : On SG&A, I mean if the dollars grew a lot, and I know you mentioned wage pressure, new bases there, incentive comp, et cetera. How should we think about SG&A leverage this year or not, other initiatives to sort of help offset that inflation as you look at your guidance? Carol Yancey : Yes. I mean, look, Q4 -- and again, Q4 SG&A, we knew going into this quarter that we had a fair amount of headwinds. The temporary cost savings last year, roughly $40 million, mean that was almost 90 basis points on our SG&A in the quarter. The increase in incentive compensation was meaningful similar to the temporary cost savings. That was a meaningful number. And then just the normal inflationary pressures, which we called out in Q3 and continued into Q4, on wages and freight, really, freight was certainly a big headwind for us. And then, we've got investments in projects and technology supply chain. But on the tailwind side, I mean, again, I would call out our strong leverage with our strong growth and being able to leverage better than we have in the past. And then the ongoing benefit of our initiatives. So we continue to have terrific initiatives. There was a lot of puts and takes, but ultimately, we had a better year in our SG&A than what we started off with, and the teams have done a terrific job in a really tight labor market and really having to do more with less. And again, as we look ahead into 2022 and your comments, we are implying certainly operating margin improvement, and we would expect to hold on to our gross margin rate in a highly inflationary environment and have initiatives that may even bring that up a bit. And at the same time, we think we're going to get some improvement in SG&A as we go into 2022, and that's coming off of our initiatives. Greg Melich : That's a great summary. And then I guess my follow-up was, I don't care if it was Paul or Will, but I think in the prepared comments, you mentioned that supply chain is tougher in the US than rest of world. So I just love some more commentary on it. Like why is that? And why do you think that -- is it going to persist? Will Stengel : Yeah, Greg, it's largely a function of just the logistics of the global freight. And so if you think about the port congestion out on the West Coast, that's probably the most elevated area that's congested. So that's largely why we would describe it as more affected than Europe and just the magnitude of the volume of the products coming in through US and North America. So -- we're encouraged by cautiously optimistic, I should say, about what we're seeing in all things, global supply chain. Good news is it's being driven by good underlying growth and demand. The factories internationally seem to be handling that volume better. As I mentioned, the congestion at the ports is still something that is being slowly addressed with some work to do, but moving in the right direction. And then obviously, the cost of moving product around the world continues to be elevated relative to historical average. And so we'll continue to work through that as well. So cautiously optimistic as we look through into 2022. Paul Donahue : And hey, Greg, I would just add to that, that we haven't seen the degradation in supply chain on the industrial side. Our industrial fill rates have, throughout this past 18 months or so, have remained pretty good, certainly better than what we've seen on the US Automotive side. So our challenge has largely relegated to US Automotive. But as Will said, we are beginning to see an uptick in our fill rates across most of our major suppliers. And look, we know our supplier partners, they have got challenges as it relates to COVID and labor and material shortages. So they're doing all they can for us. And we do believe with our size and scale, that if anybody is going to get product in this environment, it will be Genuine Parts Company. Greg Melich : That\u2019s great. Good luck guys. Paul Donahue : Thanks. Will Stengel : Thanks, Greg. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot. Good morning and congrats on your retirement, Carol. Carol Yancey : Thank you very much. Seth Basham : I have a follow-up question to the comment you just made, Paul. Just thinking about the supply dynamics for a lot of the smaller regional competitors in the US auto aftermarket business, how do you think the competitive environment can change as supply chain challenges ease, those players get more products? Do you think that it becomes more price competitive? Paul Donahue : No, I don't think so, Seth. I mean, look, if you go back -- and I've been at this a long time in this automotive aftermarket, price has never been the primary driver in the automotive aftermarket, Seth. And as I think I mentioned earlier, we focus on just putting out a great product, a quality product, having it available when our customers want it, delivering an incredibly fast fashion, having great people on the ground. And then, yes, you've got to have a competitive price on top of it. But certainly, price is not going to be the number one driver nor has it ever been in the automotive aftermarket. Seth Basham : Understood. Okay. Thank you. And then I have a separate follow-up question around KDG. Can you just give us a sense of what the contribution you're anticipating is in terms of sales and EPS from the acquisition in 2022? Carol Yancey : Yes. I'll walk through that. I mean, again, as we talked about on our December conference call with KDG, I mean, the sales of roughly $1.1 billion, our guidance of 21% to 22% and the core growth of 5% to 6%, the balance of that is KDG. So we've kind of given you the 5% to 6% with KDG being the difference there. And again, similar to what we gave you in December with the EBITDA margin, again, you're talking about in the 8% to 9% range. What you have to think about, and again, I've implied that and we've got segment operating profit improvement going into next year, both with and without Kaman, when you roll it all the way down to net profit and EPS, as we've talked about earlier, you have to take into account the incremental interest expense as well as the intangible amortizations. And again, it's early in the process, obviously, the pace of synergies is the significant driver here based on where we are now and what we know, that's all sort of rolling up to roughly a $0.10 impact for this year. But again, we're only six weeks in on the synergies, really highly encouraged by what the teams are going to do. But again, we do have the implied operating margin improvement in those numbers. Paul Donahue : Hey, Seth, I would just add to that. We are very, very encouraged what we're seeing in the early days. As Carol mentioned, we're six weeks in, but the team is out of the blocks strong. We've met with the majority of our key customers, our key suppliers in this first six weeks. The team has put an incredible amount of effort. They got a great plan in place, and we're excited with having the Kaman team as a part of GPC and we know they're going to deliver great things for us in the next few years. Seth Basham : Got it. Thank you very much and good luck. Paul Donahue : Thanks. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Seth. Operator : The next question comes from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hopped on late, but I hope that I -- didn't address this already. But I wanted to ask just on the status, obviously, your fill rates seem to be getting better, and you guys have improved that supply chain through the back half of the year. What do you guys do with the biggest risks from here to your supply chain? And related to that, one of your peers has talked more about direct sourcing straight from the Far East, kind of end rounding some of the suppliers. Would love to hear your thoughts around that strategy and potential. Would that be something GPC looks to do that expands margins or how you weigh the pros and cons of that strategy? Thanks. Will Stengel : Hey, Daniel, I'll hit the first piece of your question in terms of biggest risk, and Paul will maybe come on behind my comments. But I think the biggest risk is talent, and it's more a internal risk just having the talent into buildings to handle the increased product flow as we recover. We've talked a lot about the labor market and having access to people in the buildings, drivers, et cetera. So from our perspective, making sure that we continue to build on all the great momentum and progress we're making around all things people and making sure that we're staffed up on our end to handle the improving volume. Paul Donahue : Yes. And Daniel, I'll just mention that, look, we've been on the ground with a full team in place in Shenzhen, China now for the better part of a decade. And we're sourcing product today, direct sourcing product for all of our automotive businesses around the world. We go to the same factories. We consolidate our purchases between Europe, Asia Pac and the US. So we've been there for the better part of a decade, and it's worked extremely well for us. Daniel Imbro : Great. And so the relationships with the suppliers, you still have polisher reads, those are value-added and where you direct source where you could direct stores you already do? Paul Donahue : That's correct. Daniel Imbro : Perfect. That's helpful. And then again, I apologize if you addressed this and not to get too near-term focused, but just think about Europe, the two-year stack did slow a bit on the auto side. Obviously, Europe had some pretty strict shutdowns with COVID through the fourth quarter. Just curious what you're seeing in that market and whether some countries are maybe outperforming as they reopen or any competitive changes? We've heard anecdotes of smaller competitors closing over there. So just curious how you're thinking about that market into 2022 and 2023? Paul Donahue : Yes. So Daniel, we're in seven different markets across Europe, including the UK. The UK and Benelux countries were our strongest performers in 2021. And really continue to deliver. The UK was also our initial launch point for our NAPA-branded product. So they've got a bit of a head start on the rest of Europe. All seven countries are positive, and we certainly expect that trend to continue into 2022. We've got a great team on the ground in Europe, and we're very bullish on the outlook for our business there. Daniel Imbro : Got it. Thanks so much for the color and best of luck Paul Donahue : You bet. Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one more question by Liz Suzuki from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thanks for letting me on and I'll add my congratulations to you, Carol. It's been great working with you over the last decade. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Liz. Liz Suzuki : So you guys have done some meaningful M&A recently and then your more standard tuck-in acquisitions. And would you categorize the M&A environment broadly as more attractive now than it has been for the last two years? Just with a lot of disruption in the market from inflation and supply chain constraints without the support of PPP loans that I think may have helped some of your smaller competitors during the height of COVID. Will Stengel : Yes, Liz, I think we would agree with that statement. The M&A pipeline continues to be very active. I think GPC and both on the Automotive and Industrial side of the business continues to be viewed as an acquirer of choice. And I think scale matters and especially in times where there's kind of an uncertain environment, joining the market-leading businesses and becoming part of the family is a pretty exciting proposition. So we expect that to continue and continue the good amount of activity that we've seen over the last 12 to 24 months. Liz Suzuki : Great. And I'll just tack on one more, which is, if you could just talk a little bit about the partnership with Wallbox. I mean, is this going to be an exclusive relationship where NAPA is the destination for the PULSAR plus and is this -- is the audience for these charges primarily the DIY customer, or will you have an opportunity to sell the dealerships and other large accounts as well? Will Stengel : Yes. It's a exciting opportunity for us. It\u2019s not an exclusive relationship but it does have implications for both DIY and DIFM. And I think it's a real good example on kind of the opportunity that NAPA has to extend its business model. And so we talked about Arrival, we talked about Wallbox. But whether it's charging stations, service of the future, et cetera, we're excited about it and -- what it's also doing is creating a lot of buzz and momentum with other strategic partnerships. So, the discussions are active and the pipeline for more of these is pretty robust. So we're excited about it and looking forward. It's early days, but looking forward to what it could do for the business. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thanks very much. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Liz. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We'd like to thank you for your interest and participation in our fourth quarter and year-end earnings. We appreciate your support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to reporting out our first quarter results in April. Thank you, and have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sid Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Will Stengel, our President; Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bert Nappier, our EVP and CFO-Elect. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call and webcast includes a slide presentation that can be found on the Genuine Parts Company Investor Relations\u2019 website. Please be advised this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today\u2019s discussion of our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today\u2019s call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its\u2019 businesses. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company\u2019s latest SEC filings, including this morning\u2019s press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. As Sid mentioned, we\u2019re happy to have Bert Nappier on the call with us today. Bert joined us on February 28 as CFO-Elect and has been working side by side with Carol to ensure a smooth transition in this key role. Turning to the first quarter, we were pleased with the continued strength and our results to start the year and we\u2019re proud of the great work by all of our 52,000 GPC teammates who are at the core of our success. A few highlights in the quarter include new quarterly sales records for GPC and our automotive and industrial segment, segment margin expansion of 50 basis points, strong double-digit EPS growth and a strengthened balance sheet and strong cash flow. The GPC team is focused on key strategic priorities to sustain accelerated sales growth, improved gross margins and enhanced operational efficiencies in the face of ongoing supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures at levels we haven\u2019t seen in 40 plus years. We also executed on our acquisition strategy and our industrial team made excellent progress on the integration of Kaman Distribution Group. And with the addition of Lausan, which we announced last week, we\u2019ve expanded our automotive footprint in Europe, with the entry into key markets in Spain and Portugal, Europe\u2019s fifth largest market. For the first quarter, total sales were 5.3 billion, a 19% increase from last year. We delivered our 18th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and our teams drove cost initiatives to enhance productivity and offset inflationary pressures. All in adjusted earnings per share were up 24%, representing our seventh straight quarter of double digit EPS growth. Total sales for global automotive were 3.3 billion for the quarter, and 11% increase from 2021 and representing 62% of total company\u2019s sales. On a comp basis, sales were up 10% driven by low double digit comps in the US and Canada and high single digit sales comps in Europe and Australasia. This sales cadence through the quarter was relatively steady with our strongest performance coming in the month of March with our team\u2019s posting a 30 plus percent increase on a two years stack. Our pricing actions have contributed positively to sales. And we have maintained our gross margins despite mid-single digit inflation for the quarter. As we look ahead, we believe the sales environment continues to support our pricing actions and we expect current levels of inflation to continue through at least the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, our strongest Q1 comps were in North America. In Canada, the continued reopening of the economy drove strong demand, and a 14% increase in total sales, with comp sales up 13%. In the US, total sales were up 14.5%, with comp sales up 12% from last year. These results reflect strengthening trends on our two year stacks for both markets. In the US, sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive, with double-digit commercial sales growth outperforming DIY. In addition, ticket and traffic counts were both positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. Sales were strong across a number of product categories such as brakes, heating and cooling, and chassis. DIY sales continue to trend well above historical growth rates with enhanced in-store merchandising, improved product assortment, and our digital initiatives all driving solid growth. NAPA online continues to be our fastest growing sales channel, up nearly 50% from last year. In addition, our AfterPay payments service, which offers existing and new customers buy now pay later option has been well received by consumers and is driving higher basket sizes. We have launched AfterPay in other global markets and we are excited to see the growth generated from this new service, both online and in-store. The strength in commercial sales was driven by double-digit growth across the majority of our customer segment. Sales to our major account partners, NAPA auto care centers, fleet, government, and other wholesale customers were all strong, driven by the continued strength and demand for commercial repairs and maintenance. Our sales teams were also effective in attracting new business with national and regional accounts, fleets and auto care accounts, so an outstanding job by our teams and strong results across all our commercial accounts. Furthering our commitment to the commercial segment, we are excited to return to the classroom with in-person training for our auto technicians across the industry. NAPA Auto Tech provides industry leading virtual online and classroom training programs as a value added service for over 50,000 technicians each year. We are particularly proud to have more than 2000 new techs in our accredited training program. Our European operations also had a strong start to the year with total sales up 14% and comp sales up 7% from last year. These results reflect solid growth across each of our seven European markets, and are especially impressive given the headwinds of a mild winter across Europe. Our AAG team continues to drive share gains through key account expansion and the continued rollout of NAPA branded products. As announced last week, we expanded our presence into key markets in Spain and Portugal with the addition of Lausan. Lausan is a leading distributor of automotive aftermarket parts based in Bilbao, Spain, with a nationwide footprint including one national distribution center, and nine regional DC servicing over 14,000 customer partners and key account. With our entree into Spain and Portugal, both highly fragmented markets, we expect to further strengthen Lausan\u2019s market-leading position by capitalizing on our European scale and purchasing expertise as well as leveraging our NAPA brand. We welcome the Lausan team to the GPC family and we are excited to work together to maximize the growth opportunities in our European business. In our Asia Pac business, total sales were up 10% from 2021 with comp sales up 8% and the strongest two years sales tax across our automotive operations. This represents a terrific start to 2022, despite the headwinds posed by the COVID outbreak and severe flooding during the quarter. Both commercial and retail sales continue to perform well with growth for the Repco and NAPA brands driven by the increased demand and share gains from accelerated digital strategies and store expansion. With 2022 representing Repco\u2019s 100th anniversary, it\u2019s only fitting the Asia Pac team would have a standout year. So now let\u2019s discuss the Global Industrial segment. Total sales for this group were 2 billion for the quarter, a 34% increase from last year and representing 38% of total GPC sales. On a comp basis, which excludes KDG, sales were up 16%, representing our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit comps, driven primarily by the strong growth in our North American business. The sales cadence strengthened throughout the quarter with March being the strongest of the three months. The strong sales momentum in our industrial business reflects the benefits of our many growth initiatives and continued strength of the industrial economy, as evidenced by the PMI and industrial production indices. PMI has consistently held at expansionary levels of 57 or above every month since October of 2020 and industrial production was up 8% in the first quarter, its strongest year-over-year growth since the fourth quarter of 2020. Our industrial team is executing on its sales programs to accelerate organic growth, and delivered positive sales growth across every major product category and industry served with most up double digits. As mentioned earlier, our industrial team made excellent progress on the integration of KDG. While Will is going to go into greater detail in a few moments, I would summarize by saying that we are on plan in generating expected synergies. Wrapping up our industrial review, our strong first quarter results gives us confidence in our growth plans and pricing actions and we enter the second quarter with strong momentum. We expect continued healthy activity levels across the vast majority of our products and industries. Finally, it\u2019s important to add that we have been busy in 2022 building on our commitment to responsible ESG business practices. Our focus areas in 2022 include formalizing our carbon emission reduction strategy, and establishing reduction targets as well as driving continued progress in DE&I. We will provide additional details and report on our progress in these areas in our 2022 sustainability report later this year.  So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Will. Will? Will Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to echo Paul\u2019s comments and thank the global GPC teams for the impressive start to 2022. The teams did a great job during the quarter and built on the strong finish to 2021. As we traveled and visited the global operations during the quarter, the team energy is positive. There\u2019s a strong sense of focus and alignment and it\u2019s encouraging to see the broad base strength across the business. Our discussion centered around performance trends, initiative progress, talent, and finding better ways to serve our customers. Global supply chain and inflation challenges are common topics and all are doing an excellent job to respond. The in-flight strategic initiatives continued to deliver impact. Our foundational priorities are talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, including data and digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Strategic M&A complements our initiatives.  We added to our talent momentum during the quarter. In addition to Bert joining the team, we welcome Jeff England as EVP, Chief Supply Chain Officer of the US Automotive business. Jeff joins us following an impressive career over nearly two decades at Walmart. He will lead end-to-end supply chain execution for us automotive and brings discipline strategic leadership and relevant expertise. We\u2019re excited to have him on the team. During our travels, we had the chance to meet with the Canadian automotive leadership team in person for the first time in two years. As Paul mentioned, the Canadian economy is showing encouraging signs of strength, as it reopens from prolonged lockdowns and our Canadian team is well-positioned with detailed market-level plans to capture the growth. We also traveled to Australia where we visited locations and performed deep dive initiative reviews. Like Canada, this was the first time in over two years, the extended GPC and Australian leadership team was together in person. GPC Asia Pac continues to capture market share with its differentiated customer value propositions, new store rollouts, and unique digital and brand strategies, all of which are delivering winning profitable growth. We look forward to celebrating the 100th year anniversary with the GPC Asia Pac team later this year. In both Australia and Canada, sales effectiveness initiatives focused on market density, data and analytics, and customer loyalty are proving effective. Our technology initiatives are building momentum. The teams are gaining positive traction in our efforts across B2B digital, inventory store systems, payments, and workforce management platforms. We continue to invest in diverse engineering talent across the technology organization, and evolve our operating approach to leverage common solutions around the globe. Our supply chain initiatives are advancing well. In the quarter we visited with various US automotive DC leadership teams in the mid Atlantic region, where we walked facilities, assessed operational performance, and thanked the teams. Our US automotive distribution facilities are working hard to process strong demand, despite challenging supply chain and labor dynamics. We also spend time with our industrial business and met with the extended Motion leadership team. We reviewed the successes of our fulfillment center and network optimization effort in Florida. The strategy improved service levels, enhances product depth, and reduces duplicative fixed costs. Similarly, while in Australia, we received an encouraging update on the traction of network and automation investments in New Zealand and Victoria. In each example, our supply chain investments improved the customer experience and enhanced operating productivity. Our emerging technology initiatives made progress in the quarter as well. We hosted our first emerging tech supplier council session with various automotive partners to learn from each other and explore opportunities. We executed various targeted inventory strategies to serve current EV market needs, rolled out marketing efforts, added dedicated emerging tech talent, and advanced numerous emerging tech commercial partnership discussions across Europe, Canada, and the US. M&A bolt on execution continues to be active. We remain focused on adding density to existing priority markets entering complementary strategic geographies and/or adding new product expertise or capabilities. The KDG integration and synergy efforts are ahead of plan. The dedicated integration team is executing a disciplined playbook to deliver value. The feedback from teammates, customers, and vendors continues to be extremely positive. The executive leadership functional and field operating structures are already realigned, and the teams are working well together as one motion team. As an example, the team rebranded the combined fluid power offering to Motion fluid power solutions. Based on Motion\u2019s existing vendor relationships, we onboard over 20 new strategic fluid power supplier relationships, which added 2 million SKUs to our offering, ultimately giving our customers more choice, and our vendor partners and sales teams more opportunity to deliver growth. The team also realigned our automation and robotics business under the Motion AI, or Motion Automation Intelligence brand, which now creates a $500 million leading national automation platform. We are really pleased with the early momentum of the integration efforts and are excited about the value creation outlook. In summary, our travels during the quarter reinforce that our initiatives are well defined, and the teams are focused to execute. Our people care about serving our customers, always impressed with their deep expertise and are energized to deliver results.  Before I turn it over to Carol, I\u2019d like to again acknowledge her amazing career at GPC. Carol, on behalf of the extended team, we thank you for all you\u2019ve done for GPC and for all our GPC stakeholders over the years.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Carol to detail the financials. Carol? Carol Yancey : Thank you, Will. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. We\u2019re very pleased with our strong financial performance in the first quarter. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focused on our quarterly adjusted results which exclude the transaction and other costs related to the acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group, as outlined in our press release.  Total GPC sales were 5.3 billion in the first quarter, up 830 million or 19% from last year. Our gross margin for the quarter was 34.6%, a 10 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter last year, primarily driven by the positive impact of strategic category management initiatives in areas such as pricing and global sourcing. These gains were partially offset by slight headwinds from supplier incentives, shifts in business mix, foreign currency and the timing of inflation in certain product categories.  Our total operating and non-operating expenses were 1.4 8 billion, up 18% from 2021 and at 27.9% of sales compared to 28.1% of sales last year. Double digit comp sales growth in the first quarter drove SG&A expense leverage, despite the ongoing inflationary pressures in areas such as wages and freight. Our teams are focused on executing our strategic initiatives to further reduce expenses and drive operational efficiencies.  With our strong sales and improvement in gross margin and SG&A, segment profit was 453 million, up 25%, and our segment profit margin was 8.6%, a 50 basis point increase from last year. Our tax rate was 24.5% compared to 23.8% in the first quarter of 2021. With the increase in rate due to several factors, including the impact of prior year gains on the sale of real estate and geographic shifts in income. First quarter adjusted net income was 266 million with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.86. This compares to 218 million or $1.50 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 24%; really solid work across our global teams to achieve this strong growth in the first quarter. So turning to our first quarter results by segment. Total automotive revenue was 3.3 billion, up 11% from last year. Segment profit was 265 million, up 12% with profit margin at 8.1%, a 10 basis point improvement from 2021 and up 120 basis points from 2019. Our industrial sales were 2 billion in the quarter, up 34% from 2021. Segment profit of 188 million was up a strong 50% from a year ago and profit margin improved to 9.3%, up 100 basis points from 2021 and up 180 basis points from 2019. This margin improvement reflects the benefits of strong sales growth and strategic initiatives in areas such as category management and pricing. In addition, the industrial team is also advancing their plans to gain further operational efficiencies. Both our automotive and industrial teams are doing a tremendous job of managing through a dynamic environment and delivering margin expansion. Through their steady focus on our strategic priorities, we\u2019ve improved our total segment profit margin by 150 basis points from the first quarter of 2019. So now let\u2019s turn our comments to the balance sheet. At March 31, our total accounts receivable was up 18%, including the sale of 200 million in receivables under an accounts receivable sales agreement. Our inventory was up 17% or up 9%, excluding KDG, a function of the sales increase and accounts payable increased 16% from 2021, in line with the increase in inventory. Our AP to inventory ratio of 124% was unchanged from December 31 and the prior year.  Our total debt at March 31 is 3.5 billion, up 900 million or 34% from March of last year, driven by the 1 billion in new public debt related to the KDG acquisition. We closed the first quarter with available liquidity of 2 billion and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is two times. This is at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times and supportive of our investment grade rating. We generated 399 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, which has improved from last year. For the full year we expect cash from operations to be in the 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion range and free cash flow of 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion. We believe our continued strong cash flow and the financial strength and flexibility of our balance sheet support our growth plans and provide for disciplined value creating capital allocation.  Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the quarter, capital expenditures totaled 78 million for a broad range of productivity enhancing investments. We also invested 1.4 billion of cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth and while KDG represents most of this investment, we also acquired several automotive store groups across North America. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional acquisitions and we remain focused on the successful integration of KDG into Motion. In the first quarter, we also paid 116 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. The company has paid a cash dividend every year since going public in 1928 and the 10% increase for 2022 represents our 66th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. And as part of our share repurchase program, we used 73 million to purchase 570,000 shares in the first quarter. The company is authorized to repurchase up to 11.3 million additional shares and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead. So turning to our current outlook for 2022, we are raising all full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 17. We expect total sales for 2022 to be in the range of plus 10% to plus 12%, an increase from plus 9% to plus 11%. These growth rates include an estimated 1.5% to 2% headwind from foreign currency translation, and exclude the benefit of any future acquisitions. By business segment, we are guiding to plus 5% to plus 7% total sales growth for the automotive segment, an increase from the plus 4% to plus 6% previously. The new outlook reflects plus 6% to plus 8% comp sales growth, which is up from our previous estimate a plus 5% to plus 7%. For the industrial segment, we are updating our total sales outlook to plus 21% to plus 23%, an increase from our previous outlook of plus 20% to plus 22%. This new outlook includes a plus 5% to plus 7% comp sales increase, which is up from the plus 4% to plus 6% previously. On the earning side, we are raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $7.70 to $7.85, which is up 11% to 14% from 2021. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $7.45 to $7.60. So while the operating environment remains very dynamic, we\u2019re encouraged by the strength of our first quarter and the continued momentum in our businesses, as we move forward into the second quarter.  To close, as we previously noted, I will be retiring from GPC at the end of May, so this will be my last earnings call as CFO. It\u2019s been a privilege and an honor to work for such an amazing company over the last 30 years and I fully expect the friendships that I\u2019ve made over the years to last a lifetime. I\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve made together and I know that the best days for GPC are yet to come. I could not be more excited for Bert Nappier to start as CFO on May 2. Bert and I have been working hand-in-hand over the last two months traveling to meet with all of our business units and our leaders, as well as spending time with our finance and accounting teams. It was also nice to meet with many of you on our recent visit to New York. I personally enjoyed seeing everyone in person for the first time in two years and I know that Bert found that time extremely beneficial. I\u2019m confident that Bert\u2019s transition to CFO will be smooth and seamless and now he looks forward to working with each of you very soon.  Thank you and I\u2019ll now turn it over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Carol, another excellent review of our financial performance and fitting that our results were so strong for your last call as CFO. As a reminder to everyone on the call, Carol has had an incredible 30 year career in GPC, serving in nearly every key financial role before being named CFO in 2013. In her nine years of CFO, her leadership and her positive influence on the company\u2019s success has been immeasurable. She has served on our executive leadership team, our investment committee, our cybersecurity committee, and in addition, she has held leadership positions in everything from supply chain and logistics, to real estate and IT, in addition to her financial responsibilities. She has been a valued partner to me and the entire GPC leadership team as well as to our board, and she\u2019ll be greatly missed by all of us. So thank you, Carol, and best wishes to you, to Mike, and your entire family. So in closing, we\u2019re proud of our progress in the first quarter, and the strong results to start the year, delivering a new sales record, continued margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth, a strengthened balance sheet, and strong cash flow highlight our first quarter performance. At the same time, our teams have done a terrific job is integrating KDG into the Motion business. Looking ahead, the increase in our sales and earnings outlook reflects the confidence in our plans for accelerated growth and profitability, as we build on the positive momentum in our automotive and industrial businesses.  While cognizant of the many uncertainties in the global economy, we believe GPC is well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth plans and provide for disciplined value creating capital allocation while enhancing shareholder value. We thank you for your interest in GPC and we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering strong results.  So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Kate McShane : Hi, thank you. Good morning. And Carol, thank you, again, and congratulations. Our questions are around the guidance that you raised for the year. We\u2019ve wondered how much of the guidance increase is due to your strong Q1 performance versus maybe what has changed in the outlook for the rest of the year, versus what you were thinking when you first gave guidance? And just has the contribution from inflation changed meaningfully to influence the comp guide? Carol Yancey : Yeah, thank you for your comments Kate and I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the guidance. So certainly what went into our thinking, the stronger quarter that we had, I mean, really couldn\u2019t be more pleased with both our automotive and industrial teams and the stronger comp sales that they delivered. And so that momentum was continuing on was certainly contemplated in our guidance outlook. And then the inflation number was a bit higher than what we anticipated coming out of Q4, and that was contemplated as well. But really based on what we know now, there\u2019s not a ton of clarity around inflation and you know how volatile that is. But we certainly contemplate it a little bit more on the top line growth and a little bit more on inflation. And, on the earning side, certainly the ability to leverage on that growth and a strong Q1 that we have, we just felt like it was appropriate now to use that range that we have. We certainly hope to do better than that but we thought it was an appropriate range to get right now. Kate McShane : And just as a follow up question, I think, you know, we\u2019ve seen a bit of a fall off in miles driven given the higher gas prices, but it seems that we still are seeing, as you mentioned, a good degree of momentum in automotive. Can you help reconcile for us why you don\u2019t think miles driven is necessarily having as much of an impact on demand and again, how you see that playing out with the higher gas prices? Paul Donahue : Yeah, I\u2019ll take a shot at that Kate and good morning, welcome to the call. Look, I think, as you look at our tailwinds in the automotive aftermarket, certainly miles driven is a factor we\u2019ve not and unfortunately we don\u2019t get a whole lot of transparency as to where miles driven is trending currently, it usually trails by a couple of months. But given the high gas prices one would assume it is trailing a bit from last year. But when you look at that tailwinds, you\u2019ve got an incredible pent up demand. People want to travel, airfares are incredibly high, so I think you\u2019re going to see folks traveling more both for vacation but I also think that you\u2019re going to see miles driven pickup with folks returning to the workplace. Even though you\u2019ll see a hybrid workforce, I do believe we\u2019ll see a lift there. Used car prices are at all time highs, lack of new car inventory. All of that I believe is going to continue to bode well for the automotive aftermarket. Kate McShane : Thank you. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. And Carol, I\u2019ll add my voice to the thanks for everything over the years. Carol Yancey : Thanks, Greg. Greg Melich : I guess I have two questions. One for you, Carolyn, I\u2019d start is what comp now do you think you need the lever? Given the broader cost inflation like you talked about mid-single digits in the top line, what do you need to lever now getting comp? Carol Yancey : Yeah, look, and again, as we have contemplated, when you look at what we\u2019re contemplating for the full year, moving comps of 6% to 8% for automotive and 5% to 7% for industrial, we were pleased to take those comps, up 100 BPs. We also are going into the year with greater operating margin improvement, again contemplated in our guidance and in part based on the stronger results in Q1. So we are certainly comping just fine at those levels but at the same time, this is an inflationary environment that we\u2019ve never seen before and so we\u2019re being very mindful on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of inflation and our product inflation and our costs. But we do know when we look at our numbers and our cost structure that we still have permanently lowered our cost structure going back to 2019. So the in the range of the 3% to 4%, we certainly can see operating margin improvement there with all the actions that we\u2019ve taken. Greg Melich : Got it. And then maybe, I don\u2019t know Paul or Will, if you want to take this, you\u2019ve mentioned some pretty interesting initiatives in terms of expanding and accelerating growth. I guess I\u2019d love to follow up particularly on the AfterPay. Could you take us as to how big that is and what that program actually entails for both pros or DIY customers? And then Will you talked about adding the SKUs, which I thought was the 2 million SKUs. I thought that was interesting, just some more color on that. Will Stengel : Yeah. So on the AfterPay, it is certainly early days, Greg. It\u2019s not a material part of the business but the trends that we\u2019re seeing in our pilots are very encouraging. It is predominantly DIY today with applications for do it for me in the future. One of the things that we\u2019ve done recently is rolled that out online, and we\u2019re seeing an encouraging trend there. So it\u2019s early days, but something that we\u2019re excited about as it relates to acquiring new customers and driving average order value, which is typically higher than what we\u2019ve seen in our core business.  On the supplier side, you know, I think this was a fundamental thesis that we had, when we acquired KDG, the relationship that\u2019s been the supplier and customer base for that matter in the community that Motion has, with that type of transaction, it created a lot of great productive commercial discussions with all of our vendors. And so we called out the fluid power example as one of them but I would say that the discussions that the Motion team is having with its vendor base now with Kaman as part of the family is incredibly encouraging, including the access to new products, new growth segments, etc. So consistent with what we\u2019ve taught before we bought the business, I am really encouraged to see that initiative taking hold. Just as a reminder, it\u2019s only 100 days in on KDG, so again, early days but encouraging trends in the business. Greg Melich : Got it. And in my last one, flow got little stronger in the quarter in North America but DIY is still positive. How does that look as you go into the second quarter, especially given the bizarre comps that you\u2019re seeing, particularly in DIY now? Paul Donahue : Yeah, I\u2019ll take a shot at that, Greg. You mentioned the DIFM comps so up strong-double digits and we\u2019re seeing it across the entire commercial segment from major accounts to auto care to fleet. We\u2019re seeing it across our entire business. DIY is holding up okay. I mean we\u2019re seeing high single digit. Our strength, Greg, is always going to be on the DIFM side and that\u2019s a good 80% of our overall business. For us to generate high single digit numbers in DIY, add to reflect and I think on all the good work our teams are doing in the stores. And look, with inflation that could very well drive people back into the stores attempting to do more DIY type projects. I don\u2019t think the general population is going to get real proficient at changing out their own brakes, but certainly more basic type projects, car care products, I think, will continue to see a good lift in the back half of the year. So yeah, we\u2019re very, very pleased at the mix and anticipate it continuing through the back half of the year. Greg Melich : That\u2019s great. Good luck. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan, please go ahead. ChrisHorvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And congratulations, again, Carol, on your retirements. By the time that you depart, we might have spring in the United States, so good news ahead. Maybe starting on the industrial side of the business, you talked about the acceleration in March in the US -- and sorry, and in the quarter. Can you talk about what industries are you seeing the most acceleration? And, obviously, energy and ag, there\u2019s a lot of optimism around those sub sectors, given all the inflation that\u2019s going on in those industries. Can you remind us how significant that is for you and to what extent are you seeing improvements in those sub sectors? Paul Donahue : So as I mentioned in my comments, upfront, Chris, the increases we\u2019re seeing are across the board, and in all the segments that we track, we\u2019re seeing really strong double digit with the exception of two and those two are up mid to high single digit. So you called out oil and gas, we\u2019re seeing huge increases in that segment. Not a huge segment for us but I can tell you, the increase is significant. We\u2019re also seeing good increases, solid increases in segments like aggregate, cement, conveyance logistics products, which really points to the strength and expansion we\u2019re seeing in distribution centers around the country; equipment and machinery, which is our single largest segment, again, really, really strong growth in the quarter. So really, it\u2019s broad based and across almost every segment that that we track. ChrisHorvers: Got it. And then on the US NAPA business in March, an acceleration is pretty impressive considering we are lapping stimulus from a year ago, and to the point on maybe some late spring impact on DIY. So, can you diagnose maybe what helped that acceleration to the extent that it was pro versus DIY? Was it an acceleration on the inflation front? And then was there much difference in terms of the trend in the quarter between company-operated stores and independence? Paul Donahue : Yeah, I\u2019ll take the last part first, Chris. Not much difference at all, as we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters between our good solid independent owners and our company stores both performed very, very well in the quarter. And as mentioned, we finished strong we had a record sales month in the month of March, but we were up double digit, January, February and March. And you called weather, Chris; the weather has not really been our friend in Q1, certainly not in April with, as you mentioned, snow storms across the upper Midwest and Northeast. I mean, we\u2019re ready to get into spring and get into the ag business, depends on getting out in the field. So weather has not been a positive for us. DIFM versus DIY, I mentioned in an earlier call, strong, strong double digit growth in our core, which is DIFM and that\u2019s across the entire segment. That\u2019s major accounts, fleet, auto care, really pleased to see the surge in our auto care segment; that\u2019s a great call out for us. But DIY continues to be up high single digit and, again, I think that\u2019s evident of the good work that our folks are doing in our stores with a number of initiatives from improved assortments, enhanced store hours, better training, and better in stock availability, so really broad base across the entire NAPA team are all doing well. Carol Yancey : And Chris, I would just comment, everything that Paul just said it really was very insignificant in terms of inflationary impact for March, you\u2019re talking about a point or two, Paul said, mid-single digit inflation, we were certainly a bit higher than that in US automotive, but the bulk of it is just all the market initiatives and the growth and really the inflation impact for March specific is really just a point or so, so not significant. ChrisHorvers: Got it. Thank you very much. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Chris. Operator : The next question is from Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So given the pervasiveness of concern in the investment community about a potential recession in the next 12 to 24 months, and then comparing that to the strength you\u2019ve experienced in your business, is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in the leading indicators that you track that give you any pause in your outlook for the remainder of the year, maybe a degree of conservatism baked into that raise outlook, just given the uncertainty around potential recession or economic slowdown? Paul Donahue : Look, Liz, great question. And certainly, as excited as we are, about our Q1 performance, and how our teams performed really all of 2021 and throughout Q1. We\u2019ve fully realize the environment we\u2019re operating in could get more challenging in the latter part of the year; not as concerned in the US, I think we\u2019ll be fine, industrial remains strong. And I would tell you that our outlook for the balance of the year, we worked really, really hard, and looked at all the factors and we think our guidance for the balance of the year is very prudent. Liz Suzuki : Great. And just one follow-up about international expansion, I mean, you guys have been adding new markets to your addressable market for the last -- for several decades and adding a couple of new markets even every couple of years. So are there still -- is there still some low hanging fruit that you see out there, markets where you haven\u2019t entered that seemed like they would make sense as adjacencies to your current business or new regions to enter that you think have the same types of either vehicle dynamics or on the industrial side have similar economic backgrounds as regions where you\u2019re already operating? Paul Donahue : So, Liz, I would mention our latest acquisition of Lausan who\u2019s a market leader in Spain and Portugal. That\u2019ll be our eighth and ninth country that we\u2019ve expanded into in Europe and Lausan is just as you -- or Spain is just as you described, it\u2019s a great adjacency to our current markets, fifth largest market in Europe, 35 million vehicles, average age 11 plus years, it\u2019s very under penetrated. We think we\u2019ve got a real opportunity with a great team on the ground in Spain and Portugal to be a first mover in that part of the world. So that\u2019s an exciting move for us.  As we look at, you mentioned industrial, Liz, look, we are incredibly bullish, as we\u2019ve said in these calls before about our industrial business and I think that was borne out in our big acquisition of Kaman in early January. Still plenty of opportunities for our industrial business and continuing to expand. We\u2019ve got arguably less than 5% market share in the MRO space. We\u2019d love the robotics, the automation business. I could certainly see us continuing to expand in those categories. But I can say the same about all of our businesses, Liz. We have less than 10% market share in every business, in every part of the world that we operate in, including our North American automotive business. So yeah, lots of opportunities going forward and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about the balance of the year. Liz Suzuki : Great, thanks very much. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Paul Donahue : Hey, Bret. Bret Jordan : And congratulations, Carol, again. Carol Yancey : Thank you, Bret. Bret Jordan : On the 12% comp in the US, did you talk about what\u2019s your feelings around share gain were in that number? How do you see the underlying market in the first quarter? And then did you see anything, I guess, relative to pure price dynamics? Is anything other more or less competitive in the US auto market? Paul Donahue : Yeah. Bret, being the first one out of the big four to report, it\u2019s hard to say how the others will line up. We\u2019re very, very pleased with our performance in Q1. And if there is any market share gains, my guess is that it perhaps is coming from some of the smaller regional players. But again, until we see the balance of the big four report out, it\u2019d be hard to pinpoint that exactly. In terms of pricing dynamics, Brat, I\u2019m really pleased to tell you that it remains very rational as the automotive aftermarket has for many, many years. Certainly, we\u2019re seeing price increases across all the major categories. But it has remained very, very rational across the industry. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a question on Europe, could you talk about the cadence of Europe? And obviously a lot of change in Eastern Europe since late February, but is that showing any impacts in Western European demand dynamic? And then just a housekeeping, you talked about the NAPA brand expansion ongoing there, could you talk about what percentage of European sales are in NAPA branded mix? Paul Donahue : Yeah, let me take the first part of your question, Bret, in terms of the cadence, again, we had a very good quarter. Well, we had a very good quarter following up on a very good year in 2021 in Europe. So our total sales up 14%, our comps were up 7% in Q1, so very pleased with the performance. As I mentioned earlier, as good as we feel about Q1, we also fully realize that given all of the factors that are occurring in Europe, it could get more challenging in the final three quarters, but I would tell you that our teams are planning accordingly. And, if there\u2019s one thing that we learned, Bret, during the downturn and the pandemic, our teams are very agile, they can turn very quickly and if we do see a downturn in the business, we\u2019ll be ready to pull all the levers to ensure we deliver on the bottom line.  And then the second part of your question, Brat, regarding the NAPA brand, it\u2019s hard to say exactly, but I would tell you, we\u2019re at a point now it\u2019s less than 10% of our overall European business. We launched initially in the UK, it\u2019s more widespread there. And it\u2019s more expansive across a variety of product categories. We have since launched in the Benelux, Germany, France and we\u2019re kind of taking a product category by product category. So we\u2019ve got tremendous upside and many more opportunities to come in. And ultimately now we will launch the NAPA brand as we expand across Spain and Portugal as well. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Paul Donahue : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you, Bret. Operator : The next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. I\u2019m sure Carol is ready to enjoy her long delayed vacation. Two questions, one on each segment of the business. First, given continuing supply chain challenges, have you seen any signs that companies are trying to increase their domestic production activity? Obviously, that\u2019d be bullish for Motion, if so, and then on the auto business, just given the amount of inflation that\u2019s flowing through both the economy and your own product costs, Paul, have you seen any resistance at all to the higher price points meaning, any kind of demand destruction even if it\u2019s in a small minor category? Paul Donahue : Go ahead, Will. Will will take the first question. Will Stengel : I\u2019ll take your first question. Absolutely, we\u2019re seeing that. I would say that discussions with the vendor community are more active than they ever have been on the re-shoring concept. So as you alluded to, that\u2019s incredibly bullish for the Motion business over the medium term. I think the global supply chain and the complexities and some of the challenges that everybody\u2019s been working through over the last couple years make it very logical for that manufacturing activity to come back to North America. So we\u2019re bullish about it and we\u2019ll seize that opportunity as it develops. Paul Donahue : And then related to your second question, Scott, on automotive, and the higher price points are we seeing consumers trade down; we didn\u2019t see much of it in Q1, I think as evidenced by our strong 12% comp increase, it was strong across just about every product category. But I would tell you with our good better breath -- best strategy we\u2019re well prepared, if we do see consumers begin to trade down to the value lines and we\u2019ve seen that in the past when times get tough, they will trade down. But I would tell you, we did not see much of that in Q1. Scot Ciccarelli : Excellent. Thanks, guys. Paul Donahue : Yeah, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yep. Thanks so much, Carol. I have my congratulations and congrats on the first quarter, guys, on the results. Carol Yancey : Thank you. Daniel Imbro : I wanted to start on the on the industrial piece. Growth was robust, Paul, and with it came some margin leverage. Are you able to disaggregate out of the 1Q margin leverage how much was from any vendor volume rebates versus how much was core sustainable cost removal, just as we model headline growth slowing over time, trying to see how much of that maybe the vendor rebates go away to the back half of this year into next year. Thanks. Carol Yancey : Yeah, so on the industrial side, again, the Motion comps were 16% in the quarter, and that is just tremendous operating results. And when you get that kind of comp growth, the leverage on SG&A was extremely impressive. And then on the gross margin side, they\u2019ve done a tremendous job. I mean, they\u2019ve got a long track record of initiatives on the gross margin side, both pricing and category management. And with looking at their improvement in their operating margin, and again, the strong 100 BPs, that\u2019s coming about equally from gross margin and SG&A. The vendor incentives, it certainly is moving in line with what the comps are but it\u2019s incremental dollars, but it\u2019s not necessarily giving us the bump on the rate. So really just strong operating, both on gross margin initiatives on the leverage on the SG&A, and, again, just a tremendous job by the industrial teams. And we certainly are pleased, we don\u2019t have any reason to suspect that that doesn\u2019t continue as we look ahead, because we\u2019ve got full year operating margin implied for them as we look ahead. Daniel Imbro : Got it. And then maybe one for Will, as I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about bringing in some external talent to lead the supply chain, kind of optimize that. I\u2019m curious as to what drove that decision? Are there particular inefficiencies that you guys were really struggling to address on the supply chain or what made you or why is now the right time to accelerate that investment with external talent you brought in? Thanks. Will Stengel : Well, yeah, listen, we\u2019re always looking to add great talent and expertise to the organization. And I would say, we\u2019ve been pretty clear that supply chain technology, our foundational priorities around those elements are clear and talent helps us get there, so nothing to read into it other than we\u2019re adding great folks to the team, and we\u2019re looking forward to build on our momentum. Daniel Imbro : Got it. Thanks so much. Best of luck. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Daniel. Operator : We have time for one more question from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot. Good morning. Let me add my congratulations to Carol. I just have a follow up question for you. You talked about the rational pricing environments in the US auto segment. But have you seen any indication of relative price investments from any of your peers who have talked about doing that in the commercial side? Paul Donahue : We have not, Seth, and look we\u2019re all attuned to that, given the discussions of a couple of months ago, the team here, Will and I and Carol, and Bert, we spent half a day with our US automotive team, the entire leadership team. And trust me, that was a focal point for us. And I can assure you that we\u2019re not seeing it out there. Might have come here in the second half of the year, perhaps, but we certainly didn\u2019t see it in Q1. Seth Basham : Got it. Okay, helpful. And one last follow up, regarding KDG integration, did you see any margin accretion in the industrial segment for addition of that business this quarter or was the margin improvement driven by the other factors that you mentioned? Carol Yancey : Yeah, look, we\u2019re going to stay pretty consistent what we talked about at our February call, and also in December with KDG. We certainly -- it\u2019s not -- the contribution of the operating margin improvement was really coming from the core Motion business. Having said that, really pleased with the early execution of the integration and what we\u2019re seeing there is we get to the fully synergize model, it is definitely accretive to the industrial margins but we\u2019re still a bit early on that. So again, the strong comp growth is really what drove the 100 basis point proven and operating margin. But again, KDG performed well in the quarter, they had a similar grid quarter. The teams are really integrated. We spent some time with them. So as we look ahead, we know that we\u2019re going to be at our targets that we talked about, and hopefully be a bit early on the synergies. Seth Basham : Wonderful, thank you. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Seth. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. Carol Yancey : We\u2019d like to thank all of you for participating in our Q1 conference call. We appreciate your support. And personally, I appreciate all of your support and your kind remarks today. And the company looks forward to discussing the Q2 results with you in July. Thanks again. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the presentation and instructions will be given at that time. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sid Jones : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Will Stengel, our President; and Bert Nappier, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call and webcast includes a slide presentation that can be found on the Genuine Parts Company Investor Relations' website. Please be advised this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today\u2019s discussion of our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. As Sid mentioned, I'm here with Will as well as Bert, who was on his first earnings call as CFO. Welcome to the call Bert. We are pleased to report continued strong results from Genuine Parts Company in the second quarter of 2022. The GPC team had another record quarter consisting of double-digit sales and earnings increases and a steady cadence of continued growth throughout April, May and June. Total sales were $5.6 billion, up 17%, and adjusted earnings per share were $2.20, up 26% from last year. We continue to benefit from the resiliency of our automotive and industrial businesses and the strategic mix of our operations. We would like to thank our 53,000 talented GPC teammates for their exceptional work and commitment to excellence. A few highlights in the quarter include another quarterly sales record for GPC and our automotive and industrial segment, segment operating margin expansion in both segments and for GPC overall, record quarterly earnings and double-digit EPS growth for the eighth consecutive quarter and strong cash flow generation and the further strengthening of our balance sheet. We continue to execute our key strategic initiatives to deliver market share gains and drive positive momentum in our top and bottom line results despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures. Our teams are doing an excellent job of navigating supply chain disruptions, enabling our business with the product we need to serve our customers and capture market share. For example, we are investing in our businesses to enhance forecast accuracy for product demand, improve fill rates and optimize our network footprint. Our size and global scale continue to be an advantage as we work to have the right part in the right place at the right time. Likewise, our pricing strategies have proven valuable in substantially offsetting product inflation and rising freight cost. Our M&A strategy has also been effective. As you will hear from Will, the accelerated integration of KDG has been executed with a high degree of precision and has had a meaningful impact on our industrial performance. In addition, our global automotive teams have been active with ongoing strategic bolt-on acquisitions, such as the addition of [indiscernible], which rounds out our national footprint in Germany, the largest economy in Europe. We continue to explore a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets and M&A remains an important part of our global growth strategy. Additionally, we are benefiting from ongoing initiatives, such as accelerating the rollout of the NAPA brand, our international markets, as well as further investing in B2B and B2C omnichannel enhancements to both our catalog data and technology platforms. We also continue to upgrade our pricing and product category management strategies to further extend our leadership positions in the global automotive and industrial markets. As we look at the operating environment more broadly, our automotive and industrial business are benefiting from several tailwinds. The continued increase in miles driven and the average age of vehicles, limited new car inventory and elevated used car prices are supporting demand in the automotive aftermarket and driving continued strength in the DIFM segment. In Industrial, PMI continues to signal manufacture and expansion and industrial production showed gains again in the second quarter, representing the eight consecutive quarter of growth. We are closely monitoring potential consumer headwinds, including the effective, historically high inflation and its impact on gas prices, freight and wages. However, we will stay focused on our strategic initiatives and remain agile in the execution of our business on a day-to-day basis. The enthusiasm and momentum in our business was on full display last week, when for the first time in seven years, we hosted our 2022 NAPA Expo in Las Vegas. This gathering brought together more than 15,000 global attendees, including Napa AutoCare customers, independent Napa store owners, Napa store managers, key suppliers and leaders across our operations. It was an extraordinary event packed with seminars, insights, business, building strategies, and an extensive trade show featuring our global suppliers and key business partners. We took the opportunity to introduce our new Napa brand campaign, Get Up & Go. And you could feel the positive energy and excitement for the future of Napa and the automotive aftermarket overall. The biggest takeaway is that the Napa team in the U.S. and across the globe is well positioned for the future. During the quarter, we also had the opportunity to spend time in the field with our Motion leadership team. We visited our operations and customers across the Midwest and saw firsthand the momentum in our industrial business and the progress of the KDG acquisition. As we mentioned in our last call, we have been active in 2022 building on our commitment to responsible ESG business practices. This has included formalizing our carbon emission reduction strategy, as well as driving continued progress in DE&I. We look forward to providing additional details in our progress in these areas later this year, as we publish our 2022 corporate sustainability report. So again, we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering another quarter of record results. Now I'll turn the call over to Will. Will Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC teams as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate the team effort and hard work to deliver great results around the world. During the second quarter, we built on solid momentum and delivered strong results across both our automotive and industrial businesses. Our results were driven by team execution and discipline focused on strategic initiatives. We continue to align our initiatives around five foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain, and emerging technology. We will highlight select initiative examples as we review the business performance. Turning to the performance details by segment total sales for our global automotive segment were $3.5 billion in the second quarter, an increase of approximately $271 million or 8.5% versus the same period last year. Sales growth was relatively consistent in all three months of the quarter and on a comparable basis sales growth for the quarter was plus 8%. Our global teams delivered mid-single digit to low double digit comp growth across each of our operations. And as Paul mentioned, the automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and focused team execution. Global Automotive segment profit was $323 million and segment operating margin was 9.3%, representing a 20 basis point increase from the same period last year. The improvement in segment profit was driven by strong operating discipline across our operations, despite a dynamic environment. During the second quarter, our automotive business experienced slightly higher product cost inflation compared to the mid-single-digit experience in the first quarter. The pricing environment remains rational and we're pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our category management initiatives. Looking ahead, we believe current levels of inflation will continue through the second half of 2022. Now turning to an overview of our automotive businesses by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 11% during the quarter, with comparable sales growth of 7%. Sales were solid across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories with breaks, filters and fluids, all posting double-digit increases in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with market share growth with many of our categories. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double-digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which moderated to mid-single-digit growth as expected. Our commercial business representing approximately 80% of U.S. auto sales saw broad based strength across all customer segments. Digital channels across all customers also performed well with low double-digit sales growth during the second quarter, reflecting continued traction from investments in our omnichannel experience. Others select U.S. initiative examples to highlight include the rollout of an enhanced PROLink, our B2B digital commerce platform, new sales and marketing programs, including the new NAPA Get Up and Go brand campaign, pricing and sourcing analytics, inventory and forecasting tools and DC productivity initiatives, to name just a few. In Canada, sales grew approximately 16% in local currency during the second quarter. Comparable sales were up 14% and up 26% on a two-year stack reflective of the continued strength of the reopening of the Canadian market and solid team execution. To highlight an example of emerging technology initiatives, during the second quarter, we officially launched NexDrive in Canada. Originally launched in Europe in 2020, NexDrive is a program that enables our network of automotive service centers to repair next-generation hybrids and EV vehicles. As part of this program, we partner with our vast service center network to offer product training tools and technology. We currently have over 100 NexDrive service centers in the European market and we're excited to bring this offering to the Canadian market. Our emerging technology council comprised of global strategic partners also continues to help inform and advance our strategies. In Europe, our automotive team delivered a terrific quarter as well despite the dynamic geopolitical environment. Sales in Europe increased 19% in local currency in the second quarter. Comparable sales increased 7% for the quarter and are up more than 40% on a two-year stack basis. Growth continues to be driven by continued focus on strategic initiatives. Initiative highlights in Europe include new account expansion, continued NAPA rollout within and across the region and technology and supply chain investments. The recent Lausan and Canol [ph] acquisitions in Spain and Germany respectively are also exceeding our expectations and we're encouraged by the opportunities we're working on to capture in these businesses. In the Asia-Pac automotive business sales in the second quarter increased 11% in local currency from last year. Comparable sales were up 8% from last year and up 26% on a two-year stack, both commercial and retail sales performed well with Repco and NAPA growth driven by strong execution of complimentary customer value propositions and robust demand. Our motorcycle accessories division also performed well, benefiting from ongoing store expansion. In addition, during the second quarter, our Asia-Pac team completed the acquisition of Steady [ph], a leading Australian branded direct-to-consumer distributor of lighting products focused on the four-wheel drive market. The acquisition creates a differentiated product offering in a multi-billion dollar profitable high growth segment in Australia and New Zealand. Turning to the Global Industrial segment. During the second quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $547 million or 34.5%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter and comparable sales, which exclude the benefit of KDG increased 18% versus last year. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable growth driven by the strong performance in our North American business. The strength in our North American industrial performance was broad based with double-digit sales growth across virtually all product categories and major industry served with particular strengths coming from equipment and machinery, aggregate and cement and automotive customers. Industrial segment profit was $225 million or 10.6% of sales, a new record for the Industrial segment. This represents a 110 basis point increase from the same period last year. The improvement is a result of Motion\u2019s impressive growth and disciplined operating performance. For the second quarter, inflation in the Industrial segment held in the low-single digit range, consistent with the levels we saw on the first quarter. The pricing environment remains rational and we do not expect any significant shifts in product inflation in our industrial business through the balance of 2022. Select initiative highlights contributing to the strong performance in the industrial business include sales programs to capture profitable share of wallet with target accounts, data driven, strategic pricing, and sourcing programs, technology investments to enhance the omni-channel experience and inventory productivity and footprint optimization initiatives. As Paul mentioned, the KDG acquisition has added to the Motion team momentum. The teams are executing well defined plans with customers, suppliers, and teammates to deliver growth and create value as a combined business. To provide a bit more commentary on the recent integration progress, the team successfully onboarded KDG associates to Motion HR programs, accelerated the realignment of functional support teams, integrated systems and accelerated the co-location of overlapping branches. In addition, the team partnered with vendors to improve programs and product availability, utilized cross-functional field teams to sell services across shared customers, harmonize inventory strategies and rebranded stores under the Motion banner. All major work streams are at or ahead of plan. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the momentum of the integration efforts and excited for the growth opportunities as one Motion team. As we execute on our global initiatives, we compliment them with strategic bolt-on acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. The M&A pipeline continues to be active and will remain discipline to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth, and create long-term value. In summary, we had another terrific quarter, which resulted in record sales and profit for Genuine Parts Company. We acknowledged that the macro environment remains dynamic, but we learned as a team from the challenges presented by the pandemic. We continued to prioritize our customers as we analyze our business indicators remain agile and strategically invest with discipline in initiatives that extend our global leadership positions. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for an exceptional quarter. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bert. Bert Nappier : Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Paul and Will have shared, we had an excellent second quarter and I\u2019m pleased to walk you through the key highlights. Our comments this morning focused primarily on our adjusted quarterly results, which exclude non-recurring items that I will cover in more detail shortly. Total GPC sales were $5.6 billion in the second quarter, up $819 million or 17.1% from last year. Our increase in total sales reflects an 11.5% increase in comparable sales, including mid-single digit inflation and an 8.8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 3.3% unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Our gross margin was 35%, a 30 basis point decrease compared to the second quarter last year and in line with our expectations. Our gross margin in the second quarter was negatively impacted by headwinds from anticipated moderation and supplier incentives, foreign currency, and the timing of inflation in certain product categories. These headwinds were substantially offset by the ongoing favorable impact of strategic category management initiatives, where we continue to leverage our growing global scale. As an example of our strategic initiatives and category management, our teams are utilizing technology, innovative data analytics and AI to forecast supply chain lead times and changes in market demand to ensure optimal levels. These actions along with our pricing initiatives positively impacted our gross margin in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect our gross margin rate to be consistent with 2021, as we are relentlessly managing the impact of product and supplier price increases in our costs. Our total operating and non-operating expenses, excluding non-recurring items were approximately $1.5 billion up 15% from 2021 and at 27.6% of sales compared to 28.1% of sales in the prior year. We continue to leverage our expenses despite ongoing inflationary pressures across all costs, particularly in freight and shipping charges. Our teams remain focused on further reducing expenses and driving operational efficiencies across the business. With our strong performance, segment profit was $548 million up 24%, and our segment profit margin was 9.8%, a 60 basis point increase from last year and up 160 basis points from 2019. With a very challenging operating environment over the past few years, ranging from the pandemic to current inflationary dynamics, we are very proud of the work our teams have done to improve our segment margin over the last three years. As outlined in our earnings release, our second quarter results include two non-recurring items. The first item relates to the sale of S.P. Richards real estate, which generated $140 million in cash proceeds and resulted in a non-recurring gain of $103 million. The S.P. Richards properties sold this quarter were not divested with that business in 2020. And we are extremely pleased to monetize these assets and reinvest this capital across the GPC portfolio. In addition, during the second quarter, we incurred approximately $25 million of costs related to our KDG acquisition, including a non-cash impairment charge of $17 million for legacy motion brand name that will no longer be used as a result of the acquisition of KDG. Our second quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $59 million or $0.42 per diluted share and the non-recurring items I just discussed was $313 million or $2.20 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted debt income of $253 million or $1.74 per diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 26%. The strong growth is indicative of the crisp execution of our initiatives to deliver accelerated growth and profitability. As we turn to our balance sheet at June 30, our total accounts receivable balances were up 18% with inventory up 17% and both in line with the increase in sales. Likewise, accounts payable increased 14% from 2021, which correlates to the increase in inventory. We continue to generate strong cash flows with $392 million in cash from operations in the second quarter and $791 million for the six months up 12% from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range with free cash flow of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We close the second quarter with $2 billion in available liquidity and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.8 times. This is slightly below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times, and highlights our financial strength and flexibility. The key priorities for capital allocation at GPC remain unchanged. As a reminder, these included reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A, and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During 2022, we have invested $153 million in capital expenditures, including $75 million in the second quarter and continue to plan for additional strategic investments through the balance of the year. These investments are primarily in technology and projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity throughout the business. Beyond CapEx, during 2022 we have also invested $1.6 billion for acquisitions and returned $366 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $243 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $123 million in cash to repurchase 943,000 shares. As a reminder, we have increased the annual dividend for 66 consecutive years. Turning to our current outlook for 2022. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our first quarter earnings release. We are raising adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $7.80 to $7.95, which represents an increase of 13% to 15% from 2021 and up from our previous guidance of $7.70 to $7.85. Our revised EPS guidance includes an incremental headwind of approximately $0.08 due to foreign currency relative to the outlook we provided in April. We expect total sales growth for 2022 to be in a range of 12% to 14%, an increase from 10% to 12% previously. By business segment, we are guiding to the following : 6% to 8% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an increase from 5% to 7% previously. The new outlook reflects 6% to 8% comp sales growth consistent with our previous estimate. For the Industrial segment, we are updating our total sales outlook to 26% to 28% an increase from our previous outlook of 21% to 23%. The new outlook includes a 9% to 11% comp sales increase, which is up from 5% to 7% previously. We\u2019ve had an exceptional first half of 2022 boosted by our industrial business and the success of our acquisition of KDG along with solid global automotive results. Our outlook for the full year reflects our ongoing confidence in our businesses to execute on our strategies, despite a dynamic and uncertain external landscape. Our continued strong cash flow generation also provides us with full flexibility to continue to invest in the business and return cash to our shareholders through our dividend. We look forward to reporting on our progress in our third quarter call in October. Thank you. And we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Q - Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So a few questions from a top line perspective, so focusing first on the U.S. NAPA business. Interesting to note that your DIY business was up, some of your peers talked about a late spring impacting sort of the start of the quarter. So can you give us a sense if that customer how consistent that comp cadence was during the quarter? And then moreover, as you think about quarter to date, what are you seeing in the U.S. Walmart pre-announced earlier this week, talking about pressures on the low end consumer and some other companies have said that as well. So just curious if you\u2019re seeing any variation in the DIY side of the business in the U.S.? Will Stengel : Yes. Chris, good morning. It\u2019s Will here. Let me take a crack and Bert and Paul can jump in if you have anything to add. So as you alluded to generally speaking U.S. automotive combine, do it for me, do it yourself consistent through the quarter on a monthly basis. I would say, on the do it yourself side, we did see some moderation through the quarter as we expected based on year-over-year comparables. I would say that we\u2019re not reading into a softness in the customer based on what we\u2019re seeing in our data. And so I\u2019m not sure that we have the same takeaway that perhaps some of your traditional retailers are reading through in terms of the help of the consumer. Paul Donahue : And I would \u2013 Chris, I would just add onto that, you kind of asked about the current quarter please report that U.S. Automotive continues to be in good shape. The trends we\u2019re seeing in July are very similar to what we saw in Q2. So all is positive on the U.S. Automotive front. Chris Horvers : So just to double click on that a little bit, the DIY moderation was really just anniversary in stimulus from April of last year? Paul Donahue : We agree. Chris Horvers : And then separately on the Motion business, Motion is doing in incredibly well. One of your peers in the industrial parts distribution business talked about some signs of moderation as they saw other quarter progress and into the current quarter. So curious, if you had any comments on that side as well. Will Stengel : Yes, Chris, similarly we saw very consistent strength through the quarter. And as Paul alluded to kind of early looks and commentary around July, we\u2019re seeing that continued strength coming out of the quarter, as well as we had in our prepared remarks. We saw broad strength across all of our end markets. We saw broad strength across all of our product categories. And we spend a lot of time in the field talking with customers, and I would say the mood is cautious, but on the margin quite positive. We\u2019re obviously watching it and cautiously optimistic, but we feel good about what we\u2019re seeing in the business. Chris Horvers : And one last quick follow on, obviously a lot of questions about, what\u2019s going on in Europe? How\u2019s that business holding up as sort of the years played out with the war and energy prices over in that region? Paul Donahue : Yes, I\u2019ll take that Chris. Our European business continues to be rock solid. We had another really good quarter. I could not be more proud of our European team. And we saw it across all of our markets. We saw really nice sales increase in Germany. Our Netherlands business is strong, really pleased to see our business in France, posting mid-single-digits. So all is good there. As you know, we\u2019re not in Russia or Ukraine, and so not necessarily feeling that impact. You mentioned the energy issue, Chris, which obviously is getting a lot of press we\u2019re watching it closely. We are not an energy dependent business. So our DCs, our stores will continue to operate as they always have. So, we\u2019re watching it certainly, we\u2019re concerned, we\u2019re a little concerned over the potential for some economic challenges, but again, please to say really strong quarter by our team, and we\u2019re seeing that strength carryover into Q3 as well. Chris Horvers : Thanks very much. Best of luck. Paul Donahue : Yes. Thank you, Chris. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask, if I could about the sales guidance, which seems to imply to hit the midpoint for the full year, for example, an automotive, 400 bps to 500 bps of moderation. And then a 10 percentage point plus slow down for industrial. Just wanted to see if that\u2019s kind of more conservatism, if there\u2019s something, in particular that you\u2019re seeing, how we should think about that in light of some of the traction that you\u2019ve discussed for your initiatives? Bert Nappier : I\u2019ll take that one, its Bert. Hey Mike. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Look first, I\u2019d just like to thank our teams for the tremendous work so far in the first half. And I\u2019ll try to give you some color on the guidance from there. Certainly exceeded our expectations in the first half. The business continues to be very resilient and balanced, but a number of factors were contemplated into how we raised guidance, obviously the sales numbers that I provided in my prepared comments, the outperformance in the first half, and the momentum we see in the underlying business that Paul and Will have talked about. We needed to balance that against the fact that we just can\u2019t ignore that there\u2019s tightening economic conditions that potentially could impact businesses in the second half. So, we\u2019re trying to balance the strength of the first half and our momentum exiting Q2 while being eyes wide open and prudent about what we see out there.  And again, we've already talked about a few of these things with inflation lingering COVID conditions, the geopolitical landscape, ongoing supply chain constraints. So look, on the back half guide for sales our original plan for the year assume some normalization of growth rates in the second half. And our views are really unchanged on that. When you look at a year ago, the outperformance we had in the second half was quite significant and we just can't expect a year-for-year repeat of that level of outperformance. So we moderated that a little bit, look at a normalized growth rate in the second half.  As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we do have some FX headwinds that are incremental to our guide in April about $0.08 as we look at that. But look, we're going to stay focused, look for additional growth opportunities in the second half, stay disciplined on costs and look for efficiency gains. But at the end of the day, we're going to improve operating margin and have operating margin expansion for the full year. And we think that's a pretty good outcome. Michael Montani : Got it. Thank you. And then if I could follow up just on the cost side, one question bit housekeeping but just how to think about interest expense in light of some of the move up in interest rates? And then secondly on gross margins, given the strong organic growth and then inorganic increases kind of why the supplier incentive pressure there would think you guys might have had some incremental benefits going on there? Bert Nappier : Yeah, I'll take \u2013 I guess I'll take both of those. Look, I think, we're really in a positive spot on our capital structure. We're at 1.8 times levered that's below our range of two to 2.5 times. We have a very strong investment grade rating. And we look at our debt structure, it's nearly 100% fixed with some episodic borrowing against our revolver usually intra-month. But when you look at that, I don't see a lot of volatility there. We've got a weighted average interest rate of 2.3%. The only place we've seen a little bit of pressure is in our AR securitization program, in operating expenses. But it's still very, very attractive capital source for us and really not anything of consequence to call out there. In terms of gross margin, back to your question on that, look we landed at 35% for the quarter that was in line with our own expectations. The underlying execution from our teams, which has been absolutely tremendous in core activities around category management and pricing has driven significant margin improvement as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Unfortunately, that's a bit hard to see this quarter. We got three big factors masking that some expected moderation in supplier rebates as you mentioned and I'll talk about that here shortly, foreign currency and inflation.  When you look at the supplier rebates those moderated from a year ago we had some heightened supply chain challenges in the prior year that you're all intimately aware of, and those impacted the amounts we received from our suppliers. And so that's abated a bit, if you recall, we had a 40 basis point margin expansion from those a year ago and so that's as anticipated moderated. The great part about that, the flip side of that is we have more inventory to get to our customers, and we've got a better level of availability to be able to drive through to the business. I'll just land that point with, we expect gross margin for the full year to be consistent with 2021. And again, we think that's a great outcome in this very dynamic environment. Michael Montani : Thank you. And good luck. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Mike. Operator : And our next question today comes from Liz Suzuki at Bank of America. Please go ahead. Liz Suzuki : Great, thank you. Just on inflation which is the kind of topic. Sure. What do you think pricing and margins could look like when inflation ultimately moves in the other direction? As in, if we find ourselves in a deflationary environment, can you hold on to price actions you've taken or do you think the competitive environment has changed such that it might get more challenging to keep pricing sticky? Bert Nappier : Hey, Liz, it\u2019s Bert how you doing? I hope you having a good summer. Thanks for the question. Look, I'll take that one a bit. Look, the inflationary environment has persisted and it's no doubt, a tough dynamic out there for everyone retires, very intense focus from everyone and our teams are doing a great job of managing it and have been able to generally pass along as you pointed out price increases to mitigate the impact. Our strategy there has been to protect gross margin rate, so that's our focus.  If you look at the downside of that, we wouldn't expect to see the environment pull back on pricing. Obviously that would take some time to work through, but we wouldn't see an immediate pullback in the environment. We'll stay competitive on that front and watch the marketplace. But again, I think the bottom line is, we wouldn't see a big pull back in terms of pricing or the pricing environment in general and obviously cost changes take quite some time to work through the supply chain. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. And just how much of the comp growth in each of your segments? Do you think will be attributable to inflation or your SKU for \u2013 SKU inflation for the year, and as you look out into next year, do you expect that to moderate? Bert Nappier : I think I\u2019ll start with the back half of your question and just say for the back half of the year, we really, as Will mentioned in his remarks expect inflation levels to stay where they are from here for the rest of the year. That\u2019s how we contemplated it in our guide. That\u2019s a slight uptick from what we saw on the first quarter. And then if you look at it all up for GPC consolidated, we see the impact kind of mid-single digits on the top line within the motion industrial business. That\u2019s low-single digits on the top line. And then for the auto business globally, we see that in the high single digits on the top line for the rest of the year. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. Bert Nappier : Of course. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So just a clarification on that same-SKU inflation concept specifically in the U.S. So are we basically seeing that units are fairly steady or flat with the comp gains coming from rising prices or is there another lever in there we have to be cognizant of? Bert Nappier : Hey Scot. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s Bert. I\u2019m on a roll here. I\u2019ll keep taking these, yes, I think, the best way to characterize it is how you\u2019ve couched it there. We\u2019d see the environment to flattish in terms of how the U.S. auto business is performing. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. And then pivot to the European business once again, we know our experience in the U.S. has been when you have a spike in gas prices, people tend to often drive less, they need a little less maintenance, because there\u2019s less wear and tear on the vehicles. Because we have an energy centric challenge for a lot of countries that you guys are operating in Europe and what could become a lot worse in the next call it six, nine months? What is your view and what is your history say regarding those markets? Do they act any differently than what we see in the U.S. or is it pretty consistent kind of geography? Paul Donahue : Hey, Scot. This is Paul. I\u2019ll take that. The \u2013 look, the environment we see in Europe in our five years now in that market is very consistent with what we see in the U.S. And look, it\u2019s steady as we\u2019ve seen in the U.S., the automotive aftermarket is incredibly resilient. If there is a recession, which many are predicting, but it remains to be seen. We expect our business to continue to move in a positive direction. So we\u2019re very pleased with our team, with our performance, with our footprint which excludes Eastern Europe and with our performance to date, which has been very, very strong. And as you heard in the quarter Scot, we expanded our footprint first quarter into Spain and certainly expanded our footprint in Germany this past quarter. So we\u2019re in a good place with a great team and with a positive outlook for the balance of the year. Scot Ciccarelli : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Paul Donahue : You bet. Operator : And our next question today comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Paul Donahue : Hey, Bret. Bert Nappier : Hey, Bret, Bret Jordan : Could you talk about, I think you mentioned fill rates improving. But could you talk about sort of where you are on supply chain improvement and obviously a year ago, first half of 2021, there are a lot of supply constraints, but maybe where are we versus sort of target or normal levels? Will Stengel : Yes. It\u2019s Will here. I\u2019ll take that one. So I would characterize global supply chain as stable to slightly improved over the last 100 days. We\u2019ve seen a moderation in our ocean freight rate. I would say that the ports continue to be more congested than average in particular on the East Coast now relative to what we saw early in the year on the West Coast. But the suppliers aren\u2019t experiencing problems, obtaining vessel space, which is a positive development. Lockdowns are moderating over in Asia, which is a positive development. And I think for us as we\u2019ve thought through and worked through these developments, we\u2019ve improved actually how we execute.  So we've rebalanced some of our poor activity. We've rebalanced some of our supplier geographies and we're gaining some nice traction there. So the one thing that I would call out is the transport from port to final destination that is still challenged, whether we're talking rail or freight logistics, but net-net were slightly improved relative to where we were 100 days ago. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And I think you talked about the cadence of the quarter from the sales standpoint. Did you say anything interesting regionally? Is there any real dispersion in U.S. auto? Paul Donahue : We sell nice strengths down the Eastern half of the United States. One could make the case that fuel prices on the west coast impacted that given there's so much more elevated relative to the national average, but the Northeast, the Southeast in our Atlantic region showed nice strength through the quarter. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And the final, I guess any sign of trade down you talked about stable consumer demand, but is there any kind of a mix-shift particularly around the lower end consumer where they're looking for the lower price point option? Bert Nappier : Hey, Bret, it's Bert. I'll take that one and look we're not just \u2013 we're not seeing much evidence of consumers trading down, customers trading down at all. I think the customer's been pretty resilient despite the rising fuel prices and other inflationary pressures. When you look at the auto business, it's non-discretionary to a large degree; you need your car fixed in this environment, particularly with a shortage of new cars and higher use of car prices as well. So customers are focusing on availability and service, which is our sweet spot and we've got product readily available. Same on the industrial side we're not seeing a pull back there. The momentum continues as you saw in our Q2 results. And so we just really continue to focus on as Will talked about supply chain, inventory management and having the right product in the right place. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Bert Nappier : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Hey, good morning guys, thanks. I wanted to circle back on the pricing backdrop. Obviously it's been topical with some of your big peers investing in price. It sounds like you guys aren't really feeling the impact of that yet. I guess first is it still true, you guys really aren't feeling any discernible impact? And then Will, if not using price, you talk through a number of initiatives in you're prepared remarks on the auto side. Can you talk about which of those you expect to drive the most share gains or kind of what you guys are leaning into as you look out to next year and get back to share gains not just recouping some of the underperformance during COVID? Will Stengel : Yes. Daniel, let me see if I can't break down your questions. First piece was, are we seeing any impact from competitive pricing strategies in the market? And I would tell you that we're not seeing an impact from anything that's been announced by competitors as it relates to pricing the market continues to be rational. And as we've talked a lot about here we're doing our own strategic work around pricing to be agile and react to the market and super proud of the team there. The second part of your question was which part of our initiative stack is driving share gains near term and recently? And all of our work around sales force effectiveness obviously is turning into nice momentum. The pricing work is turning into nice momentum and all of our technology investments that's improving the customer experience and making us easier to do business with. And while I talk about, I think your question was U.S. auto specific, all of those initiatives are relevant as we look around the globe. We have flavors and versions of all of those same initiatives which I think is contributing to very nice global broad-based strength. Daniel Imbro : Yes, that's helpful. And then Paul, maybe follow-up on the industrial piece; you guys talked about momentum continuing through the second quarter across all of your end markets. It is still true about half that business is contracted. So you guys have good visibility into the back half of this year. And then just within those end markets and quarter-to-date, are you seeing any signs of weakness among different end markets or any particular concerns you see there? Paul Donahue : No. And you are correct, Daniel. It is about half of our business is under contract and pleased to say we are not seeing any signs of slowdown in our business segments. And certainly we could call out a few that were continuing to see accelerate as we go into the second half. So yes, industrial is performing incredibly well as you've heard throughout this call. Daniel Imbro : Got it. I'll leave it there. Best of luck. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Bert Nappier : Thanks Daniel. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And today's final question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning guys. My first question is just around the outlook for, especially the U.S. NAPA business. Just thinking about the trends and miles driven as gas prices are still very elevated. Do you expect pressure on your business units declining perhaps on a comparable store basis in the U.S. in the back half of the year, as we see some of the moderation and key leading indicators for your business? Bert Nappier : Hey, Seth its Bert. I'll take that, maybe will have a little will can have a little perspective to add to it as well. But look, I think our guidance assumes that we continue to perform, as Paul said as well in the U.S. auto business. It's a dynamic environment out there. You see gas prices dropping and over the last several weeks. So that's a positive in terms of miles driven. We continue to look at that very closely; miles driven were up a little over 1% in May. Most recent data we've seen. And so I think the underlying fundamentals remain very robust for that market. You got the average age of a car up for the fifth consecutive year. You've got all time, low scrap rates. You have pent-up demand for travel. I think, across the U.S. in terms of people wanting to get out and take vacations. And so I think the underlying fundamental for the marketplace is there to continue to perform well. And our guide reflects that. Paul Donahue : I would just add on to that Seth. Bert mentioned gasoline is coming down and it's coming down quickly. It's been its down. I think, I heard this morning, $0.17 in the past week. And what we're seeing is an incredibly resilient consumer. We heard from our friends at AAA 88% of travelers over the July 4th weekend, which gasoline was well over $5 a gallon in that timeframe. 88% of travelers were on the road in their vehicles. So as always the automotive aftermarket is incredibly resilient. I think our consumers are pretty resilient. So we're feeling, good about our NAPA business in the second half. Seth Basham : Got it. Thanks. And then a follow up question on a competitive environment and some of the big competitor\u2019s price investments. You're not seeing any major impact, but as the supply situation improves for WDs, do you expect that change the competitive environment at all? Bert Nappier : I don't think we do Seth. Paul Donahue : It remains to be seen Seth, but look I think the improvements we're seeing in our NAPA business, we saw it firsthand last week. We had 15,000 of our NAPA store owners, auto care centers. The positive momentum we have coming out of that conference. The positive momentum that I hear from our teams and our independent owners our NAPA auto care centers are major accounts. Our guys are in a good place. And I expect that to continue in the second half of the year. Bert Nappier : Seth, I would just, I would also add, I think this is a market where scale really matters. I think we've talked about that before. And so as product comes into the market, I think your scale and your global relationships make a difference. So we feel like that, that's a nice tailwind for us as we move forward. Seth Basham : Good to hear. Thank you very much. Paul Donahue : Okay, thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen I\u2019m showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to the management team for any final remarks. Paul Donahue : Yes, thanks Roco [ph]. And to, all of our participating analyst out there. Thanks for your questions. Thanks for participating. And look, I\u2019ve just closed with our teams are doing great work. We couldn't be more proud of the results we turned in Q2. And as we look ahead to Q3 and the balance of 2022, we continue to believe GPC is really well positioned with the financial strength to continue to support our growth plan. So listen, thanks again for your interest in GPC. Enjoy your summer, and we'll see you in October. Thanks. Bert Nappier : Thanks everyone. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. Now I will turn it over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Before diving into the details of the quarter, we want to say that our hearts go out to our teammates, suppliers, customers and all those affected by the devastating impact of Hurricane Ian in late September. GPC is committed to providing care and support through our GPC Relief Fund and our partners at the American Red Cross. So now turning to the quarter. We are pleased with the continued strength of our results for 2022 and we are proud of the great work by all of our 53,000 GPC teammates who are at the core of our success. Our team delivered record results with double-digit sales and earnings growth driven by the execution of effective strategies and continued resilience of our automotive and industrial businesses. Let\u2019s review several of our Q3 highlights. Total sales of $5.7 billion, up 18% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.23, up 19% from last year. Record quarterly sales for the automotive and industrial segments and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth. Operating margin expansion in both segments and for GPC overall, record quarterly earnings and our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. The ongoing integration of KDG, which continues to create significant value. And finally, continued strong cash flow generation and the further strengthening of our balance sheet. Our teams are executing on key strategic initiatives to deliver market share gains and drive ongoing momentum in our top and bottom line results. We remain agile in navigating a dynamic operating environment created by inflation and economic conditions, the geopolitical landscape and supply chain challenges. We continue to benefit from the competitive advantages of our size and scale and we remain focused on advancing our technology to optimize inventory availability, enhance network productivity and maximize the effectiveness of our pricing strategies. We are making significant progress in our operations through our efforts in all these areas as evident in the expansion of operating margins again in the third quarter. Our automotive and industrial businesses continue to take advantage of several industry tailwinds. In automotive, the increase in year-to-date miles driven and aging car park, limited new car inventory and elevated used car prices are all supportive of healthy demand in the aftermarket. In industrial, the manufacture and economy remains expansionary with PMI holding at greater than 50%, while industrial production just had its ninth straight quarter of growth, up 2.9% year-over-year. Our teams continue to operate well in a challenging environment. And as we wind down the year, we remain focused on driving our strategic initiatives across all of our global operations. This past quarter, we spent considerable time in the field visiting stores and branches, meeting with many of our strategic suppliers and customers and we came away encouraged by the general outlook for continued growth in the automotive aftermarket and industrial space. In addition, during the quarter, our global leadership team met to review our near-term initiatives and collaborate on our long-term strategic roadmap. Our teams are well aligned and we are confident in our strategic plans to deliver long-term sales and earnings growth and margin expansion. Our strong cash flow generation and exceptional balance sheet position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities via investments in both organic and acquisitive growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. So before I pass the call over to Will, we would like to highlight our 2022 Sustainability Report, which we published earlier this month. The new report advances GPC\u2019s long-term sustainability strategy and expands our reporting and disclosure to reflect the extent of our global operations. We do this through a focus on three key areas, including improving diversity, equity and inclusion, reducing carbon emissions and enhancing ESG governance. Two highlights from the report include : the completion of our 2022 employee engagement survey, where we had significant participation across our global teams and received an 80% global engagement score. And secondly, the calculation and disclosure of our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and plans for greenhouse gas reduction programs across our global operations. We believe that our 2022 sustainability report illustrates GPC\u2019s strong ESG strategy and a way forward that underscores our commitment to keeping the world moving. We encourage you to visit the sustainability page on our website for more information on our progress in this important area. So again, we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering on another great quarter of record results. So now, I will turn the call over to Will. Will Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I also would like to thank the global GPC teams as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate the collective focus and hard work to deliver great results around the world. During the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong results across both our automotive and industrial businesses. Our results were driven by solid team execution and disciplined focus on strategic initiatives, which are aligned around our five foundational priorities, talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology. Turning to the performance by segment, total sales for Global Automotive were $3.5 billion in the third quarter, an increase of approximately $285 million or 8.9% versus the same period last year. Our sales performance was relatively consistent in all 3 months of the quarter, and on a comparable basis, sales growth for the quarter increased 9.2%. Our global teams delivered mid single-digit to mid-teens comp growth across each of our operations. And as Paul mentioned, the automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and strong team execution. Global Automotive segment profit was $309 million, and segment operating margin was 8.9%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the same period last year. This performance reflects strong sales growth and operating expense leverage. During the third quarter, our automotive business experienced high single-digit levels of inflation, relatively consistent with the levels we saw in the second quarter. The pricing environment remains rational, and we\u2019re pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our strategic category management initiatives. We expect sales inflation in the fourth quarter to be largely consistent with the third quarter. Now let\u2019s turn to an overview of our automotive businesses by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 11% during the quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. Sales were solid across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories with brakes, filters, fluids and batteries all posting double-digit increases in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with market share growth within the majority of our categories. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double-digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which had low to mid-single-digit growth. Our commercial business saw broad-based strength across all customer segments. Digital channels across all customers also performed well with high single-digit sales growth during the third quarter, reflecting continued traction from investments in our omnichannel experience. U.S. automotive initiatives are advancing well with continued progress in talent, technology investments, customer segmentation, analytics, pricing capabilities and emerging tech. During the quarter, the U.S. Automotive team formally realigned team resources to establish a centralized project management office to coordinate and drive the impact of its business initiative portfolio. As an example of emerging tech efforts, the U.S. Automotive team hosted its first ever EV Day in Atlanta, which included teammates and representatives from various strategic emerging tech partners. We use this opportunity to update internal teammates and collaborate with our electric vehicle and emerging technology suppliers. In addition, as another example of our emerging tech focus, Motion recently established a new electric vehicle battery customer segment based on increasing opportunities presented by the build-out of new battery manufacturing facilities across North America. We continue to build momentum with our EV efforts as we leverage our global footprint business mix and scale to extend our emerging tech leadership position. In Canada, sales grew approximately 15% in local currency during the third quarter with comparable sales growth of 13%. The strong results in Canada are reflective of solid industry fundamentals, team execution and market share gains. As examples of sales effectiveness and data and technology initiatives, Canada continues to improve the customer experience and simplify its business processes with advanced analytics and business intelligence tools. This micro market visibility has increased wallet share and identified growth opportunities as the team executes both organic and inorganic growth initiatives. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter with total sales increasing approximately 20% in local currency and comparable sales up 7%. Growth in Europe is a result of the continued focus on its strategic initiatives, including growth with key customer accounts, the rollout of the NAPA brand across the region and investments in our people, technology and supply chain capabilities. In addition, our bolt-on acquisition efforts continue to create value and add to our local market coverage. Our recent acquisitions in Germany, Spain and Portugal are tracking well with integration plans and the performance and synergy capture has exceeded our internal expectations. Overall, we believe our European strategies have resulted in solid market share gains. In the Asia-Pac automotive business, sales in the third quarter increased approximately 16% in local currency from last year with comparable sales growth of 14%. Both commercial and retail sales performed well with Repco, NAPA and our motorcycle accessories division, all delivering strong profitable growth. Next month, our Australian and New Zealand team will celebrate Repco\u2019s 100-year anniversary, which is a testament to the power of the brand, differentiated customer value proposition and Repco\u2019s position as the leading automotive aftermarket business in the market. Congratulations to our teammates down under on achieving this incredible milestone. Turning to the Global Industrial segment, during the third quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately $570 million or 35.3%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter and comparable sales, which exclude the benefit of KDG, increased approximately 20% versus last year. This marks our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth. The growth was consistent across almost all product categories and major industries serve with particular strength coming from industries such as food, chemicals, aggregate and cement, mining and oil and gas. Industrial segment profit was $243 million or 11.1% of sales representing an 80 basis point increase from the same period last year and a new record for the Industrial segment. The improvement is a result of Motion\u2019s strong sales growth and disciplined operating performance, including the KDG synergy realization. For the third quarter, inflation in the industrial segment held in the low single-digit range, consistent with the levels we have seen throughout the year. Key initiatives contributing to the strong performance in the industrial business include sales programs to capture organic profitable share of wallet with target accounts, data-driven strategic pricing and sourcing programs, technology investments to enhance the omnichannel experience and continued ongoing inventory productivity and footprint optimization initiatives. As an example of footprint optimization efforts, Motion successfully executed its initial fulfillment center and branch optimization initiative in Florida, which is designed to improve the customer experience by offering next-day delivery for an order placed by 3 :00 p.m. In addition to an improved customer experience, the strategy reduces duplicative inventory position, increases available product breadth and increases the efficiency and reduces the cost of our last mile delivery logistics. In addition, Motion opened two new strategically located facilities to grow its value-added automation services with existing and new customers. We are pleased with the initiative results and Motion will continue to methodically roll out these strategies nationwide over time. In addition, the integration of KDG continues to exceed our expectations. The teams are executing well-defined plans with customers, suppliers and teammates to deliver growth and create value as a combined organization. All major work streams are at or ahead of plan, including the colocation and merging of overlapping branches and we are excited for the continued growth opportunities at Motion. Lastly, during the quarter, we were pleased to formally open the GPC Global Technology Center based in Krak\u00f3w, Poland. As part of our strategic investments in talent and technology, the center is designed to help accelerate our technology initiatives and capability building. The technology center will serve as an integrated extension of our existing global team and will focus on areas such as digital, supply chain, data platforms, pricing and cybersecurity as a few examples. With nearly 1 million people living in Cracow and approximately 200,000 students, Krak\u00f3w is a global hub for next-generation tech balance. As we move forward, we\u2019ll consider technology roles in Krak\u00f3w to leverage our scale build capabilities and deliver faster path to value for global technology initiatives. As we execute our organic growth initiatives, we continue to complement them with strategic bolt-on acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create value. During the third quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in key geographies. The M&A pipeline continues to be active and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth and create long-term value. In summary, our strong third quarter and year-to-date results are being driven by supportive industry fundamentals and our key strategic initiatives. While the macro environment remains dynamic, our teams will prioritize our customers as we analyze our market and performance indicators remain agile and strategically invest with discipline and initiatives that extend our global leadership position. With that, I will turn the call over to Bert Nappier. Bert Nappier : Thank you Will and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Paul and Will have shared, we are very pleased with our third quarter results. As I review the key highlights for the third quarter, our comments this morning focused primarily on our adjusted quarterly results, which excludes the non-recurring costs related to the integration of KDG. Total GPC sales were $5.7 billion in the third quarter, up $856 million or 17.8% from last year. Our increase in total sales reflects a 12.7% increase in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation, and a 9.1% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact of foreign currency, in line with our assumptions. Hurricane Ian did not have a material impact on our third quarter financial results. Our gross margin was 34.9%, a 60 basis point decrease compared to the third quarter last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by three key factors : first, moderating supplier incentives, which pressured gross margin by approximately 80 basis points. Second, foreign currency, which impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. And finally, a shift in the mix of our sales based on the strength of our industrial segment, which impacted gross margin by approximately 35 basis points. These headwinds were partially offset by the positive impact of our data-driven pricing and sourcing programs where our teams continue to leverage our growing global scale. These actions and our expertise drove an 85 basis point favorable impact to gross margin in the third quarter. We currently expect our full year gross margin to be in line with our third quarter and 9-month rate. Our total operating and non-operating expenses excluding non-recurring items, were approximately $1.6 billion, up 15% from 2021 and at 27.5% of sales compared to 28% of sales the prior year. We continue to drive leverage across our businesses, and our teams remain focused on effective cost controls and executing our initiatives to produce operational efficiencies. With our strong performance, segment profit was $552 million, up 24%, and our segment profit margin was 9.7%, a 40 basis point increase from last year and up 170 basis points from 2019. We believe the multiyear improvement in our segment margin is the result of transformation to a stronger and more agile company. Our teams have taken actions to streamline our operations and optimize our portfolio of automotive and industrial segments. We have also enhanced our pricing and sourcing capabilities to ensure that we deliver profitable growth. In addition, we\u2019ve generated significant cost savings over the last few years to lower our cost structure. Collectively, these actions, along with continued hard work by our teams, set the foundation for long-term strategic growth. Our third quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $4.9 million or $0.03 per diluted share and non-recurring KDG integration costs was $317 million, or $2.23 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $270 million or $1.88 per diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 19%. This exceptional performance is a result of the crisp execution of our initiatives, which are translating to GPC, delivering accelerated growth and profitability. As we turn to the balance sheet, changes in the key elements of our working capital were generally in line with our sales growth. At September 30, our total accounts receivable were up 17%, with inventory up 15%. Likewise, accounts payable increased 15% from 2021, which also correlates to the increase in inventory. We continue to generate strong cash flow with $454 million in cash from operations in the third quarter and $1.2 billion for the 9 months, up 23% from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range with free cash flow of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We closed the third quarter with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7x. This compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x and highlights our financial strength and flexibility. The key priorities for capital allocation at GPC remain unchanged. As a reminder, these include reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During 2022, we have invested $244 million in capital expenditures, including $91 million in the third quarter, primarily in technology and other projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity. We have also invested $1.6 billion for acquisitions and returned $542 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $369 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $173 million in cash to repurchase 1.3 million shares. The continued strength of our cash flow provides us the ability to manage our capital allocation through all business cycles and has allowed GPC to increase our dividend for 66 consecutive years. Turning to our current outlook for 2022. We are updating our full year guidance and raising adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $8.05 to $8.15, which represents an increase of 16% to 18% from 2021 and up from our previous guidance of $7.80 to $7.95. We expect total sales growth for 2022 to be in the range of 15% to 16%, an increase from 12% to 14%. By business segment, we\u2019re guiding to the following : 7% to 8% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an update from 6% to 8%. This new outlook also reflects 7% to 8% comparable sales growth. For the industrial segment, we are updating our total sales growth outlook to 31% to 32%, an increase from our previous outlook of 26% to 28%. The new outlook includes a 15% to 16% comparable sales increase, which is up from 9% to 11%. We are pleased with the positive momentum in our business in the third quarter and through the 9 months of 2022. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the continued confidence in our execution balanced against the backdrop of a dynamic and uncertain macro environment. Our continued strong cash flow generation provides us with full flexibility to support our growth plans through ongoing investments in the business and return of cash to our shareholders while remaining balanced and disciplined. We look forward to reporting on our fourth quarter and full year results on our next call in February. Thank you, and we will now turn it back over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Thanks. Congrats, guys. Some good numbers. I guess my first question is on the gross margin performance. Could you just give us a little more insight as to by segment in both the quarter given that you\u2019ve got increase in costs, you said it\u2019s passing through price remains rational, but it is starting to fall. So just if you could sort of walk us through each segment as to what\u2019s driving that. Bert Nappier : Sure, Greg. It\u2019s Bert. Thanks for joining. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll start just with the reiteration, we were down 60 basis points to 34.9 on a consolidated basis. The quarter benefited from an 85 basis point improvement in the underlying execution of our day-to-day strategic pricing and sourcing programs. That really reflects the outstanding execution from the team across the environment. I don\u2019t really want to break it down into each segment. I mean we\u2019re all performing well on the underlying core of the business. We\u2019re pleased with the actions on both segments. And the teams are really doing an exceptional job, as you can imagine, in a very, very dynamic environment. That\u2019s hard to see, unfortunately, here in the quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we had three key factors. I\u2019ll reiterate those year-over-year moderation in supplier incentives, that\u2019s 80 bps; currency, which you\u2019re aware at the end of the quarter there we had a lot of movement in currency rates, 30 basis points. And then the industrial performance and the acquisition of KDG, a 35 basis point drag there. That\u2019s a lower gross margin business relative to automotive. But at the same time, we trade that off for a higher margin business. And as you heard Will mentioned in his prepared remarks, an 11.1% margin for industrial for the quarter, which is a record. Just a little more color on the supplier rebates. Those moderated from a year ago when heightened supply chain challenges. We\u2019re constraining things as we\u2019re all aware. The positive is that we now have more inventory. We have a more available base of inventory for our customers, which is a good thing. Another reminder, a year ago, that was a 116 basis point benefit to margin from that issue. So look, as I mentioned, for the full year, we think the gross margin rate for the full year will be in line with the third quarter. But despite all that, we see expansion of margin here in the fourth quarter \u2013 or I\u2019m sorry, here in the third quarter by 40 basis points to 9.7% margin. That\u2019s the third consecutive quarter of overall margin expansion, and we expect that for the fourth quarter as well. When you look at the fourth quarter looking ahead, I think as you look at that number and guiding to the Q3 levels, we really see the two variables there from where we prior \u2013 from our prior guidance being gross margin performance at Motion continuing to outperform our earlier expectations and currency. Greg Melich : Got it. I guess my follow-up would be on that fourth quarter. If I sort of back into it, it seems like there is a pretty meaningful deceleration in organic growth with the new guidance. I think it\u2019s maybe 500 or 600 bps in auto and maybe double that in industrial. Is there \u2013 is that actually happening in October? Or is that just conservatism? Bert Nappier : Let me take that kind of up one level and give you some color on guidance overall. First, I want to thank our teams. We\u2019ve had a great third quarter, first 9 months. I think the business continues to be very balanced and resilient, but like everyone, forecasting in this environment has its challenges. We took a number of factors into account in our guidance raise. Firstly, our performance year-to-date and the industry fundamentals and momentum we see. But obviously, we have to balance that against the macro including, we think, with inflation and pressuring cost. We can\u2019t ignore any of these tightening conditions and undoubtedly, those will impact businesses and consumers at some point. The macro data has been pretty choppy, as you\u2019re aware, but we\u2019re very comfortable and confident in our overall guide with the new guidance range of $8.05 to $8.15. That\u2019s going to have EPS up year-over-year, 16% to 18% on the back of a really, really strong year a year ago. We\u2019re being prudent, I think it\u2019s probably the right way to phrase it. Eyes wide open on things to watch. We\u2019ve got inflation, geopolitical tension, supply chain constraints, effect, fuel and energy prices, all moving around on us. But at the same time, there is probably, Greg, a little modesty here. We outperformed in the fourth quarter a year ago, and we\u2019ve outperformed so far this year, and we\u2019re not necessarily a management team that will continue to count on the same level of outperformance. When I look at the fourth quarter, I\u2019d kind of call your attention to a few things for the fourth quarter guide and the full year. We\u2019ve got incremental foreign currency, as I mentioned, $0.03 headwind in the fourth quarter relative to when we gave you guidance before. The gross margin rate compression that we just discussed and also, we have 1 fewer working day in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s something to be aware of. But look, my dad used to say be baseball ready and that needs to be ready for whatever comes. I think we\u2019re doing that. We\u2019re going to look for additional growth opportunities and efficiency and discipline. And I\u2019m going to let Will give you a little bit more color on the segment side on the sales. Will Stengel : Yes, Greg, maybe just to answer your question, I mean, we\u2019re encouraged by the trends that we\u2019re seeing through October across the global business. So if that\u2019s any indicator, we\u2019re not seeing a slowdown. We\u2019re proud of the teams for continuing to build on that momentum into the fourth quarter. Just maybe some other thoughts. As you think about kind of what\u2019s implied in the Q4, I\u2019d just remind you, Q4 \u201821 for auto had a big comp, high teens. So the guide for auto on a 2 year is kind of close to that 20%. And that holds true for U.S. auto and kind of each of the pieces of global automotive. So still really solid performance. And as I said, encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing through October. Greg Melich : That\u2019s helpful and good luck. Will Stengel : Thank you, Greg. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers. Please go ahead with your question. Christopher Horvers : Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe to follow-up on that a little bit. One of your industrial distributor peers talked about some, I guess, softer tone in certain customer segments when they reported recently. As you were out in the field recently, is there \u2013 are you sensing any of that caution? And do you think it\u2019s maybe just like the tack that you\u2019re taking, like eventually something could happen and we\u2019re being cautious or do you think there is something \u2013 some real change going on in some of your businesses on the industrial side? Paul Donahue : Yes, Chris, thanks. This is Paul. I would tell you, and we have spent a good bit of time in the field late. I traveled with the Motion team I don\u2019t know, a few weeks back. And we spent a good bit of time with that group this week. The overall sentiment from our Motion team, Chris, remains really strong, optimistic. They are seeing increases across just about every customer segment in every product segment. So I\u2019m aware of the other industrial group, you mentioned that reported earlier this week. But I have to tell you, we\u2019re not seeing it on our side, Chris. And I would just remind you, we\u2019re still seeing expansion in PMI, which we generally track pretty closely with through the years anyway. And industrial production came out earlier this week in industrial production, again, post a good result in September. So I would tell you, overall, our Motion team continues to perform at an incredibly high level. And as Will said, early numbers in October point to that continuing well into Q4. Will Stengel : Chris, maybe just some other perspective to add to Paul\u2019s comments, sales cadence was consistent for the industrial team through the quarter, as Paul said, the vast majority, if not all the product categories were growing north of 20% plus, which were high single digits 2 plus 20%. All of our end markets, we\u2019re seeing super strong growth. We track 15 different industries. All are performing very well. We called out a few in the script, equipment machinery, food products, iron steel, automotive, mining, oil and gas. And I\u2019d tell you, geographically, we\u2019re seeing strength pretty broad-based, including Canada and Mexico as well as our service business, fluid power automation conveyance. So are the customers just like everybody trying to predict what happens in 2023, certainly, those discussions happen when we were out in the field. But the backlogs are strong, and the recent trends have been strong. So we feel bullish about certainly closing the year and then coming into next year with some momentum. Christopher Horvers : Thank you for that. Will, I think at a recent conference, you mentioned the ability to take segment margins to the double-digit range. Can you talk a little bit more about that \u2013 do you see that \u2013 is that more of a blended of NAPA and Motion or could you see that potential for the NAPA segment to also reach double digit and what do you think the big drivers are to get there? Bert Nappier : Hi, Chris, it\u2019s Bert. I\u2019ll take that one. Look, I think as the new CFO coming in and taking a look at this business, I\u2019m sitting here looking around and we\u2019re asking ourselves questions about what\u2019s the full potential of the two businesses together. So I know you would appreciate that exercise as the new guy. We\u2019re not ready to give you a target on that. I want to do some homework here over the next several months as we sharpen our pencil around that. But we\u2019re doing that work. I think the historical perspective here has been this business can be a 7% and then an 8% and then we\u2019re marching our way up the chain there. You\u2019ve seen a margin at 9.7% this quarter consolidated which is another improvement in the third consecutive one \u2013 this third consecutive quarter in a row of improvement there. As I look ahead with a fresh set of eyes coming in, I see a tremendous amount of opportunity for things that are within our own control, not necessarily reliant on external. Some of those are underway. Some of those would be sourcing and category management initiatives, which are in early innings, pricing initiatives, which are in early innings. The business demonstrated a great ability through the pandemic to transform continue to be more efficient and lower cost structure, that\u2019s going to continue. And I think there is a tailwind there. We have got two really great businesses with great size and scale. And when you have that kind of power behind you, I think you do have an ability to continue to grow and improve margins. We will have some modernization of our supply chain and DCs that continue. Will talked about that a little bit in his prepared remarks around the Florida facility for Motion. So, there are just a tremendous amount of opportunities. And we owe you to come back and give you some full longer term targets there, but hopefully, that gives you a little perspective as the new CFO. Christopher Horvers : That\u2019s great. Thanks Bert. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Paul Donahue : Chris, you are coming back for another one? I think we just had, Chris. Christopher Horvers : I can ask more questions. I got a lot more. Paul Donahue : I will talk to you later Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. You had mentioned, I think in your automotive comments that you saw growth in all categories, and we just wanted to confirm that if it includes discretionary categories and what you are seeing relative to the more defensive categories? And then just with regards to transaction versus ticket if you saw any meaningful change this quarter versus last quarter in automotive? Will Stengel : Thanks Kate. Thanks for the question. Let me take a pass at that and Bert and Paul will jump in. Maybe just starting at the top, for U.S. auto, consistent growth through the quarter, we have recognized and celebrated a variety of different sales records through the quarter, so super proud of the teams for that. As we mentioned, both DIFM and do-it-yourself, we are strong and positive through the quarter, which is always good to see. If you look at the subsets of the business, the mid-single digit performance from our major accounts in our AutoCare, we had low-double digit to low teens in our fleet and government business. And we had, as we said, mid-single digit retail performance on tough comp. No change in trends from ticket and transactions. We talked about that, I think last quarter, transactions down, ticket up, but that was as we expected, our categories of strength, batteries, filters, brakes, commodities and chemicals. And then we saw really broad-based strength across the geographies, with particular outperformance in our mountain region, which is Texas through Montana and Alaska for our business and then down the eastern part of the United States, including the Northeast Atlantic region and Southeast. So, we saw some strength in our accessories category, which is the retail category for us, a smaller piece of the business, but I think that\u2019s somewhat discretionary in nature, and we saw a nice strength there. So, really strong broad-based performance through the quarter around the business on the U.S. auto side. Paul Donahue : And Kate, I would just add to Will\u2019s comments that a driver of that business is certainly fuel prices. We are seeing fuel prices coming down a bit, which is always a good thing for our auto business. We certainly expect to see miles driven ticking back. People are taking to the roads. And they are a little \u2013 still a little bit reticent to get on mass transit and airplanes. So, all those factors, I believe will continue to bode well for our auto business going into next year. Kate McShane : Thank you. And if I could just ask one follow-up question, I think you mentioned you expect the same inflation, same-SKU inflation in Q4 as what you saw in Q3. And I know you are not talking about 2023 today, but do you have any high-level views about when you could expect to see some moderating of the inflation and how that might impact traffic versus \u2013 or transaction versus ticket next year? Bert Nappier : Hi Kate, it\u2019s Bert. I will take that one. Look, I mean I will kind of point this out, and I will reiterate it. Our expectation, let\u2019s talk about the fourth quarter because that\u2019s a bit of a setup for 2023. Our expectation at this point for inflation for Q4 is that it stays consistent with the Q3 level. And I think in our view that means it\u2019s stabilizing on some level to moderating. However, as many of you know, the inflow of moderating or stabilizing levels of inflation takes some time to flow through supply chain. I think that will lag into 2023. Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of monetary policy action afoot, and that will take some time to have an effect into 2023, but we would anticipate that it would. As we turn the corner into the next year, I think we will see continued pressure on labor costs and on product costs at this point. Again, I mean we are looking several months ahead here. So, that\u2019s a little bit of our initial view. When we think about it from our perspective, it\u2019s a tough and dynamic environment, and our teams are really focused on this and it requires intense focus. Our strategy remains unchanged in that regard as we look ahead. We are going to continue to pass along inflation impacts to protect our gross margin rate. I think we have done a nice job of managing that in a very dynamic environment, and we are going to continue to focus on those category management and pricing actions. So hopefully, that gives you a little color. We are talking about something several months away, but that\u2019s our initial view on that front. Kate McShane : Thank you. Bert Nappier : Thanks Kate. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Bret Jordan : Hey. Good morning guys. Paul Donahue : Good morning. Bret Jordan : On the European automotive, could you talk a bit more about the private label strategy there? What you are seeing as far as consumer acceptance of the NAPA brand and maybe what percentage is in the mix now and how the margin delta sets up versus the legacy product that you were selling? Paul Donahue : So, Bret, I will take a stab at this one, and let the other guys jump in. I was with our European team all last week over in Spain and pleased to report that the NAPA brand rollout continues to expand across Europe, not only in the new markets, we will be launching in Spain and Portugal later this year, early next year, but also expanding the number of product categories that we are currently positioning under the NAPA brand. The acceptance, I have to tell you, Bret, has been beyond expectation. All that said, it\u2019s still about 10%, give or take, of our total business. So, it\u2019s meaningful. But look, we are still \u2013 we still have a long way to go, and before NAPA becomes a real dominant piece of our overall business over there. So, very pleased with where we find ourselves. And look, there is a lot of discussion around Europe, a lot of concern around Europe. But I can tell you, Bret, you saw the numbers, you heard Will talk about the numbers in Q3, another really, really strong quarter, up 20% plus local currency. And pleased to tell you that despite all the noise through the first couple of weeks of October, business in fourth quarter looks good as well. So, we continue to be very bullish about our European business. Bret Jordan : You just answered my second question, but just \u2013 to go back to the first half of the first \u2013 on the October trend in Europe. But how does the margin shake up in Europe on the private label mix, obviously, a different supply chain? Will Stengel : Yes. Bret, it\u2019s neutral. Generally speaking, on average it\u2019s neutral. So, either a good guy or a bad guy. And I would just add to Paul\u2019s comments, I figured you asked a follow-up. But as he said, we are continuing to see really good strength broadly in each one of our countries, Germany, mid-teens growth, Benelux, low-double digits, mid single-digit growth in the UK and the French market. So, as Paul said, NAPA is a big part of each one of those country strategies and initiatives and they have got nice traction delivering super nice results. So, good to see. Bret Jordan : If it\u2019s margin neutral is the long-term goal to get a better cost of goods there to get margin out of it. I mean what\u2019s the point of the initiative, if it\u2019s not more profitable? Will Stengel : That\u2019s the strategy over time, obviously, getting the brand into the market, putting it into the line logic and penetrating the market as kind of step one and then over time as it develops the following, we will revisit that. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Bret. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. Thank you. Just a question on the automotive side. And Paul, you had mentioned that new vehicle supply and elevated used car prices have been tailwinds, but you started to see used car pricing rolling over and new vehicle supply could begin to improve. So, I mean how much of a headwind do you think that could be as you plan your business for the next few years? Paul Donahue : Yes. I appreciate you pointing that out, Liz. We are seeing used car prices coming down a bit. I honestly don\u2019t see that being a huge impact on our business overall. We look at \u2013 look, the key drivers for our business have always been and will continue to be, I believe the average age of the vehicle on the road, which is at a new record again in this year over 12 years. Miles driven is always going to be a key element for us. And we are seeing an uptick in miles driven as fuel prices moderate just a bit. And I think you are going to see that as folks do begin to return to the workplace and are again, a bit hesitant to get on mass transit. I think we will continue to see that drive forward. So, look, in terms of new car sales, Liz, it\u2019s a little bit of a double-edged sword. We need those new car sales because 5 years from now, those are going to be our customers as they come to the aftermarket. So, if new car sales tick up a bit, that\u2019s not going to have a big impact on our business in the short-term. In the long-term, it\u2019s a good thing for us. And if we go back to the 17 million vehicle new car vehicles produced each year sold each year, that\u2019s not a bad thing for us at all because that\u2019s our future customers. So, I think any way you slice it, the \u2013 our business \u2013 our U.S. automotive business and our global automotive business is in a good place and the fundamentals are very sound. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. Yes, that makes sense. And just a quick follow-up on the auto side. Will had mentioned you are pleased with the market share growth in the majority of categories, what are the categories where you aren\u2019t pleased with your market share? And what do you view as the biggest opportunities? Will Stengel : Look, I am looking down our list, but I am not sure I can call out one where we are not pleased. I mean we are seeing really broad-based strength across all the product categories. So, I can\u2019t call out one where we are disappointed. Obviously, if there are some inventory opportunities, those would be \u2013 that will be the commentary where we would want to do better, but I am not sure that\u2019s a function of the demand drivers or kind of our strategy. So, sorry for not being more helpful, but I think that\u2019s the honest truth. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay. Alright. Thanks very much. Paul Donahue : Okay. Thanks. Thanks Liz. Operator : Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. Paul Donahue : Good morning Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : How are doing? So, the industrial business is obviously very strong. And we know that historically, it\u2019s followed some of the broader macro factors and index changes typically with about a six-month to nine-month lag or so. And Paul, I think you already pointed out how PMI is still positive, but obviously, it\u2019s moderated quite a bit. So, I guess the question is, how should we kind of net out today\u2019s strong growth versus at least what appears to be a pretty significant moderation in that, let\u2019s call it, broader macro trend? Paul Donahue : So Scot, thanks for the question. And you are right to point out that the moderation in PMI. But again, anything over 50, if we are growing and we continue to grow. That said, the motion footprint Scot, is different today than we were historically. So, we have expanded our footprint into segments like conveyance, conveyors and all things around that product category, which as we have seen the distribution center model, expand across the U.S. We have seen great expansion in that product category, automation and robotics is a growing double digit \u2013 strong-double digit category for us, and we believe we have huge upside in that area. So, if you look at the motion of today, Scot, it\u2019s different than it was 3 years to 5 years ago when we were primarily a power transmission and industrial supplies-type business. And that has been intentional from our team. And I think will shelter us going forward and will give us a leg up as we go forward if we do see continued softening because Scot, you are not alone. We continue to have people and analysts and investors question the industrial business and do we believe that we will continue to see the great growth that we have seen out of that business in the last couple of years. And certainly, while we have shown 20% comp growth in Q3, we are not going to stay at 20%. We are realistic enough to know that, but we also do believe that that\u2019s a business that we can continue to grow 6% to 8% year-after-year-after-year regardless of what PMI and industrial production numbers might call out. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Carolina Jolly with Gabelli. Please go ahead. Carolina Jolly : Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Paul Donahue : No problem. Good morning. Carolina Jolly : Good morning. So, just a quick question around cash flow, working capital. Your AP to inventory ratio is probably around 130% now. That\u2019s definitely higher compared to 2019. Has that been a structural shift since you extended terms in Europe, or do you think we will see that kind of revert to your historic\u2026? Bert Nappier : No, I don\u2019t think it has anything necessarily to do with Europe. When you look at the landscape \u2013 this is Bert, by the way, I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with the European landscape. Look, the business has changed fundamentally over the last year. We have a large acquisition of KDG in the Motion business. But when we look at our working capital metrics, we are very pleased with where we are. We have had a six-day reduction in our cash conversion cycle during the course of the year. So, we are pleased with that. Managing payables well. DSO is down, managing inventory very well as well. And so I don\u2019t think there is anything that I would call out as a structural shift. It\u2019s something that we stay very focused on a day-to-day basis, given the unlock of cash as we are smarter about how we do that. Look, as we look ahead, I mean nobody is perfect. We do have opportunities to optimize on the inventory side, and we will continue to do that. And we have got great teams here that are focused on that as well. So, I wouldn\u2019t place any overreliance or over-indexing on any one factor. Bottom line is we have had very strong cash flow through the course of the year. We will have a great result for the rest of the year in terms of free cash flow and for the full year. And that takes us back to our long-standing ability to continue to be very disciplined and thoughtful on capital allocation and reinvest in the business, which we will continue to do because we see great opportunities there. And at the same time, return capital back to shareholders, which as you all know, we have a long-standing history of doing so. Carolina Jolly : Great. Thanks. So, it doesn\u2019t sound like this is a temporary benefit you are seeing right now, but it\u2019s corporate initiatives that have been working. Bert Nappier : No. I wouldn\u2019t point to a temporary benefit. I think we are very consistently \u2013 I know some of this predates me, but consistently showing improvement across cash conversion and our working capital elements. Carolina Jolly : Great. Thanks. And then just a quick second one. Your DIY business seems to have been doing very well performing potentially just given what have been said in the second quarter call. Can you talk about why you think that is? Is it the digital factor that you talked about in the beginning of the call or just any commentary there? Will Stengel : Yes, Carolina, it\u2019s Will. I think you nailed it. We are super proud. We have made a lot of progress on all things, technology and digital for our retail business all around the globe, but in particular, U.S. automotive and in Canada and investments in the catalog, investments in search, investments in kind of product data quality have been making a real difference. So, more work to do, but proud of the progress the teams are making. Carolina Jolly : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. End of Q&A: Paul Donahue : Yes. Thanks Dave. Just to all of our folks out there today, we appreciate your questions and everyone joining the call. Look, we are very pleased with another record quarter at Genuine Parts Company. We could not be more proud of the great work done by all of our GPC teammates around the world. We continue to be excited that with the momentum that our business is generating. And I would just conclude by saying the future continues to be very, very bright for Genuine Parts Company. So, you all have a great day, and we look forward to chatting again in February. Thank you. Operator : The call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report the GPC team capped off a record setting year with a strong fourth quarter highlighted by double-digit sales and earnings growth coupled with continued margin expansion. We're incredibly proud of the progress in our operations and thankful to our teammates across the globe for their ongoing commitment to excellence.  With the support of strong industry fundamentals and resilience of our automotive and industrial businesses, our teams were focused on executing key initiatives to drive sales growth faster than the market, improved gross margin and enhance operational efficiencies. As a result, we delivered in several key areas in the fourth quarter and full year.  A few highlights in the fourth quarter would include total sales of $5.5 billion up 15%. And our seventh consecutive quarter of double digit sales growth. Segment margin of 9.5%, up 80 basis points from the prior year and adjusted earnings per share of $2.05 up 15% from 2021 and our 10th consecutive quarter of double digit earnings growth.  For the full year, our strong quarterly performance drove record total sales of $22.1 billion up 17% which follows a 14% increase in 2021. Segment margin of 9.4% up 60 basis points from 2021. Adjusted earnings per share of $8.34 up 21% from the prior year, and a new GPC record. And strong cash flow with cash from operations up 17% and free cash flow up 14% from 2021 levels. Reflecting on the record year which followed and outstanding 2021, we are confident that our transformation efforts, including the streamlining of our businesses to an automotive and industrial centric business, along with our ongoing strategic initiatives has been highly successful. Throughout 2022, our teams have navigated the dynamics of the macro economy and have continued to deliver market share gains while delivering positive momentum across our core businesses.  We continue to make significant investments in talent and technology to maximize the impact of our key initiatives. As examples, we made solid progress to advance our pricing strategies and optimize our supply chain and network footprint. Our execution in the field has proven effective in driving poor improvement in gross margin and SG&A as well as parts availability, all of which provide additional opportunities for us in the future. As we build on the competitive advantages of our size and scale, we continue to look for strategic M&A opportunities to further boost our product and service offerings and expand our automotive and industrial footprint. As you will hear from Will, last year's acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group, has been transformational for our industrial segment. KDG had a significant impact on our industrial performance in 2022. And as elevated our capabilities as a premier industrial solutions provider. Our global automotive teams were also active with acquisitions, including geographic expansion in Europe, with the addition of operations in both Spain and Portugal. For the year, we added 138 net new stores across our global footprint, with the U.S. and Europe leading the way. Looking ahead, we have a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets, and M&A remains an important element of our global growth strategy. As we turn our attention to 2023. While the macro environment remains uncertain, we are confident in our strategic plans to drive ongoing market share gains, with sustained sales and earnings growth, continued margin expansion and strong cash flow. Looking at the operating environment more broadly, our automotive business is benefiting from several tailwinds, including the geographic diversity of our markets. The increase in vehicle miles driven an aging vehicle fleet and limited new car inventory. These tailwinds are driving steady levels of demand in the aftermarket, with particular strength in the DIFM segment. In industrial, we continue to see solid demand trends with new and existing customer activity and reshoring threat trends, each presenting growth opportunities. We believe this strong performance in our industrial business reflects the diversity of our product and service offerings, as well as our end markets, which all performed well in the fourth quarter. In addition, as you'll hear from Will, our growing capabilities and industrial solutions, including automation, fluid power and convenience, are proving to be differentiators for our business. Collectively, we believe these strong fundamentals, combined with a rock solid balance sheet, position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to continue to pursue strategic growth opportunities through both organic and inquisitive investment, while also returning capital to shareholders. So before I close, I'd like to remind our investor community that we will be hosting an Analyst and Investor day on Thursday, March 23, here at our headquarters in Atlanta. We will be sharing more about our strategic initiatives and provide an update to our long-term financial targets. We look forward to hosting this event next month and hope to see you all here in Atlanta. We have an exceptional 2022, which included celebrating our 95th year of operations. Our accomplishments as one GPC team are evident in this milestone year. And we are proud to lead a company with such a long and rich history that differentiates GPC across all of our marketplaces. But now I'll turn the call over to Will. Will Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I also would like to thank the global GPC team for an exceptional year in 2022, and the hard work to take care of our customers every day. Around the world, our teams are aligned on our strategic initiative pillars that include talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging tech.  Investment and focus in these areas translate into a better customer experience, profitable growth, operational excellence and a differentiated team culture. There in 2022, all of our teams made significant initiative progress, and we look forward to sharing more details about our progress and outlook at our upcoming investor day in March. Turning our attention to the fourth quarter performance total sales for the global automotive segment were $3.4 billion, an increase of approximately $243 million or 7.6% versus the same period in 2021. Our sales growth was consistent through the quarter with a solid finish in December to close the year. On a comparable basis automotive sales growth for the quarter increased 8.2%. Our global automotive teams delivered mid-single digit to low digit comp growth across each of our operations. As Paul mentioned, the automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and team execution. For fiscal year 2022, Global Automotive segment sales was $13.7 billion, an increase of 8.9% from 2021. Global automotive segment profit in the fourth quarter was $295 million and segment operating margin was 8.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the same period in 2021. For the year Global Automotive segment profit was $1.2 billion and segment operating margin was 8.7%, an increase of 10 basis points from 2021 and up 110 basis points from 2019. During the fourth quarter, our automotive business experienced mid to high single digit levels of inflation, relatively consistent with the levels we saw in the second and third quarters. We continue to be pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our category management strategic initiatives. Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the U.S. automotive sales grew approximately 10% during the fourth quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 6%. Sales were strong across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories, with batteries, motor oil, tools and equipment, heavy duty and brakes all posting strong growth in the quarter. The team navigated various extreme weather events in December and kept teammates safe while taking care of customers. Both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which had low single digit growth. Our commercial business saw sales growth across all customer segments, including notable strength with our fleet and government channel and mid-single digit growth in our NAPA AutoCare Network. Over the course of the year, we grew our NAPA AutoCare Network of professional repair centers to record 18,500 customers, an increase of 670 locations, and further expanded our competitive advantage as America's largest network of parts and care. We also continue our investment in the industry as we trained over 34,000 technicians in 2022 and actively support 900 technicians in our apprenticeship program. Other select accomplishments in 2022 include investments in talent, and enhancements to our data analytics and technology capabilities. These enhancements have improved our insights and are driving data driven decisions around strategic pricing and sourcing, which has nicely contributed to margin expansion performance. We've also improved our inventory visibility and are taking action to ensure the right part is in the right place at the right time. We will continue to invest in these capabilities as we move forward. For the full year our U.S. Automotive business grew sales by approximately 11% with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. We're extremely pleased with the share gains and record results in 2022. In Canada sales grew approximately 14% in local currency during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 12%. The results in Canada continue to reflect solid industry fundamentals, strong team execution and market share gains. Our field oriented data analytics to assess and prioritize market customer and network opportunities has delivered returns. In partnership with global teams, the Canadian business also made progress with next drive powered by NAPA, our leading offering that positions repair shops to service hybrid and electric vehicles. In a short period of time, the program has certified over 50 EV technicians, part specialists and service advisors, with plans to have 100 certified service centers and nearly 400 trained part specialists over the next few years.  For the year, our Canadian business grew sales approximately 15% in local currency, with comparable sales growth of approximately 13%. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter, with total sales increasing approximately 22% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 10%. For the year our European team delivered sales growth of 19% with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. The strong growth in Europe continues to be driven by solid execution and coordinated teamwork across Europe. As examples, during 2022 our European team won business with numerous key customer accounts and continue to gain market share with the rollout of our differentiated NAPA offering across the region.  Sales of NAPA product in Europe reached nearly \u20ac300 million, an annual increase of over 50% from the prior year and now positively contribute to profitability. The impressive growth is a testament to the global strength of the NAPA brand. The next drive rollout is also strong in Europe with approximately 150 certified workshops across 7 countries. In addition, our European bolt-on acquisition efforts continue to create value and expand and add density to our market footprint. Despite a challenging environment, the performance over the last few years has been strong in Europe and the momentum has continued to start 2023. In the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the fourth quarter increased approximately 10% in local currency from the same period in the prior year with comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. For the year, our Australian team delivered sales growth of 12% and comparable sales growth of approximately 9%. Both commercial and retail sales continued to perform well with Repco, NAPA and our motorcycle accessories division delivering profitable growth and share gains. The team continued its impressive performance in 2022 with a 3-year sales stack of more than 30%. Repco's 100-year anniversary in 2022 marked an amazing achievement for this team, and it was only fitting that the team delivered another outstanding year. Turning to the Global Industrial segment. During the fourth quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $478 million or 29.6%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter with average daily sales growth at or above 30% for all three months of the quarter. Comparable sales growth, which excludes the benefit of KDG, increased approximately 17% in the fourth quarter versus last year. This marks our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth.  As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of KDG in the first quarter of 2022. As a result, going forward, KDG sales growth will be included in comparable sales growth. The strong sales growth at Motion during the quarter was broad-based with double-digit growth across nearly all product categories and major industries served with particular strength coming from industries such as automotive, oil and gas, food products and aggregate and cement. For the year, sales at Motion were $8.4 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 33.2%. Industrial segment profit in the fourth quarter was $230 million or 11% of sales, representing a 150 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement at Motion is a result of strong and disciplined sales growth and operating performance, including the KDG synergy realization. For the year, Global Industrial segment profit was approximately $887 million, and segment operating margin was a record 10.5%, an increase of 110 basis points from 2021 and up 240 basis points from 2019.  In 2022, the Industrial segment now represents over 40% of GPC total profit, up 8 percentage points since 2021. For the fourth quarter inflation in the Industrial segment held in the low single-digit range consistent with the levels we've seen throughout the year. The strong financial performance at Motion is a direct result of their customer and sales intensity, focused strategic initiatives and operating rigor.  During the year, we enhanced our selling capabilities by further leveraging data and technology and continue to expand our value-added solutions offering for our customers. These solutions include products and services in categories like automation, conveyance, fluid power and repair. These categories now collectively represent approximately $1 billion in annual revenue promotion. In addition, our strategic initiatives around pricing, category management and supply chain are driving increased productivity and profitability, which is reflected in the strong margin expansion delivered in 2022. As we execute on our organic global growth initiatives, we continue to complement them with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. During the fourth quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. We also continue to make progress in integrating our strategic acquisition of KDG with Motion. When we announced this acquisition in January of 2022, we communicated a plan for approximately $50 million in annual run rate synergies to be achieved over a 3-year period. We're pleased to report that thanks to the incredible teamwork for many, Motion realized over $30 million in synergies in just the first year with more expected in 2023 and 2024.  Our acquisition pipeline is active, and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth and create long-term value. In summary, our team delivered an exceptional fourth quarter and record year for Genuine Parts Company. All our business units and geographies exceeded internal expectations, driven by supportive industry fundamentals and the focused execution of our key strategic initiatives. We're excited to build on our momentum, and we look forward to another great year in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Bert Nappier : Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very proud of our teams and our outstanding performance, and I'm pleased to share the key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year results. My comments this morning focused primarily on quarterly and full year adjusted results, which exclude nonrecurring items that I'll cover in more detail shortly.  Total GPC sales were up 15% or $720 million to $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase reflects an 11.1% improvement in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation and an 8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 4.2% unfavorable impact of foreign currency, which was essentially in line with our assumption for the quarter.  Sales for the full year were $22.1 billion, up 17.1% from 2021. As we continue to invest in organic and acquisitive growth initiatives for both of our segments, it was encouraging to see our core business combined with acquisitions, including KDG, which added more than $1 billion in revenues for 2022 drive strong sales throughout the year.  Our gross margin expanded approximately 50 basis points in the fourth quarter to 35.7%, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our pricing and sourcing initiatives that Will mentioned. These initiatives, along with others, contributed approximately 160 basis points of core gross margin improvement. These gains were partially offset by a few key factors : first, moderating year-over-year supplier incentives pressured gross margin by approximately 30 basis points; second, a shift in the mix of our sales based on the strength of our industrial business impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points; finally, foreign currency and inflation impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points.  With a strong fourth quarter, gross margin for the full year was 35.1%, slightly above our expectations and essentially in line with the prior year. Our performance on gross margin reflects an excellent job by our team, executing our strategies given the very dynamic market challenges. Our total operating and non-operating expenses in the fourth quarter, excluding adjustments, were approximately $1.6 billion, up 16.6% from 2021 and a 28.7% of sales compared to 28.3% of sales in the prior year. Our expenses were up in the quarter, primarily due to inflation-driven increases in freight costs and overall investments in IT initiatives across our business units.  For the year, total expenses were $6.2 billion, up 16.2% at a 27.9% of sales, a 20 basis point improvement from 2021. Despite ongoing cost pressures in the fourth quarter, we continue to drive leverage on strong core sales growth across our businesses and execute on our initiatives to produce operational efficiencies.  Segment profit in the fourth quarter was $526 million, up 25%, and our segment profit margin was 9.5%, an impressive 80 basis point increase from the same period in 2021. For the full year, segment profit was $2.1 billion, up 25% on a 17% sales increase. Our segment profit margin was 9.4%, a 60 basis point improvement from the prior year and up 160 basis points from 2019, which we believe demonstrates our transformation to an even stronger company and our ability to consistently perform through dynamic economic conditions.  As outlined in our earnings release, our fourth quarter results include three adjustments. The first item relates to a $29 million adjustment to remeasure our product liability reserve. Secondly, we incurred approximately $13 million of costs related to the acquisition and integration of KDG. The third item relates to an $11 million loss on the divestiture of our remaining minority interest investment in S.P. Richards, which was finalized in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, our non-recurring items include these fourth quarter adjustments as well as the 12-month impact of costs related to KDG and a gain on the sale of certain real estate recorded in the second quarter. Our fourth quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $40 million or $0.28 per diluted share in nonrecurring items I just discussed, was $292 million or $2.05 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $256 million or $1.79 per diluted share in 2021, an increase of 15%.  For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.2 billion or $8.34 per diluted share, an increase of 21% from 2021. Reported net income was $1.2 billion or $8.31 per diluted share. The continued execution of our initiatives allowed us to deliver back-to-back double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2022 and 2021. With strong earnings growth and improved working capital, we generated $222 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and $1.5 billion for the full year, a 17% increase from 2021. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, up 14% from 2021, and we closed the fourth quarter and year with $2.2 billion in available liquidity.  Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7 times, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times and highlights our financial strength and flexibility. Our strong performance has allowed us to stay focused on four key priorities for capital allocation, including the reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  For the year, we invested $340 million in capital expenditures, including $96 million in the fourth quarter, primarily in technology and other projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity. We also invested $3 billion investment in KDG and returned $719 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $496 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $223 million in cash used to repurchase 1.6 million shares. Our continued strong cash flow generation provides us the ability to manage our capital allocation through all business cycles. Turning to our outlook for 2023. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.80 to $8.95, which represents an increase of 6% to 7% from adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2022. Our outlook for earnings growth is driven by our expectations for continuous sales growth and another year of margin expansion.  We expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. As we look at the business segments, we are guiding to the following : 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with a 4% to 6% increase in comparable sales. We would add that our outlook for Industrial assumes a much stronger first half relative to the third and fourth quarters of 2023. Turning to a few other items of interest. We will continue to drive growth through the reinvestment in our business and M&A. We currently expect CapEx to be in the range of $375 million to $400 million in 2023, reflecting incremental opportunities in technology and supply chain, among others. We also continue to have a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets, and we'll continue to seek additional bolt-on acquisitions wherever they create value for us.  In 2023, we will continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.80 per share annual dividend for 2023, representing our 67th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 6% increase from the $3.58 per share paid in 2022 and is above our 20-year average increase of 5.8%.  Our total shareholder return performance of approximately 27% in 2022 placed GPC in the top 10% of the S&P 500. Taken together, we delivered sales growth of 17% and adjusted EPS growth of 21%, so a tremendous year in 2022. Our teams worked hard for these achievements, and we enter 2023 with strong momentum and are well positioned to continue to take share and deliver through an uncertain macro environment. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the year. In closing, as both Paul and Will have mentioned, we look forward to hosting our Investor Day on March 23. We are excited to provide further insights on key growth initiatives, and long-term financial targets and are confident you will find the day informative and productive. We'd love to see you here in Atlanta. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you share some more thoughts on -- in terms of the cadence of the year? I know you talked about the first half being stronger on the industrial side from a comp perspective. I was curious, if you did add KDG into the 4Q comp base, like how accretive would that be? Or how accretive is KDG entering the comp base in 2023? And then on the margin front, do you expect margin expansion both segments in 2023? Bert Nappier : Thanks, Chris. It's Bert. I'll take that one. I think in terms of the cadence of the year and maybe I'll just pull it up a level and talk about the guidance in general, sure you can appreciate the forecasting environment has its challenges right now, particularly with the mixed macro signals. We're very comfortable with our outlook, 4% to 6% top line, driving EPS up 6% to 7%, and in our range of $8.80 to $8.95. And we do expect margin expansion. That will come from both segments.  We see industrial having a little bit more upside on margin expansion in the auto business, but we'll see nice improvement on both. When we looked at our guidance and talking about the cadence, we really try to be as thoughtful as we can in this environment. We've got solid industry fundamentals for both businesses. We have really good momentum in both businesses coming out of 2022, but we've had two exceptional years. And I think we're in an environment where we all expect, not only GPC, but others growth to moderate a bit and normalize. And I think that's still good, and I think what we're doing this year and what we're forecasting for 2023 is a good outcome. There are headwinds, and we're staying very prudent with our eyes wide open on the key factors that are out there to watch. We can't ignore that there's recessionary pressure and inflation in the geopolitical landscape around the world are all things we're watching. As we look at the year, we really kind of broke it into two halves. The automotive grows consistently across the quarters. So I think the cadence will stay pretty nice across the year and a few halves are 4 to 6 in both halves. On the industrial, we're a little stronger in the first half, more high single-digit outlook for the first half for industrial and on the second half, more low single digit. And that's really just some of the uncertainty on that side of the business with some decelerating PMI numbers and things like that. So that's what we can see right now, a little stronger view into the first half and a little less clarity on the second half. And we think that lines up nicely for the full year. Again, KDG has been accretive to the business for the full year. I think you saw in our release and our commentary that we had a nice synergy benefit from KDG, and we'll continue to get good synergy benefits as we look into 2023. So we like that acquisition. It's been a tremendous expansion of capability for the Motion business, and our team at Motion has done an absolutely brilliant job of integrating and executing that acquisition.  So all that taken together, I think we feel really good about where we are. We're very bullish on GPC, and our size, scale and momentum across both segments position us to be successful. And we're going to watch the landscape and continue to stay ready for what comes at us as the macro environment continues to move. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And my follow-up question is on the Motion side. You have a number of different end markets that you pursue, and I know there's some weakness in some of the consumer areas out there on the durable side and you have some of your peers talking about that weakness. So can you help us understand, one, are you seeing any indications of weakness within Motion? And two, how is your mix sort of split out at a more higher level, the capital goods versus sort of consumer discretionary items versus more commodity and sort of ag type businesses? Will Stengel : Yes, Chris, it's Will. Let me see if I can add some color to that. So as we commented in the prepared remarks, we really do continue to see very broad-based strength across our end markets to give you some perspective. I mean we have, call it, 15 different industries that we would describe as our top industries. The range of performance for the fourth quarter and the industries range from high single digits to over 35%.  So -- and then I think we said in our comments through the quarter, the 30% per month comp where growth rate was pretty consistent as well. So it's consistent and broad. This is a B2B business. So it is quite industrial and less consumer-oriented. There are a couple categories or industries here that perhaps you could extend to a broader consumer dynamic, lumber and wood be one, things around the construction industries. Those, if we had to point out one area of weakness to start the year, we saw some relative weakness there. I don't know if that's residential, commercial, real estate markets changing on us. But again, generally, it's a very industrial, non-consumer oriented B2B type of business that's very well diversified. Paul Donahue : Yes. And Chris, I would just add. I think as you look at our more traditional end markets, food products, iron and steel, aggregate, automotive, all up well into the double digits in Q4. So as both Will and Bert had said, we remain incredibly bullish about our industrial business. I'm pleased to say, we're seeing double-digit growth right out of the blocks here in Q1. So yes, we're going to -- we're just going to keep on pressing forward. And look, there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the future. You've got manufacturing returning to the U.S., a lot of onshoring, reshoring. You've got a lot of investments in semiconductors, energy, battery storage, mining, all of which play to our strength. Christopher Horvers : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Kate McShane : Hi, thanks. Good morning. And thanks for taking our questions. I just had two questions. One with regards to operating expenses and some of your commentary around CapEx. I just wondered with regards to operating expenses in '23, what you're anticipating for freight and investments in IT? And how that will look in '23 versus '22? And if there are some examples of the ongoing tech investment in the CapEx spend that was noted today? Will Stengel : Thanks, Kate. Appreciate the question and give you some color on '23 as we're looking at OpEx and CapEx side. On the OpEx, we are expecting a little bit of deleverage next year. We're going to invest in the cycle here, really focused on the long term on tech and talent. I know you asked about freight. We will see a little pressure there in inflationary pressure like we saw in the fourth quarter on freight, but we expect that to abate as we get into the second half of the year.  But back on our two big investments for next year, tech and talent, it's a competitive marketplace out there, and we're thinking about the long term. So on the talent side, we're making some smart investments in the business with our teams. We'll see a mid-single-digit wage increase this year a tiny bit higher than 2022, and we're going to absorb some costs, particularly on the health care side. Health care inflation is pretty prolific, and we're going to absorb some of that cost at corporate. So we think those are the right investments for our team. The impact of 2023 of that basket of activities is about 30 basis points of deleverage on SG&A. And on the IT side, we're making investments that we need to make in the business to improve our capabilities, and this is really about modernizing our platforms. These are investments in data analytics, AI and new systems and some of those are pivoting to cloud-based systems, and those costs can't be capitalized.  So we feel good about those investments and what they do for our business. It allows us to go faster. And those investments we think driving leverage -- will be driving leverage outside of those investments and focus on efficiencies. So if you take those out, we'd be levering the business. The IT investment is about 30 basis points as well and our guide reflects all of this. And so we feel good about that as well. On capital, we'll see a little bit of an increase in capital next year, not outsized increase at the low end of our range, 10%. Again, we're very energized about where we're focused on the business in terms of opportunities for automation and modernization of DCs in the supply chain, and again, on IT. There's IT as platform investments and things that we want to do that we see benefit in. Many of those projects on the supply chain allow us to consolidate and close old DCs, and you can imagine that's kind of big benefit. And so taken all together, we think these are the right things to do for next year. We're still expecting margin expansion and a topline guide of 6% to 7%. So we think all of that together makes the right sense for where we are. Kate McShane : Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Melich : Thanks. Just wanted to clarify that last question, and then I had a follow-up on inflation demand. The 30 and the 30 bps or 60 bps of OpEx headwind, presumably that's offset by more than 60 bps of gross margin expansion, and what\u2019s driving that? Bert Nappier : Yes. So on the margin side, we're going to carry the momentum that we had in the fourth quarter. Our teams are doing absolutely reliant job of executing our core strategies on pricing and sourcing capabilities. I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about a 160 basis point increase in the fourth quarter just from the execution of category management, pricing and sourcing activities, that's going to continue. We expect that to continue into 2023, and so that success is what we have in our forecast.  We're looking for gross margins to be up in the range of 20 to 40 basis points for 2023. We don't really see a lot of headwind there. Anything in terms of what we're looking at from FX or inflation or any of that, it's pretty negligible at this point. So we're bullish on our execution of our gross margin activities and that helps us expand margin overall.  The SG&A impact on those two investment side are offset by other efficiencies. So when you look at the full year, we expect deleverage of 30 to 40 basis points in total. I gave you 60 basis points of deleverage, and so you'll see that we're making some ground up in driving leverage outside of those two investment categories where we can be more efficient and smarter in the business. Greg Melich : Got it. And then my question on top line isn't -- inflation last year, I think in the Paul what you said it was mid-single to high single, so let's call it 6% or 7% in auto and low singles in industrial. What's in your assumption this year when you did your 4% to 6% guide for each business? Paul Donahue : Yes. So inflation, just to kind of talk about it trend-wise, our view is that it moderated in the fourth quarter. It ticked down slightly from Q3, and that monetary policy in the U.S. is working. It's having an effect around the world, but it does take some time all about the flow through supply chain and through the businesses. So as you said, Q4 and FY '22 inflation levels overall were mid-single digits. High single digits in auto and low single digits in industrial.  And as we look to '23, we expect for it to continue to moderate for the full year. We think monetary policy works and will work. We were at a peak of 9.1% in June. We had 7 straight months of easing. And when we look at that, the way we kind of thought about our forecast for the full year is that the full year would be at a low single-digit all up, remaining at low single digits for industrial and low single digit for auto.  That obviously ticks down across the course of the year. So we step down Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 as monetary policy continues to have an impact. Again, it's a little bit of a wildcard, and we have to make an assumption when we give our guide, which is what we've done. So we'll still be watching the effect of monetary policy and other actions, but that's our assumption based. Q1, just to be specific, we'll tick down from where we are to mid-single digit, I think, for auto. Industrial stays at low single digit and all up mid-single digits in Q1. Greg Melich : That's perfect. And then last, just DIY and do-it-for-me. Do-it-for-me still outpacing DIY by about 1,000 basis points. Is that the trend you're expecting this year to continue? Or are we seen enough recovery in fleet and other that maybe those start to narrow? Will Stengel : I think they start to narrow, and so we would expect the DIY business. We're seeing some good strength in our DIY business, in particular, our accessories, which is a small part of the business, but it continues to grow really nicely even on tougher comps. So we would expect the gap to narrow as we go through 2023. Greg Melich : Congrats guys on a good year. And good luck. Operator : The next question is from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Scot Ciccarelli. First question is, you have made a couple of comments on the gross margin benefits you've been able to accrue from pricing. Is that both in auto and industrial? And then if at least some of it is in auto, could some of those price increases create some competitive challenges down the road since some of your other major competitors have made selective price investments over the last 1.5 years to 2 years? Will Stengel : Yes, Scot, it's Will. I'll take a cut at this. We're seeing great pricing work happening on both sides of the business, and in particular, in U.S. automotive. I would say, they're one of the most dynamic teams in terms of the things that they're doing around pricing. We've been at this now for 12 to 18 months in a pretty robust way, both in terms of the technology that we're using, the data, working with a third party, et cetera.  And we are actively thinking through the right way to execute pricing strategies relative to the market. That's really at the core of the work that we're doing. So we feel good about what we're doing. We study it daily. It's at the SKU level. We go into different markets, and we've got really nice visibility to react accordingly with dashboards and weekly updates as a team to make sure that what we're doing is beneficial for our customers and our business. So it's definitely something that we're hyper focused on. Paul Donahue : And Scot, I would just add to that, that we're -- despite what you may be hearing in the marketplace, the pricing environment overall as it generally has been in automotive is rational, we're not seeing any huge swings one way or the other. And as you well know, having the product on the shelf and available when the customer needs it is still the primary driver and not necessarily price. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the industrial side. I mean the comp performance of the industrial piece segment rather has continued to significantly outpace the indexes. It's historically tracked really over the last, call it, 15 to 18 months. And Paul, I think you've mentioned, some of it is kind of the changing business mix that you previously highlighted. Are there other factors we should be thinking about to kind of explain the divergence from, let's call it, historical trend that we've seen? Paul Donahue : I don't think so, Scot. I know you and I talked about it on the last call. Look, we're not totally insulated from the effects of a downturn in PMI or industrial production. But I would tell you, we are a whole lot more confident today given the diversity of our product and our service offering, the end markets we're servicing, things like EV manufacturing plant.  I mentioned earlier, the opportunity with onshore, nearshore and manufacturing coming back to the U.S. So all of that bodes very well for Motion. And we've evolved, I guess, Scot -- my time here, we've evolved from being a -- basically a distributor of bearings and industrial supplies to a really world-class industrial solutions provider, one who provides solutions in automation, robotics, conveyance, hydraulics, fluid power. So look, we're not totally immune to what's happening in manufacturing, but I like our business, I like our team and I like our chances. And again, we're off to another really good start here in Q1. Will Stengel : Scot, I might just add one other thought, which is the momentum that's behind the KDG and the Motion combination. We get very active and positive feedback from customers on kind of the breadth and depth of the service offering, the value-add services. And I think that's really extended the leadership position of the combined business over the last 12 months. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thanks. Very helpful guys. Operator : And the next question is from Liz Suzuki from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Liz Suzuki : Thank you. I was hoping you could just comment a little bit about your leverage ratio, which is a bit below target. Are you kind of holding on to some dry powder so that if attractive acquisitions or buyback opportunities come up, you could act on that opportunity without taking on high rate debt? Or is there some hesitancy maybe about the economic outlook that's keeping you more conservative on leverage? Paul Donahue : Liz, you're exactly right. We're being a little conservative here. We're holding some dry powder. Look, we are at 1.7 times, well below our stated range of 2 to 2.5 times. And we like that position. We think that it's really smart right now in this environment. We'll look for opportunistic things across the board whether it's CapEx or M&A. And so we really do think that we've been able to work that down post KDG acquisition right after we bought KDG earlier in the year, we were closer to 2.  So I think nice performance to work it back down. And look across the landscape or whatever we might see come up. So nothing pressing or imminent, but we just like the financial flexibility that we have with our current cash balance, our total liquidity and being very disciplined across our capital allocation structure. Liz Suzuki : Got it. Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Good morning, guys. On the NAPA private label program in Europe, you said, I think, what, \u20ac300 million you're doing. Could you talk about sort of what inning you are in and penetrating there? I mean how many segments that you think you're going to run private label versus how many you're doing or what the potential market is? Will Stengel : Yes, Bret, let me take a pass at that. We're in the very early innings Obviously, the last 12 to 18 months has delivered really strong momentum. We're excited about that. We fully expect to continue to do that. We're in, call it, 10 to 15 categories. We've got opportunities to do more than that. Within the categories that we actually offer that doesn't necessarily mean they're in each one of our local markets. So even if we just stayed in our 10 to 15 primary categories, we'd have a great opportunity to continue to push that product. But we're excited about this and believe that it can be close to 20% of the revenue over the next 2 to 3 years. Paul Donahue : Bret, I know we got into this discussion last time we were together. And so I would tell you, I think we're at about the bottom of the third, Bret, in terms of our process here in private label. It's going extremely well. All the countries have jumped on board, and we haven't even rolled it out yet to the new markets we entered last year, Spain and Portugal. So yes, we're excited, and I know the team is excited. And the best part is, our customers and the consumers are buying the product, and they love the product. Bret Jordan : Okay. Great. And then on the U.S. acquisition, you're talking about folding in some store acquisitions. Could you talk about what you're looking at there? Are these NAPA-independents? Are these other independents in other buying groups, and I guess, sort of which regions are these, more urban company-owned store markets you're looking at? Sort of what's the strategy on increasing this company-owned store base? Will Stengel : It's a great question. The short answer is, it's always the above on the store base. So a lot of thought has gone into the markets in which we want to add relative density. And so depending on the best way to do that, we'll consider either working with an independent owner or if it's another competitive store group, we'll consider that. But as you alluded to, it's strategic markets, adding that density, making sure that we've got the ability to cover customers well with the right inventory mix, and it's a very attractive ROIC lever for us as we bring a lot of value to those merged entities after we own. Bret Jordan : Are there any particular regions you're looking at? Or is this sort of national? Will Stengel : It's a national approach. We're doing it. It's the same M&A strategy, quite frankly, globally for our automotive business. We do the same work in Canada, and we did the same work in Europe as we do here in the U.S. Bret Jordan : If you were to roll that forward, if you're sort of thinking out three to five years, is it a meaningful change in company-owned store mix versus independent? Will Stengel : It has the potential to be. It will take some time just given the law of numbers, but that is a lever that we have to change that mix, for sure. Operator : And the next question is from Daniel Imbro from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Joe Enderlin : This is Joe Enderlin on for Daniel. Looking at the industrial space, I think you noted reshoring as a tailwind in the prepared remarks and previous questions. Could you maybe provide some more thoughts on how you expect this to impact profitability or how you're thinking about the effects of reshoring? Paul Donahue : Yes. So thanks for the question, Joe. And look, it's a reality, and there's a number of reports that we've all reviewed of late commenting on the number of CEOs that are considering and have begun considering bringing manufacturing back here, not only the U.S., but across North America. And certainly, Mexico would be a part of that where we have a strong presence with the Motion business.  So look, it's a positive. It's more long -- it's certainly more long range. It's not going to -- certainly not going to happen overnight. But again, I think as these companies do return to North America, automation is going to play a significant role given some of the labor challenges and labor shortages. So automation in these operations is going to be significant, and again, we are extremely well positioned as it relates to our automation and robotics offerings. Joe Enderlin : That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, you noted you realized there were $30 million of synergies from the KDG acquisition with more expected in '23 and '24. Just to clarify, were these mainly revenue or cost synergies? And then what are the primary drivers here? And then do you maybe think there might be any upside to the $50 million goal? Will Stengel : Yes. The synergies are in both buckets. So we have net sales synergies as well as cost synergies. So they interplay together. We do think there's some upside as we move forward. The business has really nice momentum. We committed to $50 million when we originally announced the transaction by year three. We're in a position to deliver $50 million by the end of year two. So with $30 million realized through year 1, an incremental $20 million in year 2. And I'm confident that the team will execute well and deliver on that commitment and potentially more. Joe Enderlin : That\u2019s all for me. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question and that question is from Seth Basham from Wedbush. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot for squeezing me in. Nice quarter. I have a couple of questions about the core U.S. NAPA business. First, regarding the fourth quarter results, you mentioned strength finished the quarter. I presume weather helped. I'm wondering if you can quantify how much weather was a help, and how you're thinking about weather for the first quarter and 2023. Will Stengel : Yes, Seth, I would -- its Will. I would say that weather might have helped slightly, but not material to close the year. As we look forward, it's currently 80 degrees here in Atlanta. There's a couple of feet of snow in different parts of the country. It's hard to predict. I would tell you, January feels like -- certainly, in our North American market, it's been a mild winter that had some implications for some of our product categories, but I'm confident the team is going to work through that. We can't control it. So we're going to focus on what we can control and make sure that we're taking care of our customers and our teammates safely. Seth Basham : Fair enough. And then as you're thinking about the U.S. NAPA sales growth in comps in 2023, is that within the same 4% to 6% range that you're expecting for the global business? Bert Nappier : Yes, Seth, this is Bert. That's right. We're thinking about that total automotive segment out of 4% to 6%. And within that, we would be in the same range for the U.S. business. Seth Basham : Got it. Okay. And then lastly, in terms of the miles driven outlook, how are you thinking about miles driven and obviously, a key driver of U.S. NAPA of sales? Paul Donahue : Well, I would tackle that, Seth. We're hoping to see a little bit of a lift, which we did see in the latter part of the year as fuel prices started to abate a bit here in the U.S. So I still think there's a bit of a reluctance for mass transit, not to mention air travel and air fares are at all-time high. So I think that a 1% lift would not be out of the realm of possibility. So we think it will be a tailwind in '23, for sure. Seth Basham : Wonderful. Thank you very much for your answers. And good luck. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Paul Donahue : Yes. Thanks, Chad. We appreciate it. Appreciate all the questions and everyone joining us this morning. As you've heard, we're incredibly pleased with the reported record year for GPC, and we could not be prouder of the great work done by all of our teammates around the world. We continue to be excited with the momentum this business continues to generate, and I would just conclude by saying, the future is very, very bright for GPC. So I hope you all have a great day wherever you are, and hope to see you at our Investor Day meeting here in March. All the best. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sid Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Will Stengel, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bert Nappier, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition to this morning's press release, a supplemental slide presentation can be found on the Investors page of the Genuine Parts Company website. Note, we will not be playing these slides through the webcast. Please be advised this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release. Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now, I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We were pleased with the continued strength and momentum in our businesses and to report results that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Before I share my comments on the first quarter, I want to share a few thoughts from our 2023 Investor Day, which we hosted just this past month. We use this event to convey our confidence in the bright future of Genuine Parts Company and update everyone on our strategy and the many opportunities we see for long-term profitable growth. During the course of the day, we highlighted our rich history, ongoing transformation and strategic priorities, which we showcased through several key initiatives in an interactive expo. Our panel discussion with our global business unit leaders, allowed us to share specific business and market opportunities and provide insights to the collaboration among our leaders and synergies across the businesses. Finally, we provided three-year financial targets, including a compelling outlook for double-digit EPS CAGR and a double-digit EBITDA and segment profit margin by 2025. It was a great day for the GPC leadership team and hopefully, an informative and productive day for all of our attendees and everyone in the financial community more broadly. If you missed it, we invite you to view the full presentation on our Investor Relations website. So now let's turn to the first quarter. We are proud of the outstanding work by our global GPC teammates, with sales and earnings coming in ahead of our expectations. Our first quarter performance was a clear example of how our strategic transformation to a global automotive and industrial company is a competitive advantage that distinguishes GPC in the marketplace. We benefited from our business mix and the geographic diversity of our operations with continued strong performances in our international automotive businesses and in the industrial segment. A few highlights in the quarter include; record quarterly sales of $5.8 billion, up 9% from the prior year, segment margin of 9.1%, up 50 basis points from 2022. Earnings per share of $2.14, up 15% from adjusted EPS last year, and our 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. And finally, we strengthened our balance sheet while generating solid cash flow to support our growth initiatives and capital allocation. The global GPC team is focused on driving accelerated sales and earnings growth, continued margin expansion and strong cash flow through dynamic economic conditions. Across our businesses, our teammates are aligned and executing on our strategic plan to deliver outstanding customer service and continued market share gains. In industrial, demand trends held strong throughout the first quarter with new and existing customer activity and reshoring trends each presenting growth opportunities. We believe our continued momentum in industrial is due to the diversity of our product and service offerings and end markets, which all performed well again this quarter. Our acquisition of KDG and enhanced capabilities in industrial solutions, including automation, fluid power and conveyance are proving to be competitive differentiators, and we remain bullish on this business in the near-term. Our global automotive business continues to benefit from the geographic diversity of our markets, which helped to offset the headwinds of a warmer winter and volatile weather conditions in our US automotive business in Q1. In addition, the automotive aftermarket is benefiting from trends such as the ongoing increase in miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet and rising interest rates and continued high prices for new and used vehicles. These are all key drivers to ongoing growth in demand, especially for the DIFM segment, which represents 80% of our global automotive sales. So after delivering back-to-back record years, we are pleased with the solid start to 2023 and we continue to expect another strong year of profitable growth. Looking ahead, we are confident that GPC is well-positioned with the right strategic plans, strong fundamentals, and rock-solid balance sheet to pursue accretive organic and acquisitive investment opportunities while also returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. So again, we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers around the world. So now I'll turn the call over to Will. Will Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC team for the strong start to the year. We appreciate all your hard work to take care of our customers every day. As Paul referenced earlier, the pride in our business was on display at our Investor Day last month. We were excited to share our vision, unique advantages, market opportunities and how we're winning as we execute strategic initiatives. Our initiatives are focused on talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, all complemented by a disciplined M&A strategy. As we shared during the sessions, our team is well positioned with leadership positions in attractive, fragmented markets with established customer relationships, global supplier partnerships, technical expertise and a scaled global infrastructure. We work together with shared values as one GPC team to create customer success and shareholder value. Turning our attention to the first quarter performance in our two business segments. Total sales for Global Industrial segment were $2.3 billion, an increase of approximately $240 million or 11.9%. Comparable sales growth increased approximately 12.1% in the first quarter versus last year. This marks Motion's eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth. From a cadence perspective, through the quarter, January and February were the strongest two months on a one-year basis, but on a two-year basis, sales were relatively consistent throughout the quarter. In March 2023, Motion eclipsed the previous monthly sales and profit record set in March of 2022. The sales growth at Motion continues to be broad-based with double-digit growth across most product categories and major industries serve. During the quarter, we saw strength from industries such as food products, chemicals, mining and oil and gas. In addition, Motion continues to see solid performance with its corporate account initiatives, as sales with these customers grew approximately 20% in the first quarter. The corporate account strength is driven from not only new customers but also strategic renewals of existing relationships. In Asia Pac, our Motion business continues to build on its momentum posting sales and profit growth well over 20% for the quarter. We realigned the leadership of the industrial business in Asia Pac by organizing under one automotive and industrial leadership team in the fall of 2022. The team has made impressive progress to identify opportunities, take action and deliver performance. Industrial segment profit in the first quarter was approximately $262 million or 11.6% of sales, representing a 230 basis point increase from the same period last year. The continued profit improvement for this segment reflects excellent operating discipline on strong sales growth, both in North America and Asia Pac. In addition, the team in North America continues to build on the synergies from the KDG acquisition last year. As we reported at our Investor Day, thanks to the incredible teamwork for many, Motion realized over $30 million in synergies in the first year, and we expect to achieve our target over $50 million in total synergies by the end of this year, one year earlier than our initial expectation. For the quarter, Global Industrial represented 50% of total GPC segment profit. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Total sales were $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately $230 million or 7% versus the same period in 2022. Total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification as our businesses outside the US posted high single-digit to double-digit growth in local currency during the first quarter. From a cadence perspective, through the quarter, Global Automotive sales were strongest in February and March. On a comparable basis, global automotive sales increased approximately 7%, with comps ranging from low single digits in the United States to low double-digit growth in Europe and Asia Pac. As Paul mentioned, we remain encouraged by the solid industry fundamentals and team execution, which we believe will continue to drive profitable growth. Global automotive segment profit in the first quarter was $264 million, essentially flat with last year and segment operating margin was 7.5% compared to 8.1% in 2022. The strong performance of our European, Canadian and Asia Pac businesses helped to partially offset lower margins in our US Automotive business. Profit in the US Automotive business was impacted by a sluggish start to the year on sales, combined with planned investments in wages and elevated freight out expense. Now, let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the US, automotive sales grew approximately 4% during the quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 3%. The first quarter represents the toughest year-over-year comparison of 2023, with an approximate 12% comp growth in the first quarter of 2022. Looking at our average daily sales, growth was relatively consistent throughout the quarter. However, milder winter temperatures combined with extreme weather events impacted automotive demand in certain product categories and periodically disrupted operations. As examples, sales of batteries were positive, but below internal plans during the quarter, particularly in the Northeast. More broadly, we offset sluggish categories in heating and cooling and undercar, with strength in various core categories such as filters, brakes and fluids, all of which had growth above the US average. Growth was consistent across our regions, except for our west region, which experienced a more pronounced negative impact from weather, which temporarily disrupted many of our operations. Overall, we estimate that weather negatively impacted US Automotive sales by approximately 1% in the quarter. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive, with mid-single-digit commercial growth outpacing retail. Our commercial business saw sales increase across all customer segments, including continued strength with our fleet and government channel and mid-single-digit growth in our NAPA AutoCare network. The sales performance at US Automotive started the year slow relative to our expectations. As a result, the team acted during March to address cost while balancing its longer-term investment priorities. The benefits of the actions will be weighted towards the second half of the year. Sales have improved during the first half of April when compared to March and the team remains focused on delivering in 2023 despite the soft start to the year. In Canada, sales grew approximately 9% in local currency during the first quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 9%. Our Canadian performance reflects strong growth in several categories like brakes, chassis and filtration, all of which were up double digits in the first quarter. In addition, we saw strong performance in our heavy-duty business, which outperformed the total Canadian growth rate. These categories helped offset headwinds in certain weather-related categories like batteries, which were pressured by a milder winter season. We're pleased with the strong quarter in Canada, and we continue to see compelling opportunities for long-term growth due to our leading market position, solid industry fundamentals, share gain initiatives, and strong team execution. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter with total sales growth of approximately 22% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 13%. The strong growth in market share gains across Europe continue to be driven by solid execution of key initiatives. During the first quarter, we saw high single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies as our teams continue to win new business with key accounts drive higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expand the NAPA brand in the region. We're on track to grow our NAPA branded sales from \u20ac300 million in 2022 to approximately \u20ac400 million in 2023. Our entry into Spain and Portugal in 2022 has exceeded our expectations and value creation plans as it benefits from the NAPA brand and European scale advantage. In addition, our team is expanding our NexDrive EV service shops to approximately 400 locations, up from 150 shops in 2022. We believe our NexDrive offering will position the European team to lead our industry in the growing EV aftermarket. In the Asia-Pac automotive business, sales in the first quarter increased approximately 14% in local currency from the same period in the prior year, with comparable sales growth of approximately 11%. Both commercial and retail sales continued to perform well with both growing at a double-digit rate in the first quarter. In addition, March saw record sales and profit results across several go-to-market channels, including Repco, NAPA, and our motorcycle accessories. Asia-Pac continued to make impressive progress on its talent and culture and customer-centric growth initiatives. We continue to complement organic growth with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. During the first quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions, primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that extend our leadership and create long-term value. In summary, the global GPC team delivered strong first quarter results and we remain confident in the outlook for the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment. We will execute our near and long-term initiatives and focus on what we can control. Our investments in our people, customer solutions, technology, supply chain, and emerging tech will continue to enhance our capabilities and leadership positions. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for the hard work and performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Bert Nappier : Thank you, Will and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very proud of our teams as they continue to navigate a dynamic environment and I'm pleased to walk you through the key highlights of our first quarter performance. Before I get started on the details of our results, I would like to note that we had no non-recurring items in the first quarter of 2023. However, our comparisons to the prior year do exclude certain non-recurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG. Total GPC sales increased 8.9% or $470 million to $5.8 billion in the first quarter of 2023. This reflects an 8.7% improvement in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation and a 2.4% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 2.2% unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Overall, our balanced portfolio and global diversification drove record total sales and strong earnings to start the year. Our gross margin was 34.9% in the first quarter, improving 30 basis points from our adjusted gross margin last year, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our pricing and sourcing initiatives. The favorable impact of these and other initiatives contributed approximately 60 basis points of core gross margin improvement. These gains were partially offset by two key headwinds. First, a shift in sales mix related to the strength of our industrial business, which impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points; and second, foreign currency, which also impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points. As we highlighted at Investor Day, our ongoing execution of key strategic initiatives around gross margin continue to drive strong results. Our total operating and non-operating expenses in the first quarter were approximately $1.6 billion, up 9% from adjusted expenses in 2022 and in line with the prior year at 27.9% of sales. The increase in expenses in Q1 reflects the combination of solid discipline in managing core costs, offset by planned investments in our teams due to inflationary wage conditions and increased spending in technology to support our ongoing strategic initiatives. As Will noted, with elevated operating costs pressuring margins in the first quarter in our US Automotive business, we have taken actions in March to address these headwinds, which we anticipate to persist into Q2. We expect these cost actions, combined with our ongoing discipline on costs across the remainder of the business and the execution of our broad base of strategic initiatives to drive further improvement in operational efficiencies and productivity for GPC. Our performance in the first quarter generated total segment profit of $526 million, up 16% and a segment profit margin of 9.1%, a 50 basis point improvement from last year and our fifth consecutive quarter of segment margin expansion. Our first quarter net income was $304 million or $2.14 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $266 million or $1.86 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 15%. Our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth is indicative of the hard work and crisp execution by our teams to implement our strategic initiatives across our global operations. Turning to our cash flows. We generated $198 million in cash from operations in the first quarter. This compares to $399 million in cash from operations last year, which included the sale of $200 million in receivables under our AR sales agreement. Free cash flow was $109 million, and we closed the first quarter with $2.1 billion in available liquidity. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7 times, which compares to our targeted range of two to 2.5 times. We are well-positioned with financial strength and flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities that may become available across the business. We remain committed to our long history of disciplined capital allocation. Our four key priorities for capital allocation are unchanged and include investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we invested $88 million in capital expenditures, primarily around supply chain and technology. These investments support many of the initiatives we shared at Investor Day that we believe will drive the modernization of our business moving forward. We also invested $40 million for acquisitions, which remains a key element of our growth strategy. As Will mentioned earlier, we continue to generate a robust pipeline of acquisition targets for our businesses. For the quarter, we returned $194 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $126 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $68 million of cash used to repurchase 411,000 shares. We are well-positioned with the cash flow to effectively deploy our capital through all business cycles. Turning to our outlook for 2023. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 23rd and reaffirmed on March 23rd at our Investor Day. We are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $8.95 to $9.10, an increase of approximately 7% to 9% from 2022. This represents a $0.15 increase from our previous guidance of $8.80 to $8.95. Our sales guidance is unchanged, and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding to the following; 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with a 4% to 6% comparable sale increase, and with the ongoing assumption of stronger first half year-on-year sales growth relative to the second half of 2023, although our view on Q2 and Q3 have improved modestly. Turning to a few other items of interest. We are raising our outlook for cash from operations to a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, an increase from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion previously. We are raising our outlook for free cash flow to a range of $900 million to $1 billion, an increase from our previous guidance of $800 billion [ph] to $1 billion. We continue to plan for CapEx of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology and supply chain, among others. In closing, we are very pleased with the strong start to the year and positive momentum in our business. While our US Automotive business had a slow start to the year, we've started Q2 with good sales momentum and expect our team to execute, build traction through the second quarter and have a solid second half of 2023. Our outlook for the full year reflects the ongoing confidence in our strategic plans and our ability to execute through the dynamic economic environment. GPC is truly differentiated with our business mix, global footprint, our size and scale, the execution of initiatives and our talent, we have a unique value proposition. As we shared at Investor Day, our team is well positioned to execute our plans to deliver our targets for a double-digit EPS CAGR over the next three years and double-digit margins by 2025. Thank you. And we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Just one housekeeping question. Just it sounds like weather was a little noisy during the quarter, but the fundamentals are still intact. Can you remind us what exposure you have to California or to the West? Will Stengel : Yes. Kate, it's a good question. I would say we don't have an outsized exposure to any one region. The breakdown of the US automotive revenue is probably directionally correct, equally split across the regions. Kate McShane : Okay. Thank you. And then I think you mentioned in the prepared comments that because of the sluggish start in January, your team pivoted to some new strategies that will impact the second half. Can you talk a little bit more about what that is? And what impact do you think it will have in the second half? Bert Nappier : Yes, Kate, this is Bert. I'll talk a little bit about -- maybe I'll start with the outlook as a starting point, just to give you some context for the full year. I'll talk a little bit about Q2, and then I'll flip it to Will and will give you a little bit more color on the cost actions in US auto specifically. When we think about the full year, we did raise the outlook $0.15. That's a 1.5% increase on the top end of our range, really on the back of a better-than-expected first quarter and our expectations, as we've commented for US Auto to recover against some of these Q1 headwinds and a stronger view on Motion performance over the coming two quarters. When we think about that, I do want to remind everyone that we do expect growth to moderate in 2023. We had exceptional growth in 2021 and 2022. But we're still looking at very solid earnings growth at 7% to 9% year-over-year with the new range. The business continues to perform well. We're going to continue to capitalize on size and scale, and bullish against our execution of our own strategic initiatives. And I think we're off to a great start as we march towards our 2025 targets that we shared on Investor Day. We're obviously being very balanced and being prudent against the external factors that are out there. Inflation levels, foreign currency and the geopolitical landscape, just to name a few. When I think about Q2, just to give you some color there about how we're thinking about the upcoming quarter, we started off in a good place. Global Automotive is in line with April, 7% on the top line. And within that, as Will stated in his prepared remarks, US auto has started off with good momentum in the month of April, accelerating from March. We see continued strength in international auto and the global industrial business momentum is carried into Q2. But, again, we do expect that to normalize against the Q1 rate. Those cost pressures in US Auto, I think, will persist into the early part of Q2 for the balance of the quarter probably, and Will will talk about those just in a moment on what we're doing to get us back to the expected level of performance that we're looking for in the second half. One thing I'd remind you, too, on Q2 is, just as you think about your models, recall that Q2 of 2022 represented our strongest earnings growth last year. And as a result, when we think about our guidance for the full year, the second quarter of 2023 will be -- our expectation will be that it will be our lowest earnings growth rate for this year. So Will, maybe you want to just take that from there and fill in a little bit more specific on the cost actions at US Auto. Will Stengel : Yes. Happy to, Bert. Kate, I would say, obviously, the teams around the world have been incredibly focused on costs. So, I wouldn't say, there's any necessarily new actions or levers being pulled. I think we're just stepping up the urgency and the focus at US Automotive. They're predominantly around as you would suspect, all things people, in particular around more rigor on over time in stores and DCs, just being super thoughtful to make sure that we're balancing cost with taking care of our customers, T&E expense. We've also pulled together some accelerated plans around merchandising and freight cost strategies, which will take a little bit of time to materialize here through the second half of the year. But we're going to balance near-term cost actions with, as we've talked about, long-term investments, and make sure that we're doing the right thing for the business over the medium and long term. Kate McShane : Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please, go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Bret. Will Stengel : Hi, Bret. Bret Jordan : On the US Auto, I think you said the comp was plus 3%. Could you break out price versus units in that number? Will Stengel : Yes, Brett. So total GPC price, mid-single digits. Global automotive, slightly higher than that. I would put US Automotive in that category. Industrial, slightly under the mid-single digit, low single digit. So probably mid-single digit plus is probably a good estimate for US Auto. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then, you talked about margin benefits from pricing initiatives. And could you talk about what you're seeing out there? And, I guess, auto and industrial as well, as sort of market share dynamics and how the competitive pricing environment looks this year? Obviously, you guys were investing in price a year or so ago, but Auto Plus has gone Chapter 11, so maybe there's some sort of change in dynamics out there as far as the competition. Will Stengel : Yes. It's a good question, Bert. I would say, generally speaking, in US Automotive, the -- we haven't seen any material change in the pricing dynamics as we've talked about many quarters before. It is a dynamic environment. That's why we're so focused on our strategic pricing initiatives and all the investments we're making there. Like every industry, people are picking and choosing and executing strategies in the market, just like we are. But it is kind of a rational but dynamic market. So, we're really not seeing anything materially different than what we've seen in the last few quarters. We're going to focus on what we think is right from a strategic pricing perspective. As you heard at Investor Day, we've put a lot of investment into tools and talent and new rigor around collecting intelligence to make sure that we're in the right place for our customers. You also heard a lot about the NAPA brand and the role that, that plays in particular, in Europe in our assortment strategy and all the great work that our merchants and sourcing teams are doing around the world. So, we're being very thoughtful in this pricing environment, but I wouldn't say there's a material change despite some of the developments that you noted in your question. Bert Nappier : And Bret, this is Bert Nappier. I'll just add a little bit to that. And you see that effectiveness with our margin -- gross margin expansion here in Q1 up 30 basis points. And within that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, 60 basis points of improvement from these activities that Will just outlined. So, the core is really performing well. We had some headwinds from mix and FX, but we're really pleased with how all of that work is flowing through and delivering in terms of gross margin improvement. Bret Jordan : And just sort of a follow-up on that point. Now, that you've got Asia-Pac sort of industrial and auto under 1 team. the potential to leverage the sourcing, buying products from the same suppliers for both segments. Is that something that you're seeing better traction in down there versus the broader portfolio? Will Stengel : I wouldn't isolate it to down in Asia-Pac. In fact, we just had our global sourcing teammates here in Atlanta from all around the world to continue to build on this exciting momentum where all geographies on both sides of the business will be better aligned and more press on where we have our opportunities. So, I wouldn't say that Asia-Pac is benefiting now more on sourcing. Having said that, they are benefiting from being together as a team, and that's a big part of how they're thinking about their business as they move forward. And so whether you're talking about the organization design, back-office cost, et cetera. I think there's a lot of opportunities for them to continue to work better as one organization. Bret Jordan : Would you do broader integration globally? If it works in Asia-Pac, would you just think about merging more of the overhead on both sides of the business? Will Stengel : I think we have an opportunity to work together to leverage our scale, the definition of what you mean by merged business units, probably not. But working together as a team, you heard at Investor Day, the importance of One GPC. That's the perfect philosophy around how do we work together to make sure that we're capturing all the opportunities as a global organization. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Will Stengel : Thanks. Operator : And the next question will be from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Josh Young : Hey, good morning. This is Josh on for Scott. So, on the segment margins, with automotive down 60 basis points in the quarter, industrial up over 200. Can you just unpack a little more what the drivers were there for each segment? Bert Nappier : Hey Josh, it's Bert. I'll take that one, and I'll start kind of at the GPC level. When we think about -- we had margin expansion for gross margin, really, where we're focused on some of that drag is in SG&A. SG&A was up 10 basis points year-over-year. That's really a mix of three factors : inflation, planned investments in the business and then offset by really strong leverage across the business outside of US Auto. For the quarter, when we think about how to really think about the elements, I would say we had SG&A pressure about 50 basis points from those planned investments that we shared at the beginning of the year and again at Investor Day, in IT and talent. Now, some of the talent cost is certainly going to be inflation driven, but we're making very thoughtful investment in talent and IT, which we see as critical for the future. When you look at US Auto, the quarter was impacted by higher personnel costs there and freight delivery costs. So that's the outbound freight from a DC to a store. The wage side was really again the impact of planned investments we made to ensure we're staying competitive. I think everybody is facing that across all businesses and talent is a key part of our long-term success. On the freight side, we're seeing the impact of higher rates from our carriers as they're looking to do the same thing, they're looking to cover higher wages due to driver shortages. So those two things on the automotive side were part of the equation. The other thing I would just say is that, I turn back to this weather consideration. We really didn't anticipate that, as you would expect. None of us are forecasters here in terms of weather. But -- we didn't anticipate some of those weather impacts, particularly coming off the very strong December we had in US Auto. So our staffing models were set to align to a sales run rate where we exited 2022. And that was probably a little bit higher than we needed to support Q1 softer sales level. So all of that together compressed margin in US Auto and was a bit of a headwind for us. As we look ahead, the cost of business is doing a little of doing business is a little higher and inflationary conditions are certainly contributing to that. We're reducing where we can. And again, investments we're making in the business that we shared at Investor Day are a big part of driving efficiency. So while two is kind of take that back to the top level again, and maybe talk about these wage investments in IT and why we think they're so important to us. On the IT side, we're making investments to improve our capabilities and modernize our platforms and Nadeem share that extensively last month. We think those are the right things to do. But in certain cases, the pivot in that space is to cloud-based technology. And as many of you know, that changes the dynamic from a capital to operating costs. And as I shared earlier this year, that's about a 30 basis point drag for us for the year. On the talent side, it's a very competitive market out there for talent. And we're making smart investments with our people with a mid-single-digit wage increase. I think that's in line with most businesses, slightly higher for us than 2022. And we also made the decision to take some of the health care costs we were seeing and absorb them here at the corporate level rather than what we might normally do and pass those on to our employees through higher contributions from them. And that's the right thing for our team right now. So I take that all together, we got a little bit of deleverage for the year 30 to 40 basis points. Those two things are 60. So you can see we're really leveraging outside of that US auto business right now. And with that, we expect margin for the full year to be up 20 to 40 basis points. And as you saw in Q1, we were up 50 basis points. Josh Young : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then could you just walk us through what you saw in terms of inflation during the quarter and what your expectations are for the balance of the year here? Bert Nappier : Sure. Yeah, I'll take that one as well. As we look at Q1, inflation moderated slightly during the quarter. That was in line with our expectations. Again, we think monetary policies here in the US and around the world are having the desired effect. But that does take a little time to flow through. Q1 inflation and sales, all GPC total was mid-single digit. Auto was high single digit. And again, industrial, which has been very consistent, low single digits. Our expectation for inflation for the rest of the year is for it to continue to moderate. That's pretty consistent with the view I just shared at Investor Day. Obviously, the actual impact is yet to be seen. But our assumption is that the automotive business will tick down from high single digits to low single digits to close out the year. Industrial will stay in that low single-digit range and that GPC that translates in us going from mid-single digit to low single digits. Josh Young : Okay. Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher, your line is open. Perhaps your line is mute on your end. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning everybody. So a couple of follow-up questions. First, is it fair to say that you were expecting US NAPA to be more like a 4% comp for the first quarter, considering you pointed out a point of on the weather side? And is that a fair interpretation of where the business is running in April? Will Stengel : The first part of your question is fair. And the second part of your question is fair. Christopher Horvers : Okay. And so dovetailing back to the US NAPA division, you talked about 20 to 40 basis points of segment margin expansion. So was it -- is the original plan that you would deleverage the NAPA operating margin due to the investments? Bert Nappier : Chris, this is Bert. So when I talked about 20 to 40 basis points of segment margin improvement, I'm talking about GPC consolidated. I don't really want to get into parsing the onion too finely between the elements of that. But we were not expecting margin declines in either segment for the year. The math would be difficult to achieve 20 to 40 basis points being up consolidated for either of the two segments to be down year-over-year. Look, we had a softer start to the year in US Auto. We've got a great plan here in place with some cost actions we're taking, but it will take a little time to build traction and auger in through the quarter. We're looking for a really solid second half there and building that momentum for us, and we feel good about that. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then just on the freight front understanding that there's some wage cost being pass-through and driver shortages, fuel prices surged in March of last year and all your freight out, I'm assuming it's a periodic expense. So should the freight start to be a tailwind here in the second quarter? And then how long before maybe some of the capitalized freight costs turned to a tailwind later in the year? Thank you. Bert Nappier : Yeah. Thanks, Chris. It's Bert again. Look, on the cost of ocean freight, those that are included in our inbound and cost of goods sold. My gross margin projection for the year and our guidance assumes we get a bit of a tailwind of that in the second half. That's clearly our expectation. I think that's in line with the market. On the outbound freight, diesel fuel is still up year-over-year just slightly in the quarter. It started out January, I think, in the north of 20%, moderated a bit in February into the teens and then turned positive in March. The net sum of that was about a 3.5% increase for the quarter in fuel cost. And so we had a bit of a headwind there on top of the rates we're getting from the carriers in terms of fuel as it relates to diesel, and that is primary -- that's the primary component of that delivery cost as we think about fuel when it goes from the DC to the store. We would expect that, if March is an indicator that, that will start to tick down a bit and could be a benefit to us. Will mentioned that we've got some actions related to that. On the labor side, I think it's pretty sticky, though. When we think about these carriers, and we're all facing higher wages. Year-over-year, the cost of doing business is undeniably higher because of wage rates, and I don't think those will abate. But we might get a little bit of a tailwind here on the fuel aspect and see how that maps out over the next couple of quarters. Sorry for the long answer. Christopher Horvers : Got it. Thanks very much. No, thank you so much. Will Stengel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Liz Suzuki from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Liz Suzuki : Hi, thank you. Just -- I guess this is more of a theoretical question about acquisition opportunities. I mean historically, you've acquired businesses that are performing well that can bring synergies to your core operations in both Industrial and Automotive. But if there were underperforming competitors in either a category where you saw an opportunity to bring GPC's distribution capabilities to that business. Would that ever we consider it as an acquisition target? Will Stengel : Yes, Liz, it's a great question, and the answer is yes. We're going to do deals that create value that align with our strategy, regardless of how they're performing. And I would say our capabilities in this part of the business positions us pretty well as the environment gets tougher. We're going to be really disciplined on whether they're a good business or a challenged business. But if we can create value and it makes sense for our strategy, I think the power of our balance sheet and our liquidity position is that's exactly the type of environment that we want to operate in, so we can leverage our scale. Liz Suzuki : Got you. And then just on the guidance for the year, the interest expense came down a little bit. So it sounds like there are no near-term plans to take on additional leverage, but just wanted to get your thoughts about that and on your current debt level and any near-term plans for cash outside of the opportunities that you laid out already in your -- in the slides. Bert Nappier : Hi, Liz, it's Bert. Look, there's nothing in the near-term that has really changed or really for the balance of the year in terms of how we're thinking. Interest expense has come down a bit. We've had a little less need to borrow against our revolver intra-month, which has been a bit of a benefit to us and intentional. And then when we think about the uses of cash and our capital allocation for the year, it's still pretty balanced. We don't have anything different than what we shared at Investor Day and no different plans. The only thing that's on the horizon is we've got a debt maturity at the end of the year. And obviously, we'll want to be thinking about the environment that the capital market brings to us as we get closer to that and how we think about refinancing or paying back or some of the various options we might have. So again, just being really disciplined as we always are being faithful to our four priorities on capital allocation and no surprises for you guys. Liz Suzuki : Perfect. Thank you. Bert Nappier : Yes. Will Stengel : Thanks, Liz. Operator : And the next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Melich : I have a follow-up on Auto and then turn to Industrial. I just want to make sure on the Auto margin, it looks like the decline was pretty much all in the US business. Is it fair to say that both Europe and Asia Pacific segment Auto margins were up year-on-year? Bert Nappier : That's fair to say. Greg Melich : Got it. And then the -- on the Industrial side, how sustainable is the expansion rate, but also just the level that you've gotten to in industrial? Is something changed there about the fundamental profitability of that side of the business? Bert Nappier : Greg, this is Bert. I wouldn't say there's anything fundamental that's changed other than just continued strong momentum and building on the actions in that business over the last couple of years. You build on industrial team that -- and the Motion team that is executing at a very high level, their core business, a stellar integration of KDG and how we've achieved synergy, which was transformational in driving additional size and scale and creating opportunity. That combination has allowed us to continue to improve margin in that business. As we shared at Investor Day, we're looking at that business being at a 12% level. And so, we're marching towards that as a target. And, obviously, this quarter gave you a glimpse of our progression in that regard. And I think we're on the right track to hit that level of profitability as we shared at Investor Day based on what we see right now and what we see for the next several quarters. Paul Donahue : Hey, Greg, this is Paul. I would just cap off both those comments. When you think about the two businesses, Auto and Industrial, and we've talked about this a good bit in the past. We talked about it during Investor Day. If you go back a few years, we laid out our multi-year diversification strategy. And I would tell you, this is a classic quarter where that strategy is really paying dividends. And it's -- and hats off to our teams, our Industrial team, our international teams all really delivered in Q1. We could not be more proud of them. Greg Melich : Very well. Congrats guys and good luck. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Greg. Will Stengel : Thanks, Greg. Bert Nappier : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Next question is from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please, go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is just on the weather effects going forward. Given the gyrations you saw through the winter, do you expect the weather to be a drag on sales through the balance of the year? Will Stengel : Hey, Seth, it's Will. Listen, I don't -- I'm not in the -- I don't think any of us are in the business of forecasting the weather as we move forward. So, no, we haven't modeled in any of our forward commentary or outlook impact from weather. Paul Donahue : Seth, I've been at this a number of years. It was a crazy, crazy quarter. When I look back at our call in January, we were sitting here in Atlanta, and it was 80 degrees, yet many parts of the country were shut down with incredible snowfall. At this point in time, all we're going to do is we're going to focus on what we can control. And our businesses are all performing at a really high level. We expect that to continue regardless of what Mother Nature has in store for us in the balance of the year. Seth Basham : Understood. And in terms of the 100 basis points drag from weather in the quarter, was it more pronounced on the DIY side than the do-it-for-me side? Will Stengel : Yes, I don't think we can make a distinction between DIY and DIFM from a weather perspective. I mean, 80% of our business is do-it-for-me. So -- but there's no distinction between the two. Seth Basham : Fair enough. Thank you. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Seth. Will Stengel : Thanks, Seth. Operator : And our final question for today will come from Daniel Imbro from Stephens Inc. Please, go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to start as a follow-up on the industrial margin kind of outlook you guys provided. Bert talked about kind of 12% guidepost. If I look at 1Q, really strong expansion, but the growth was up double digits. Obviously, the guide is calling for growth to slow to get to that 5% midpoint for the year. It's your expectation, just to make sure we understood that correctly, margins would still be up year-over-year for the coming quarters, just maybe up less than the first quarter, or how would you think about the pace of industrial expansion as that headline growth flows through the year? Bert Nappier : Well, I don't want to get into giving quarterly guidance on the Industrial segment, but I'll just talk about the full year and tell you that when you think about the industrial business, we've got, as we -- I think we've said repeatedly high single-digit topline growth model for the first half. That moderates down to low single digits in the second half based on our expectation of economic conditions, which could obviously change. Even with all of that, even with a low single-digit outlook for the second half, we're expecting the segment to improve its margin for the full year. Will it be at the same rate as Q1? No. We're not modeling that, and you know that from our full year guidance. But in a lower growth moderated environment in the second half that business will still perform well on a margin basis, and we expect that margin to expand for the full year, which is why we're looking at overall GPC margin expansion for the full year as well. Daniel Imbro : Great. I appreciate that color. And then to follow-up on the automotive margin, not to beat a dead horse, but you mentioned the wage investment and kind of I think you mentioned it in the question, the cost of doing business has gone up. I guess, what inning are we in, in terms of those wage investments as and when do we begin to lap these and we could return to levering that wage line on a low to mid-single-digit type comp? Just what's that kind of outlook look like on those investments you're planning on making in the business? Bert Nappier : Well, look, I'll just tell you that we spent the last 12 months or so moving down the P&L in terms of inflation impact, starting with the topline and cost of goods sold, I think all businesses, so I don't want to put us in some unique camp. I think all businesses are starting to feel the impact of inflation in the heart of the P&L. And that's now moving into freight lines, SG&A, personnel costs, and some of those things. To call the inning on that is really tough. My dad was a baseball coach, and I like to say that I'm baseball-ready, but the call to inning on that one is a little difficult. I just go back to the point that in this highly inflationary environment, there's no question the floor has been raised on the cost of doing business. It's not just here in the US, it's around the world. And the best indicator for that is what all companies are facing right now with inflation on wages. I don't want to give you a precise estimate on a range of leverage. I think historically, the company has been talking about a 3% to 4%. If it's been 3% to 4%, it's probably floating closer to the higher end of that range. But the thing we're focused on, and I think it underscores and emphasize the importance of doubling down on these investments and initiatives we're making in productivity and efficiency, modernizing our operations, and the things you heard about at Investor Day will help us. And then we're always going to be faithful to driving leverage and reducing costs where we can. And you saw a great example of that in the business this quarter with the leverage we gained in the Motion business and the International Automotive businesses. So, I think that's a great data point on how we're thinking about modeling this going forward. And obviously, my guidance contemplates that as to our 2025 targets. Daniel Imbro : Yes, makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much for all the color. Bert Nappier : Thanks Daniel. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Paul Donahue : Yes. Thanks, Chad. We appreciate it. And listen, we appreciate all the questions and all of you joining us this morning. As I hope you've heard, we're incredibly pleased with the strong start to the year and we could not be more proud of the great work being done by all of our GPC teammates around the world. We're -- we continue to be excited with the momentum this business is generating. So, I hope you feel that and heard that today in our in our comments. So, listen, all of you have a great day wherever you are and thanks for your interest in GPC. Operator : And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sidney Jones : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.  With me today to share their remarks are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Will Stengel, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bert Nappier, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Tim Walsh, our Senior Director, Investor Relations, has also joined us. In addition to this morning's press release, a supplemental slide presentation can be found on the Investors page of the Genuine Parts Company website. Please be advised this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release. Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.  Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report another solid quarter with record sales and double-digit adjusted earnings growth. Our second quarter once again highlights the value and benefit of our global automotive and industrial businesses and the mix and geographic diversity of our company which we believe are competitive advantages that differentiate GPC in the marketplace. A few highlights from our second quarter results include : Total sales of $5.9 billion, an increase of 5.6% from the prior year. Total company segment margin of 10.4% and an increase of 60 basis points from the same quarter last year. Earnings per share of $2.44, an increase of 10.9% from adjusted earnings per share last year, and our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. And finally, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet while generating solid cash flow to support our growth initiatives and capital allocation priorities. Our global team remains focused on the strategic initiatives we highlighted at our Investor Day in March. And we believe our One GPC approach is contributing to our strong financial performance. We compete in 2 very large and fragmented markets and see significant opportunities to grow our business, expand our margin profile and generate strong cash flow to support our strategic investments while delivering returns to our shareholders. As we continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment, we believe our focused execution, investments in our business and strong industry fundamentals, position GPC for long-term success. Looking at our Industrial segment, demand trends held solid through the second quarter, even as the rate of sales growth tempered a bit relative to the first quarter as we expected. Motion's growth rate on a 2-year basis continues to be exceptional. And while certain economic indicators have slowed, we believe our strong market share position, along with the diversity of our products, services and end markets bode well for our continued growth prospects. In addition, future reshoring opportunities and the growth of domestic manufacturing industries provide significant opportunity for Motion. And as you will hear from Will, our team's focus on productivity and efficiency is driving significant margin expansion in the Industrial segment. Our global automotive business continues to benefit from the broad geographic diversity of our markets. In addition, we believe our long history of supporting the DIFM customer segment which is 80% of our global automotive sales, positions us well as sales growth to DIFM customers continues to outpace DIY sales growth. During the second quarter, our international Automotive businesses delivered strong mid-single to double-digit growth, while our U.S. automotive business experienced low single-digit growth. The fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket remain favorable with trends such as increasing miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet, rising interest rates, and continued high prices for vehicles, all contributing to underlying demand. While the near-term environment remains dynamic, we are very pleased with our year-to-date performance. And with the strong earnings growth in the second quarter, we are once again raising our outlook for 2023 earnings per share, which Bert will discuss further. As we look forward, we remain confident in our strategic plans, and we'll continue to invest to strengthen our business and achieve both our near- and long-term financial targets while returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. So in closing, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight the outstanding work of our HR and IT teams in Q2 around our implementation of Workday. In early July, we completed the first phase of our implementation of the Workday HR platform in North America. Continuing to demonstrate the modernization of our system platforms and supporting our teams with the right tools and the right technology. Our HR and IT teams delivered an exceptional outcome, well ahead of schedule, showcasing the benefits of our One GPC talent and technology initiatives. So before I turn it over to Will, we want to thank each of our 58,000 GPC teammates for their hard work and continued dedication to serving our customers around the world. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will. William Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC team as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate all the hard work to take care of our customers every day with solutions that help keep the world moving. We do this with focus on our foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, all complemented by a disciplined M&A strategy. We work together as One GPC team to create customer success and shareholder value. On behalf of the entire GPC team, we would like to congratulate Kevin Herron on his well-deserved retirement after an amazing 34-year career at the company. Kevin earned success in all of his roles over the years, including the last 5 years as President of the U.S. Automotive business. He embodies our GPC values and he's been an inspirational leader and mentor to many around the world. We're deeply grateful for his significant contributions to Genuine Parts Company and wish him the very best in his retirement. With Kevin's retirement, we also want to congratulate Randy Breaux on his promotion to Group President, GPC North America effective July 1st. In the new role, Randy will oversee both the automotive and industrial businesses across North America, while assuming day-to-day responsibility as President of the U.S. Automotive Group. Randy is a proven leader with a track record of performance. His relevant expertise across distribution industries, familiarity with GPC teammates and stakeholders and success at Motion make him the ideal candidate for the role. This transition represents the depth of our leadership team and our talent strategies as we continue to leverage the power of One GPC. Now turning to our 2 business segments. Total sales for Global Industrial were $2.3 billion, an increase of $125 million or 5.9%. Comparable sales growth increased 6.0% in the second quarter versus last year. The cadence through the quarter was relatively consistent with April being the strongest month followed by mid-single-digit growth in both May and June. The sales growth at Motion was broad-based again in the second quarter, with all product categories and major industries served posting positive gains from the prior year. During the quarter, we saw strength from industries such as food products, iron and steel, chemicals, mining and oil and gas. In addition, Motion continues to make excellent progress with its initiatives including inside and outside sales, pricing, e-commerce, growth-focused tech and supply chain strategies, they're all helping to win profitable market share. As an example, Motion has seen a nearly twofold increase in average daily sales across its e-commerce platform since 2021, which now represent nearly 30% of total Motion daily sales. In Asia Pac, our Motion business also delivered strong performance in the second quarter with double-digit sales and profit growth. Customer-centric initiatives across talent and culture, inventory availability and operational excellence are delivering positive results. Industrial segment profit in the second quarter was $283 million or 12.5% of sales, representing a 190 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement in Industrial was driven by excellent operating rigor in both North America and Australasia and the disciplined execution of strategic initiatives. In addition, the Motion North America team continues to realize synergies related to the KDG acquisition. The team is substantially complete with the branch consolidation and merger efforts well ahead of initial plans. And we expect to exceed our 3-year $50 million synergy commitment by the end of this year, also well ahead of initial plans. Turning to Global Automotive. Total sales in the second quarter were $3.7 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.4% versus the same period in 2022. Similar to the first quarter, total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification as our businesses outside the U.S. posted mid-single-digit to double-digit growth in local currency. On a comparable basis, global automotive sales increased 4.3%, ranging from low single-digit growth in the U.S. to low double-digit growth in Europe. We saw global automotive sales inflation moderate from high single-digit growth in the first quarter to low to mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. We remain encouraged by favorable fundamentals and solid team execution, which we believe will continue to drive profitable growth. Global Automotive segment profit in the second quarter was $329 million, up 2.1% versus the same period in 2022. And segment operating margin was 9.0% compared to 9.3% in 2022. As expected, Automotive's margin showed an improvement versus the first quarter. The improvement in the second quarter reflects the impact of the cost actions implemented at U.S. Automotive, and we expect to see an increased benefit of these actions in the second half of the year.  Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 2% with comparable sales growth up 1% for the second quarter. April and May were the stronger months while trends lagged in June, particularly as we headed into the July 4th holiday weekend. That said, we're encouraged by the early trends thus far in July. Growth was relatively consistent across our regions with the East and West regions recovering in the second quarter after the slow start to the year due to the impact from weather. More broadly, we offset sluggish categories in heating and cooling, exhaust and ride control with strength in various core categories such as filters, batteries and fluids, all of which had growth above the U.S. average. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with commercial growth outpacing retail. Our commercial business saw sales increases across most customer segments with fleet and government outperforming again this quarter with high single-digit growth. In Canada, sales grew approximately 6% in local currency during the second quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 6%. Our Canadian performance reflects strong growth in several categories like heating and cooling, paint and body and tools and equipment, all of which were up double digits. Our automotive and heavy-duty businesses performed well, both posting mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter.  Our Canadian team executed well in the quarter, especially given the destructive wildfires across the country and we continue to see attractive opportunities for long-term growth due to our leading market position, solid industry fundamentals and share gain initiatives.  In Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter with total sales growth of approximately 15% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 11%. We continue to drive strong growth and market share gains across our European markets due to the ongoing execution of our key initiatives. For the second quarter, we delivered mid-single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies. As our teams continue to win business with key accounts, drive higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expand the NAPA brand in the region. The team is on track to deliver EUR 400 million in sales of NAPA-branded products in 2023. In addition, we continue to strategically roll out our next Drive offering across our European markets that position our team to lead the industry in the growing EV aftermarket. Recent bolt-on acquisitions in Europe are tracking ahead of growth and synergy plans as we leverage our scale, integrate with discipline and expand margins. For example, comparable growth in our Iberian markets was approximately 25% during the second quarter, significantly ahead of our initial expectations.  In the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the second quarter increased approximately 9% in local currency with comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. Both commercial and retail sales performed well with retail outpacing commercial in the second quarter. The team continues to strategically invest in the business to extend its customer value proposition. For example, the recent opening of distribution centers in Auckland, New Zealand and Melbourne, Australia will drive long-term profitable growth and productivity.  We complement organic growth with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. We completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. Our acquisition pipeline remains active, and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that extend our leadership positions and create long-term value.  In closing, the global GPC team delivered strong second quarter results, and we remain confident in our plans for continued growth through the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment. Our company is benefiting from our strategic business mix and global geographic diversification. Our teams remain focused to execute our strategic initiatives that deliver customer solutions and create value. We're committed to investments in our people, customer solutions, technology, supply chain and emerging technology that will continue to enhance our capabilities and leadership positions.  Thank you again to the entire GPC team for the hard work and excellent performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Herbert Nappier : Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams continue to operate at a high level and perform through this dynamic environment. And I'm pleased to walk you through the highlights of our second quarter performance.  Before I get started on the details of our results, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the second quarter and 6 months of 2023. Our comparisons to the prior year, however, excludes certain nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the sale of S.P. Richards Real Estate and the integration of KDG which represented a net $59 million benefit or $0.42 per diluted share. GPC revenues increased 5.6% or $313 million to $5.9 billion in the second quarter of 2023. This reflects a 4.9% improvement in comparable sales, including low single-digit to mid-single-digit levels in inflation and a 1.8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 0.9% unfavorable impact of foreign currency. The value and advantage of our balanced portfolio and global diversification was highlighted again as we delivered another quarterly sales record. Our gross margin was 36.1%, a 110 basis point improvement from the second quarter last year, driven by the ongoing favorable impact of our pricing and sourcing initiatives. We believe the execution of key strategic initiatives around gross margin will continue to drive strong results. And for the full year, we now expect our gross margin rate to improve 30 to 50 basis points from 2022, an increase from our prior estimate of 20 to 40 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Our total operating and nonoperating expenses in the second quarter were $1.7 billion, up 9% from adjusted expenses in 2022 and at 28.4% of sales. This compares to total adjusted expenses of 27.6% of sales in the second quarter last year or approximately 80 basis points of deleverage year-over-year. The deleverage in SG&A in the second quarter is primarily attributable to a few key factors, 2 of which were planned, our investments in wages and benefits for our teams and increased spending in technology. Our investments in the IT and digital initiatives we showcased at Investor Day, impacted SG&A by 20 basis points in the second quarter. In addition, planned investments in wages and benefits for our team members impacted SG&A by 30 basis points, much of this as a feat of inflationary pressure on wages. Finally, during the quarter, we recorded charges related to cost improvement actions at our U.S. automotive business and a true-up of stock compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees totaling 30 basis points, both of which we would not expect to repeat in the future. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A deleverage of 30 to 40 basis points, driven by investments in our team members and IT. Our second quarter growth and gross margin improvement drove total segment profit of $613 million, up 11.8%. Segment profit margin was 10.4%, a 60 basis point increase from last year and our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. While we delivered strong overall margin expansion, margins in our Global Automotive segment were lower in Q2 due to pressure in our U.S. Automotive business. As we discussed in the first quarter, following the slow start to the year, we anticipated that the profitability of this business would remain challenged in the second quarter, and it did. However, our teams are making great progress as evidenced by the acceleration in the rate of gross margin expansion from the first quarter to the second quarter and the sequential improvement in segment margins. As Will mentioned earlier, we are executing cost improvement actions to address the elevated levels of operating costs in this business and to continue to improve profitability. We expect these actions, combined with our ongoing discipline on costs across the remainder of the business, and execution of our broad base of strategic initiatives to drive further improvement in operational efficiencies and productivity for GPC. Our second quarter net income was $344 million or $2.44 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $313 million or $2.20 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 10.9%. This represents our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth and is a true testament to our team's hard work and continued focus to drive our profitability. Turning to our cash flows. We generated $457 million in cash from operations for the first 6 months of 2023. Recall that our cash flow in 2022 included a sale of $200 million in receivables under our AR sales agreement. For the first 6 months of 2023, free cash flow was $252 million, and we closed the second quarter with $2 billion in available liquidity. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.6x, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. We remain well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities across GPC. Our key priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. And includes investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During 2023, we have invested $205 million in capital expenditures, including $117 million in the second quarter. These investments continue to support the initiatives we believe will drive growth and the modernization of our business moving forward. Acquisitions remain a key element of our growth strategy, and we invested $106 million year-to-date for acquisitions, and we continue to generate a robust pipeline of acquisition targets for our businesses. Thus far in 2023, we have also returned $395 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $260 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $135 million in cash used to repurchase 841,000 shares. As we enter the second half of 2023, we are well positioned to effectively deploy our capital through all business cycles. Turning to our outlook for 2023. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on April 20th. We are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $9.15 and to $9.30, an increase of approximately 10% to 11.5% from 2022. This represents a $0.20 increase from our previous guidance of $8.95 to $9.10. Our sales guidance is unchanged, and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding to the following : 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with 4% to 6% comparable sales increase, and we continue to expect sales growth to moderate in the second half of 2023 relative to the first half of the year. Turning to a few other items of interest. Our guidance includes cash from operations in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and free cash flow in a range of $900 million to $1 billion. We continue to plan for CapEx of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology and supply chain, among others. Overall, we are very pleased with our first half results. Through this dynamic environment, our teams have demonstrated their ability to be agile while staying focused on serving our customers around the world. Our updated outlook for 2023 earnings per share reflects the ongoing confidence in our teams and their ability to execute and drive solid results. We believe GPC is truly differentiated with our business mix, global footprint, our size and scale, the execution of initiatives and our talent, we have a unique value proposition. We look forward to reporting on our progress in our third quarter call in October. Thank you. And I will now turn it back to Paul for a few closing thoughts before we address your questions. Paul? Paul Donahue : Thank you, Bert. Before we get into Q&A, we'd like to take a moment to acknowledge Sid Jones, who has announced his decision to retire from Genuine Parts Company after 33 years of service to the company. Sid has been leading our Investor Relations team since 2003 and today marks his 83rd quarterly earnings call at GPC in that role. We thank Sid his many contributions over the years and wish him and his family the very best in his retirement. Tim Walsh has been working closely with Sid and the team for over a year and will be named Head of Investor Relations on August 1st. We look forward to having Tim in his new role and now he will do an exceptional job for us.  So with that, we are now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Liz Suzuki of Bank of America. Elizabeth Suzuki : Sid, you're going to be greatly missed. So we'll miss you a lot. Just a question on the U.S. automotive comp is plus 1%. You noted that globally, both DIY and -- for me were positive with DIFM outpacing DIY. Was that the case in the U.S. as well? You may have mentioned it and I missed it, I'm just not sure if you gave that detail for the U.S. in terms of DIY versus DIFM. William Stengel : We did Liz, DIFM outperformed retail in the U.S. Automotive group for the quarter. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay. Great. No, that's very helpful. And then just a question on the Industrial business. The margins have been really healthy there. I mean should we think about that 2Q operating margin is a decent run rate going forward? And is there any seasonality we should keep in mind that may have changed one way or another after the KDG acquisition? Herbert Nappier : Liz, it's Bert. I don't think you have on part to Q2 as the proxy for industrial for the full year. As you -- as we've commented, we see that industrial growth rate moderating here in the second half. Having said that, we still will get margin expansion for the full year on the Industrial segment. But we're thrilled with where the business performed in Q2 that 12.5% rate is a proxy for we can go long term as we shared at Investor Day, but we still have a lot of work to do to continue to grow that business and would use -- not use that as a proxy, but look to still see expansion of margin for the full year. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Sid we will miss you very much, and congratulations on your retirement and all the best in your future endeavors. My first question is just following up on the U.S. -- the U.S. NAPA comp, I think you implied in April that you're maybe running about a 4 and you imply that June was down. So was June down sort of low to mid. And can you talk about what you're seeing that you're encouraged by in July and how you're thinking about U.S. NAPA comps in the back half? William Stengel : Yes, Chris, happy to walk you through, and I'll maybe just kind of walk through some of the comments that we had in the prepared remarks. But so for U.S. automotive, April and May, as you noted were the stronger months in the quarter, low single-digit growth. The first half of June, in fact, was a solid start to the month, and we saw a tapering towards the end of the month that left June to be flattish, which puts together the 2 and then the 1 comp for the quarter, U.S. Automotive. We have seen an improvement to start the month in July. Obviously, we've had some extreme heat that is going to have a positive impact and -- while it's probably early to call the whole month, we're encouraged by the positive momentum plan to build on that through the quarter.  As Liz just asked, we saw outperformance and do-it-for-me versus retail, both growing in positive directions. And we continue to be bullish about our fleet and government segment, which we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that grew nicely in the quarter. Good strength in filters, batteries and fluids, which are important categories for us. So we're excited about some of the things we're doing from a merchandising standpoint in those categories.  And I think it wasn't a total surprise to us given the weather patterns in the second quarter that some of our heating and cooling categories didn't perform the way we expected them to, just given. It wasn't an overly warm second quarter in the aggregate for the U.S. market. But we're excited about what we're working on in the business. Obviously, we think we've got more potential than we showed in the quarter. We're excited about Randy's leadership now in place here for the first couple of weeks. He's been out in the field working with the teams. I think there's a lot of energy and positive momentum there. Gross margin, as Bert talked about, continues to be a great piece of execution, both on the pricing and sourcing side of the house. Also very proud of the team and their quick adjustments to all things cost. So they're operating with a lot of intensity and focus. And importantly, we're investing in the business for the long term. So making sure that we're balancing near-term actions with long-term potential. So in the aggregate, a lot to be proud about the team. We're going to continue the grind and push through the second half of the year, but proud of what we're working on. Paul Donahue : And Chris, I would just tag on to that, that the fundamentals of the industry are still solid -- miles driven, going in the right direction as gas prices moderate a bit. New car sales being still a bit soft compared to historic numbers. And we're seeing the same across our international business as well. So as we reported our team in Europe had a phenomenal quarter, strong double-digit growth. Many of the fundamentals there, the same here across North America, rock solid. And our team in Asia Pac, Australia, New Zealand also had another really strong quarter. So fundamentals of automotive are still rock solid. And we certainly see improvement as we move forward through the back half of the year. Christopher Horvers : Sounds great. And then a follow-up question on the gross margin. I mean 36.1% is quite impressive. If you look back historically, the second quarter is a reasonable proxy for the year on gross margin. I know 1Q was a lot lower. But perhaps, was there anything unsustainable in the gross margin performance in the second quarter? And do you think over time, this is a level that is around 36% is sort of the destination? Or is it an area that perhaps you could even grow from? Herbert Nappier : Chris, it's Bert. Look, I think we had a great quarter here. In the past couple of quarters, I've given you the offsets for gross margin. We had a clean number this time around. We had no offsets from some of the things we've talked about in the past, whether it's inflation or mix. So we're just thrilled with the work that the team is doing and so important in this environment when we've got all the different economic pressures out there. So we've got a great focus on sourcing and getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time. We also have great work happening on pricing across all of the business. And so that 110 basis point improvement for the quarter up to 36.1%, I think is a reflection of really, really hard work.  We're going to continue to stay focused on gross margin expansion through those 2 prisms, through pricing and sourcing. I'm not going to call the bulges yet on where that number can ultimately end up. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're more bullish on where it can be for this year. We had originally been planning for 20 to 40 basis points of improvement, and we've got that to 30 to 50 basis points. Within that, again, benefit from the execution of our strategic initiatives. We do have a little bit of a benefit modeled in for ocean freight, which we see turning positive for us here in the second half. So those are the 2 things I'd call out with really no foreseen at this point impact from either FX or inflation or mix. Operator : The next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli of Truist. Scot Ciccarelli : I have a follow-up on Christopher's question. So the slowdown you've experienced in U.S. auto, do you think there's any share shifts occurring given some of the strong results we've seen from a few of your competitors or would you really just point to weather as the headwind in 2Q? William Stengel : Yes, Scot, we don't think there's any share shifts. We always study the analytics. We use third-party independent information. We look at it by category and feel good about where we are. We act on that data every week and every month. We review it as a team and feel good about where we are. So no, we don't think that there's share loss happening here. We have specific strategies by category that we're executing against. And so the story can be quite different at a category level, but that's part of the science and art of all things, category management. So really proud of what the teams are working on. And as I said, we use independent data to keep ourselves honest to make sure that we're winning in the marketplace. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. So maybe some of the delta could be due to geographic differences potentially? William Stengel : When you say geographic, you mean U.S. geography differences? Scot Ciccarelli : Well, no. I mean, within the U.S., like your results, like if we had positive results from both DIY and commercial. And obviously, you had a 1% comp, like neither was up very strongly, right? So on -- specifically on the commercial side, like could we potentially attribute -- or did you potentially see like significant geographic differentiation in your business, stronger in the South, weaker in the West, what have you? William Stengel : We really don't see a material difference across our regions. We've got 5 regions. The growth rates are not materially different. There's always region specific customers and dynamics. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we saw a recovery in the Northeast and West, which we planned and expected based on their slow start driven by weather, we saw that come to bear. And for the second quarter, though, by themselves, there's not a material difference by region. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. And then just a quick housekeeping item. The $80 million or so that you guys highlighted for cost actions and the stock comp true-up. Were they the main drivers in the spike of corporate expense? And should we expect that line item to moderate in the back half? Herbert Nappier : Scot, it's Bert. I'll take that one. Look, we did have an increase in the corporate expense as a result of the 2 items you noted, one on the stock comp true-up and the other on the cost actions. The other thing contributing to corporate, and this is a little obscured in the 10-Q, but if you take a chance to read through the 10-Q, you get some good color on that either from the first quarter or the one that will be filed later today.  We transferred some functions at the beginning of this year into the corporate environment that we felt were better suited to be run on a more consolidated basis, one of them being cyber security and our work around cybersecurity globally. We did a little bit of that related to some of the finance functions and also our management of our product liability cases and litigation. When we did that, we actually got a benefit so far this year in terms of being ahead of where those items were being spent last year. But it did create a transfer left pocket, right pocket, which makes the corporate number look a little bit bigger. We're still guiding for the year of corporate expense in the $300 million to $325 million range. Longer term, we target for that to be about 1% of revenue. It's up this year because of those transfers and we'll look up for the full year. But like I said, we're already seeing the benefit of the move of centralization by streamlining those functions and seeing them operate at a lower cost rates than they had in the past. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. But some of the margin expansion that we've seen at the segment level is because of that cost transfer, just to be clear. Herbert Nappier : Yes, it's pretty small there, Scot. I mean we're talking about costs totaling year-to-date, $29 million in the aggregate. So it's a pretty small move. It stands out at corporate a little bit bigger because of the size and scale of the corporate expense line. But it's very negligible at the segment level. Operator : The next question comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Congrats to Sid and Randy. Randy now that you run them both, I guess, where do you see the biggest opportunity industrial or auto in the U.S. in the next, say, 2, 3 years? William Stengel : Bret, the good news is Randy is not on the call with us, but that's a tough question for him to answer. He loves both these businesses now. He's been out in the field and has a ton of energy and excited about the opportunities in front of us. So... Bret Jordan : I was going to ask you what you like better, but I figure out you too. William Stengel : He wouldn't have answered that question? He like them both. Paul Donahue : Which one is your favorite kids, you know, Bret? Bret Jordan : That's easy. Question on price, I guess. We were talking about sort of low mid-single-digit benefit from inflation in Q2. How do you see the second half cadence? The bar gets higher, I guess, year-over-year, but maybe you've got some incremental price passing along some of the rate inflation from your suppliers. How do we think about the organic price comp second half? Herbert Nappier : Yes. Bret. I'll take that one, it's Bert. On inflation, I'll kind of start at a high level. As we expected, we saw inflation moderate again in Q2, and I think really falling in line with our original thinking as we started the year, monetary policy in the U.S. and around the world, I think it's having its desired effect. You can see that in the U.S. CPI data. Just to reiterate, for the quarter -- second quarter inflation with low single digits all up for GPC, mid-single digits in auto, and low single digits for industrial. That industrial number has stayed pretty consistently in that low single-digit range for the year. Auto ticked down from high single digit to mid-single digit. And then on the whole, GPC has ticked down from mid-single digit to low single digits. So really falling right in line with what we thought when we started out the year. We're seeing some inflationary pressure on operating expenses, particularly in wages, and that was in my prepared remarks. That's sitting in the mid-single-digit range right now. It's probably the most pronounced impact in the business, but we're managing it. We're doing all the right things and taking some actions to try to offset that. And I think that's not a GPC-specific comment, it's a comment that all businesses are facing with wage pressure and inflation and wages.  As we look ahead, we think inflation will continue to moderate throughout 2023. And I think policy will continue to have its desired effect. Auto will tick down from high single digits to start the year to low single digits to close out the year. And industrial is going to bounce along that low single digits for the full year. We'll see GPC close out in the aggregate from a mid-single digit to a low single-digit. So it's not a one-size-fits-all for our business segments, but hopefully, that gives you a little color on how we're thinking about the rest of the year. And that's all factored into our guidance and our update to the guidance for the year. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then one follow-up on another pricing question. I guess one of your auto peers reported pretty rough Q1 and talked about price competition in the market. I guess could you comment about what you see, I guess, from pure pricing, any cadence of change in pricing in year-to-date '23? Paul Donahue : Yes. I'll take a shot at that, Bret. And then maybe Will can tag on what perhaps more specific thought. Look, first and foremost, I'd say we're not going to speak to specific strategies of our competitors. We got a lot of respect for our peers and they're doing what they've got to do for their business. What I would tell you, the competitive landscape, the dynamics are still rational. We play in huge markets, as outlined by Will. We've got lots of different competitors across all those markets, both big and small. What we really spend our time thinking about, Bret, and you won't -- this is not new news. It's about inventory availability. Ensuring we've got the right people in the right markets, ensuring we've got our store footprint -- the right store footprint to cover all of our strategic markets and allowing us to continue to grow profitably. We're in a break-fix model and helping our customers really solve their problems quickly with the right part in the right market at the right price. It's all part of our value prop. That hasn't changed, Bret. And honestly, I don't see that changing anytime soon. Do we think about price? Sure, we do. But right now, our customers are really more focused on ensuring they can be productive in their shops. That they're taking care of their customers. And we think we're a pretty good partner not only here in North America, but around the world to solve those challenges for them. So Will, I don't know if there's anything else from a pricing environment that you would want to comment on? William Stengel : Well, I would just say, operationally, what the teams are working on is incredibly helpful in this environment as it has been for the last couple of years, hence, the investment and focus on it. And more importantly, the teams globally are learning from each other. And so I think in one of our previous calls, we've talked about all the great work that's happening in U.S. automotive. We're sharing that work over in Europe.  And so these are some of the benefits of working together as a team and sharing all the learnings from an environment that's very similar around the world and gross margin performance in the total company. I think, is a good data point to suggest that we're having some success. So it's an important part of distribution business and it's especially important part of navigating this environment, and we're going to continue to get better at it and invest in it so that we can make the right decisions for our customers. Operator : The next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Gregory Melich : I wanted to -- one question on the U.S. auto business and then follow-up on industrial guidance. I just want to understand a little bit better with that inflation number, I think we're still seeing mid-single digits. Would it be fair to say a 1 comp would translate into negative 4 units. And then could you give us a little more color on the non-fleet and government business, how the independent dealers did and how NAPA AutoCare did? William Stengel : Yes, Greg. So I don't -- it's not as simple as minus 4% because we got to do it for me in retail. So you've got a distinction on transactions there. So do it for me, positive transaction and price, do it yourself as expected, transactions down tick it up. So in the aggregate, that's a little bit more noisy than just the minus 4%. On the other parts of the business, the AutoCare business continues to perform well. Obviously, our value prop with that segment is incredibly important and it's a challenging time. So partnering with them to make sure that they're being productive and navigating the environment. So that was a part of the business that performed to our expectations.  Major accounts is a very customer-specific book of business. So there are some pockets of strength in that book of business as well as some areas of opportunity. I would reinforce our philosophy here that it's really important that we think about partners and growing our business through the medium term in a profitable way. And so I think we're going to bring a lot of discipline and rigor to thinking about the trade-offs between profitable share and not in our major account business. So in the aggregate, a bit of a mixed story, but positive in total. Gregory Melich : Did the company stores do materially different than the jobbers? William Stengel : We didn't see a material difference in the performance. It was pretty close to each other. And... Gregory Melich : Yes, okay. Just maybe DIY, do-it-for-me mix a little bit, but no difference in that cut. The -- I guess the follow-up is on industrial. I just want to make sure I got that right. I mean, with obviously the big numbers continue to come through it. But the margin, the 12.5% margin, I just want to make sure I'm not -- do we assume that industrial margins will actually be down in the back half or that was -- they'll still be up for the year? Was that -- interpret that wrong, Bert? Herbert Nappier : Yes. Actually, you did interpret it wrong. But let me back it up and maybe pull it up and give a little color on guidance in general, and I'll work my way back down to segment margins. As you can expect, we're pleased with the first half performance on an overall basis, allowed us to raise our outlook again for the year this time by $0.20 to the $9.15 to $9.30. And in doing that, we see some upside in industrial profitability versus our previous expectations, the international automotive business, which is about 50% of the segment revenue for global automotive, we see some upside. And then obviously, we've taken up our gross margin performance expectations. That guidance delivers EPS growth with a midpoint of 10.6%, and that's putting us in a position to expect our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, which in this environment, is, we think, pretty impressive. On a growth basis, top line, we had exceptional '21 and '22. We still see strong growth but moderated growth to mid-single digits overall for this year. And that really, as we look at a pretty choppy macro environment and difficult to interpret we're keeping an eye on some of these things that are out there, whether it's inflation, monetary policy, interest rates, the political landscape globally and foreign currency.  So we're keeping a close eye on all of that. We balance that against confidence in our own business. Paul talked about strong industry fundamentals. We've got some great cash flows that allow us to invest in our business. And taking that all together, while it's a little bit more cautious, we do have a lot of confidence in GPC. A few details just to remember, again, gross margin, we've ticked up to 30 to 50 basis point increase expectation versus our original 20 to 40 basis points.  On segment margins, we're looking for those to be up for the full year, 20 to 40 basis points. That's expansion again. We do think industrial will be up for the year. So just to clarify, Industrial will be up for the year, but not using the 12.5% for Q2 of the proxy. Industrial segment margin will outpace automotive, but we believe automotive will be in a position to recover here in the second half, as Will outlined. The only point I would call out on just a headwind is SG&A. We will see deleverage as we expected for the year 30 to 40 basis points, which is consistent with our original expectations. So all that together allowed us to take our guidance up for the year slightly better on international auto, industrial profit conversion and better gross margin expectations. Gregory Melich : Got it. Thanks for piecing that together. And I guess I will say said, thanks for everything, and I didn't realize 83 quarters you must have started in college. So... Sidney Jones : All right, I lead them up too easy. Operator : The next question comes from Daniel Imbro of Stephen Bank. Daniel Imbro : Sid, I'll add my congratulations to the group. Well deserved -- working together. Well, I want to start on the U.S. auto side, maybe taking a step back from the quarter, just more strategically, obviously, with the promotion of Randy to the new responsibility, can you talk about what's the strategy is there, maybe bringing Motion and auto under singular leadership rather than kind of running separately. Is that a reflection of running the businesses closer together? Is that just a personnel decision? Can you talk to me about how you view that? And you mentioned some early positive internal response. Can you share any more color on what that's been. William Stengel : Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, Randy is a proven leader. He is well understood by our organization and brings a lot of relevant expertise to the NAPA business. As we've talked about often, at the end of the day, these are distribution businesses. And while -- they obviously have a different customer and product catalog. The value creation initiatives are all the same. And so Randy's progress and momentum and building a great team there at Motion that is incredibly deep, I think, it's all relevant and has spoken for itself in terms of the performance. And so I think it's more about how do we quickly build on the momentum of the business. And I think Randy brings is a great opportunity to do that.  So I don't think it's operationally, meaning that we're putting the 2 business. In fact, I know it's not. We're not putting the businesses together, but I think it's just going to allow us to be a little bit more efficient and at pace to work together as kind of a One GPC team, which is a philosophy that we've been talking about as an organization. And I think an advantage that we have, given the similarities of all the initiatives that we're doing around the world to go at pace and drive impact faster than perhaps if we were not together as a company. Paul Donahue : Daniel, I would just add to Will's comments, Randy has done a phenomenal job at Motion as you've seen in the numbers, and we expect that to continue because we've got a great leadership team at Motion. And as you know, every business, it's much bigger than one person.  I would say the same by U.S. automotive, Daniel. And I'm glad you asked the question because it gives me the opportunity to recognize that team. Kevin did a great job over the last few years of really bringing in a lot of new talent into the leadership group at U.S. Automotive. That team, I have 100% confidence, it is going to continue to drive improvements in U.S. automotive. And I have no doubt Randy will continue on with the good work that Kevin did by leading that team. So we're excited by the moves and look forward to the impact that Randy is going to have across both businesses. Daniel Imbro : And then follow up on the automotive guidance, not to get too into it, but trying to reconcile the 4% to 6% comp guide and the 4% to 6% total revenue guide on the automotive side. I think FX rates just as we sit today are at least a few points better than what you initially guided. So trying to reconcile how that wouldn't be more of a tailwind. Are you hedging out some of that translational benefit in the back half? Or is the right interpretation, it will be more FX benefit? And maybe lighter organic growth just within that same guidance range. Just trying to square away how FX rates can change the guide, kind of gets maintained. Herbert Nappier : Yes, sure. Look, on the top line, I think we've been consistent pretty much throughout the year with our initial outlook on the top line guide. And we've just basically done what we said we would do on both with the 4% to 6%. As we look at the rest of the year through de-comping and trying to get a little bit more color on global automotive I would say that the international automotive will continue to outpace the U.S. We'll expect it to be on the higher end of our comp range. We'll expect the U.S. to be on the lower end.  So the international is a bit on the higher end, you probably get a little bit of improvement from FX to your point, but that's kind of how we're thinking about those things. And look, in the U.S. automotive business, as Will has highlighted, there's more potential there. But we are being a little bit conservative on how we think about the rest of the year and how that business recovers and continues to improve over the second half. On industrial, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the industrial side. They've had a fantastic first half. But as we expect in the second half, moderates a bit to low single digits in the second half versus high single digits in the first half, which gives you the 4% to 6% for industrial. But even with that low single-digit. As I've said a couple of times, we will see some nice margin expansion for the full year in the Industrial segment. So hopefully, that reconciles that and squares the circle for you. Daniel Imbro : Just one follow-up on the comp guide. You just mentioned you called the back half conservative on the outlook. But in the U.S., you're calling for an acceleration. Inflation is moderating. So clearly, you're implying traffic is going to further accelerate to get the total comp up. I guess, what are the specific buckets? Or what are you looking at in the business that gives you guys the confidence that the traffic will be ultimately accelerating from here through the back half of the year to get that acceleration towards the low end of the 4% to 6% comp guide in the U.S. Herbert Nappier : Yes. I'm not sure I would have interpreted that way. I'll just reiterate kind of what we're thinking. As we look at the 4% to 6% for the back half for automotive. We've had consistent growth throughout the year on the 4% to 6% range. We expect that for the next 2 quarters, full year automotive at 4% to 6%. International on the higher end and U.S. automotive on the lower end of that range, and I think we'll just leave it there. Operator : We have time for one last question, and that question will come from Seth Basham of Wedbush. Seth Basham : Congrats to Sid as well, we'll miss you buddy. My question, not to beat a dead horse is back on the U.S. auto business and the cadence of comps through the quarter. Perhaps we were mistaken, Will. But I thought on the last quarterly conference call, you said that April to date had accelerated from the 3% level in the first quarter. That implies a pretty material deceleration through the balance of the quarter, he said zero-ish, flattish in June. Where were we in April and May? William Stengel : I think the comment that we made in the first call was true. In April, we did accelerate from the March performance. And as you articulated, and as I think we said, April and May were close to each other in this quarter and then June was the deceleration, and we called it flattish. So call it low single digit, low single digit, flattish for the quarter. Seth Basham : All right. Fair enough. And then secondly, just following up on your comments regarding the major accounts segment. Seems like that's the segment where there's the most price competition, you're being more disciplined with how you approach some customers there. Can you give us any more color? Are you walking away from some business that you don't see as being profitable enough at this point in time? William Stengel : I'm not sure I'd go that far. I would say, first and foremost, this part of the business is always discussing price, obviously, because they're big scale accounts. So I wouldn't say that those types of discussions are more intense today than they were before. I think we're just bringing a fresh perspective to making sure that our value prop is being appreciated. And we're also doing work with smaller regional \"major accounts\" that we can really drive a lot of value with given all the capabilities that we bring to them. So I think it's just a stepped-up level of focus and strategic discipline about taking care of our customers. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Paul Donahue : Yes. Thank you. And I just want to reiterate, we are super proud of our team, the way they continue to operate and in a challenging environment around the world. I'd also like to thank all of you for joining us today, and thanks for your combined and continued interest in Genuine Parts Company. We'll look forward to hosting another call in the third quarter and report on our results. So we'll have another call on October 19th. In the meantime, stay cool and enjoy the rest of your summer. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. With that, let me turn the call over to, Paul. Paul D. Donahue: Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. I'd like to start this morning with a few remarks on our overall performance before turning it over to Will, to cover the highlights of the automotive and industrial businesses. And then, Bert will get into the details of our financial performance, before we open the call to your questions. To recap the third quarter, total GPC sales were $5.8 billion, an increase of 2.6% compared to last year. Total company segment margin was 10.4%, a 70 basis point increase from last year, and diluted earnings per share were $2.49, an increase of 11.7% from adjusted diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year. I want to take this opportunity to give a call out to our GPC teammates around the globe, as we delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Our third quarter results reflect our strong operating discipline and our ability to improve our operating margins and profits despite a more challenging topline environment. Overall, we continue to benefit from solid industry fundamentals in both the automotive and industrial end markets, including rational pricing environments in both segments. In our Global Automotive business, the underlying fundamentals of the aftermarket remain favorable, increasing miles driven, an aging and complex vehicle fleet, and high vehicle prices and financing cost. Within our Global Industrial business, we benefit from a highly diversified portfolio of customers and end markets, with overall growth driven by manufacturing and opportunities with onshoring and reshoring trends. Our automotive and industrial businesses are mostly break fix and non-discretionary in nature. And as a result, we remain focused on offering solutions that support our customers to have the right part, in the right place, at the right time, across both business segments. Sales in our industrial business were up slightly in the third quarter, and the team continues to deliver exceptional profit conversion as evidenced by a 180 basis points of segment margin expansion. During the quarter, demand trends were positive, but continued to moderate relative to the first half as expected. Over time, Motion has transformed its business into an industrial solutions provider, with a compelling value proposition. Motion serves diverse end markets with many of its product offerings being highly technical in nature. In addition, with the acquisition of KDG, Motion has added scale and enhanced its industry leading offering of value added services, such as fluid power, automation, conveyance, and repair. The Motion team is focused on executing on our strategic initiatives to expand gross margin, while remaining disciplined on cost, driving further segment margin expansion. Turning now to our Global Automotive business, we continue to see strong results across our international automotive businesses with the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in Europe, and record sales and profits in Australia and New Zealand. Our teams continue to focus on our key organic initiatives, in addition to our bolt-on acquisition strategy. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Gaudi, one of the largest independent players in Spain, Europe's fifth largest car park, building on our 2022 acquisition of Lausan, Gaudi mainly operates in the Catalonia and Madrid regions, and creates further scale, and a national platform across Siberia, with the addition of 22 stores to our market leading position. We expect this acquisition to be accretive to our European business post synergies. We welcome the Gaudi team to GPC. While we were pleased with the growth internationally, the U.S. automotive business performance was below our expectations, with sales down 1.1%. Let me take a moment to share a few thoughts on the performance of U.S. auto. There is no doubt we've seen some challenges in 2023. From the record levels of inflation seen a year ago, which benefited the industry and have faded throughout 2023 as anticipated, it challenges across our own execution. Our year-to-date results demonstrated that we have not operated to our full potential in 2023. As many of you know, success in the automotive aftermarket is highly dependent on availability of inventory. Particularly for the important DIFM customer, which represents approximately 80% of our automotive revenue. Further, the automotive aftermarket has demonstrated consistent performance throughout all economic cycles. As we close out 2023, we are taking actions to better service our customers, and ensure our commercial activities are where they need to be. Under the leadership of Randy Breaux, we are confident the U.S. automotive team has taken the measures to improve execution with our customers. Will, plans to discuss these actions in greater detail. And before passing the call over to Will, we'd like to highlight our 2023 sustainability report, which we published earlier this month. At GPC, we embrace our responsibility to build a more sustainable and equitable future for our planet. This year's report highlights the progress we've made as a company to measure and reduce our carbon footprint. This year, we are proud to report that in 2022, we further improve the measurement of our carbon emissions and have reduced scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by over 10%. We encourage you to build the sustainability page on our website for more information on our progress. So, in closing, our performance in the third quarter, again, demonstrates our unique and differentiated portfolio. Will and I continue to visit with our global teams, including a recent trip to Europe and Australia. The teams are investing in the right areas of the business to drive long-term profitable growth, and they couldn\u2019t be more energized. We enjoyed a benefit of strong global brands and the GPC culture is alive and well across all our global operations. Further, we remain committed to the strategic investments and initiatives that we highlighted at our Investor Day back in March. We believe these investments are critical to our long-term success and are contributing to our financial performance both now and for years to come. We want to thank each of our 58,000 GPC teammates for their hard work and continued dedication to serving our customers around the world. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to, Will. Will Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking the global GPC team for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate the hard work every day to deliver parts and solutions that help keep the world moving. It's great to see the teams work together as one GPC team to deliver customer success. We do this with coordinated focus on our foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain, and emerging technology complemented by disciplined M&A strategy. To that end, I'd like to take a moment to specifically recognize the global teams for the progress on our numerous in-flight initiatives around the world. We're executing a broad set of initiatives across our global business and making strong and steady progress. The teams are simultaneously working to evolve the business for the better, while delivering on our day-to-day service commitments to our customers. As we detailed at our Investor Day, we believe we have compelling opportunities to invest back in the business and are excited about the progress and outlook. As Paul mentioned, we have great examples of progress around the world, specific examples range from state-of-the-art distributions centers with automation and next generation technology, enhanced data visibility and analytics capabilities, added talents and expertise, modernize technology platforms to enhance growth and productivity, and much, much more. We know the teams are working hard to execute the body of work, so thank you very much. Now, turning to the details of the business segment results. Before I get into the specifics, I should mention that the third quarter had one less selling day in the U.S. when compared to the third quarter last year. This impacted our total sales and comparable sales growth versus prior year, for both our industrial and automotive segments. During the quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.2 billion, an increase of 0.6%. We estimate that the one less selling day negatively impacted Global Industrial sales growth by approximately 160 basis points. Total sales for Global Automotive were $3.6 billion, an increase of 3.9% with a negative impact to Global Automotive of approximately 100 basis points, due to the one less selling day. Now, turning to the Global Industrial segment. Our quarterly results were essentially in-line with our expectations, and we remain ahead of our year-to-date plans. Recall that our expectation was for industrial growth to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Comparable sales growth increased 0.3% in the third quarter versus the same period last year. The same period last year was our highest quarterly comp during the year at approximately 20%. The monthly average daily sales cadence through the quarter was relatively consistent with each month of the quarter up low single digits. During the quarter, Motion saw a more mixed result across its various end markets with the strongest growth coming from industries such as food products, iron and steel, and mining, offset by relative softness in equipment and machinery. As mentioned, Motion continues to make excellent progress with initiatives including sales excellence, pricing, e-commerce, technology, and supply chain strategies that are helping to win profitable market share. As one example, the inside sales team initially formed in 2020 now covers approximately 25% of active customer accounts. The proactive sales calls are helping to drive profitable double-digit growth across the selling channel with a lower cost to serve. Our technology investments supporting revenue growth are also helping deliver better customer experience, with nearly 30% growth across e-commerce channels year-to-date, and e-commerce now at over 30% of total sales, up approximately 6 percentage points since 2021. Motion's second new fulfillment center in Fort Mill South Carolina is another example of exciting progress. This supply chain initiative consolidates various older legacy facilities while improving productivity, efficiency, speed, and service to customers. Our first fulfillment center in Lakeland, Florida opened at the end of 2021 and has delivered outsized sales growth a 10% reduction in operating expenses and corresponding profit margin expansion. We'll continue to roll out this strategy with additional fulfillment centers opening scheduled for 2024. In Asia Pac, our Motion team delivered another strong performance in the third quarter with double digit sales and profit growth. Local teams are energized as reaffirmed by recent independent survey data showing high levels of team member engagement combined with market leading customer satisfaction rates. Motion is a trusted value-added advisor to its customers, and the team has detailed plans to win additional share in this fragmented market. Industrial segment profit in the third quarter was approximately $283 million up a strong 16.6% and a 12.9% of sales representing a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement in industrial was driven by another quarter of excellent operating discipline in both North America and Australasia. The accelerated integration of the KDG acquisition has contributed to the strong performance and we will exceed our $15 million synergy estimate by the end of this year. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Similar to the first half of the year, total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification with our international auto businesses outperforming with mid-single-digit to double-digit sales growth in local currency. Comparable sales for the Global Automotive segment increased 0.6% in the third quarter and by geography include low to mid-single digit growth in each of our international businesses in comparable sales of negative 2.9% in the US. The moderation in inflation continues to be a significant factor in our year-over-year performance. As expected, Global Automotive sales inflation moderated in the third quarter to low single digits from mid-single digits in the second quarter. By comparison, in the third quarter of 2022, Global Automotive benefited from high single digit levels of sales inflation, which includes a benefit in the US of approximately 10%. We expect sales inflation in Global Automotive to be low single digits in the fourth quarter. Global Automotive segment profit in the third quarter was $322 million up approximately 4% versus the same period last year, and segment operating margin was 8.9% flat with last year. In the quarter, each of our international geographies delivered margin expansion, while US Automotive segment margin was down due to expense deleverage related to planned investments and the impact of lower sales. Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the US, as Paul outlined, automotive sales declined approximately 1% in the third quarter with comparable sales down 2.9%, which includes the negative impact of one less selling day year-over-year as I had previously mentioned. Further, the third quarter of last year included the benefit of sales associated with our NAPA Expo. A sales event held approximately every five years, which negatively impacted our year-over-year comparisons by an estimated 170 basis point. Collectively, these two factors represent approximately 340 basis points of headwind in evaluating our year-over-year growth performance in the US. In the third quarter, sales to both commercial and retail customers were down slightly with commercial and DIY essentially performing at similar levels. Our commercial business was mixed in the quarter as fleet and government outperformed and major accounts remained pressure driven by the impact of tighter market conditions on the end consumer. The average daily sales cadence by month was July, slightly up, August, down low single digits, and we exited the quarter with September up low single digits. It's fair to say that our performance in the US automotive business was below our expectations, and we believe the underperformance is a combination of execution and further tightening of market conditions. On the execution side, we have not been crisp enough in the field with service to our customers. In addition, while supply chains have improved significantly post pandemic. We've experienced some lingering issues with inventory availability in a few product categories. Finally, the impact of tightening market conditions, including higher interest rates and persistence levels of higher cost inflation, has created a more cautious trading environment for our customers. Despite the challenges we're taking action, first, in terms of service in the field, we've taken actions to intensify our operational rigor at stores, and DCs as well as further enhanced our inventory strategies powered by investments we've made in data analytics tools. Second, we've experienced fill rates below our acceptable levels in a few product categories. This fill rate performance has taken too long to remedy post pandemic and as a result, our merchandising teams partnered with alternative suppliers to address the issue to ensure our markets are properly stocked. Finally, while we can't control the overall market conditions, we are working closely with field sales to drive incremental growth opportunities and we continue to be disciplined on costs, including ongoing cost actions, which Bert will discuss further. As mentioned, we've underperformed our expectations at US Automotive in 2023, but with new leadership enrolled for 100 days now, the team has clarity of the priority opportunities as taken actions and are quickly moving to get where we need to be. With solid industry fundamentals and the team's competitive drive to win, we're confident our US automotive team is positioned to overcome our recent challenges and execute on our long-term strategy to profitably grow share. In Canada, sales grew approximately 4% in local currency during third quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 3%. During the quarter, our automotive and heavy-duty businesses grew mid-single digits and low single digits, respectively. And we are pleased with the Canadian team execution of their strategic initiatives despite macroeconomic pressures and a cautious consumer. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter, which total sales growth of approximately 11% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. We continue to drive strong growth in market share gains across our European markets due to the ongoing execution of our initiatives and strategic value creating acquisitions. During the third quarter, we delivered mid-single digit to double digit growth across each of our geographies driven by continued wins with key accounts, winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts, and expanding the NAPA brand in the region. In addition, the team's making excellent progress on our new National Distribution Center in France that Paul, Bert and I had a chance to visit. Scheduled to open in 2024, this 50,0000 square foot facility helps evolve the network's strategy and upgrades the level of technology and automation within our supply chain. This effort complements a similar investment in the UK, and the teams are working well to leverage best practices. We expect these facilities to further drive productivity and efficiency as well as increased service level to our customers. In the AsiaPac Automotive business, sales in the third quarter increased approximately 6% in local currency with comparable sales growth of approximately 5%. Sales for both commercial and retail were solid in the third quarter, with retail growth slightly above commercial. Having recently visited with this world class team, it's impressive to see the team consistently executing at such a high level and delivering another quarter of record sales and profitability. Our AsiaPac team is driving market share gains, improving profitability, increasing its employee value proposition all while executing strategic initiatives to create long term value. In closing, the global GPC team delivered solid third quarter results, driven by the benefit of our strategic business mix, and global geographic diversification. We remain committed to our plans for continued growth through the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment. We're confident our teams are focused on the right long term strategic initiatives that will deliver customer solutions and create value. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for your hard work, your performance, and your dedication to taking care of our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Bert Nappier Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our performance in the third quarter reflects the operating discipline in our business, alongside the focus by our teams to serve our customers, which is evident with our double-digit earnings growth for the quarter. Before I walk you through the key highlights of our third quarter performance, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the third quarter and nine months of 2023. Our comparisons to the prior year, however, excludes certain nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG. Double GPC sales increased 2.6% to $5.8 billion in third quarter of 2023. This reflects a 0.5% improvement in comparable sales, which includes low single digit levels of inflation, a 1.7% contribution from acquisitions, and a 0.5% favorable impact of foreign currency. Our sales performance reflects ongoing strength in international auto, continued, but moderating growth in industrial, offset by a decline in sales at US Automotive. Further, 1 less selling day in our US businesses negatively impacted sales growth by an estimated 120 basis points. Our ongoing execution of our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives were the primary driver of our strong gross margin expansion. Gross margin was 36.2% in the third quarter, 130 basis point improvement from the same period last year. Given our performance year-to-date, we now expect our grow margin rate for the full year to improve 50 to 60 basis points from 2022, an increase from our prior estimate of 30 to 50 basis points of improvement. Our total operating and non-operating expenses in the third quarter were $1.6 billion or 28.2% of sales. This compares to total adjusted expenses of 27.5% of sales in the third quarter last year, or an increase of approximately 70 basis points. The SG&A deleverage in the third quarter is primarily attributable to a few key factors, planned investments in wages and benefits for our teams, and increased spending and technology to support our strategic initiatives. These investments in wages and benefits for our team members impacted SG&A by approximately 35 basis points, while investments in IT and digital impacted SG&A by approximately 25 basis points in the third quarter. As you heard earlier from Will, within SG&A, the US Automotive team has been working hard to execute on cost improvement actions. The team has been successful in reducing headcount, implementing a hiring freeze, and driving discipline around travel and other discretionary costs. These actions are on track and equate to approximately 15 to 20 basis points of benefit which is embedded in our annual guidance and year to date results. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A deleverage of 30 to 40 basis points based on our investments in our team members and IT. Our third quarter revenue growth and gross margin expansion drove total segment profit of $605 million up 9.6%. Segment profit margin was 10.4%, a 70 basis point increase from last year and our seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion. This quarter's segment margin expansion is a clear reflection of the value of our portfolio diversification, highlighted by Industrial, which now represents nearly 50% of GPC's segment profit. While we deliver strong overall margin expansion driven by industrial, our Global Automotive segment margin was flat due to US Automotive. We've demonstrated consistent improvement throughout 2023 as global auto segment margins improved again sequentially. Further, we have identified opportunities to improve execution at our US Automotive business and position the business to take share. With a combination of operating discipline and ongoing investments in strategic initiatives to drive further operational efficiencies and productivity for the year, we now expect GPC segment margin expansion of 40 to 50 basis points and increase of our previous outlook of 20 to 40 basis points of improvement. Our third quarter net income was $351 million or $2.49 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $317 million or $2.23 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 11.7%. Turning to our cash flows. For the first nine months of 2023, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and $733 million in free cash flow. We closed the third quarter with $2.2 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.6 times, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Highlighting our flexibility and the strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to our four key priorities of capital allocation, which include the investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. During 2023, we have invested $350 million in capital expenditures, including $145 million in the third quarter. We remain disciplined investing in initiatives we believe will drive modernization and long-term growth for our business, as acquisitions remain a key element of our growth strategy we invested $211 million year to date for acquisitions, including the investment in Gaudi to expand our market leading position in Iberia. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of bolt on acquisition targets for our business. Thus far in 2023, we have also returned approximately $565 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $393 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $172 million in cash used to repurchase 1.1 million shares. We remain well positioned with solid cash flows and a strong balance sheet to effectively deploy our capital through any economic environment. Turning to our guidance. We continue to navigate a balanced mix of headwinds and tailwinds as we move into the fourth quarter. With that backdrop, we are reiterating our full year sales guidance and updating our diluted earnings per share guidance previously provided in our Q2 earnings release. We now expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.20 to $9.30 an increase of approximately 10.3% to 11.5% from 2022. This compares to our previous outlook of $9.15 to $9.30. Our sales guidance is unchanged and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding for the following, 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. Within this outlook, we expect international automotive to be at the high end or above this range with US Automotive below. We also expect Global Automotive segment margin to be flat to slightly down for the year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 4% to 6% with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. As expected, the sales growth within this segment has moderated along with the industrial economy, and our outlook includes low-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. For the year, we now expect Global Industrial segment margin to expand by at least 150 basis points year-over-year. We are reaffirming our outlook for cash from operations and free cash flow. We expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, and free cash flow to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion. We continue to plan for capital expenditures of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology, and supply chain, among others. In closing, our third quarter double-digit earnings growth demonstrates our ability to improve earnings and expand margins and low growth environments backed by a strong balance sheet and returns to our shareholders through our dividend. Our teams are delivering on what we said we would do for 2023, including our expectations for mid-single-digit sales growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth for the full year. We look forward to closing the year strong and reporting on our fourth quarter and full year results on our call in February. Thank you. And we will now turn it back to the operator, for your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Scot Ciccarelli of Truist. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. I know your Investor Day wasn't all that long ago, but you guys had outlined some margin targets for each of your divisions, and while we've seen great progress on the industrial side. How are you guys thinking about your automotive margin targets given the performance from the last few quarters? Bert Nappier : Yes, Scot, Bert. Thanks for the question. Look, I don't think we've changed how we're thinking long-term. We've got two years left on that cycle. And again, as we close out this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're looking for Global Automotive segment to be, flat to slightly down. With two years left, it's not unusual to get to a three-year plan a little differently, maybe than you started in March, and when we announced all that, but we still, still feel confident that the levers are there. As we look at the long-term margin expansion, particularly for auto, we got pricing and category management benefits. So, when talk about pricing and sourcing benefits and gross margin expansion. We'll continue to see those levers. And we've got further long-term investments, and that's really how we're thinking about this. We've got some short-term challenges, but a long-term investment around things like supply chain, investments in IT, those remain in early innings. And so, we're really still bullish on the long-term despite some of this near-term choppiness. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. That's, that\u2019s helpful. And then given some of the near-term choppiness, and you guys are obviously implement -- implementing various improvement processes to improve the U.S. auto business. But, the way this business typically works is, once you lose market share, it's kind of hard to get back. So how are you guys thinking about -- can, can you actually -- are you guys thinking that you can call that market share back or, are the changes you're implementing really just kind of patching holes in the ship and stopping incremental share losses? Thanks. Will Stengel : Yes, Scott, it's Will. Let me, let me add a few thoughts. And I'll start by just saying, the U.S. Automotive team, just to be very clear, is working incredibly hard every day to take care of their customers and be easy to deal with, and as you know, better than anyone, what that means for customers is, we got to be in a position to offer them the right quality part in the right place at the right time, and have that transaction be seamless. Once that product is available in the market, we needed to efficiently and quickly speak -- efficient and quick to search for the part and then pull the part and get it to the customer. And so, when you think about what we're working on everyday, we have the opportunities probably to be better in, each part of that. There's no single point of failure that has recently developed. I think this is just a call to action for the team that we need to be better across the board. The good news is, as you started with your question, and our initiatives that we detailed at Investor Day are all focused around these customer needs, and we're making good progress. And while, we might have been disappointed with recent performance, and might indicate that we've given back a little bit of share, we still feel good about what we're working on. We just need to do that body of work with more urgency at a faster pace. Paul D. Donahue: And Scot, I would, I would just add on to that. Look, we've been in this business a long, long time. There's nothing structural, that has shifted or changed in, in our business or in our, in our structure. We know the levers to pull, will hit on them. And trust me, there is a sense of urgency up and down, up and down the organization to get it done. I have no doubt we'll get it done. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. On the U.S. auto business, can you frame how much market share you have locked in the most recent quarter, and how does that compare to the run rate, or is that, is it getting better, or is it getting worse? Paul D. Donahue: And, Michael, can you repeat the last part of that question, you're, you're kind of fading in and out on it. Michael Lasser : Sorry, Paul. Sorry. Paul D. Donahue: That\u2019s all right. Michael Lasser : Are your share, yes, are your share losses getting better or are they getting worse? Bert Nappier : Yes, Michael, I don't think it's getting worse. Listen, I think we're clearly disappointed with the recent performance. And as I said, that plus some of the performance of our credible competitors would indicate we've given back some share over the last couple of quarters. But maybe a few thoughts to elaborate on the whole, share thought, which is -- we've always had strong competition in this profit pool, both large and small. And as I said with Scot, it takes consistent execution everyday to serve those customers. And we just haven't performed to, our expectations in '23. I would tell you we have seen with the supply chain challenges moderating over the last 12 months, some of our smaller competitors have gotten more healthy, as it relates to inventory. And so, we're seeing them, playing from a different place of strength than they were maybe 12 months or 24 months ago. The good news is, is that we play in a huge market. It's very fragmented. And as, Paul said, we know what we need to do to return to a position where we're taking share. But we're not, we're not feeling like it\u2019s getting worse. We've got a good line of sight of what we're working on and taking action as we talked about on the call. Paul D. Donahue: And Michael, Michael, I would just add to that, that you really have to break down. I mean, it's a very broad question, when you start thinking about and talking about market share. It's very fragmented industry. Yes, you have the big four, but then you've got you know, independent WDs scattered throughout the country, along with, with others. So, you really got to look category-by-category. And what I'm pleased to see, and I'm encouraged to see is that when I look at specific product categories, product categories that move the needle, for our business, we have made changes, and we have improved our availability and we've improved our supply chain. And I would tell you if we're at fault for anything, it's it took us too long to make those changes. I think we'll touch on that. So, yes, no doubt better days are ahead and the team under Randy's leadership are all over. Michael Lasser : It\u2019s just my mic problem. Thank you very much for that. And my follow-up question is [Technical difficult] Bert Nappier : Hey, Michael, it's Bert. You're still cutting out pretty, pretty bad. We can't hear you very well. Could you get a look -- Michael Lasser : So hopefully, that's better. Paul D. Donahue: Oh, yeah, much, much better. Michael Lasser : All right. All right. Sorry. But my follow-up question is, some of the share dynamics influenced general parts -- Genuine Parts ability or willingness to do acquisitions in the U.S. auto business right now? Bert Nappier : Hi, Michael. It's Bert. And first and foremost, welcome to the, to the universe of coverage for GPC. Thanks for joining, joining us. We appreciate that. I would say no. I mean, look, we look at what we're -- what's happening here, and as Will and Paul have given me some color on, really just as something we're managing through here in the near-term. The great thing about GPC is that we performed pretty well through all cycles. We've had $1.1 billion of cash generated here year-to-date $733 million of free cash flow. We have a tremendously strong balance sheet, and we're improving our margins and growing earnings double-digits despite some softer topline. And so, I think the great thing is that the performance of the business holistically allows us to continue to take advantage of the market including the M&A market and investments in capital expenditures that are great for the business long-term. And so while we may have a little choppiness short-term, it doesn't impact our ability to move, as we need to move, whether it's in U.S. automotive on M&A or the whole portfolio. Michael Lasser : Thank you. Sorry for the background. Bert Nappier : No worries. Thanks, Michael. Paul D. Donahue: Thanks, Mike. Operator : The next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. Some I'd love to go a little deeper in the trend through the quarter and the exit rate and particularly how, inflation may have impacted that. Bert Nappier : Hey, Greg. It\u2019s Bert. I'll talk about inflation first, and then we'll come back to, kind of, our views on guidance and outlook. I think we've talked about this a little bit along the way throughout the course of the year. Inflation has really developed almost exactly as we expected with where we thought we would to begin the year. That's a little bit of a surprise and that we could be, kind of, that consistently, planning and thinking out the way we're thinking about the trends of inflation. We thought they'd moderate through the course of the year and they have. So, we started the year, with a mid-single-digits, moving to low-single-digits in Q2, all up low-single-digits here again in the third quarter. And we expect to finish out the year in low-single-digit. So, really has followed how monetary policy has been implemented around the world and tick down as we expected. One thing to call out on inflation, I think it's important to keep in focus and, Will mentioned it in his prepared remarks, inflation or said differently price, was a significant tailwind in 2022 for the automotive aftermarket. And that's dissipated in 2023, as I just kind of outlined. In particular, in third quarter a year ago, we were looking at inflation and sales at the high-single-digit level for the Global Automotive segment with the U.S. at nearly 10%. And that's a pretty tough comp when you think about low-single-digits for this particular period that we're coming up against. So, I think right now, moving as we expected, we'll close out the year low-single-digits, across the board. In terms of the outlook and how we're thinking about the rest of the year, bringing that up just a level, it'll start at the highest level and then maybe work down through getting to U.S. automotive. We think we've had a great quarter in terms of earnings growth, double-digit earnings here in Q3. That gave us some confidence to narrow our range and lift the bottom up, with a new guidance range of $9.20 to $9.30. As I said in my prepared remarks, we really have a mix of tailwinds and headwinds, tailwinds, solid industry fundamentals for both segments. We've improved our gross margin outlook, industrial margin for the full year as a bit better than we thought. There\u2019re some positive trends in industrial production data. I'm not ready to call a new trend, but at least it's leaning positive of late. And we're going to have continued ongoing discipline in costs, and that's going to lead to our expectations for segment margin expansion for GPC. In terms of headwinds, you guys know most of these. We've got a choppy environment out there. We've got inflation, geopolitical considerations, a new thing here in October with student loan repayments starting back. That's probably somewhere near $10 billion a month. So, obviously, something that will impact the consumer. Interest rate environment are up sharply over the last month. And so taken together, we see an increasingly cautious consumer. We're also going to be prudent about the time that it's going to take to, to effectuate some of the operational changes and rigor that, Will mentioned. So that taken together, I think, is how we're thinking about the rest of the year. But again, we expect a strong year when it's all said and done. We're going to close out the year based on our guidance with mid-single-digit revenue growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion, and we expect to have double-digit earning growth in a tough environment for the full year. And maybe Will, if you want to comment a little bit on the cadence of the quarter. Will Stengel : Yes. Greg, it's for, U.S. auto cadence of the quarter. It was mixed through the quarter. July was slightly up, as I think we said in our, prepared remarks, August was down low-single-digits, and we exited the quarter with September up low-single-digits. We did call out the NAPA EXPO, year-over-year compare. That event was in July of last year. By the time all the sales had processed, it's probably, it's not scientific probably impacting August. So, if you think about that adjustment, it's probably mid-quarter, mid-to-end of the quarter. Bert Nappier : And Greg, I'll come back and give a little bit more color. You kind of talked about how things are looking as we start and maybe pull that up. As I think about this year on U.S. automotive, the full year, we started out Q1 with a little softer, weather impact there. And as we said in Q2, we really knew that our U.S. automotive business had more potential than we showed, and it's a feeling we continue to echo. Q2 made some new moves with new president. Cost actions to further drive some of the improvement of -- to offset the weakness on the topline. And the Q2 results were really a catalyst for the executive team to walk away and look at the things that were impacting our performance. We'll share those perspectives. But as we look at the fourth quarter with respect to U.S. AG or to the U.S. Automotive business, we know that we've got a tough comp coming up yet again. So, fourth quarter, for U.S. automotive was a 9.6 reported comp sales growth was 6.3. So, we have another fourth tough quarter ahead. And, all things considered, we expect the fourth quarter for them to be in-line with the third quarter. Greg Melich : Got it. And when did inflation peak last year. And maybe you've even brought it out some more like, average unit price, if you think about mix. Bert Nappier : Yes. So, our third quarter would have been the highest inflation comp for the year for that business and, Will mentioned that. We've got another tough comp on inflation in the fourth quarter. That's going to be around 8% for the U.S. automotive business. So, the peak would have been Q3, but we still have a tough Q4 comp. Greg Melich : That's great. Thanks, and good luck guys. Paul D. Donahue: Thanks. Bert Nappier : We appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Christopher Horvers of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Christian Oberle : Hi. Good morning. It's Christian Oberle on for Chris. So, Motion organic trends have had been outperforming the ISM and, and industrial production as the, industrial economy had slowed. So, as you digest, the outsized share deals following the KDG acquisition, do those indicators become more relevant again? And as you look ahead, are there any end markets where there's reasons to believe it should reflect positively or negatively? Will Stengel : Yes, Christian. Thanks for the question. Look, those are two important data points. We monitor and track them closely. And, we've publicly said that it seems whether with KDG or post pandemic that, the correlation was less clear. Having said that, we still look at those indicators, and we've been encouraged obviously by the recent trends in particular industrial production. So, they're certainly part of what we look at as we inform our views of the outlook of the business and, based on those recent inflections, we're cautiously optimistic. There's no specific tie with those metrics to a specific part of our business. I think it's a good representation of the diversity of our business. And so, it's something that we look at in conjunction with customer, vendor feedback, provide different other pieces of internal and external data. But we\u2019re cautiously optimistic based on what we're seeing both in the business and from a third-party data perspective. Paul D. Donahue: Hey, Christian, I would just tag on to what, Will said. We are encouraged. One, we'll mention the industrial production numbers, which we saw nice a lift in September. But we've tracked 14 different indicators in our Motion business. Christian, we saw five of those indicators improve in September. So, categories like, I mean, automotive has continued to be positive food products, DC logistics, equipment leasing, all are trending up, including mining. So, yes, to Will's point have -- has the industrial downturn has had reached a trough. I think if it hasn't, we're darn close. And what we generally find is, as we see the major indices like industrial production begin to bounce back, we generally follow that somewhere 60 to 90 days later, we'll see our business begin to shift. So, again, great team at Motion. They've had a phenomenal year, and, and we're looking forward to better days here in 2024 on the top line for that group. Christian Oberle : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And as you think about gross margin, are there any one time or unsustainable items in 3Q just given and as you look ahead, you know, vendor allowances have historically driven a fair amount of volatility in 4Q gross margins. So, is there anything to call out there? Bert Nappier : Hi Christian, its Bert. Nothing to call out, we had a really clean quarter on gross margin. Nothing related to some of the noise you just mentioned there. I'm super proud of the teams. They've executed at a very high level. So, our expansion of gross margin here in the third quarter of 130 basis points continues to come on the back of the investments we're making in sourcing and pricing. Christian Oberle : Got it. Thank you very much and best of luck. Bert Nappier : Thank you, Christian. Operator : The next question comes from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is regarding the pricing strategy in the US Automotive business. Obviously, you've done a great job improving your gross margins there. But what gives you the confidence that your less aggressive pricing is not leading to some market share losses? Bert Nappier : Yes, Seth. This is Bert. Look, it's a good question. A thoughtful question. And we don't believe that our work around gross margin has come at the expense of share gains. You all know that price is not generally the leading factor. And driving sales in the aftermarket. It's more about availability and quality as Paul and Will have mentioned this morning. That's a really strategic question. It comes down to pricing strategies that category and SKU level, and the long-standing balance of that against unit growth. We believe the investments we're making in data analytics and pricing tool many of those we showcase at Investor Day have really given us an ability to be even more strategic and flex our strategy up and down, by both category and geography. It allows us to remain competitive, respond to the environment as it moves and stay in line with the market dynamics. So, I think the short answer is no. We don't believe that our work there is impacting, share gains or losses. And we continue to stay focused on driving our gross margin performance, we lifted our expectations for the year, now looking at 50 to 60 basis points of improvement for the full year. I\u2019m pleased with that result. Seth Basham : That's helpful color. And you mentioned responding to market dynamics you know, talked about some of your smaller competitors being better in stock. Last quarter, you talked about weighing the cost and benefits of the major account segment. Can you give us an update on that latter point? How you're thinking about major accounts at this point has become more price competitive there, and if you walked away for any business? Will Stengel : Yes, Seth. You know, I wouldn't say there's a material change in the major accounts part of the business. It continues to be pressured. We've been more disciplined as you alluded to in the way that we're thinking about the business or that piece of the business. It's about 15% to 20% of our commercial business. So, it's not a large, outsized portion of the total business. And as I think we've said before, it's inside of our major account business, there's four or five different even sub verticals. And there's different nuances associated with each one of those verticals. So, we have seen some consolidation in some of the, national players in particular, some of our existing customers that have come to consolidate that's impacted some of the year over year trends, just as they work through some of their acquisition activity. But generally speaking, the business continues to kind of, be at the same level that it was last quarter to slightly down. Bert Nappier : Yes, Seth. Just a little additional color on that. We're, -- you know, as we break apart that major account business, which Will alluded to, where we see challenges in some of the big national tire chains. But on the flip side, we're seeing a good growth in our fleet and our government. We're seeing recent growth in the OE dealer segment, which we expect to continue as some of those challenges for that segment continues. So, there's puts and takes, but, again, our team is addressing those issues, and I think we'll see improvements here going forward. Seth Basham : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yep. Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Will Stengel : Hi, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : I want to start on the automotive margin. Maybe a follow-up to Scott's question earlier. I think you mentioned you know, pricing and category management as levers to still pull in the coming years. Just curious, as you think about some of the fixes in the auto business, as you expand the new suppliers, does that limit the category management benefit or the NAPA private label offering? And then pricing is good to hear. I guess you kind of answered it in the past question. Can you just talk about the pricing backdrop and the ability to use that as a lever to grow margins again? Bert Nappier : Sure. Look, I don't think we've, think anything differently about the longer term, to follow-up on that earlier point. As I said, maybe we'll get there a little bit differently than we expected when we announced everything in March. This year's played out slightly differently, but we have two years ago, and gross margin, opportunities aren't going to be impacted by changes in suppliers. Actually, there are opportunities more than anything as we look continuing to be competitive going to market with our size and scale, looking at some of these opportunities, more globally and through a one GPC prism. So, I don't see those as limitations at all. They actually tend to be more of an opportunity for us. The pricing environment remains rational. We still think there's opportunity there. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we've got great work and data analytics there that allows us to be flexible and nimble. And we haven't really seen a change in the way the competition is behaving in that space that would change our view on the longer term or the or the short term for that matter. Will Stengel : Yeah. Daniel, I would just add the, your question around the NAPA brand and category management. That's all upside. And just as a reminder, I think as we talked at investor day, when we look at category management now, we essentially by product category, we look at our global volume. So that NAPA brand has got strong presence now across Europe, AsiaPac and, of course, North America. So, to me, that's upside for our North American business. As we get into a better position, from a supply and inventory standpoint to really accelerate our growth in a couple of key product categories. Daniel Imbro : Great. That's helpful. And then just to clarify, Bert, I guess, you said you had one fewer selling day in the quarter. I guess, how did that happen? Was it timing of a holiday and what month did that fall in as we think about the cadency laid out? And then if there any makeup, if there are one more selling day in any quarter coming up, we should be aware of as a model. Bert Nappier : So, Dan I missed the very beginning of your question. Can you give that back to me one more time? Daniel Imbro : You said one fewer selling day. Was it a holiday timing or kind of what drove that. And then what month did it fall into as we think about the cadence you gave us at month-to-month comps? Bert Nappier : I'd rather not get into -- get into parsing out the quarter by month. The quarter year over year in the US, for both Motion and for US Automotive was impacted by one day. We'll just leave it there. And then, in fourth quarter, we're going to be flat on operating days. Daniel Imbro : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Our last question comes from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Kate McShane : Hi. Thanks for taking our question. We had two quick ones. First, is there a way to delineate between the pockets of where inventory is maybe a little light versus some of the execution issues that you highlighted in automotive. And is there a timeline of when inventory availability improves? Will Stengel : Yeah. There is we have great information, on where we've got our opportunities as we've talked about the last 12 to 24 months, investing in analytics, and in particular around inventory analytics has been an area of focus. So, I think that's made us better to know precisely where we have, opportunities. And the opportunities are not just availability, but it's movement. And again, there's nothing \u2013 there's not a new thought here. It's just better execution. That's taking the inventory that we have and getting into the right spot at the right time and making sure that you've got enough of the stuff that's moving fast. We've got a lot of visibility into that. And it's an ongoing effort. I mean, we've been working on this topic probably forever. And we're just stepping up our urgency. So, we'll, the teams that are urgent, they're focused on it, and we're going to make progress each and every day. Paul D. Donahue: And Kate, I would just tag out to what Will said. Specific categories that were problematic for us, during the pandemic and even post pandemic, those new programs are rolling out as we speak. So, we would expect to see improvements in those product categories here going forward. Kate McShane : Okay. Thank you. And then our last question is just around the 340-basis point headwind in the quarter. Was that anticipated when you were originally guiding 4% to 6% same store sales in automotive? And if so, what is bringing that original comp guide of 4% to 6% down to 2% to 4%? Is it more what's being anticipated in Q4? Bert Nappier : Yeah, Kate, it's Bert. Of course, we knew the expo headwind and the selling day was there. So that wasn't a surprise to us at all. Remember, we don't guide to quarters. So, we weren't thinking about through that \u2013 through a Q3 lens. We were thinking about our guidance through the full year. And we, you know, as we guided, thought we would sell through that. And again, we've reaffirmed our top line guide for the year this morning. We did lower the comp guide for automotive. I think that's just being smart, about having to factor in. The slower and softer performance for US Automotive year to date and what it's going to mean for the full year. But at the end of the day, as we thought about expectations, sales recovery didn't progress quite as quickly as we thought in Q3, Will has given you a lot detail around the execution things we're working on. And again, we've reaffirmed our full year top line this morning. Kate McShane : Thank you. Bert Nappier : Thanks, Kate. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Paul Donahue for any closing remarks. Paul D. Donahue: Yeah. Thanks, Andrea. And, just to reiterate, we want to thank all of our teammates around the globe for their efforts, in the quarter and year to date. And, just to let them know how much we appreciate, all they do for the company and for our customers. I'd also like to thank all of you for joining us today and thanks for your combined and your continued interest in Genuine Parts Company. Have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report that Genuine Parts Company delivered on our financial commitments in 2023 and finished the year with a solid fourth quarter. Will and Bert will cover our results in more detail, but I'd like to share a few highlights.  During 2023, total GPC sales topped $23 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion from the prior year and in line with our expectations. We improved our total company segment profit margins by 50 basis points to nearly double digits, and we had our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. And notably, we returned $788 million to our shareholders this year and today, we announced that our Board approved a 68th consecutive annual increase to the dividend.  Our teams around the globe delivered a strong performance while remaining focused on our long-term strategic initiatives to profitably grow our business and deliver value for our customers. I want to take this opportunity to thank our more than 60,000 GPC teammates across the world for their dedication and hard work. Our fourth quarter and full year results again demonstrate the value of our complementary business mix paired with our geographic diversity. At our Investor Day back in March of 2023, we showcased our strategic initiatives and announced long-term financial targets for the first time in our history, all focused on delivering for our customers and delivering shareholder value. Clearly, this past year had its share of challenges and opportunities, but our performance in 2023 was a good start to achieve our three-year goals highlighted by the following. Our Motion team completed the integration of Kaman Distribution Group, and we exceeded our synergy target a full year ahead of plan. As an integrated business, Motion is a clear leader in their space, providing industrial aftermarket solutions with a compelling value proposition to more than 200,000 customers around the world.  In addition, during 2023, Motion continued to roll out their fulfillment center strategy, which is driving cost efficiencies, inventory productivity and improved customer service levels. During the fourth quarter, I had a chance to visit our fulfillment center in Lakeland, Florida, and I can't say enough positive things about the team and their dedication to serving our customers. We're excited about the rollout of these facilities in 2024 and 2025.  Within Automotive, our International Automotive businesses outperformed our expectations in 2023. Our European team continues to expand their presence and gained market share through both strategic acquisitions and organic growth. In 2023, we expanded our presence in Spain, Europe's fifth largest car park with the acquisition of Gaudi, securing our position as the leader in this strategic market. And finally, the rollout of NAPA branded product in the European market has continued to surpass our expectations, a testament to the strength of the NAPA brand. In Australasia, our team is profitably growing market share with their fourth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth on top of industry-leading sales growth. Our supply chain investments in the region have improved the customer experience while driving productivity in our business. In North America, while results fell short of our expectations, we remain focused on our strategic initiatives and continue to make solid progress. We've undertaken a comprehensive review of the NAPA business to identify key issues, and we have taken action to improve the performance at NAPA. We are confident we are focused on the right initiatives to positively impact our performance in the quarters ahead. These initiatives, along with plans for long-term investments, were rolled out to our field leadership teams and across our independent owner group in December. The teams' competitive drive and energy were on full display, and we know that the best days for NAPA are in front of us. And finally, as part of our long-term growth strategy, our teams continue to expand our footprint through bolt-on acquisitions. During the year, our global automotive store count expanded by 173 net new stores, up approximately 2% from 2022. We remain disciplined on our playbook for acquisitions and are confident in our ability to continue seamlessly integrating future businesses across all our segments and geographies to create value for our shareholders.  As we look ahead to 2024, we are seeing supportive industry fundamentals in both the Automotive and Industrial end markets. Within our global Automotive business, we continue to see an increase in miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet and high vehicle prices and financing costs all supportive for the Automotive aftermarket, and we remain uniquely positioned in this space with our global footprint. Within our industrial business, macro indicators like industrial production, and the Purchasing Managers' Index continue to show improvement after 15 months of contraction. We stand to benefit from a highly diversified portfolio of customers and end markets and we are well positioned now and in the future to capitalize on reshoring trends. While industry fundamentals remain supportive, broader macroeconomic factors like high interest rates and persistent inflation in everyday purchases are pressuring the consumer and businesses alike. That said, the vast majority of parts and solutions we provide across both businesses are great fits and non-discretionary in nature. In our business, parts availability is paramount, and we are leveraging our enhanced data analytics and science to have the right part in the right place at the right time. As we continue to navigate the environment in 2024, it is imperative that we remain agile and move forward with a sense of urgency. Given current market conditions, we need to continuously take action to position our business for long-term success. This morning, we announced a global restructuring initiative to further simplify and streamline our business. Will and Bert will share more about the specific actions we are taking, along with the financial implications. So in closing, we are proud to have delivered on our financial commitments for 2023. We accomplished this while taking decisive actions to improve our NAPA business in the U.S. while at the same time, investing in our strategic priorities to drive profitable growth. We believe the execution of our strategic initiatives, along with our teams' relentless focus on our customers, will drive value for our customers and our shareholders, both now and for years to come.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will. Will Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by adding my thanks to the global GPC team for another great year and for their ongoing dedication to serving our customers. In addition to delivering solid financial results for the year, we also made significant progress on our strategic initiatives, many of which we shared at our Investor Day last March. Globally, we align our strategic initiatives around five foundational priorities, which include talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology complemented by disciplined and value-creating M&A. Our focus around these priorities drives global team alignment as we continuously improve the customer experience and deliver profitable growth. Turning to our results by business segment. During the fourth quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.1 billion, an increase of 2% with comparable sales growth of 1% versus the same period last year and 18% on a two-year basis. Average daily sales were essentially flat in October with low single-digit growth in both November and December.  Motion saw mixed results across its various end markets similar to last quarter, with particular strength in iron and steel, chemicals and mining. Categories like equipment and machinery and oil and gas were underperformers relative to the fourth quarter average. Motion continues to make excellent progress with initiatives, including sales excellence, pricing, e-commerce, technology and supply chain strategies that are helping to win profitable market share and improve productivity. For the full year, Motion sales grew $414 million or 5% with comparable sales of 5% and 22% on a 2-year basis. I'd like to take a quick moment to highlight our Motion team in Asia Pacific, who delivered a fantastic year. Sales and profit were up double digits in 2023 and the team continues to outperform our expectations. Industrial segment profit in the fourth quarter was $275 million, up 19% and 12.9% sales, representing a 190 basis point increase from the same period last year. For the full year, Industrial segment profit was $1.1 billion up 24% and 12.5% of sales, representing a 200 basis point increase from the same period last year and exceeding the 2025 target that we set at our Investor Day.  Bert will take you through more detail on our outlook for the Industrial segment margin, but we're confident that our strategic initiatives can continue to deliver margin expansion. Throughout 2023, the profit improvement in Industrial was primarily driven by strategic pricing excellent operating discipline, the execution of our productivity initiatives and the accelerated integration of KDG. When we announced the acquisition of KDG in December of 2021 we set a target of approximately $50 million of synergies to be accomplished over a three-year period. We're proud to say that the integration of KDG is complete and we've realized $70 million of synergies a full year ahead of schedule. Turning to the Global Automotive segment, during the fourth quarter our International Automotive businesses posted positive sales growth in local currency, while sales declined at U.S. Automotive. Total sales for global automotive increased approximately 1% for the quarter, with comparable store sales decreasing 3%. For the full year, total sales for the Global Automotive segment increased 4% with comparable store sales increasing 2%, in-line with our guidance. The moderation in the sales benefit from inflation continues to be a factor in our year-over-year comparisons. As expected, Global Automotive sales inflation moderated throughout the year and ended the year in the low single-digit range compared to a high single-digit range in the fourth quarter of 2022. Global Automotive segment profit in the fourth quarter was $259 million and segment operating margin was 7.5%, down 110 basis points. In the fourth quarter, all of our international geographies delivered margin expansion, although Global Automotive segment margin was negatively impacted by the performance at U.S. Automotive. For the full year, automotive segment profit decreased approximately 1% versus the same period last year and segment operating margin was 8.2%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. Now let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter with total sales growth of 10% in local currency and comparable sales growth of 4%. For the year, total sales growth was 16% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 8%. We're winning profitable market share gains across our European markets due to the on-going execution of our initiatives and strategic value-creating acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, we saw low single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies and for the year, we delivered mid-single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our markets. This was driven by continued wins with key accounts, winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expanding the NAPA brand, generating over $400 million in the region, which exceeds our internal target for 2023. Congratulations to the entire AAG team for another outstanding year. In the Asia-Pac automotive business, sales in the fourth quarter increased 2% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 1%. This compares to strong double-digit growth in the comparable period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the fourth quarter. The team is executing well, converting the sales momentum in the quarter into strong operating margin expansion. For the year, sales increased 7% in local currency and comparable sales increased 6%. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the year with commercial growth up mid-single digits and retail growth up high single digits. Our Asia-Pacific team had another fantastic year and their fourth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth. They continue to drive market share gains, deliver strong operating leverage and strategically invest for long-term success. Congratulations again to the Asia-Pacific team on another great year. In Canada, sales grew approximately 1% in local currency during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales decreasing approximately 1%. For the year, total sales grew 5% in local currency, with comparable sales increasing 4%. We're pleased with the Canadian team's growth this year and the execution of their strategic initiatives, despite a softer macroeconomic backdrop and a more cautious consumer in Canada.  In the US, automotive sales declined 5.6% during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales down 6.1%. A reminder that our comparable sales figure includes same-store sales out from our company-owned stores, as well as same-store sales into our independent owned stores. In the quarter, sales to commercial customers were down low single digits, while sales to DIY customers were down mid-single digits. For commercial, NAPA Auto Care saw low single-digit growth while major accounts sales were down mid-single digits.  Let me provide an update on the priority actions we're taking at NAPA that we explained on our third quarter call. We detailed three key areas to improve, including operational rigor in our stores, addressing fill rates in key product categories and working with our commercial teams to address growth opportunities in the field. First, we completed changes to certain key suppliers to improve fill rates. The changes have improved category trends in the fourth quarter and we're encouraged by the positive momentum. Second, our in-store service levels measured by on-time delivery to customers have significantly improved, as a result of increased focus on last-mile operating disciplines. Lastly, our commercial efforts are on-going and were highlighted by the appointment of Tom Skov to a newly created role of EVP Sales and Store Operations for NAPA. Previously serving as a Division Vice President in the West, Tom has over 20 years of field sales and operations experience with NAPA. He's an automotive parts expert and has a deep understanding of our customer's field sales and store operations. We're excited for the strong leadership Tom will bring to our sales and store operations field teams. While these actions drove encouraging improvements, the fourth quarter results at NAPA still missed our expectations. As we mentioned previously, the fourth quarter and December in particular, were difficult year-over-year sales comparisons for NAPA. Our average daily sales growth for NAPA in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 10%, which included approximately 8% benefit from inflation with December 2022 sales up 13%. As expected, the benefit from inflation did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2023. Further, December 2022 included the benefits of extreme winter weather for most of the U.S. With that context, as we look within the current fourth quarter for U.S. Automotive, the first two months of the quarter were in-line with our outlook that we shared last quarter. December performance, however, was well below our expectations, driven by unseasonably warm weather and moderated purchases from our independent owners. We have the opportunity to be with many of our largest owners at a week-long meeting in December. It was a productive series of discussions with high energy and good engagement. The outlook for the market fundamentals remains positive. We reviewed areas of commercial focus and detailed key initiatives to deliver profitable growth together. The NAPA competitive spirit is certainly high. A theme from the owner's feedback highlighted on-going efforts to manage their purchases as they balance operating costs in the current environment. Based on the session feedback, however, we remain optimistic that owners purchasing behaviors return to more normal patterns in 2024 and we're encouraged by the performance in January, albeit it's only one month. As we reflect on 2023 and move forward, we will continue to evolve our operating model at U.S. Automotive. We will be more intentional about owning more stores. A higher mix of company-owned stores in targeted priority markets enables us to service our repair shop and commercial customers more consistently and completely. We are also working actively to better align incentives with our independent owners to partner and grow together. We have current and future opportunities to create value in both our owned and independent owned locations. As an example, during the fourth quarter, we made strategic acquisitions of 33 NAPA stores from our independent owners, ending the year with approximately 1,560 company-owned stores up 20% versus 2021. While owner acquisitions have been a long-standing aspect of the business, these trends accelerated in the fourth quarter and second half of 2023 and we would expect these accelerated trends to continue into 2024. The NAPA business navigated unexpected challenges in 2023, but the team adjusted and took decisive action to step up our operational intensity, simplify our priorities and improve service to our customers. As we look back during the year, a few highlights. We brought in new leadership with Randy Brow now leading the team and a proven internal leader as the new CFO. These seasoned executives got to work quickly identifying opportunities and improved our business clarity and priorities. We quickly assessed costs and took action to increase productivity and efficiency. We partnered with new suppliers to address poor fill rates in select key categories and surgically invested in inventory breadth and depth. We identified opportunities within our stores and DCs to improve our processes to ensure that we're delivering our customer commitments and executing locally. We accelerated progress on foundational talent, technology and supply chain investments, including as one example, a strategic global partnership with Google for analytics and search. And we're encouraged by some recent wins, including a structured inside sales program, planned introduction of new product lines and recent traction with loyalty programs with key customers. In 2024, we believe that supportive industry fundamentals combined with clear priorities and urgent action position NAPA to deliver success. For GPC, overall, our global teams are already actively executing 2024 priorities, focused on our key strategic initiatives across our businesses. We know evolving market environments require us to continuously evolve with them and to that end, as Paul mentioned, we announced a coordinated restructuring program across each of our global geographies.  The primary objective of the global program is to continue to simplify and streamline our operations, consistent with our overall business strategy. When we simplify, we increase the speed of local service, deliver operational productivity, improve the efficiency of our teams and reduce our overall cost to serve. This program is a similar playbook to our previous GPC program implemented in fall 2019 that delivered positive results. Aspects of the restructuring are already in flight and some will take place in the months ahead. Bert will go over the financial details of our restructuring and his remarks and update you on how it's reflected in our 2024 outlook. In closing, GPC delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results and we achieved the plan we laid out for 2023. This was driven by the benefit of our strategic business mix and global geographic diversification. Most importantly, it was driven by incredible effort from our global teammates to take care of our customers, live our GPC values every day and deliver performance. We're committed to our plans for long-term growth, and we're confident our teams are focused on the right strategic initiatives that will deliver solutions for our customers and create value. Thank you, again, to the entire GPC team for another great year.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Bert Nappier : Thank you, Will and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our performance in the fourth quarter and full year continues to demonstrate our long history of delivering earnings and cash flow growth, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our results, which include double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter and for 2023 were achieved while navigating through a dynamic and challenging year. Before I walk you through the key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter and 12 months of 2023. Our comparisons to prior year, however, exclude nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG and an adjustment in the fourth quarter related to a remeasurement of our product liability reserve. As we look at 2023, sales totalled $23.1 billion, up 4.5% from 2022 and consistent with our guidance. In the fourth quarter, sales increased 1.1% and with a 2% contribution from acquisitions and a 0.3% favorable impact of foreign currency and other. These items were partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in comparable sales. During the quarter, we experienced low single-digit levels of inflation in both our automotive and industrial segments in line with our expectations. As Will outlined, our fourth quarter sales performance was highlighted by the growth in Europe, Australasia and industrial, offset by the decline in U.S. Automotive. During the fourth quarter, our gross margin expanded by approximately 70 basis points. And for the year, our gross margin was 35.9%, an 80 basis point improvement from our adjusted gross margin in 2022. Our gross margin expansion was primarily driven by the execution of our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives through investments in technology that enabled us to leverage data and analytics to ensure we have the right inventory for our customers to meet their needs. Total operating and non-operating expenses were 28.9% of sales in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from total adjusted expenses in the prior year. For the year, total expenses were 28.4% of sales, a 50 basis point increase from adjusted expenses in 2022. During 2023, we anticipated 60 basis points of deleverage related to our planned investments in team members and increased spending in technology, both of which came in line with our expectations. These investments were partially offset by cost actions throughout the year, particularly at U.S. Automotive. Despite the deleverage in SG&A, our fourth quarter gross margin expansion drove segment profit margin up 10 basis points to 9.6%. For the year, segment profit margin was 9.9%, a notable 50 basis point increase from 2022 and highlighted by our team at Motion driving an impressive 200 basis points of margin expansion on mid-single-digit sales growth with industrial now representing approximately 50% of GPC's profit pool. Our fourth quarter earnings were $2.26 per diluted share compared to $2.05 per adjusted diluted share in the same period last year, an increase of 10.2%. For the full year, earnings were $9.33 per diluted share compared to $8.34 per adjusted diluted share in 2022, an increase of 11.9%. Turning to our cash flows. For the year, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations and over $900 million in free cash flow, both in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we issued $800 million of senior unsecured notes and used $250 million of the proceeds to repay debt that matured in December 2023. We closed the year with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8x, which compares to our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. Our capital expenditures in 2023, which totaled approximately $500 million or 2.2% of revenue, we're focused on driving the strategic initiatives we showcased at our March 2023 Investor Day. For 2023, 60% of our CapEx was growth capital centered on technology and supply chain capabilities, including projects related to distribution center expansion and modernization, fulfilment centers at Motion and using technology to enhance our catalogue and payment platforms. While modestly above our original expectations, the areas where we are investing are delivering good returns well above our cost of capital. We continue to make progress on the M&A front in 2023, a long-standing aspect of our growth strategy. During the year, we completed approximately 90 transactions, investing $309 million, with virtually all of these transactions in the Automotive segment. The blended EBITDA rate of the businesses acquired was over 9% on a pre-synergy basis and is accretive to our overall Automotive segment margin, demonstrating the discipline we have in the space. In 2023, we returned approximately $788 million or 55% of our operating cash flows to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $527 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $261 million in cash used to repurchase 1.8 million shares. Before we turn to our outlook for 2024, as you heard earlier from Paul and Will, this morning, we announced a global restructuring designed to reduce our SG&A costs, improve efficiency and accelerate investments. In 2024, we expect to incur costs of approximately $100 million to $200 million related to our restructuring efforts, and we will report this as a nonrecurring expense. Through these efforts, we anticipate a benefit of $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis. Our current restructuring activities reflect our discipline to continuously refine and improve our business and ensure we are taking the necessary actions to position us to achieve our long-term targets. As we turn to 2024, we are balancing solid industry fundamentals, which remain supportive for long-term growth across our businesses against a backdrop of mixed economic conditions, driven by high interest rates and persistent cost inflation.  Despite this, we remain confident in the execution of our strategic initiatives and the benefits we expect to realize. For the year, we expect total sales growth to be in a range of 3% to 5%. We anticipate a more moderated first half and stronger second half in 2024 for both automotive and industrial. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels contributing less than 1% for both business segments. We are targeting full year gross margin expansion of approximately 20 to 40 basis points, primarily driven by our continued focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 20 and 30 basis points from further investments in technology. Our technology investments are key to enabling our strategic initiatives. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.95 to $9.15 and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.70 to $9.90, which represents an increase of 4% to 6% to last year. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance includes approximately $0.10 of EPS benefit related to our restructuring initiatives, which represents about half of the savings we are targeting for 2024. The successful execution of all our restructuring initiatives in 2024 provides an additional $0.05 to $0.10 EPS benefit, not included in our guidance. By business segment, we are guiding to the following; 2% to 4% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, with comparable sales growth in the 1% to 3% range. As we consider our sales guidance for automotive, our growth rate will be negatively impacted in 2024 and by approximately 100 basis points from new incentive programs associated with changes to certain supplier arrangements we previously announced in the U.S. Automotive business. Historically, these programs have been managed by our suppliers. Under the new arrangements, these will be managed by our U.S. automotive team. The new arrangements will be accounted for as a reduction of revenue, however, have a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold and as a result, have no negative impact to gross profit. For Global Automotive segment margin, we expect 20 to 40 basis points of expansion year-over-year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 3% to 5% and with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. For 2024, we anticipate Global Industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 to 20 basis points year-over-year after finishing 2023 at 12.5%. Our performance in 2023 exceeded our long-term target of 12%, driven in part by our outstanding work to integrate KDG a year ahead of schedule. We will revisit our long-term target for Industrial in the future, but we see further opportunities for margin expansion in 2024 and beyond. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest. With our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that fit with our long-term growth strategies regardless of the economic backdrop. In 2024, we will continue our long history of balanced capital allocation with four priorities; capital expenditures, M&A, our dividend and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter, we added a new capability and further flexibility to pursue strategic investments with our commercial paper program launched in December. Our cash flows will remain strong in 2024 as we expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. As we outlined at Investor Day, investments in our supply chain and IT capabilities are central to our success. For 2024, we expect CapEx to be approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue, consistent with 2023. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast will drive modernization of our supply chain through automation and new DCs and fulfilment locations that are partnered with technology that enhances our customer experience like our investments in catalogue and search platforms through our partnership with Google. As we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust and we continue to remain disciplined pursuing opportunities that create value. Our strong track record of success, combined with our ability to put our balance sheet to work positions us well to further grow our global scale and footprint. In maintaining our focus on shareholder returns, this morning, our Board approved a $4 per share annual dividend for 2024, representing our 68th consecutive increase to our annual dividend. This represents a 5.3% increase from the $3.80 per share paid in 2023. In closing, our teams managed the business through a dynamic environment in 2023, including navigating unexpected pressures in our U.S. automotive business, while achieving mid-single-digit sales growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. As we look ahead to 2024, we will continue to strategically invest in our business for the long term while taking actions to better align our assets in the near term and maintain our strong balance sheet. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Horvers : Thanks, good morning guys. So my first question is regarding the independent versus the company-operated stores. Can you talk at a high level what the comp look like between those two segments? And more importantly, do you have a sense of what POS is versus inventory at those independents. Presumably the deferral can only last so long. And would you expect that catch-up to happen relatively quickly? WillStengel: Morning, Chris. Thanks for the question. I'll take your first part there to start. The independent owners and company-owned stores for NAPA through the quarter were relatively similar with the exception of December, where we saw a tail off as we noted in our prepared remarks, from the independent owner purchases. So I would say largely similar through the quarter with the exception of December. On the inventory levels and purchasing relative to sales out we did see a positive inflection as we went through the quarter towards the end of the year. And so we are encouraged that as we come into 2024, those inventory levels will better reflect the sales out activity. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then I guess as a follow-up and thinking about that, there was bad weather in December, good weather in January. So and you had the destock, restock. So I guess in light of that, can you talk about how you're thinking about the trend of the business? What's January? Should we look at those 2 months together? And how does that inform the cadence of U.S. NAPA over the year? Bert Nappier : Chris, it's Bert. I'll take that 1 a little bit and maybe pull it up first before I talk specifically about January and getting into '24. But in terms of guidance, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're looking for 970 to 990 for the full year, 5% at the midpoint. Just to give you a little bit more color, we think the first half is a bit more moderated on both segments than the second half. Second half, we think will be a bit stronger. And that's really around how we're thinking about the interest rate environment, perhaps what could happen there in the second half and rebounding and improving industrial activity in the second half as well for the Motion business. Beyond that, you know the macro environment is pretty choppy. We've got high interest rates, stubborn inflation. We've got a lot of geopolitical considerations we're looking at, including an election here in the U.S. On the other side, we've got some of our own headwinds with some interest rate expense headwind for the year, and we'll be normalizing, as I said in my prepared remarks on inflation benefits against 23 million and looking at the cadence of the quarters, I don't want to give quarterly guidance. But as I just talked about, moderated first half, stronger second half and a few things specifically for Q1, we'll have some interest rate headwind -- interest expense headwind, excuse me, and a difficult comp promotion, they comped at 12% last year. Still strong industrial production Q1 of 2023. We'll come up against that here in the first quarter of '24. And for the NAPA U.S. auto business, we'll be looking at a comp against some high single-digit inflation from Q1 a year ago. Taking all that together, a long answer here, but taking all that together, we do expect the NAPA business to improve sequentially from Q4 on a reported basis even with that headwind from inflation. And we're encouraged, as Will said, with what's happening in January. We really feel like we're off to a good start, met our expectations for what we were looking for in January. But as you also look at the cadence of the year, I still expect Q1 to be our weakest earnings quarter of 2024, but remain very confident in our full year guidance. Chris Horvers : And just a finer point on that, would you expect both Motion and Industrial and U.S. NAPA to be negative in 1Q on an organic comp basis? Bert Nappier : Well, look, I don't want to get into giving you intra-quarter guidance since I'm not going to give you the quarterly guidance. I'll just kind of stick with where we are, not focus on 1 month since 1 month doesn't make a quarter but we're encouraged by January, particularly in the NAPA business, it improved sequentially from December and better expectations to start the quarter. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thanks very much. Bert Nappier : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please go ahead. Josh Young : Hi. Good morning. This is Josh Young on for Scot. So if we look at the performance of the U.S. auto business, why do you guys think you're losing so much share there? And what do you need to do to gain back share given that it's typically pretty difficult to drive meaningful share shifts in this industry? WillStengel: Yes. Thanks for the question. Listen, I think we've shared both last quarter and this quarter, a lot of specificity about the work that we're doing proud of the progress that we're making. The script laid out a lot of the actions that we've taken specifically around operational intensity, inventory technology investments, field leadership, store operations, a big body of work, and we're highly confident that the team is going to turn it around as we move forward. So there's a lot to like -- we know we've got opportunities to get better, and we've got a lot of confidence in the team. Paul Donahue : Josh, I would just tag on to what Will said. We -- look, we own our results for '23. We've touched on that. It's now behind us. We've got new leadership at NAPA. We've got an improved supply chain -- we've got improved search capabilities, new sales structure in the field, and we're confident that business, as I think I said in my prepared remarks, our best days are in front of us. So we're encouraged, as Bert said, by the early days and early weeks of 2024. And again, looking for better days ahead. Josh Young : Got it. That's helpful. And then just one on margin. So if we think about the targets you outlined last year, obviously, you're running above that on industrial and you're talking about expansion for next year. But given what we've seen in auto for '23, how are you thinking about the target you laid out there? PaulDonahue: Yes. On the Automotive segment margin, we're guiding to 20 to 40 basis points of improvement for the coming year. We're building off of a continued strength in Europe and Australasia. We've got great businesses there with great share and good growth opportunities. And as Will outlined, we're optimistic about where both of those businesses are headed. When we turn back to the U.S., we've got a lot of actions in flight, and we're bullish on the things that are happening Will outlined all of those, but I don't want to be repetitive. But January is off to a good start for NAPA. We're encouraged by the result there. And we think that business improves, as I said, as we move throughout 2024. I would couple that with our restructuring, our restructuring activities that we announced this morning are intended to streamline the business and improve our efficiency, and we expect to get good benefits there as well. Josh Young : Yes. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. On the Industrial segment, where do you think margins can go now that you've experienced such significant growth over the last few years? And is there any reason to believe that you should give some of the growth back in the coming years? BertNappier: Thanks, Michael. Look, we guided to 10 to 20 basis points of margin expansion for industrial in 2024 coming off of 12.5% in 2023 and 200 basis points of improvement this past year. I would just say the last 2 years have just delivered exceptional margin expansion for that business. We had good industrial production over that period. And most importantly, we had an outstanding execution of the integration of KDG. We got that a year earlier than we expected and at a higher level of synergy than we expected. So that helped the result in 2023. I'll be a little bit outsized, which is probably what's a normal run rate for the business. As we look at 2024, we'll operate in a little tighter economic environment. We'll have a little less top line in the first half than we did a year ago in the first half. And we're also going to be lapping those same KDG benefits that I just mentioned a moment ago. So 2024, we see a little bit of a recalibration for industrial back to what would be more historical for GBC in terms of growth, always committing to that 10 to 20 basis points of improvement. But having said all that, we see a long runway here. The industrial business is something we love. That team is just executing at a very high level. Will mentioned their operating discipline. They're focused on gross margin and we expect that to continue, which is why we've guided to more improvement this year, and we'll see that as we move into 2024 and beyond. Paul Donahue : And Michael, I would just tag on to what Bert said, we've been able to accomplish this while in the midst of the longest contraction on the PMI numbers, I think, since about '08. So we fully expect -- well, we're encouraged by the move in the right direction in the PMI numbers, we'll see industrial production, I think, today comes out. But we're expecting that manufacturing to shift back to a positive sometime in 2024. And that's just going to benefit the top line, which will benefit the overall business. Michael Lasser : Got you. My follow-up question is on North American auto business. What if you assume for market growth for 2024 within that segment, just so we can get a sense for how you're assuming your market share will trend in the year ahead? And have you made any assumptions around acquisitions within your growth expectations for this year? Thank you. Bert Nappier : Yes, Michael, it's Bert. So we gave comp sales guidance for Global Automotive segment of 2% to 4%. I don't want to get into too much geographic difference. But we'll say that the market, when you take all of our geographies together, is somewhere between flat to 2% up. We've already talked about inflation, that will be about one point or so. And we're assuming that we'll get one point or so from acquisitions as we look at the automotive segment when we move through 2024. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the breakdown of how we're thinking about sales growth. Michael Lasser : Got it. All right, thank you very much and good luck. Bert Nappier : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning, guys. Morning, Bret. Could you talk a bit more about the strategy of expanding the NAPA company-owned store base? I mean it sounds like you've added reasonably substantially to that. And are there either sort of a profile of the target acquisition by market or size? And sort of how do we think about that from a CapEx and margin impact going forward? Will Stengel : Yes. I'll take the first part, and then I'll pass it to Bert. Look, I think in 2023, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we reflected deeply on where we've got opportunities in the NAPA business here in the U.S. And part of that reflection was the strategic impact of owning more stores relative to independent owners. And that was accelerated as we talked about, based on some of the feedback that we heard from owners as they work through this kind of higher cost inflation and higher interest rate environment. And that led us to be very specific and strategic about market prioritization categorizing specific markets into different categories and then thinking about our operating model through that prism. And so the benefits of that, obviously, is takes some variation out of our network. It simplifies our network when we invest in initiatives the execution of those initiatives become easier throughout the network. And so I think there's a lot of qualitative and quantitative benefits that come from an evolution. The evolution will take time, obviously, but we think it's the right thing for us to do as we move forward. The good news, Bret, is that even when we look within our independent owner network and our company-owned network we've got great operations out there for us to replicate. And so while we will evolve over time, the value creation and operational opportunity in front of us is to get on both sides of the house, the underperforming stores up to best-in-class. And so that's a very actionable body of work. As it relates to capital allocation, I'll ask Bert to make a few comments. Bert Nappier : Look, on the capital allocation side, this will show up as M&A. These are small acquisitions. And so that won't really be a CapEx number, but more of an M&A number. And look, they're very attractive to us. We have got a great balance sheet a lot of financial strength and flexibility to be able to lean in here and we'll have the ability to do that. These are attractive in terms of being accretive almost immediately as we recapture some of the margin we were sharing previously with an independent owner. We get to reduce some of the structural costs and the way we serve our customers. We'll capture some SG&A synergies, particularly on the IT side and with some of the team members and the overhead and back office ranks. And we'll drive some incremental sales, as Will mentioned. We really have an ability to partner our commercial activities where also with an independent owner, they may not be fully NAPA sourced, we'll be able to increase that as well. These are asset deals and always and generally in high-performing markets. So we like the lean here, and we think there's a lot to love. Bret Jordan : Great. And then you commented that December, in particular, you saw independent volumes down or purchasing down. Is there anything -- was that a weather impact? Was that a sort of compounding effect of high rates on their cost of carrying inventory, sort of what do you attribute that air pocket and the independence too? Will Stengel : Bret, I think you nailed it. I think it was a cumulative effect of both of those cumulative effect of rates through the year, getting to year-end, closing the books, if you will, softer weather and then just getting ready for maybe a more robust 2024. So as we said in our comments, we're encouraged by the first 3 or 4 weeks of the year here and hoping for a more normal 2020 for as we move forward. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Will Stengel : Thanks, Brett. Operator : Your next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore. Please go ahead. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I'd like to circle back on the restructuring activity. So Bert, could you help us understand the $100 million to $200 million? Is it cash, noncash? What's the portion there? And in terms of the synergies, what segments do they show up? Where will we see that in the P&L over time? Bert Nappier : I'll start maybe with the second part of that. So in terms of where will they show up in the P&L, this is a global restructuring. So we'll have all the business units participating. In terms of breakdown of where you'll see things -- the biggest part of our SG&A cost is people cost. And so you'll see the vast majority of the benefit. About 2/3 of the benefit we expect to get will come out of the people side. It will be about half of the cost. It starts already. So we've announced last week, a voluntary retirement program here in the U.S. That is the preponderance of the activity, and you'll see that show up in our U.S. business results as we move forward. The offer period for that closes here in the first quarter. So we won't expect any Q1 benefits of that, but you'll see those build as we get through the second half or last 3 quarters of the year. In terms of cash, noncash, I would say it's predominantly cash. We do have DC and facility consolidation. Some of that will be a noncash charge. But I would say at this point, particularly with the voluntary retirement offer in the U.S., it's predominantly cash. And then we both report it all at the nonrecurring expense as we move forward and call that out for you guys. Greg Melich : Got it. I appreciate that. And I guess, back on the business, could you just level set us now I know we're up to the 1,500 stores that are company owned. Could you level set us on what isn't company-owned, Well, how many independents there are, what's company-owned and then also the mix of business that's NAPA AutoCare major accounts and then up and down the street. Will Stengel : Yes. So today, Greg, for the NAPA business here in the U.S., it's about 25%, 30% company-owned and the balance independent owned. We have over 2,000 independent owners roughly. So that gives you some perspective. In total, we've got 6,000 stores in the U.S. So that gives you all the math there. As you look around the world, we have the independent owner model in Europe, obviously, it's about 1/3, 2/3 company-owned to independent on and about that same ratio in our Canadian business. And then we're a 100% company owned in our Asia Pac business. Paul Donahue : Greg, this is Paul. I'll jump in on the second part of your question regarding the business breakdown, major accounts roughly in the high teens, 20% range. NAPA AutoCare, which we're incredibly excited about the progress we're seeing in NAPA AutoCare. We've had a big surge in memberships over the last 90 days. That's about 20% of our overall commercial business. You mentioned small kind of mom and pop up and down the street. We've got a program as well in place where we're focusing in on getting back some of that business. That's about 20% roughly. And then you've got government and fleet, which for us, Greg, that's a significant part of our commercial business and one that -- we have long been incredibly strong and that's about the balance of your 40% of your commercial business. So I hope that helps. Greg Melich : It does. Thanks, and good luck, guys Paul Donahue : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, Anne. Good morning. My question is on sell-in versus sell-through to independents in 2024. So as we sit here today, are you anticipating your guidance, those to be pretty equivalent? Bert Nappier : Seth, I'm not sure I fully follow that. Run that one more time. Seth Basham : Sell-in versus sell-out for your independents. How they finished destocking from your perspective so that we should see more pressure on comps from that effect? Will Stengel : Yes, I think we're expecting 2024 to be a more normal year coming off of 2023, which was clearly challenged and different than our expectations. Seth Basham : Got it. And then my follow-up is, Paul, you talked about the up and down the street customers. Perhaps that's 1 area where you've seen some of the most pressure on your business. Are there competitive dynamics there that you didn't anticipate? And what are your plans for getting back to that business specifically? Paul Donahue : So I think Will mentioned, Seth, in his prepared remarks, he made some comments about our sales force restructuring more of and also taking an opportunity to learn a bit from our industrial team with an inside sales group that is focused on that type customer. There's nothing new on the competitor said, look, Seth, we've got great competitors, and they're tough and they ultimately raise the bar on us and make us better. And that's exactly how we're responding. So we think there's an opportunity to go back and capture some of that business, and we've got programs, incentives and people in place to make that happen. So again, encouraged 6 weeks into the year, early days, but we are encouraged with what we're seeing. Seth Basham : Got it. Thank you. Paul Donahue : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yes, hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. Paul Donahue : Good morning, Daniel Daniel Imbro : Well, I want to start on the industrial side. I did get disconnected during Q&A, so apologies if you said this but obviously, industrial growth continued to outperform, I think, the broader market. I guess, what end markets are showing the most relative strength? And is that just share gains? And then when we look at the monthly cadence, this low single digit, is that the right exit rate as we think about 1Q and organic growth in the industrial side? Will Stengel : Daniel, I'll take the first part of your question. I think previously, we've shared some commentary with you on the end markets that we track here internally. There are about 14 of them. And as I said in my prepared remarks, it's similar to Q3, it's a mixed mosaic as it relates to kind of growth versus contraction. Having said that, just maybe a few additional data points. As we look at the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter across those 14 in the fourth quarter, we had 9 of 14 in growth mode, which is an increase of 2 versus the prior quarter. And if you decomp that growth, we've got low single digits in 3 of them mid-single digits and 2 of them high single digits in 1 of them and double-digit growth in 3 of them. So on balance, we're encouraged by the sequential improvement versus third quarter and even in the 5 of 14 that are declining, we saw 3 of those 5 improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of perspective of, call it, the last 6 months' trends on all things end markets. Paul Donahue : And then, Daniel, you asked about Q1. As you know, we don't give out quarterly guidance. What I would tell you, Q1 will be our toughest comp of the year, Daniel. And I think as Bert mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're looking for really a strong -- much stronger second half. But I will tell you this, our industrial team is focused, you hit it in your question. I do believe we're taking share. We've got the best team in the industry, and I have no doubt they'll deliver for us in Q1 as well. Daniel Imbro : Great. I appreciate that. And then for a follow-up, I wanted to follow up on the restructuring. You talked about in the previous question, maybe where we're going to see it in the reported numbers. But I'm curious if we dig into like what kind of jobs are we actually reducing across the business? And how do you weigh that against the risk of service levels? It feels like some of your auto peers are investing into stores and into distribution. And so curious how you guys think about the competitive dynamics and how you view that risk in '24 as you try to maybe gain back some of the share? Bert Nappier : Daniel, thanks for the question. Look, I would tell you that the big construct here is to protect the field customer-facing selling organization. It's super important to how we go to market how we can stay very competitive. And so as we look at the voluntary program in the U.S., which is, as I said earlier, the substantial majority of all the activity we're taking that voluntary program is very thoughtful. It's targeted to those that are closer to retirement, which is why it's a voluntary retirement offer. And mostly focused on management and back office spans and layers. And so I would just say that we feel really good about the thoughtfulness that was put in by our teams of how to make sure that we strike the balance here between continuing to serve our customers and deliver every single day, but at the same time, do the right thing for the business for the long term and streamline some of our costs. Daniel Imbro : Thanks, Bert. Good luck, you all. Bert Nappier : Thanks, Daniel. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today.

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now let me turn the call over to Paul. Paul Donahue : Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report our first quarter results for Genuine Parts Company and we are encouraged by the start to 2024, particularly when compared to our strong performance in the first quarter of 2023. Our results in the quarter reflect and highlight the value of our business mix paired with our geographic diversity. Our teams delivered results that exceeded our expectations while they stayed laser-focused on our strategic initiatives to enhance our businesses and drive profitable growth. This strong start to the year, along with the continued execution of our initiatives, gives us confidence to raise our outlook for adjusted earnings per share in 2024. Bert will provide additional details in his remarks. A few highlights of the first quarter include : Total GPC sales of $5.8 billion increased slightly versus the same period in the prior year, which produced nearly double-digit growth; total company segment margin increased 30 basis points as continued operating discipline at motion and solid momentum in the actions implemented at our U.S. Auto business improved our profitability; and lastly, we delivered mid-single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth from the same period last year. As we look to the broader macroeconomic environment, the start to 2024 continues to present a mix of challenges and opportunities. Higher interest rates and persistent cost inflation are pressuring businesses and consumers alike. Fortunately, our businesses enjoy supportive industry fundamentals, providing a positive backdrop for growth. Within our Global Automotive business, we continue to see an increase in the number of miles driven, the fleet continues to age, and new and used car pricing remains elevated, particularly with financing costs. On the industrial side of our business, we have recently begun to see positive movement with key industry metrics. This further supports our positive outlook for Motion business for the balance of the year. Our Motion business benefits from a highly diverse portfolio of customers and end markets. Motion serves nearly all aspects of the industrial and manufacturing economy and is not over-indexed to any one end market or customer. In addition, we continue to expand into new areas of opportunities such as semiconductor technology. Longer-term trends around resurrect present a significant opportunity for Motion and the team is well-positioned to capitalize on those as they materialize. As we expected, sales were challenged in the first quarter as the team posted a slight year-over-year sales decline. Despite the more challenging top-line environment, the Motion team delivered exceptional profit conversion. We are pleased with the progress with our supply chain initiatives and enhanced data analytics, which are driving inventory productivity, lower cost and higher customer service levels. We expect Motion's business to accelerate through the year, particularly in the second-half of 2024. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce the promotion of James Howe to President of Motion North America. James has nearly three decades of service to the company and most recently served as EVP and Chief Commercial and Technology Officer. His leadership in overseeing e-commerce, strategic pricing, sales excellence and corporate accounts has been instrumental in driving the company's recent success. James is supported by a deep bench of talent both in the field and amongst its leadership team. Last week we had the chance to visit our Motion team at their Birmingham headquarters and tour their new learning development center. This is a great example of investing for future success as we provide intensive training for both our customers, as well as our technical field teams. So now moving on to Automotive. Our teams in Europe and Australasia continue to perform well and grow market share. In addition, our team in the U.S. demonstrated solid sequential improvement from the fourth quarter in both sales and profit after a challenging 2023. The improvement was driven by the continued progress on the decisive actions we took at U.S. Auto over the past several quarters. We're really proud of our leadership team for their focus and execution and are confident they'll continue to drive sequential improvements as we progress through 2024. Looking ahead, we believe the GPC team is well positioned with the right strategic plans, supportive fundamentals and a strong balance sheet to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities, while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. Our results in the first quarter reflect the progress our teams around the globe are making on our key investment pillars and believe the execution of our strategic initiatives, along with our team\u2019s relentless focus on our customers, will drive value for our shareholders both now and for years to come. So, in closing, we thank each of our over 60,000 GPC teammates around the globe for taking great care of our customers. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will. Will? Will Stengel : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by adding my thanks to the global GPC teams for their ongoing dedication to taking care of our customers. We're pleased with the solid start to the year and our first quarter performance. We truly appreciate your hard work and commitment. As always, we're aligned with global strategic initiatives centered on five key priorities including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, complemented by disciplined and value-creating acquisitions. Our global focus around these priorities drives efficiency and pace as we work to continuously improve the customer experience and deliver profitable growth. Now, turning to our first quarter results. During the first quarter, total sales for global industrial were $2.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 2%, with comparable sales down 2.6% versus the same period last year. These results were in line with our expectations as we were up against our most difficult comparative period of the year with first quarter 2023 sales up 12%. From a cadence perspective, average daily sales were flat to slightly down in all three months with January seeing the most pressure, partially driven by a negative impact from severe winter weather that caused some customer facilities to close. Motion continues to see mixed results across our various served industrial end markets with strength during the quarter in iron and steel, as well as chemicals and automotive. Equipment and machinery and lumber and building products were softer in the quarter relative to the average end market. We continue to receive mixed and cautious feedback from our diversified customer base. However, our overall outlook for the year remains positive. Current renewal rates for corporate accounts, which represents approximately 45% of the business, remain at historically high levels, which further validates the current strength of the Motion value proposition. We're seeing outsized growth in our offering to physically locate Motion teammates at customers' facilities to enable an even closer partnership. Motion's highly technical sales expertise and solution-based selling drives deep relationships with our customers and helps to keep our customers' operations moving every day. Over the past 16-months, manufacturing PMI readings have experienced the longest period of contraction as represented by a PMI index below 50 since the financial crisis in 2009. Despite this, our Motion business has outperformed driven by its customer and end market diversification, business mix and strategic initiatives. Encouragingly, in March 2024, the manufacturing PMI was 50.3, representing an expansionary data point for the first time in 16-months. We obviously appreciate that one month doesn't make a trend, but we remain cautiously optimistic about the rest of the year and the medium-term outlook. Turning to Industrial segment profitability, which represents now 50% of GPC's total profit. In the first quarter, segment profit was $271 million, up 3% and 12.3% of sales, representing a 70 basis point increase from the same period last year. The team continues to execute category management and supply chain productivity initiatives and operate with discipline to deliver operating leverage and margin expansion despite lower sales. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Sales in the first quarter increased approximately 2% with comparable store sales essentially flat. Our International Automotive businesses in Europe and Asia-Pac posted positive sales growth in local currency, while U.S. Automotive was flat and sales in Canada were down low-single-digits. As expected, Global Automotive sales inflation moderated to less than 1% and we expect this to be the case throughout the remainder of the year. Global Automotive segment profit in the first quarter was $273 million, up 3% and 7.6% of sales, representing a 10 basis point increase from the same period last year and a meaningful sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. Our first quarter results for Global Automotive segment reflect strong operating discipline and a positive initial impact that we're seeing from actions taken at our U.S. Automotive business. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in this segment. Now let's turn to our Automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our Automotive team delivered another solid quarter with total sales growth of 8% in local currency and comparable sales growth of 1%. Our team continues to deliver growth with key accounts winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts and the further rollout of NAPA private label products across the region. The ongoing bolt-on acquisition activity continues to have a positive impact and create value. In addition, during the quarter, our new national DC in France opened. This approximately 500,000 square foot distribution center represents a significant technology and automation upgrade within our local supply chain. This project is a great example of how we're investing to optimize our network to drive productivity and increase service levels to our customers. A similar project is well underway in the U.K. and we're leveraging best practices and technologies to deliver the project efficiently. In the Asia-Pac Automotive business, sales in the first quarter increased 2% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 1%. Similar to last quarter, this performance compares to strong double-digit growth in the same period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the first quarter with retail showing relative strength. Despite a challenging macro environment, the team is executing well to simultaneously deliver growth and expand operating margins. In Canada, sales decreased approximately 1% in local currency during the first quarter with comparable sales decreasing approximately 3%. Our Canadian team continues to focus on sales growth in excess of the market, despite pressure from a more cautious consumer and an unseasonably mild winter. During the quarter, our Automotive business saw positive sales growth in line with our expectations, while our heavy vehicle business was slightly below driven by softer-than-expected market demand. In the U.S., Automotive sales were essentially flat during the first quarter with comparable sales increasing approximately 1%. This represents a notable improvement from the fourth quarter in both reported and comparable sales. The first quarter performance was in line with our expectations. As we moved through the quarter, we saw a sequential improvement in average daily sales growth each month. During the quarter, we also saw positive buying behaviors from our independent owners, a trend that we expect to continue over the course of the year. From a customer segment perspective, sales to commercial customers in the quarter were slightly down, while sales to Do It Yourself customers were approximately flat. For commercial, Auto Care continued to outperform while major accounts underperformed, driven by a cautious end consumer. We believe the in-flight actions across the business are delivering a positive impact and we expect the benefits to build throughout the year. Let me provide another quick update on some of the focus areas. First, we experienced further improvement in our inventory fill rates during the first quarter, and as expected, our actions significantly improved our in-stock levels in both our stores and distribution centers. Second, our in-store service levels, as measured by customer service and on-time delivery metrics improved following the improvements we experienced in the fourth quarter. Related, to start the second quarter of 2024, we realigned certain field teams to help focus the field on key activities, deliver excellent customer service and generate sales growth. Our elevated focus on the stores and the field operations is having a measurable positive impact on our teammates. The team is energized and we've seen a notable reduction in employee turnover year-over-year. Finally, our supply chain teams are making significant operational improvements across our network. We've enhanced processes and procedures in our operations that are driving better safety, accuracy, service levels and operational efficiency, while simultaneously reducing errors and overtime. During the quarter, we also made progress on medium-term strategic initiatives. For example, we continue to build upon our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives that are delivering results. During the quarter, our newly expanded DC and Indianapolis went live. This 600,000 square foot facility will more efficiently service hundreds of independent and company-owned stores in the U.S., utilizing new automation and enhanced technology. We also leveraged our partnership with Google to accelerate enhancements to our search and catalog that remove friction and drive a better customer experience. The feedback on these technology improvements from our customers and teams has been exceptional and we look forward to building on the momentum in the months and quarters ahead. And finally, as announced on our fourth quarter call, we're advancing our initiative to evolve our operating model at U.S. Automotive as we're being more intentional about owning more stores in selected priority markets. In parallel, we continue to partner with our existing network of independent owners, who play an important role to help us serve our local markets. Our current in-flight initiatives are designed to improve growth and operations at both company-owned and independently-owned locations. During the first quarter, we made strategic acquisitions of 45 NAPA stores from our independent owners, an increase from the 33 NAPA stores acquired in the fourth quarter and the 16 acquired in the first quarter of last year. We're leveraging our disciplined integration playbook as we integrate these stores into our own store base. We expect these trends to continue over the course of the year. Our global teams are executing on our 2024 priorities and are focused on key strategic initiatives across our business. Last quarter, we announced a coordinated global initiative across each of our operations to further simplify and streamline our operations, improve productivity, increase our speed of service and reduce our cost to serve. Our efforts are on track and Bert will go over the restructuring details in a moment. In closing, GPC started 2024 well. We delivered first quarter results that exceeded our expectations, we're cautiously optimistic about a North America industrial recovery, we're seeing encouraging traction at U.S. Automotive, we're making progress on our long-term strategic initiatives and we're confident in the revised outlook that we laid out for 2024. These results are only achieved with the hard work and dedication of each of our global teammates who take care of our customers, live our GPC values and focus to deliver performance. We remain committed to our plans for long-term growth and we're confident our teams are focused on the right strategic initiatives that will deliver solutions for our customers and create value. Thank you again to the entire GPC team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Bert Nappier : Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our momentum from 2023 carried into the first quarter of 2024 as our teams delivered profit growth against the backdrop of low sales growth. We are pleased with the start to the year, which was ahead of our expectations, particularly as we anticipated this quarter to be the most challenging given the strong results we delivered in the first quarter of 2023. My comments this morning focus primarily on adjusted results which exclude non-recurring costs related to our previously announced global restructuring program. During the first quarter, we incurred approximately $83 million of costs on a pre-tax basis in line with our expectations, or $62 million after-tax related to our restructuring efforts. As we look at the first quarter, total sales were up slightly versus the prior year, reflecting a 1.9% contribution from acquisitions, offset by a 0.9% decrease in comparable sales and a 0.7% unfavorable impact of foreign currency and other. During the quarter, the contribution from inflation was less than 1% in both our Automotive and Industrial segments in line with our expectations. Our first quarter sales performance was highlighted by the continued growth in Europe and Australasia, offset by slight declines in Industrial and Canada. Sales in our U.S. Automotive business were flat in the first quarter and our performance reflects a more than 500 basis point improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2023. During the first quarter, our gross margin expanded by 100 basis points to 35.9%, primarily driven by the ongoing execution of our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our investments in technology and category management capabilities are continuing to be beneficial in driving positive results and our gross margin performance. Adjusting for restructuring expenses, total adjusted operating and non-operating expenses were 28.8% of sales in the first quarter, an increase of approximately 90 basis points from total expenses in the prior year. Our higher operating expenses in the first quarter reflect a negative impact of approximately 20 basis points from planned investments in IT as we continue to invest in modernized technology to run our businesses, approximately 25 basis points of negative impact from rent expense as inflationary pressures are contributing to higher costs as we renew leases, and approximately 70 basis points of negative impact from salaries and wages as we lap the final quarter of our previously announced 2023 investments in team members and absorb continued mandatory increases in minimum wages in certain international markets. These headwinds were partially offset by discipline in other discretionary categories and looking ahead, our operating expenses will benefit from the actions taken under our global restructuring program. For the quarter, segment profit margin was 9.4%, a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year. Industrial delivered 70 basis points of margin improvement, while sales declined slightly. Our margin expansion in our Industrial business is a result of ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our operations combined with strong expense discipline. As Will outlined earlier, the actions we've implemented to improve our U.S. Automotive business are driving benefits and we are encouraged with the margin expansion at Global Automotive and expect further improvement throughout the year. Our first quarter adjusted net income, which excludes restructuring expenses of $62 million after tax or $0.44 per diluted share, was $311 million, or $2.22 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $304 million, or $2.14 per diluted share in 2023, an increase of 3.7%. Turning to our cash flows. For the quarter, we generated $318 million in cash from operations and $203 million in free cash flow. We closed the first quarter with $2.5 billion in available liquidity and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times, which compares to our targeted range of two times to 2.5 times. During the first quarter, we invested $116 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures and another $135 million in the form of strategic acquisitions, including bolt-on acquisitions in the U.S. to support our strategy to own more NAPA stores. In addition, we also made a small acquisition for our Motion business in North America, which expands our value-added service capabilities like fluid power and repair solutions. In the first quarter, we returned approximately $170 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $133 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and approximately $37 million in cash used to repurchase 261,000 shares. Our global restructuring efforts kicked off in the first quarter as we implement actions to position us to achieve our long-term targets. We continue to expect costs of approximately $100 million to $200 million, most of which will be incurred in 2024, and we will report these as non-recurring expenses. Our restructuring efforts are expected to deliver a benefit of $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis. We incurred $83 million of costs in the first quarter related to our restructuring program, which can be categorized into two key areas, costs associated with our voluntary retirement program and facility optimization. Approximately 65% of the first quarter restructuring expenses were the costs associated with our voluntary retirement offer. The remaining costs are related to facility closures and start-up costs associated with new facilities that replace those that were shut down. Our first quarter restructuring activities, including the voluntary retirement offer, were completed in line with our expectations and we expect to start realizing benefits in the second quarter. Turning to our guidance. While the macroeconomic backdrop remains dynamic, industry fundamentals remain supportive and we are confident in our team's ability to drive results. With that in mind, we are raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2024 and reaffirming our sales guidance. For the year, we expect total sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%, with a more moderated first-half and stronger second-half for both Automotive and Industrial. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels, contributing less than 1% for both business segments. For gross margin, we now expect full-year gross margin expansion of 30 basis points to 50 basis points, primarily driven by our continued focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. This compares to our previous guidance of 20 basis points to 40 basis points of gross margin expansion. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 20 basis points and 30 basis points, primarily from further investment in technology. We now expect the diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts, will be in the range of $9.05 to 9.20, compared to our previous outlook of $8.95 to $9.15. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.80 to $9.95, an increase of 5% to 6.6% from 2023. This compares to our previous outlook of $9.70 to $9.90. By business segment, we are guiding to the following : 2% to 4% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth in the 1% to 3% range. For Global Automotive segment margin, we continue to expect 20 basis points to 40 basis points of expansion year-over-year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 3% to 5% with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. For 2024, we anticipate global industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 basis points to 20 basis points year-over-year. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest. We are confident in the strength of our cash flows in 2024 and continue to expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. In 2024, we will continue our long history of balanced capital allocation with four priorities : capital expenditures, M&A, our dividend and share repurchases. For CapEx, we continue to expect approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast, will drive modernization of our supply chain, including new DCs partnered with technology that enhances our customer experience. As we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust and we will remain disciplined in evaluating opportunities that create value, including continuing to pursue our strategy around stores at our U.S. Automotive business. With our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that fit with our long-term growth and strategies regardless of the economic backdrop. Overall, we are pleased and encouraged with our first quarter results as our teams continue to remain agile and deliver in this dynamic environment. Our outlook for 2024 reflects the ongoing confidence in our teams and the actions we are taking to better align our business. We look forward to updating you on our progress in July. Thank you. And we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Couple of clarifications, if I may, on the U.S. Auto. Did you guys say commercial comps were down a bit and DIY was flat? And if I heard that right, I thought you said U.S. Auto comps were up slightly. Can you just help reconcile that for us? Will Stengel : Yes, Scot, it's Will. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So the way to think about it, when we give you our reported numbers, both reported total and comp, that's the total U.S. Automotive kind of sales environment. So our sales into our owners and then our company-owned and independent-owned sales out. And so those numbers reflect that concept. When we start digging into the deeper level of detail around customer segment, that is just sales out, both independent and company owned. So that would be the distinction between the two data points. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay, understood. And that does or doesn't include that 130 basis point drag you cited in the deck? Bert Nappier : Yes. So Scot, on the -- that's a question for Bert, and I'll take that one. The reported number includes the 130 basis point adjustment, but the comp number does not. And maybe I'll give you a little color on the rebate itself. And look, we hate that there's anything to mention about the whole thing, but it's a new program and it's really good for the business. As a reminder, historically, these programs were managed by our suppliers, and that was handled all outside of our P&L, and it was directly between supplier and customer. The new arrangement, those are managed by the team, and that's a good thing for the business. The new arrangement, though has to be accounted for us. It's a reduction of revenue with a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold and no impact to gross profit. It's a better structure for us when we think about our customers. And I think it sees tangible results in some of the things that will talk about in improvements in the business, particularly with fill rates with our new suppliers. For the first quarter, as I think we noted in our earnings presentation, our total reported sales growth was negatively impacted by 130 basis points at U.S. Automotive. When we think about comp sales, it's excluded. And our approach to comp sales excludes revenue adjustments. And this new incentive is a revenue adjustment. That's the accounting for it. And therefore, we've reflected it as such and made it consistent with like items from prior years. I think the final point I'd make is the new program wasn't in the prior year, and thus we think this is a more comparable way to present it in our view. And really, if you were going to make any adjustment, it would be to the reported number that's flat. That would actually probably have been positive without the drag of the 130 basis points. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay, thanks. I'll save my follow-up questions for later. Thank you. Will Stengel : Thanks, Scot. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, first a question on Motion. You know, the down 2.6% organic, you're expecting that to accelerate pretty sharply over there -- over the balance of the year. Obviously, ISM ticks up. Can you talk about how much is your -- of the expectation on the acceleration is just the macro indicators getting better versus something senior business just -- versus just looking at the comparisons? And then within that, I know you said back-half much better in Motion. Would you expect 2Q to turn to positive or flat? Will Stengel : Chris, I'll start just kind of commercially. The Motion team is doing excellent work. And so I think as we think about the recovery of the sales growth, it's going to come from market. We feel like we're outperforming the market with discrete initiatives. And so as you alluded to, as that recovery happens through the balance of the year, that would be a driver of improvement. The other thing I would just tell you, in the first quarter, we did call out the commentary around weather that impacted the business. We estimate around 80 basis points of impact to the top line associated with customers that had facilities closed in Q1. We don't want to make too big a deal of that. The other thing I would call out is the Easter holiday. We had the last day -- business day of the quarter on Good Friday, and so we saw some customer order sluggishness associated with the holiday weekend. You put that -- those two together, the Easter Holiday is probably another 80 basis points. So you got about 160 basis points of negative impact to the top line. And then you marry that together with macro acceleration through the year and we feel good about the revised guide that we gave everybody. And Bert, I don't know if you got any additional color. Bert Nappier : Yes, look, I'll just say, Chris, when we think about the guidance for the year, we raised the outlook to $9.80 to $9.95. We really raised and tightened around a solid start to the year, the progress we've seen at U.S. Automotive, little bit better than expectation first quarter results and our restructuring activities being in line with our expectations. So we're making great progress, but we've got more work to do. As you noted, our guide assumes that U.S. Automotive and Motion accelerate through the year sequentially improve. First half is still going to be a bit moderated for all the reasons we'll just outline. And the second-half, we think gets better just on the general expectation of an improvement in industrial production and easing interest rates. I don't want you guys to think we're being overly precise about the correlation of interest rates and industrial activity in the outlook. It's not terribly specific. It's more like many companies, just a general view around our forecast that easing rates will be more supportive, more robust activity on the industrial side. And we're seeing a little sign of that with March data and no cuts right now. So we're bullish on the second half and believe that the environment will get better as we move through the year. Chris Horvers : Understood. And then two quicks ones on the margin side. So first, on the vendor incentive program, how does that roll? So if it just change, do the benefits grow as the volumes grow? So would that be an accelerating tailwind to the gross margin over the year? And on the SG&A side, you talked about the restructuring. It's going to be $100 million to $200 million in costs, and you're basically saying it's only annualizing savings, slightly less than half of that. So why wouldn't it be something, I guess, more in line with the cost to restructure versus half of that rate? Thank you. Bert Nappier : Yes. Look, on the vendor rebate program, we see that as pretty constant. It's not something that's going to accelerate through the course of the year. So I think that one is pretty straightforward. Look, on the restructuring program, when we think about that, it's a nice opportunity for us when you take it net-net, it's got a two-year payback. We had some variability in some of our assumptions as we started the year with the voluntary retirement program here in the U.S. But the good news is we're well underway on the restructuring activities. Just to frame it again, the overall program is going to cost us about 50% of the cost being on the people side, another 30% or so on facility actions. We'll get about 70% of the benefit we've outlined from people and about 15% from facilities, and then the rest is some other categories that probably not worth going into too much detail. In the first quarter, about 65% of the cost we incurred of the $83 million came from people, with the remaining being on facility optimization around the globe. As we look at the first quarter, the voluntary retirement program is complete. Most of the retirees left on March 31, and we wish them all the best in their new chapter in their life, largely came in line with our expectations. And we'll see those benefits start to accrue in Q2 as we move through the rest of the year. In terms of sizing, Chris, we gave ourselves a range. We're not done yet. We have a lot of work left to do through the rest of the year. So we've given you a range of $100 million to $200 million to give us some variability in where that may land. The big piece of that so far has been the voluntary retirement program, which, as I said, is finished. On the benefits side, we're estimating where we're going to be based on the take rate on the VRO and then some of the additional activities that are yet to come as we move through the rest of the year. Some of those are tied to very specific go-live dates with actions around facilities and DCs and those things. And as you know, we have an estimate of those things. They can be pulled forward and they can move back. So until we get a little bit more color, given we're just into the first quarter of the year, the fact that we're off to a good start is encouraging to us, but we'd like to give ourselves a little bit of room to work within the range until we get a little bit deeper in the year. So we'll keep you -- we'll keep you guys updated on that and we'll tighten it up when we can. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thanks very much. Will Stengel : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Melich : Hi, my first question was on inflation. I think I heard that it was still -- it's now trending slightly positive and you think it's sort of flat going forward. Was that true for both Industrial and Auto? Bert Nappier : Yes, Greg, it's Bert. So the inflation impact for the quarter was less than 1% for all GPC. Both segments were pretty much in line with each other. Very, very slightly positive. So when I say less than 1%, it was pretty de minimis. And our outlook for the rest of the year is for it to stay at that less than 1% level. Greg Melich : Got it. And then I wanted to go a little deeper. I think in the prepared comments, it might have been, Will, you mentioned Auto Care outperformed and the major accounts continue to underperform. Could you sort of give us more detail around that and how you see that playing out some of the initiatives and how that could change some of those performances in coming quarters? Will Stengel : Yes, Greg, happy to. So Auto Care, obviously is a super important part of our commercial business and we've been incredibly intentional about making sure we're servicing that customer segment with a lot of excellence. So making sure that we've got the right sales coverage, the right economics to motivate those folks to grow and buy from us. And so we're seeing very nice traction in that part of our business, and we're encouraged by the trajectory of that. Major accounts, as we've talked about before is a pretty diverse book of business for us. It's about 15% to 20% of our commercial business. And inside that, there's four or five different flavors of accounts. We have very specific strategies for each one of those sub segments and focusing and being disciplined around making sure that our value proposition is upheld and intact. So I think as we think about the bigger national accounts, they are feeling some sluggishness from a cautious consumer. And so that's on top of the work that we're doing to make sure that we're covering the market in the major accounts and each of its segments in the right way with a lot of strategic intent. A - Will Stengel Hey, Greg. I would just add, we had the Auto Care Advisory Council in here very recently, the teams, that group is energized. We we've got a growing Auto Care base. The quality of our auto cares has never been better and that's a program now that's 18,000 members strong and growing. And our goal is just continue to capture more-and-more of their spend, which our team is doing a great job of executing. So that's a business that's been a hallmark of NAPA for many, many years. And certainly we're energized with the direction that group is going. Q - Greg Melich And if I could throw in one more. I think last year you bought in over 100 drivers, that was a real dial-up. I guess, is that -- are you continuing at that pace this year? How does that help all these initiatives to buy those folks in? A - Bert Nappier Well, look, Greg, it's Bert. We announced in Q1 or the year-end call that we were pivoting some strategy there around the independent owner model. Look, that model has been successful for many, many years and will continue to be. And both models work in our business and they'll stay in our business. We've refined the approach a little bit and we're going to lean into owning more stores where we can and see that mix shifting some over-time. And that's really around the opportunities we see in target priority markets. And so we're going to continue to accelerate the pace. We did so in the first quarter. We had 45 stores acquired from independent owners in the first quarter. That's against 33 stores in the fourth quarter and then that number in the prior year would have been 16. So we're excited about this opportunity and we think it's great for the business. It's going to allow NAPA to really control more of the transaction, the customer experience, the strategic priorities in key markets. And we think that's a real positive thing for the business. A - Paul Donahue Hey, Greg, and I'd also mention the acquisition of independent stores is not a new development for Genuine Parts Company. We've been doing that every year for as long as I've been here. As Bert mentioned, we see that accelerating in 2024, we saw it in Q1 and expect that to continue throughout the year. But our -- us buying and selling independently-owned stores is not a new phenomenon for GPC. Q - Greg Melich That's great guys, and good luck. A - Paul Donahue Thank you. A - Bert Nappier Thanks, Greg. Operator Your next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead. Q - Henry Carr Good morning. This is Henry Carr on for Michael Lasser. I just wanted to ask, I believe you said you've been seeing more positive buying behaviors from your independent owners. What exactly is driving that? Thanks. A - Will Stengel Yes, Henry, thanks for the question. Look, I think -- I think one of the things that we've been very clear about is all these initiatives that I detailed in my prepared remarks, those are not just relevant for our business, but also our independent owners. And so we've been very thoughtful and close in our partnership, working with them to make sure that they've got the right inventory, they're running their stores and their businesses the right way operationally. And so when we say that we're doing initiatives around NAPA, it's not only company-owned stores, but also the independent owners. And I think -- I think those programs are having an effect. A - Paul Donahue Hey, Henry, I'd just -- I'd add to Will's comment. I think it's also evident of the great job our ops team is doing in improving availability and improving our overall supply chain for U.S. Auto. Q - Henry Carr Thank you very much. Operator The next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Q - Bret Jordan Hey, good morning, guys. A - Paul Donahue Hey, Bret. A - Bert Nappier Hey, Bret. Q - Bret Jordan Could you talk about, I guess regional performance for the U.S. business? And then I guess my second question would be the cadence of the quarter as far as the progression through the months. Will Stengel : Yes. So I'm assuming this is a U.S. Automotive question. The progression -- the progression through the quarter was sequentially improved starting January, February, March. So March was a very strong month for us. As we look at regional, we had a good quarter in the East, Mid Atlantic, West kind of outperformers. And relative to those three parts of the business, Midwest and Southern were a little bit soft. As you know, we've got five divisions. They're all about equally weighted. So nothing of note, but that's how the quarter played out. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Company. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot. [Technical Issues] business. If you could just go a little bit deeper on the regularization of the field teams that you mentioned, how broad is this? And what customer segment are you focused on with this reorg? Paul Donahue : Hey, Seth, can you repeat the question? You cut out on us with your -- the first part of your comment. Seth Basham : Sorry, within U.S. auto and the regularization of the field teams that you mentioned, how broad is this across the country and what customer segment are these field teams focused on? Will Stengel : Yes, Seth, it's a national program. So it's having an effect in all parts of the U.S. Automotive business. The way to think about it is, this is our first pillar around sales effectiveness. And the concept is making sure that you've got your selling resources focused on the right customers. And so in particular, as we talked about the Auto Care segment, making sure that we got the right sales coverage for our Auto Care customers and then making sure that people in the stores are appropriately resourced and focused on making sure that we're getting parts out-of-the stores efficiently. So it's just -- it's a standard play in distribution to make sure that we're optimizing selling and then you complement all that with inside sales resources for folks and make sure you got real nice sales coverage across the entire customer-base. So it's a broad program, very common and excited about what it's going to do for the business? Seth Basham : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a little bit more color around the changes in sales incentives. Are there changes for the independents that could be pulling forward any sales in the last couple of months? Paul Donahue : We haven't made any meaningful changes to sales incentives for our sellers. We're obviously doing category management work each and every day. That's a cousin of strategic marketing. So thinking about promotion activity. And there's nothing new or different there in the first quarter unlike any other previous year. So we wouldn't expect a pull-forward. Seth Basham : Thanks, Paul, and good luck. Paul Donahue : Thanks, Seth. Operator : The next question comes from Aaron Reed with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Aaron Reed : Yes, thanks for taking my call. I just want to touch on real quick. Inflation seems to be slowing. It sounds like you had it down 1%. Can you give a little more insight around what does wage inflation look like? Are you seeing that fall as well too or kind of where are you in that process? Bert Nappier : Yes, Aaron, it's Bert. Look, I mean, I think when we think about the period from a year-ago with wages and some of the competition around labor, the environment certainly has abated and gotten much softer year-over-year. We're seeing in terms of how we think about labor more in-line with historical averages in terms of increases, some of the things we were having to do to invest a little bit more a year-ago have abated and we're not seeing those. So I would say year-over-year much more normalized environment and we've got that reflected in our outlook for the year. Some of that headwind of investment that we made last year, we saw impact the quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And some of those things where we were investing in our team members with a little higher wage increase and healthcare increases that we didn't pass on last year, well, we're seeing that pass by. And so I would just say that when we look at labor moving forward, a less intense and competitive landscape, easier ability to recruit and gain talent in a more normalized environment for wage increases. Aaron Reed : Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up question. Something I've been actually looking at closely as well too is your own brand expansion across Europe. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on that and really how that's progressing? Paul Donahue : Yes, happy to, Aaron. The -- look, the launch of the NAPA brand which occurred about four years ago, we started in the U.K., we anticipated it would be well received in the UK markets. It exceeded our expectations and actually accelerated our strategy to expand the brand across Europe. And I would tell you, Aaron, we have and continue to be very bullish on the reception the NAPA brand has received across Europe. We rolled -- we're in the process of rolling out in Spain now as we -- as we speak. And we expect that this year we'll cross the $500 million mark in outbound sales of the NAPA brand and we've done that in five years. So it's gone amazingly well. Aaron Reed : Great. Thank you very much. Paul Donahue : You're welcome. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Your next question comes from Carolina Jolly with Gabelli. Please go ahead. Carolina Jolly : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I know you talked about the automotive cadence. I was wondering if you could touch anything on maybe industrial and anything you can talk about in terms of cadence there and any end-markets that might have done well in the quarter? Paul Donahue : Yes, Carolina, thanks for the question. Happy to talk about that. The -- from the end-markets perspective, given some of the noise that I described with the weather and the March Good Friday, I'm not sure I would over-index or extrapolate some of the comments that I'll share with you. If you remember last call, we shared a little bit more detail about our 14 end-markets that we track and we saw kind of sequential improvement versus the prior quarter in two of those. We saw a little bit of step back in the sequential improvement. So we actually had three or four go the other way this quarter. Again, I wouldn't read too much into that. The short strokes are it's a mixed story out there. I commented a little bit about some of the areas of strength and weakness in terms of the types of categories. But through the quarter, we saw basically a mixed quarter, largely again driven by some of that weather. The January month was a little bit unusual and then March was a little bit unusual based on the Good Friday. Will Stengel : Hey, Carolina, thank you for the question. I would comment as well on the end-markets that you mentioned. Iron and steel performed very well. We also saw a good strength out of the automotive sector in the quarter. Chemicals was strong, mining was strong. So we saw a good balance across a number of end-markets, which really gives us good optimism, especially when you combine it with the positive PMI number that came across in March, it certainly gives us good optimism about our Motion business in the -- in the remaining quarters of the year. So all good on that front, and thank you again for the question. Carolina Jolly : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Will Stengel : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Before we turn to the results of the quarter, I'd like to share a few thoughts as part of my transition into the CEO role over the last 45 days. First and foremost, it's an honor and a privilege to serve as only the sixth CEO in Genuine Parts Company\u2019s nearly 100-year history. GPC has a special culture which was founded on taking care of our people and offering solutions to our customers efficiently and consistently. This has served our business incredibly well over the years and will remain a core element of our foundation. As part of the transition over the last several months, I've spent time engaging with our teammates, customers, and suppliers around the world. I'll share a few key messages that have come out of those discussions and that are areas of emphasis as we move forward. First, leverage our culture as an advantage. We have a unique and differentiated culture. Our global engagement data shows the vast majority of our employees are incredibly proud to work for GPC. That's a fact of which we are proud and is a testament to our strong, consistent leadership over the years. We must nurture our culture to extend our unique advantage, but we must also continuously evolve with our customers and our markets. Second, build high-performing teams. Our talent strategies have been intentional as we continuously work to be an employer of choice. We have a capable group of leaders around the world that have aligned values and a clear understanding of our shared vision. But we amplify our impact when we relentlessly build high-performing teams throughout the organization, who are energized to work together, solve problems, and deliver results. Third, capture our exciting opportunities. We streamline GPC to focus on two core businesses with market-leading positions and significant exciting opportunities. We believe size and scale creates an advantage, and when we work together as we invest in capabilities and share best practices to solve common challenges, we act faster, we're more efficient, and we create value. Fourth, focus and execute our defined plans. We believe we have the right strategies and initiatives in place. We've worked together over the last three to four years as a global organization to understand our opportunities and prioritize the work that we're doing. We align globally around five key priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain, and emerging technology, complemented by a disciplined acquisition strategy. This focused approach is not changing. We're intentional, we're disciplined, and we're leveraging expertise around the world to reduce complexity, improve the customer experience, deliver profitable growth, and increase productivity. And lastly, play to win and continuously improve. Thanks to the hard work of our teammates, we've made great progress as a company over recent years. But we're focused on continuous sequential improvement to build on our momentum. We can't be satisfied with good, instead striving to be great, always working to be better and faster in all that we do. Overall, it's fair to say I'm more energized than ever about the opportunities we have as a company and the future for Genuine Parts Company. I want to thank each of our over 60,000 global GPC teammates for their ongoing passion for serving our customers. In addition to serving our customers every day, our teams are executing and delivering on a broad set of initiatives while navigating a dynamic and challenging macro environment. Thank you to all, as always, for your good hard work. Now, let's turn to the specifics of our quarterly results. A few highlights for the second quarter include total GPC sales of $6 billion, which increased approximately 1% versus the same period in the prior year and included a tough start to the quarter with particularly weak sales month in April across both segments. Total company gross margin increased 50 basis points with continued execution of strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. And in May, we announced the acquisition of Motor Parts and Equipment Corporation, our largest NAPA independent owner in the US with a network of 181 locations across Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. It's a great example of our ongoing initiative to own more NAPA stores in priority markets. Our second quarter results were below our expectations. The variance can be attributed to three key themes. Weaker than anticipated customer demand in industrial, accelerated softness in Europe, and choppy demand in the automotive aftermarket in the US. Many factors outside of our control, including higher interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, and persistent inflation are driving overall weaker customer demand. This weaker demand environment and ongoing cost inflation resulted in adjusted earnings flat year-over-year for the quarter, which Burt will cover in more detail shortly. Looking at our results by business segment. During the second quarter, total sales for global industrial were $2.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% versus the same period last year, and comparable sales were down 1.6%. When we look at the sales performance for our industrial business, the main headwind remains lagging industrial production activity. Over the past 20 months, manufacturing PMI readings continue to be in the longest period of contraction since the financial crisis in 2009, as represented by a PMI index below 50. While we saw a positive reading in March, during the second quarter, the monthly PMI readings reverted back into contraction territory versus our cautiously optimistic expectation of an improving backdrop coming out of the first quarter. From a cadence perspective, average daily sales were softer in April and relatively flat in May and June. In addition, the higher interest rate environment and election uncertainty is curbing larger capital spending decisions across our diversified customer base as they remain cautious. Looking at Motion's results across its end market served, we're still seeing mixed performance across the board. Five of our 14 end markets showed positive growth during the second quarter, which was in line with the first quarter, with relative strength coming from mining and chemicals, offset by weakness in equipment and machinery, fabricated metals, and aggregates and cement. Despite the market softness, Motion's corporate account customer base, which represents approximately 45% of the business, continues to perform well and is showing positive growth, which is a true testament to Motion's strong value proposition. Additionally, during the second quarter, the Motion team successfully renewed several key multi-year corporate account agreements and remains active with various well-defined field sales initiatives. Industrial segment profit in the second quarter was $277 million, down approximately 2% versus prior year and 12.4% of sales, representing an approximate 10 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Our business in North America performed well despite the softer sales performance, but was offset by pressure from our business in Australasia, given the challenging local economic environment and cost pressures. Turning to the global automotive segment, sales in the second quarter were $3.7 billion, an increase of 2%, with comparable store sales decreasing 0.6%. During the quarter, all of our automotive geographies showed positive sales growth in local currency. Similar to the first quarter, the global automotive sales benefit from inflation remained less than 1% in the second quarter, and we expect the same in the back half of the year. Global automotive segment profit in the second quarter was $314 million, down 4.7% versus prior year and 8.4% of sales, representing a 60 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Our second quarter results for the global automotive segment reflect pressures from a challenging sales environment across our geographies, combined with inflation driving higher costs and outpacing sales growth. Now, let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our team delivered total sales growth of approximately 8% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 1%. We've seen a broadening in the moderation in demand across our geographies in Europe through the quarter. We believe this is driven by an incrementally more cautious consumer, as well as a reduced sales benefit from inflation, which is also now less than 1%. Despite this, our teams are focused on serving our customers, delivering on our strategic initiatives and delivering above-market performance. We're winning share with target key accounts and the NAPA brand expansion continues to be a differentiator. For 2024, we're on track to deliver sales of NAPA branded products in excess of EUR500 million, above our initial internal target. Our ongoing bolt-on acquisition activity also continues to have a positive impact and create value in Europe. In the AsiaPac automotive business, sales in the second quarter increased approximately 3% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 2%. Similar to last quarter, this performance compares to a high single-digit growth in the same period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail increased in the second quarter, with retail showing relative strength. The macro environment remains challenging in the region but the teams are executing well to grow in excess of market and take advantage of their industry leading position. In Canada, sales increased 1% in local currency during the second quarter, with comparable sales decreasing approximately 2%. Our Canadian team showed sequential improvement from the first quarter despite ongoing pressure from a more cautious consumer and difficult macro environment. Sales in automotive and heavy vehicle performed similarly during the quarter with both having slightly positive growth. In the US, automotive sales increased 0.5% during the second quarter, with comparable sales decreasing 1.5%. This represents a slight improvement in our reported results sequentially from the first quarter and was generally in line with our expectations. As we looked at our sales cadence through the quarter, average daily sales growth was pressured in April and then showed solid sequential improvement throughout the remainder of the quarter. Our overall results also benefited from our MPEC acquisition in May. From a customer segment perspective, sales to our commercial and do-it-yourself customers were both slightly down during the quarter with commercial outpacing do-it-yourself. For commercial, fleet and government, auto care, and other wholesale were all essentially in line, while major accounts underperformed the group, driven by continued cautious end consumer, as we\u2019re seeing elevated levels of deferrals from customers on certain repairs. For sales into our independent store owners, we saw another quarter of more normalized buying behavior, which is a trend we believe will continue throughout the balance of the year. We have active initiatives across our US automotive business and we're encouraged by the progress in the improvements that they're delivering. During the second quarter we saw further improvements in inventory fill rates and stocking levels for specific categories where we had opportunity. Additionally, the team continues to elevate the execution in our stores and DCs, which is driving better customer service metrics. We're pleased with these results, but we're intensely focused on continuous sequential improvement. And finally, we're making good progress on our initiative to evolve our operating model at US automotive to own more stores in selected priority markets. Our recent acquisitions of independent stores are being integrated into the NAPA network with a focus on improved performance and synergy capture. In parallel, we continue to partner with our existing network of independent owners who play an important role to help us serve our local markets. Our current in-flight initiatives are designed to improve growth and operational excellence in both company owned and independently owned stores. During the second quarter we acquired 242 NAPA stores from our independent owners as well as competitive stores and key markets. We're leveraging our disciplined integration playbook as we integrate these stores into our own store base. We'll continue to make methodical progress with our strategy of owning more stores in the second half of the year as the pipeline remains active, although we don't expect the recent acquisition pace to be linear through the year. With all these evolving factors in mind, we moderated our 2024 outlook for sales and earnings per share. We believe it's prudent to adjust our expectations for the second half of the year based on the current information available to us, particularly as it pertains to the industrial and European market outlook. And Bert will provide further color in a moment. While our quarterly results reflect a softer economic backdrop than we anticipated, our in-flight initiatives and fundamental prospects for our business remain robust. Within automotive, industry fundamentals like miles driven, the age of the car park, and new and used vehicle prices remain supportive. We benefit from the fact that NAPA's core business serves the commercial customer where many repairs are non-discretionary and break fix in nature. We like this position as we view the commercial customer as the growth engine of the industry given the increasingly complex vehicle fleet. Within industrial, our business is well diversified across 14 and growing different end markets that cover a wide range of the manufacturing economy, and we\u2019re positioned well to take advantage when economic conditions improved. Studying PMI cycles over time, we see a pattern of long periods of attractive growth once the index inflects into an expansion territory. Motion's highly technical sales expertise and solutions-based selling drives deep relationships with our customers and helps to keep their operations functioning effectively every day and in every market cycle. As the market leader, we believe we're well positioned to capitalize on the eventual improvement in the manufacturing economy, near and long term, as we expand our customer base and grow share of wallet in this fragmented market. Lastly, before I turn the call over to Bert, on behalf of the entire company, it's only fitting that I take a moment and extend our gratitude to Paul Donahue, not only for his tenure as CEO, but for his many contributions to Genuine Parts Company over his 20-year career. Under Paul's leadership as CEO, the company strategically evolved and transformed for the better. A few highlight accomplishments under Paul's leadership. He simplified the GPC business mix to enable strategic focus on our automotive and industrial segments. He championed the expansion of GPC around the world, growing our global footprint from six countries in 2016 to 17 countries in 2024, including the transformational acquisition of AAG in Europe. He led us through a pandemic and kept our team safe. He kept our culture thriving and he kept our teams operating to ensure we took care of our customers. He accelerated strategic investments of over $2 billion in growth capital, including the transformational acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group to extend our industrial leadership position, and obviously many other accomplishments. Altogether since 2016, GPC has grown its sales from $15 billion to approximately $24 billion. It goes without saying that Paul's positive impact on GPC has been remarkable. His ability to lead our teammates around the world has been inspiring and he's a tremendous steward of our GPC culture, importantly a good friend to all, and we certainly look forward to his continued counsel and his role as Executive Chairman. Thank you again to the entire GPC team around the world, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Bert Nappier : Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results were below our expectations, as market conditions, including lagging industrial production and weaker demand in our US automotives and European businesses negatively impacted our performance. Despite the muted market backdrop, our teams continue to operate with discipline and are making progress on priority strategic investments necessary for the business. The softer market conditions combined with the impact of inflation and acquired businesses on SG&A resulted in flat adjusted earnings year-over-year. With that context, let me take a few moments to comment on more specific details of the quarter along with our updated view on our outlook for the year. My comments this morning will focus primarily on adjusted results, which exclude the non-recurring cost related to our previously announced global restructuring program and transaction costs related to the acquisition of MPEC. During the second quarter, we incurred a total of $62 million of costs on a pre-tax basis or $46 million after tax related to restructuring efforts and MPEC integration costs. As we look at the second quarter, total sales were up 0.8% versus the prior year, reflecting a 2.2% contribution from acquisitions, partially offset by a 0.9% decrease in comparable sales and a 0.5% unfavorable impact of foreign currency and other. During the quarter, the contribution from inflation was less than 1% in both our automotive and industrial segments, in line with our expectations. For the quarter, our gross margin expanded by 50 basis points from last year, driven in part by the ongoing execution of our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our investments in technology and category management capabilities are continuing to deliver positive results in our gross margin performance. In addition, the acquisitions we are making in our US automotive business contributed approximately 30 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter. Adjusting for restructuring expenses, total adjusted operating and non-operating expenses were 29.2% of sales in the second quarter, an increase of approximately 80 basis points from total expenses in the prior year. As we look at our expenses for the second quarter, we had a mix of factors, including the following. A negative impact of 50 basis points from increased salaries and wages associated with the acquisitions in US automotive and Europe, particularly from our recent MPEC acquisition. Salaries and wages costs continue to be negatively impacted by mandatory increases in minimum wages in our international businesses. Further, inflationary cost pressure and renewals of leased facilities and acquisitions drove a negative impact of approximately 30 basis points in rent expense. We experienced a negative impact of approximately 10 basis points from our ongoing investments in technology to modernize our business. Interest expense continues to be a headwind in 2024, driving a negative impact of approximately 10 basis points in our expenses. These items are partially upset by cost savings resulting from our global restructuring program of approximately 10 basis points. We expect the incremental SG&A from acquired businesses to abate over time as we execute on our integration plans and capture synergies. As a reminder, we are just 60 days post-close of our MPEC transaction with an integration that is expected to last approximately 24 months. For the quarter, segment profit margin was 9.9%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. The decrease in segment profit and segment margin was primarily driven by the softer sales growth environment and associated deleverage on costs. Our second quarter adjusted net income, which excludes non-recurring expenses of $46 million after tax or $0.33 per diluted share, was $342 million or $2.44 per diluted share, in line with the same period of the prior year. Of the $62 million of non-recurring expense in the second quarter, approximately $37 million was related to our global restructuring program, and the remaining $25 million was related to the MPEC transaction. Our MPEC transaction costs primarily include impairments of leases and leasehold improvements for facilities we will not use as we integrate the business and capture synergies moving forward. Turning to our cash flows. For the first six months of 2024, we generated $612 million in cash from operations, up 34% year-over-year, and $353 million in free cash flow, which was up 40% from the prior year. Our strong cash flow in the first half of 2024 reflects a long-standing hallmark of GPC, which is delivering robust cash flows through low growth cycles. We closed the second quarter with $2 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. In 2024, we have invested approximately $260 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures, including $143 million in the second quarter. In addition, we have invested $580 million here today in the form of strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of our largest independent owner, MPEC. With this acquisition, we converted 181 independently owned stores in the Midwest to company owned, bringing our total company owned store count to nearly 30% of our US stores. We expect the acquisition to be accretive both before and after we realize synergies as we capture more commercial opportunities, gross margin, and optimize the SG&A of the acquired business. Our global restructuring initiative to better align our cost structure and assets with the current environment remains on track. Year-to-date, we've incurred approximately $120 million of costs related to our restructuring efforts, in line with our range of $100 million to $200 million. During the second quarter, we realized approximately $10 million of benefit from our restructuring and expect to deliver a benefit of between $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis, in line with our expectations. Our restructuring efforts are a key element of our work to offset the headwinds of current market conditions and cost inflation across the business. Turning to our outlook, we've updated our views on the remainder of 2024 based on our perspective on current market conditions across the business, most notably for our industrial, European, and US automotive businesses. We now expect the diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts, will be in the range of $8.55 to $8.75 compared to our previous outlook of $9.05 to $9.20. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.30 to $9.50, up slightly to 2023 at the midpoint of the range. This compares to our previous outlook range of $9.80 to $9.95. Our wider range is reflective of the current macro environment, which has elevated the degree of uncertainty from earlier in 2024, particularly on the trends on the industrial side of the business. Our earnings presentation includes an illustration of the key business drivers impacting our revised outlook for 2024. Let me take a moment and walk through the details of these components, starting with sales. We now expect total sales growth in the range of 1% to 3%, down from our previous outlook of 3% to 5%. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels, contributing less than 1% for both business segments. By business segment, we are now guiding to the following. 1% to 3% total sales growth for the automotive segment with comparable sales growth in the flat to 2% range. And for the industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of flat to 2% with comparable sales growth in the flat to 2% range. Our reduced sales outlook for the year is driven by our updated expectations around market conditions in the second half, which we now see as softer than our previous views, and are informed by third-party data as well as the trends we experienced in the second quarter. In addition, we've seen a soft start to July with disruptions from Hurricane Beryl, a more pronounced industrial shutdown around the July 4th holiday, and impacts from the CrowdStrike outage that began late last week. Within industrial, the lagging industrial production activity remains a headwind for the business. The industrial economy continues to operate in the longest period of contraction, as defined by PMI levels below 50, since the great financial crisis. Our original outlook for 2024 assumed we would see an uplift in manufacturing activity entering the second half of 2024 in connection with easing interest rates. We now believe the improvement in the industrial backdrop is going to come much later in 2024 with very little benefit to our revenues for the year as the timing of interest rate cuts, if any, remains unclear. In our European and US automotive business, market conditions continue to moderate as consumers are impacted by a wide range of factors, including inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical election uncertainty. For gross margin, we now expect 40 basis points to 60 basis points of full-year gross margin expansion, primarily driven by our continuous focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives, as well as benefits from our acquisitions in US automotive not previously included in our outlook. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 50 basis points and 60 basis points, compared to our previous range of 20 basis points to 30 basis points of deleverage. Our revised SG&A outlook takes into consideration our reduced sales outlook which drives further deleverage as well as the impact of incremental SG&A from acquisitions in the US automotive business. Our views include the expected benefits from our global restructuring activities. For global automotive segment margin, we now expect to be approximately flat with last year. For 2024, we expect global industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 basis points to 20 basis points year-over-year. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest. We are competent in the strength of our cash flows in 2024 and continue to expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. For CapEx, we continue to expect approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast, will drive modernization of our supply chain, including new DCs, partner with technology that enhances our customer experience. As we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust, and we will continue to remain disciplined pursuing opportunities that create value, including continuing to pursue our strategy around the mix of company-owned stores at our US automotive business. In closing, we continue to operate in challenging market conditions and are taking actions, including advancing our global restructuring activities to ensure the long-term profitability of the business. We believe the backdrop of lower sales growth is market driven and not specific to our business, and we are well positioned once the cycle turns more favorable. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our businesses and will continue to invest with a long-term focus. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Go ahead please. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Will Stengel : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Will, your comment about independents expecting more normalized buying behavior in the balance of the year, could you give us, I guess, more color? I think they destocked late in \u201823 and then bought in pretty well in the beginning of \u201824. I guess, how do you see the cadence working out? Will Stengel : Yeah, look, we've seen continuous sequential improvement on that topic. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, all the initiatives that we're working on here in US automotive are affecting both company-owned and independent-owned stores. And so when we think about inventory strategies, service excellence, those initiatives are all relevant for what we're doing with the independent owners. And we've seen nice sequential improvement through the year. We would expect that to continue through the balance of the year. The math of how that works, I won't get into the specifics, but the tone is good, the relationships are good, the partnership\u2019s good. We had a bunch of independent owners into Atlanta just last week, and everyone's got their hand in the huddle and committed to continuing to grow the business and compete in the local markets. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then on Europe, is there anything notable, I guess, regionally? I mean, France has had some political backdrop, I mean, you're talking about sort of softening in that market, but is there anything to attribute it to, sort of from a geographic standpoint, or is it just widespread? Will Stengel : It's more widespread than it was probably 90 to 100 days ago. Just to be clear, we're really pleased with the European performance. I mean the business continues to grow and grow profitably. The M&A pipeline is having its effect with very accretive acquisitions. In particular, our Spanish and Portuguese businesses after their acquisition last year continue to perform really well. They're a standout. NAPA brand is a differentiator as part of that to help us compete in the market. But we've seen some softness earlier in the year in the UK and France, I would say. It's moderated growth through the balance of the business, call it Germany, Benelux, et cetera. But the business is still performing in excess of market and we think we're winning share. So, tougher times, but proud of what the team's executing over there. Bret Jordan : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. Go ahead please. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Will Stengel : Good morning, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi. You guys referenced a few times about your pricing issues is providing a boost to gross margins for your auto business. I'm assuming that is code for raising prices. So with that context, at what point do you start to run into competitive pricing issues, especially in an environment where the WDs become more price competitive and one of your public competitors is actively reducing prices? Will Stengel : Yeah, Scot, thanks for the question. I think our pricing strategies are more holistic than just raising prices. And so as we've talked about before, we talked about it through the prism of category management which is the intersection between not just pricing but also sourcing and in some -- at the SKU level, and some SKUs are going up and many others you're going down as well and the challenge that we put to the category managers across the business has net-net positioned us in a better margin profile as we move forward both on the sourcing and pricing side. So we're being very thoughtful about being competitive in the market on certain categories and we're balancing that with a lot of very scientific and thoughtful technology work that we've done around data analytics to make sure that we've got visibility down at the local field level to compete and win. Bert Nappier : And, Scot, this is Bert. I\u2019ll just amplify that a little bit with -- in the quarter the gross margin improvement was skewed to the majority side from acquisitions. So we're seeing a nice benefit from the new acquisitions in US automotive. And just to parse out how we think about this split between sourcing and pricing, where you would have seen a bigger benefit in 2023 from pricing, we're actually drawing most of our benefit this year on the back of the work that Will just described in category management and sourcing. So again, pricing is a complex topic. It's a lot of moving things up and down to be competitive. So I wouldn't just categorize it as we're moving prices up. It's a lot of moving pieces here, but we're also getting this nice benefit from acquisitions as well. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay, thanks. And then kind of related to that, when you guys go, you've been on a pretty active sequence, trying to acquire some of your independence. When you guys own a store rather than selling product to an independent or wholesale relationship, can you give us some generalized color just regarding the sales and gross -- the profit dollar contributions once you own that business? Bert Nappier : Yes, so that's one of the benefits of this pivoting strategy. So we see the mix shifting to more company-owned, continue to lean in on the independent owner model as we have in the past. So we'll have this hybrid model going forward, but as we look at isolation of adding more company owned stores, the benefits come across a few prisms. First, commercially, we'll stop sharing the margin. So we see a difference there in terms of recapturing some of the margin that we were sharing previously and you're seeing some of that come through in what we've seen in the second quarter here. Secondarily, when you just start at the very top of the house and you think about the commercial transaction itself, we'll have more control over the transaction from the outset. So that means the price in the market will have the ability to adjust and flex the depth and breadth of inventory in the market to be competitive. Some of those things were tension points between the independent owner and us before. And then as you move through the rest of the P&L, we obviously get benefits from SG&A. We're able to simplify and streamline the back office. In many cases, the independent owner had their own back office, which we can leverage our own, we'll be able to capture some of the benefits from technology and continuing to drive technology into the stores and create some incremental leverage on some of the supply chain elements as well. Many of these independent owners had their own small stocking and many kind of offsite locations that we obviously wouldn't need. So as you move through the different elements of the P&L, I think we have a lot of goodness there. We bought a great business here in the second quarter with the MPEC business, and we're already seeing benefits of that coming through our P&L. So we're excited about this pivot. The team is doing an outstanding job in terms of integration and execution and bringing these folks on board. Scot Ciccarelli : Thanks guys. Will Stengel : Thanks, Scot. Bert Nappier : Thanks, Scot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. We wondered just within DIFM if you're seeing any notable strengths or weaknesses by customer segment? And also within automotive, if you could talk to product categories that were the strongest, and if there was any meaningful change when the warmer weather came in in late June, early July? Will Stengel : Yeah, Kate, thanks for your question. On the customer segment side for commercial, we actually have seen relative strength, as we said in our prepared remarks, in the auto care fleet and other wholesale for us. Our headwind continues to be our major account business. And if you look at and decomp major account, there's different pieces inside of that book of business, ranging from regional accounts to the big national guys, OE dealerships, et cetera. And so there are some customer specific challenges in that book of business, but I'll tell you, there's just as many recent wins, certainly on the regional accounts that we were talking about the other day as a team that we're really excited about that should position as well as we come through the second half of this year and into next year. So we're being really thoughtful in that major account book of business to make sure that it's a win-win economic relationship for NAPA and the customer. And so we're going to be pretty disciplined as we think about that going forward. From a category standpoint, we have seen some positive trends based on recent weather in all the categories that you would expect. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the inventory progress that we've made through the first half of the year has been quite fruitful and so those targeted categories we've seen nice momentum as we go through. So the category managers are really doing a very nice job and our sales folks out in the field on the commercial side are also being very thoughtful as well. We're proud of the teams. Kate McShane : Thank you. Will Stengel : Thanks, Kate. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Christian Carlino : Hi, good morning. It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. So the industrial guide assumes that comps or sales growth accelerates to low single-digits in the back half. And understanding you have the extra day phenomenon, just, can you speak to what else drives this acceleration? And is there any appetite to start up larger capital projects or is it at this point really just break fix until after the election? Bert Nappier : Yeah, Christian, it's Bert. I'll take that one. And maybe as we think about guide, it's just important to refresh on how we thought about the year when the year started and then where things have moved. When we started the year, we expected a moderated first half, stronger second half and a lot of our second half view was based on better industrial production and that being stimulated by interest rates. That model wasn't overly precise, so we didn't have a specific rate cut time to industrial growth or timing of industrial growth, and I think it was more philosophical like many companies about easing interest rates would be supportive of industrial production. As Q2 developed, which included some softer market conditions across industrial, we really have updated our outlook on that side of the house based on that updated view. And we think that with some third-party data, the industrial production activity will continue to lag, it'll still be a headwind for the business as we move here into the third quarter and getting into the fourth quarter as well. We really expected at this point based on our original view to enter the second half of the year with some better kind of low single-digit mid-single-digit growth in Motion and in our industrial side of the house and that's obviously not happening. So we've pushed that out a bit. We -- operating this period of PMI that's been down for quite some time and so now as we look we think that comes much later in the year in terms of improvement. Again, a function of interest rate cuts and we all can take our own predictions on those. Q3, I think we would have parked in our old guidance at somewhere at mid-single-digit, exiting the year at high single-digit. I think we'll see the rest of this year play out in the low single-digit range at best, as we indicated at the top end of our sales guidance and look for improvement as we move through the back half of the year and into 2025. Will Stengel : Hey, Christian, I might just add a couple other thoughts. Obviously, the year-over-year compares ease in the second half of this year. And so as we do the two-year stack and kind of year-over-year compares, that's something that we've spent a lot of time thinking about. The other thing I would tell you just commercially, we've had a lot of discussion with the Motion business and all the leaders about stepping up the sales intensity of the business And as I suggested in my prepared remarks, the discussions we're having with our customers are very positive in the sense that they understand our value proposition. They're great strategic partners. They want to do more business with us. And as a result, you're seeing a lot of renewals of corporate accounts as well as some sales initiatives that is incremental to existing business. So, again, we're working on the right stuff in the Motion business. It's a choppy market. But once we get that sales growth and the customers start spending, we're going to be in a great position. Bert Nappier : And, Christian, just on the specific point about capital projects, I mean, the feedback from the customer is, look, there's a lot of uncertainty out there, high interest rates. Capital projects at this point are must-do activities. So we're really seeing some tempering there on that spend. And again, to Will's point, we're having great wins and renewals with customers. And as this interest rate environment, I think, eases, we'll start to see things move. Christian Carlino : Got it. That's really helpful. And just a follow up on Kate's question, I guess what do you think drove the acceleration in US NAPA over the quarter? Was it weather that abated as you got into May? Or is it starting to lap some of the early signs of deferral you saw last year? And just any comments on what you're seeing in terms of maintenance deferrals. Is that getting worse? Will Stengel : Yeah. I mean, look, I think April, as we've talked about, was super tough. I don't think that was new news for anybody. And so it's all relative. We were kind of working off a low base, and we saw sequential improvement. The initiatives are making a difference. The MPEC acquisition helped build some momentum through the quarter, and the weather did help. So that all being said, it's hard to extrapolate the trend out of the second quarter. I think that's some of the challenge with how we're thinking about the guide. July was a little bit choppy based on what we articulated. So pleased with the sequential improvement through the second quarter, but trying to make sense of the world and the macro environment that we find ourselves as we come into the second half. Christian Carlino : Got it. Thanks very much. Best of luck. Will Stengel : Thanks, Christian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Go ahead please. Greg Melich : Thanks. I wanted to follow up on that last point, guys. The start in July is choppy. So it sounds like -- was July as bad as April? Or is it something between the exit rate of June and April? Bert Nappier : Well, Greg, I reserve the right to vote on July since it's not over yet. But look, April was a tough month for sure. Will has already articulated that. And as I said in my prepared comments, I think July has started out with a lot of mixed views. So we've got some disruption from Hurricane Beryl that impacted both of our US businesses on the automotive and Motion side. We've had some additional industrial production shutdown around the 4th of July holiday. I think manufacturers are taking advantage of any slowdown in a holiday to cut a little bit of their own costs and pull back on some costs there. And then obviously, we had a CrowdStrike outage that began late last week, and that's impacted many, many businesses. We were down for a brief part of the day, and Naveen and the teams around the world did an outstanding job of bringing us back up very quickly. So while we've taken care of our own house, part of the impact of that will continue to be how our customers and down the chain feel that impact across their businesses. So, look, I wouldn't compare April and July just yet. As I said, July is not over, but April certainly was a tough month. And I think the thing that is a challenge for us is just all these different pieces of noise create some lack of clarity into the true trend. Back to Christian's question a minute ago, how do you parse some of this out? And I think these are the things that we're looking at, but I feel good about where we are and all the work we're doing. Will Stengel : Yeah, Greg, I would just come over the top on that and emphasize the point that we feel good about the work that we're doing. And the tone of our meetings is positive. Everyone appreciates that it's a tough market, but the specific initiatives at NAPA or Motion or any one of our businesses is the right body of work. And at some point, hopefully soon, as the market recovers, we'll have a couple of nice tailwinds behind us. Greg Melich : Great. And my follow-up is maybe digging a little deeper on the consumer environment and the end market. Have you seen any sort of trade down or deferral of projects? Are you seeing that where just consumers are like, I\u2019m out of money, and I'm just going to wait on things? Can you see that in the data? Will Stengel : We don't see it empirically in the data, but qualitatively, we have seen that. The other challenge that we put to the merchant is making sure that the good, better, best assortment logic kind of plays in every market condition and for every customer. And so we've seen some shifting around good, better, best. That's probably the closest data that we can look at to see the psyche of the consumer. And then you also anecdotally, you do hear that the consumer is if they needed to, maybe they only do one kind of phenomenon, with most of our big kind of major accounts. Those discussions are pretty consistent across the landscape. So we're seeing it, but I think we're well positioned in the market environment with how we're positioning our brands. Greg Melich : Got it. And then, I guess, last on that, it sounds like do you think you gained share in the quarter, in both industrial and auto? Will Stengel : We feel good about what we're doing. Quarter-to-quarter, we're the first one out of the gate. Hard to kind of fixate on all things share. The feedback that we get qualitatively from the supplier community, honestly, as has never been better. And I think that's just a reflection of another data point to support that the work that we're doing is all the right stuff. We've just got to keep our head down and keep sequentially improving. Greg Melich : Great. Thanks and good luck, guys. Will Stengel : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS Securities. Go ahead please. Henry Carr : Good morning. This is Henry Carr on for Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our questions this morning. I wanted to ask, so assuming third quarter demand looks similar to second quarter, are you anticipating those pressure callouts of 50 basis points from increased salaries and wages, [Technical Difficulty] Are these pretty much going to be pretty consistent in third quarter, would you say? Bert Nappier : Hi, Henry, thanks for the question. I'll talk a little bit about how we see the rest of the year. We've talked about some things already with Greg's question around the start to July. So we do have some things that we're managing through here in the month. I won't give quarterly guidance, but as we frame the rest of the year, Will talked about easing top line comps. But when we look at the third quarter specifically, to your point, we will continue to see deleverage in the business for many of those factors and the combination of a lower sales outlook for the rest of the year. Given that, I would tell you that we expect Q3 earnings to be down year-over-year, mostly because we see a lot of this persisting, particularly coming out of the second quarter and particularly with the softness on the industrial side of the house. With that, we would see Q4 being a little stronger on a relative basis. But as you know, there's plenty of things to think about in the fourth quarter with holidays and the weather. So I would just say, look, we've got an elevated degree of uncertainty in how we're forecasting from earlier in the year, particularly on the trends in industrial. But we're giving you all the information we have right now, everything we think, including all the other variables that are out there, with interest rates and elections and all of that are reflected in our guide. Henry Carr : Great. Thank you. And for a follow-up, I just wanted to ask about with the increased M&A of company-owned stores, I think it's increased to roughly 30% of mix. Does -- when we think about M&A as a contribution to sales growth moving forward, is that 1% target given at the Investor Day in 2023 still a good kind of benchmark to gauge with? Bert Nappier : I think so, Henry. I mean I think that's a fair proxy. I mean, obviously, it will flux in any given year, a little higher maybe in a year where we do something like KDG. But I think if you're using that for a modeling point, I think it's a fair enough proxy, particularly when you look back over the history of GPC over many years. So let's just leave it there and you guys keep using that number as a reasonable proxy. Henry Carr : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham from Wedbush. Go ahead please. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. First, congrats on the appointment of CEO Will, and best wishes to Paul. Will Stengel : Thank you, Seth. Seth Basham : My first question is just a follow-up to the last one. In terms of your goal related to acquiring independents, 30% of the mix of stores now I don't know that you have a stated goal necessarily, but do you expect continued strong acquisitions for the next couple of years? Bert Nappier : Yeah. Look, Seth, I would tell you that we don't have a stated goal at this point. We're just in the early innings of this pivot. We've made some nice progress here in the second quarter. That move up to 30% came on the back of the acquisition of our largest independent owner. And we're going to continue to be opportunistic as we look at these. We obviously are trying to focus on target markets. I would tell you those lean a little bit more towards urban areas. The independent owner will continue to be an important part of our ecosystem. We have tremendously strong independent owners. They provide us strength in key markets, particularly in rural markets. They have deep relationships. We have great scale and good capabilities with all of them. And so we'll continue to have that hybrid. As we think about the March forward, I think we'll be more acquisitive as we move through the course of this year. But that will be based on the timing of these individual discussions. It's a willing buyer and a willing seller. And we've had some good luck here, bought a great business with MPEC, but it's not a one-size-fits-all, and we'll continue to let that go and come to us as it does. Will Stengel : Hey, Seth, maybe just a couple of other points. I mean I think we said in the script, it's not linear. So we started with the largest independent owner and transacted there. But obviously, we have a lot of smaller owners and so building nice momentum, but it's not linear. Just to make a finer point, we're 70-30-ish today. Three years ago, that was more like 20-80. So to help calibrate the last two to three years, we've made really nice progress. We continue to do that. That being said, the independent owner will always have a role in the NAPA operating model, and we value those relationships and look forward to working with those as we continue to align to win in the local markets. Seth Basham : Got it. And can you quantify the benefit to gross margin in the quarter from the independents acquisition? And [Technical Difficulty]. Bert Nappier : Yeah. We said that number was right around 30 basis points. So of the 50 basis points improvement in gross margin, all acquisitions contributed about 30 basis points. Seth Basham : And similar impact for the full year expected? Bert Nappier : I didn't parse out the improvement for the rest of the year. We lifted the guidance for gross margin, primarily on the back of some of that goodness. So I'll let you guys kind of parse that out, how you want, but we're not being quite that specific in terms of how we thought about it. We know there'll be more benefit coming out of gross margin because of acquisitions, but also because of the great work we're doing across the business. Seth Basham : Got it. And my follow-up question is on the major [Technical Difficulty] segment in the US. You talked about discipline there, Will. Are you giving up business there where you don't see it economical? Or is the pressure there more related to elevated levels of deferred maintenance? Will Stengel : I wouldn't say we're giving up business, I would say we're having active discussions with customers to make sure that we've got a path to have it be a win-win. And as we think about incremental new business, we're bringing another level of perspective to that and defining what's helpful to the business. All of that obviously there's trade-offs to all things kind of pursuing new sales. And so each customer is a specific discussion and its own situation. We're just, I think, focusing a little bit more intently on making sure that we're doing right by the business and our customers. Seth Basham : Got it. Thank you very much. Will Stengel : Thanks, Seth. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question. And our last question will be from Carolina Jolly from Gabelli. Go ahead please. Carolina Jolly : Hi, thank you for answering my questions. Will, congratulations, and that was a really, really great tribute to Paul. So thanks for that as well. Will Stengel : Thanks, Carolina. Carolina Jolly : First question is just around the modernization of supply chain you mentioning. Does that also require or imply more inventory? Bert Nappier : No, Carolina, I think as we modernize DCs, it's actually probably one in which we optimize inventory, not have to stock and add more. I'll just give you an example of some of the big projects where when we look at an Australian DC consolidation of other satellite facilities around it into one, same thing happening with two different projects in Europe. And so actually, what we're seeing is it gives us a chance to be a little bit smarter and probably not have to be quite as broad in different locations and concentrated into one and maybe even get a little bit deeper in terms of what we're doing. They obviously have been designed and put in locations where they shorten stem times and lead times to get to the distribution network on the ground. That's helpful as well. So I don't think modernization of supply chain is a net negative for the inventory side of the balance sheet. I think it's actually a long-term net positive particularly when you combine it with some of the other things we're doing with service. And then if you look at the Motion side of the house, what they're doing with the fulfillment centers we've talked about in the past as well. Carolina Jolly : And then just a quick question. Do you date on the regional disparity [Technical Difficulty]? Will Stengel : Yeah, we had relative strength, call it, in the middle part of the country. For the quarter, the West Coast, East Coast was a little bit challenged relative to the balance of the country, but nothing material that I would suggest is a trend or a commercial challenge. Carolina Jolly : Thank you. Will Stengel : Thanks, Carolina. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a lovely day.",

Will Stengel : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. As always, I'd like to start by thanking our global teammates for their hard work serving our customers. And I'd also like to acknowledge all those who were negatively impacted by the devastating hurricanes in the U.S. I'm proud of our teams as they rally together to take care of each other and our customers. Our culture shines through with our teammates going above and beyond to navigate the challenge. Taking care of our communities is a pillar of our mission at GPC and we'll continue to support impacted communities through our partners at the American Red Cross. Let me also welcome Jenn Hulett to GPC. Jenn joined GPC in August as our new Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer, responsible for advancing the company's global talent and culture initiatives. This is a critical area of focus as we continuously strive to be an employer of choice. We look forward to Jenn's many contributions. Before I get into the results for the quarter, I'd like to take a few moments to provide an update on the business and share my perspective after nearly six months in the role as CEO. GPC has a great legacy. NAPA will celebrate its 100th anniversary next year. Motion is a market-leading value-added industrial solutions business founded in 1946 and our international automotive businesses in Europe, Asia Pacific and Canada have similar long proud histories. Together, GPC is a differentiated business with compelling opportunities individually and collectively as one GPC team in each of the global markets we serve. As we leverage the size, scale and strength of our company in our fragmented industries, we're intensely focused on evolving the business and leaning into the initiatives around talent and culture, technology, supply chain and sales effectiveness that we shared at our last Investor Day. Transformation and investment across all industries is critical as customers' needs and markets continue to evolve at increasing speeds. I'm confident that we're doing the right hard work for GPC's long-term benefit as we look to not only extend our existing competitive advantages, but also create new ones. Most importantly, our legacy has created financial strength, both in terms of our cash flow and our balance sheet to thoughtfully pursue these actions through business cycles. Our capital allocation discipline is elevated as we work to methodically balance foundational, growth and innovative investments across the most attractive and strategic GPC opportunities. In parallel, we're committed to growing our long-standing dividend. We acknowledge that these strategic investments come with near-term trade-offs, including higher costs that are amplified by sluggish market conditions and an underlying inflationary cost environment, in turn pressuring results as seen in the third quarter. We're balancing the medium and long-term by offsetting current headwinds with a back-to-basics customer and operational excellence mindset, which is gaining traction as evidenced by improved internal operating metrics. We're also managing core operating costs through global restructuring activities, which are on track to deliver the intended impact. And we continuously pursue initiatives to simplify the business and further enhance our productivity. As we close out 2024 and look ahead to 2025, I want to highlight select examples of actions that reinforce our enthusiasm for GPC's future. At Motion, we continue to extend our value proposition with our customers with tools, technology and expertise to drive embedded solutions that create value and efficiency for our customers. Further, our investments in automation to address customers' productivity needs and mobilizing our technical sales expertise to capitalize on reshoring and nearshoring activity present meaningful new opportunities for us. At our U.S. automotive business, we've invested in inventory to drive better availability by broadening our assortment, while simultaneously improving operational productivity. These investments, combined with actions to improve our delivery times from stores have strengthened our daily value proposition. The quality of the NAPA brand is differentiated and our longstanding local relationships, geographic footprint and expertise position us to continue to lead in the do-it-for-me segment. The recently announced refinement to the U.S. automotive operating model will drive greater commercial opportunities in key markets across the U.S., improving revenue growth and profitability over time. Underpinning these activities are critical investments in technology, that include automation of DCs with next generation robotics, enhancements to the customer digital experience, including better search and catalog capabilities and modernization of our store systems. These investments will position us to deliver a better customer experience and capture growth moving forward. We're also leveraging 250 world-class engineers at our global tech center in Krakow, Poland to build software for global initiatives, including innovative products with emerging technology. And finally, by leaning into our One GPC operating philosophy, we're unlocking the synergies that exist between our automotive and industrial businesses globally, with meaningful value creation opportunities ahead as we implement as an example, our reenergized approach to IT collaboration across the globe to simplify and harmonize our operations. In total, our initiatives are designed to create a better customer experience and generate growth in excess of the market, reduce costs and deliver attractive returns. All our efforts are at different levels of maturity, but all have exciting runway. Our operating cadence as a global leadership team is designed to challenge ourselves and each other, each day to be faster, smarter and better. The decisions to pursue long-term investment are difficult in the face of near-term market headwinds. But we believe, that these investments will increase the intrinsic value of GPC over time. Our financial results were obviously below our expectations in the third quarter, driven by various market factors that we expect to be temporary in nature. But we are confident that we're doing the right body of work to make the company better. Now turning to the third quarter. Note that our results include the impacts of two major hurricanes, Beryl and Helene and the start of the fourth quarter has been affected by Hurricane Milton. For the third quarter, total GPC sales were approximately $6 billion, an increase of 2.5% year-over-year due to the benefits of an extra selling day in the U.S. and acquisitions, particularly in U.S. automotive. However, continued softness in market conditions across our global geographies negatively impacted our sales growth in the quarter relative to our expectations, with the most pronounced impacts in Europe and our global industrial business. The weaker demand environment continues to be impacted by interest rates, combined with persistent cost inflation and election and geopolitical uncertainty. These factors are impacting our customers, most notably with tightened budgets and reduced spending for capital projects in our industrial business and reduced spending in general maintenance and discretionary categories across our automotive segment. The weak sales environment along with cost pressure in wages and rent expense plus anticipated headwinds from depreciation and interest expense resulted in adjusted earnings being down year-over-year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the third quarter was $1.88, down from $2.49 last year. Our results for the third quarter missed our expectations. Our outlook in July, included anticipated improvements in market conditions in Europe and global industrial activity, neither of which materialized. Our original expectation for the third quarter included flat industrial sales growth. Actual reported results ended up down low-single-digits. In Europe, we expected low-single-digit organic growth, actual results ended up flat. The combination of these market headwinds contributed to over $140 million in lower sales in the quarter versus our expectations. Given our results to-date and our expectation that these weaker market conditions will likely persist for the balance of the year, we've adjusted our 2024 outlook accordingly. While many of these factors are outside of our control, we remain focused on controlling what we can and we're confident in eventual market tailwinds. Bert will provide a clear explanation of the impact of hurricanes, variation drivers versus prior year and our third quarter expectations, as well as our updated outlook in his prepared comments shortly. Looking at our results by business segment. During the third quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% versus the same period last year and comparable sales were down 2%. During the quarter, we had one extra selling day, compared to the third quarter of last year, which positively impacted total sales growth by approximately 140 basis points. Looking at the cadence for the quarter, average daily sales were down mid-single-digits in July, relatively flat in August and down mid-single-digits in September. Lagging industrial production activity continues to be the main headwind for our industrial business, as we're now in the longest period of contraction for PMI in over 33-years. While this period of contraction has lasted longer than many expected, history does show us that we typically see a long period of attractive growth once the index inflects into expansion territory. During the third quarter, three of our 14 end-markets we track showed positive average daily sales growth year-over-year. We saw relative strength coming from pulp and paper and our distribution and logistics segment, which was offset by weakness in equipment and machinery, lumber and wood and iron and steel. Within industrial, our core MRO business has remained relatively flat year-over-year with continued strength across corporate accounts through the year. However, customer spending related to capital projects, which represents approximately 20% of sales has been down mid-single-digits versus prior year. We continue to hear from customers considering capital projects that they are pausing, not canceling these plans until they have better visibility into the interest rate environment and the outcome of the election in the U.S. As the market leader, Motion is well positioned to capitalize on the eventual improvement in the manufacturing economy, near and long-term to expand our customer base and profitably grow share of wallet in this highly fragmented market. As a testament to Motion's value proposition and customer service, Motion has already received Supplier of the Year awards from six of its largest 25 customers in 2024, surpassing the total it received in the previous four years combined. Industrial segment profit in the third quarter was $259 million, down approximately 8% versus prior year and 11.9% of sales, representing an approximate 100 basis point decrease from the same period last year, driven by sales deleverage combined with wage inflation and higher depreciation expense. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Sales in the third quarter were $3.8 billion, an increase of approximately 5% with comparable store sales up slightly. During the quarter, we had one extra selling day in the U.S., compared to prior year, which positively impacted Global Automotive sales growth by approximately 90 basis points. Similar to the first half of the year, the Global Automotive sales benefit from inflation remained less than 1% in the third quarter and we expect the same in the fourth quarter. Global Automotive segment profit in the third quarter was $262 million, down approximately 19% versus prior year and 6.9% of sales, down from 8.9% of sales in the same period last year. Our third quarter results for Global Automotive segment reflect ongoing pressures from a soft sales environment and cost pressures, particularly in Europe and the U.S. Now let's turn to our Automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our team delivered total sales growth of approximately 6% in local currency with comparable sales flat. During the third quarter, overall market growth remained muted, down low-single-digits, which was consistent with the second quarter. The weak economic backdrop in Europe is being driven by an elevated level of deferred maintenance attributable to real wage declines, unemployment, higher interest rates and uncertain political and geopolitical situations. In addition, the benefit from same SKU inflation was less than 1%, while the prior year benefit was mid-single-digits. As we look at the economic backdrop in three key European markets; Germany, France and the U.K., higher interest rates continue to negatively impact consumer purchasing power across these three geographies. Furthermore, higher unemployment rates and real wage declines in France and Germany have contributed to softer spending at the consumer level. Collectively, these factors are driving weak consumer confidence across the three markets. Despite this challenging environment, our team continues to outpace the market growth and win share, driven in part by our initiatives with key accounts and the rollout of the NAPA brand, which is a competitive differentiator. In the Asia Pac Automotive business, sales in the third quarter increased approximately 7% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 4%. Sales for both commercial and retail increased in the third quarter with continued strength in retail, particularly in Australia. The macro environment is also challenging in the region with Australia experiencing the weakest economic growth in nearly three decades and New Zealand currently is in its second recession in 18-months. However, our teams are executing well, extending our industry-leading position and taking market share. In Canada, sales increased 1% in local currency during the third quarter with comparable sales decreasing 1%. Our Canadian team continues to perform despite ongoing pressure from a more cautious consumer and difficult macro environment. Sales in automotive and heavy vehicle performed similar in -- during the quarter, with both having positive growth. Lastly, in the U.S., Automotive sales increased 4% during the third quarter with comparable sales essentially flat. The extra day versus the same quarter last year positively impacted sales growth by approximately 160 basis points. Our growth was also driven by acquisitions, most notably the acquisition of MPEC that we completed in May. The sales results were broadly in line with our expectations as we believe we're benefiting from the actions that we've detailed over the last few quarters to improve our execution, and we're seeing a positive impact in the marketplace. Our average daily sales cadence through the quarter was positive in all three months with July being the softest month. Sales to our commercial customers increased low-single-digits in the quarter while sales to do-it-yourself customers was down mid-single digits. Within Commercial, fleet and government, auto care and other wholesale were all positive, while major accounts underperformed the Group, but improved sequentially as we remain focused on profitable growth within the major account segment. On a comparable basis, sales from company-owned stores were slightly positive, while comparable sales into our independent stores were down slightly. More broadly for U.S. Automotive, to provide additional perspective on the cautious consumer, on a year-to-date basis, our non-discretionary repair categories, which accounts for approximately 50% of NAPA's business were up low to mid-single-digits. Our general maintenance categories, which represents approximately 35% of our business, were flat year-over-year, driven by continued cautious end-consumer, who is deferring certain service and maintenance-related purchases. Discretionary categories, representing approximately 15% of the business, were down mid-single-digits. We continue to invest in our U.S. Automotive business for growth and build on significant improvements in service over the past year. During the quarter, we further invested in inventory, increasing the SKU coverage in our company-owned stores by approximately 10%, while driving further productivity in our DCs, which resulted in a more than 8% increase in our internal DC service metrics. We're encouraged with the continued progress and have seen a material improvement in our customer service and store delivery metrics. We will obviously, continue to stay focused on this important effort. Going forward, we see the commercial customer as the growth engine of our industry and we benefit from the fact that 80% of NAPA's business serves this segment. Our continuous improvement on inventory availability, service and product quality position us well to win in the markets that we serve. Following our successful acquisition of the MPEC business in the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of our next largest owner, Walker Automotive Supply in August, furthering our plan to own more of our stores in strategic priority markets. We added approximately 70 NAPA stores across North Carolina. Year-to-date, we've made strategic acquisitions of more than 450 NAPA stores from our independent owners, as well as competitive stores in key markets, including approximately 160 in the third quarter. Our store network in the U.S. is now comprised of over 6,000 stores, of which approximately 35% are company-owned, up from approximately 25% at the end of 2022. Over time, we see a path to bring our network closer to a 50-50 mix with our independent owners continuing to play a critical role in our network. While our quarterly financial results were below our expectations, we are confident that we are investing in the right areas to better position GPC and we're experiencing traction across numerous efforts. We believe, the current market softness is temporary and will eventually serve as a tailwind. The long-term fundamentals of our industries are attractive and our businesses are well-established with leadership positions. We're balancing near-term actions and medium and long-term investments. Disciplined and consistent investment in our business, particularly during temporary periods of broad weaker industry dynamics will strengthen our leadership positions and earn profitable market share and create value. In closing, thank you again to our global teams for the leadership and hard work. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Bert Nappier : Thanks, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. Our results for the quarter reflect the impact of several factors; weak market conditions, the cost impact of investments we are making in the business and disruptions from the CrowdStrike outage in July and two major hurricanes. The third quarter was challenging and in evaluating our financial results and to provide additional transparency, we reflected on three key themes, which I will address, along with an update on our cash flows and capital allocation. Those themes are, what drove our profitability down year-over-year, how did the quarter differ from our expectations and what is our outlook for the remainder of 2024. My comments this morning will focus primarily on adjusted results, which exclude the non-recurring costs related to our previously announced global restructuring program and costs related to the acquisition of MPEC and Walker. During the third quarter, we incurred a total of $45 million of pretax costs or $36 million after-tax related to the restructuring efforts and integration activities. Before I review our three key themes in detail, let me share some high level context for our results, starting with sales. Total sales were up 2.5% in the third quarter, which included a benefit from acquisitions of 320 basis points and the benefit of an additional selling day in the U.S. totaling 110 basis points. Sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by disruptions from Hurricanes Helene and Beryl, as well as the CrowdStrike outage, totaling approximately 70 basis points. For the quarter, our gross margin was 36.8%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. The improvement in our gross margin was driven by acquisitions, primarily at U.S. Automotive, which drove approximately 60 basis points of gross margin expansion. Turning to cost, our SG&A as a percentage of sales for the third quarter was 28.8%, up 220 basis points year-over-year. The impact of acquired businesses, investments in IT and cost pressures contributed to the year-over-year deleverage. More specifically, our MPEC and Walker acquisitions negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 50 basis points. The incremental SG&A from acquired businesses will abate over time as we execute on our integration plans and capture synergies. We are now five months and two months post close of our MPEC and Walker transactions respectively, and expect each respective integration to take approximately 24 months from start to finish. Our integration efforts are on track with respect to timing and synergy capture. Both acquisitions contributed positively to our EBITDA margin in the third quarter. Inflation-driven increases in rent expense and salaries and wages, including increased minimum wages in certain international markets, along with service improvement investments in freight expense resulted in approximately 120 basis points of SG&A deleverage versus the prior year. In addition, our planned investments in technology to modernize our business resulted in a 20 basis points headwind in SG&A in the third quarter. Our global restructuring initiative remains on track. Our restructuring efforts are a key element of our work to offset the headwinds of current market conditions and cost inflation across the business. Year-to-date, we've incurred approximately $160 million of costs related to our restructuring efforts, in-line with the top end of our range of $100 million to $200 million of costs. During the third quarter, we realized approximately $16 million in benefits from our restructuring efforts and expect to deliver a benefit of between $30 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis, in-line with our expectations. With that context, let's turn to the first theme. Our third quarter profitability. Our third quarter results were down year-over-year from an adjusted EPS of $2.49 to an adjusted EPS of $1.88, a decline of $0.61. As we look at the details, I will describe the major drivers of our year-over-year decline in terms of impact to EPS, and you can see these illustrated in our earnings presentation. First, as we expected, higher depreciation and interest expense, combined with IT costs I referenced in my SG&A comments drove approximately $0.25 of the year-over-year decline in earnings. Our initiatives come with cost headwinds, which we anticipated and planned for in 2024. These costs are in the form of higher depreciation expense as we depreciate new investments, higher SG&A as our efforts to modernize IT show up in operating expense and higher interest expense from borrowings to fund investments, particularly in this higher interest rate environment. As I mentioned, core cost inflation is negatively impacting salaries and wages along with rent expense and we are making investments to improve service that are contributing to higher freight expense. For the quarter, these higher costs combined with deleverage on lower sales reduced our year-over-year earnings by an estimated $0.38. These negative impacts were partially offset by benefits of our global restructuring actions totaling $0.08. Finally, the quarter was negatively impacted by lost revenues as a result of the impacts of disruptions from the hurricanes and the CrowdStrike outage, which translated into an estimated $0.06 reduction in earnings for the quarter. With respect to Hurricane Helene, we closed September with approximately 200 locations across NAPA and Motion impacted by power outages and storm damage. Many of these locations have come back online, but we continue to operate with closed stores and disrupted customers. With respect to the second theme related to our expectations, we underperformed, where we expected to be in the third quarter. As we shared in our second quarter earnings call, we expected weak market conditions and headwinds from depreciation, IT investments and interest to result in lower third quarter earnings, and we were targeting an adjusted EPS range of $2.20 to $2.25. Our adjusted results for the quarter with EPS of $1.88 came in below our expectations, driven by two key factors, weaker results in Europe and our industrial business and the impact of CrowdStrike and the hurricanes. When we gave guidance in July, our outlook assumes sequential improvement in market conditions in the second-half of 2024, and tailwinds from easing comparisons. More specifically, our original expectations for the third quarter included industrial sales growth coming in flat and low-single-digit organic European growth. Underlying European market conditions did not inflect in the quarter and remain negative on a sequential basis from the second quarter. For industrial, PMI closed June at 48.5%, nearly flat to May and then turned sharply negative in July at 46.8%, rebounding slightly to 47.2% in both August and September. Along with negative industrial production manufacturer readings in September, this backdrop resulted in our sales for industrial in the third quarter being down. As Will shared, the underperformance of our European and industrial businesses versus our expectations translated into $140 million in reduced sales or an estimated $0.30 of earnings. When combined with a $0.06 impact from CrowdStrike and the hurricanes, this led to an approximate $0.36 earnings shortfall versus our expectations. Our third quarter performance, which was largely driven by ongoing weak market conditions, led us to the third theme, our outlook for the remainder of 2024. Based on the trends we are seeing in our business, including our lower-than-expected third quarter performance, we are adjusting our 2024 outlook. With no sequential improvement in market conditions in the third quarter from the second quarter, our revised outlook reflects our view that the demand environment for the balance of the year will remain consistent with the third quarter. We now expect that diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts, will be in the range of $6.60 to $6.80, compared to our previous outlook of $8.55 to $8.75. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $8 to $8.20. This compares to our previous outlook of a range of $9.30 to $9.50. Our earnings presentation includes an illustration of the key business drivers impacting our revised outlook for 2024. Let me take a moment and walk you through the details of these components, starting with sales. We now expect total sales growth in a range of up 1% to 2% versus our previous outlook of up 1% to 3%, which includes the benefit of acquisitions we've made year-to-date. By business segment, we are now guiding to the following. 3% to 4% total sales growth for the automotive segment, which includes the benefit of acquisitions made year-to-date. We anticipate comparable sales growth to be approximately flat. And for the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth to be down 1% to 2% with comparable sales growth also down 1% to 2%. Our reduced sales outlook for the year is driven by updated expectations around market conditions. For the balance of 2024, we do not expect any improvement in market conditions across our geographies. Our expectations are informed by third-party data, as well as the trends we experienced in the third quarter, which have persisted into the start of the fourth quarter. Further, the beginning of the quarter has been compounded by the impacts of hurricane Milton across Florida as well as the continuing effects of Hurricane Helene. While we've made good progress on restoring our operations, uncertainty remains around our customers and their ability to resume operations, which makes the ultimate impact on our business difficult to predict. Our updated guidance includes our estimated impact of these storms on our results for the remainder of the year. Within industrial, the weak industrial production activity remains a headwind for the business. As Will mentioned, we are now in the longest period of contraction for PMI in over 33-years. We now believe that improvement won't come in 2024 as we wait for PMI to inflect into expansionary territory and for the benefit of initial interest rate cuts to have a positive impact on our customers. In our International and U.S. Automotive businesses, market conditions continue to remain soft as consumers are impacted by a wide range of factors, including inflation, interest rates and geopolitical election uncertainty. In the U.S., while our independent owners continue to gain strength, high interest rates remain a headwind for these small and medium business owners. For gross margin, we continue to expect 40 basis points to 60 basis points of full year gross margin expansion, primarily driven by the acquisitions in U.S. Automotive and our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 140 basis points and 150 basis points, which includes SG&A deleverage on our reduced sales outlook, ongoing cost inflation and the impact of incremental SG&A from acquisitions in the U.S. Automotive business. Our views include the expected benefits from our global restructuring activities. For Global Automotive segment margin, we now expect to be down approximately 90 basis points to 100 basis points versus last year, given the softer organic sales growth and corresponding pressure on SG&A. For 2024, we expect Global Industrial segment margin to be down approximately 40 basis points to 50 basis points year-over-year. For the first nine months of 2024, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and $700 million in free cash flow. We are confident in the strength of our cash flows in 2024 and continue to expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. Delivering consistent cash flows in all business cycles, combined with our liquidity, a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation philosophy positions us to grow the business long-term. In 2024, we have invested approximately $386 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures, including $126 million in the third quarter. With respect to capital expenditures, as we shared at our Investor Day in 2023, our historical investment rate in our business hovered at around 1% or less of revenue. Over the past two years to drive the needed transformation of our business, this has moved to 2% of our revenue and we continue to expect an investment rate of 2% of revenue or approximately $500 million in spending in 2024. The growth capital we are deploying, which represents approximately 55% of our total 2024 CapEx will drive modernization of our supply chain, including new DCs and automation, that when partnered with technology enhances our customer experience and positions us for long term growth. Further, disciplined M&A has been a key element of our growth as we take advantage of value creation opportunities in our fragmented markets globally. In 2024, our M&A strategy has evolved with respect to our operating model at NAPA and our new approach to having a more balanced mix of company owned and independently owned stores will improve our revenue growth and profitability over the long-term. We have invested $954 million globally year-to-date in the form of strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of our now largest independent owner, Walker Automotive Supply. As we acquire these businesses, we have a disciplined integration playbook where we extract value through incremental sales opportunities, capture the full gross margin and optimize the SG&A of the acquired business. During the third quarter, we further strengthened our balance sheet by initiating the transition of our U.S. pension plan to a third-party insurance company, which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of 2025. This is a continuation of our pension de-risking strategy that began in 2013, when the plan was frozen and does not impact the benefits of the planned participants. Our pension plan is well funded and we took this step to reduce balance sheet and income statement volatility and protect us from future potential cash flow contributions. We anticipate a one-time non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2025 and do not expect any impact to our 2024 financial results. Further, we do not expect any cash payments associated with the transfer of the plan to the third party insurance company in 2025. In closing, we continue to operate in challenging market conditions and are taking actions including advancing our global restructuring activities to ensure the long-term profitability of the business. We believe, the backdrop of lower growth is market driven, not specific to our business, and we stand well positioned for growth once the cycle turns more favorable. As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the recent reduction in interest rates in the U.S. and are optimistic that lower rates will create a more constructive market backdrop moving forward. Although, we recognize that this will take time to result in improved activity. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our businesses and we'll continue to invest in the business with a long-term focus. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Thanks for all the detail on the call today. One area that we wanted to learn a little bit more was just the detail around the inventory increase you saw during the quarter. And if you could maybe drill down into some of the investments that you're making in freight? Bert Nappier : Sure, Kate. Good morning. Look, on the inventory side, I think that goes back to really some of what Will touched on and positioning us in the marketplace on the NAPA side. We've made some great strides on getting inventory availability, where it needs to be. That's a year-over-year kind of effort. We started that this time last year, as you recall. And I think we've really made some nice moves to increase depth, increase SKU count and do the things that matter in the field. We know that inventory availability is the deciding factor in being successful, NAPA's great legacy, it's got a great brand, it's got a great footprint. And so when we put that inventory power behind it, I think it really positions us well in the marketplace. That's the biggest driver of the change there. We also have some acquired inventory from the acquisitions we've made. So that will show up in the balance sheet as well. In terms of investments at freight, some of those are a bit competitively sensitive. I would just leave it at the fact that we're really leaning into making sure that, we've got on the other side of the equation, that store excellence, making sure, we have the driver availability and consistency of experience that we want to make sure, we're meeting the needs of our customers. Will Stengel : Kate, I might just add, as we look at all the internal operating metrics that we use to run the business, in particular in NAPA, we continue to be very bullish about the progress that we've made. So whether it's service levels from deliveries to stores, from DCs, from stores to customers, those are at all-time highs and getting better every day. As Bert said, the inventory strategy was all about making sure that we had the right vendor alignment with the right availability in the local markets and those have seen material improvement year-over-year. Safety is better in our DCs, inventory breadth and depth, as Bert alluded to, has never been better. So we've added deeper and wider inventory while using our existing supply chain. Voluntary turnover is down 30% plus year-over-year. And importantly, we're seeing about 100 basis point improvement in our customer metrics in terms of their satisfaction. So as we're running the business and putting these investments in, we feel good about the returns that are associated with them. Bert Nappier : Thanks, Kate. Operator : Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is now open. Scot Ciccarelli : Yes. So you did not call out U.S. auto as a primary source of profit disappointment in the quarter? Does that mean U.S. margins held up and the total margin decline was really due to the international business? Or does that mean you just had subdued expectations for U.S. auto? And then secondly, obviously, '24 is going to fall well below initial expectations. Without providing any specific guidance, can you give us a general feel for how you're thinking about '25, meaning the sequential trends continue to weaken, but your comparisons get easier, et cetera? Thank you. Bert Nappier : Hey, Scot, it's Bert. Look, on the margin side for U.S. Automotive, we don't really get into the details by the individual regions. I will say that the pressure we felt at the consolidated level was consistent across all the markets. And so, we were disappointed in total with where we were. It came in underneath our expectations as we've outlined. But I wouldn't isolate the pressure in any one market regionally around the world versus the other. They're all feeling the same kind of pressure. Interest rate pressure in all of our markets on the automotive side, cost inflation are both present in all of those markets. And so, when we think about the factors that drove SG&A, that I outlined in my prepared comments, those would be true for each of the regions individually. In terms of how we're looking ahead, and as you said, we don't want to get too specific. But look, I mean, I think the bottom line on 2025, is that we're going to continue to watch all the same data that you all are. And at this point, as we exit the third quarter and start the fourth quarter and start to look into 2025, those conditions remain pretty stagnant quarter-over-quarter. And so, market conditions are going to be a big factor in how we look at things. The bottom line though, is we're very encouraged by the long-term fundamentals for both segments. And we're in great fixed industries. I think those are beneficial to us in the long-term. Our size and scale is a benefit there as well. We have leadership positions in fragmented markets around the globe, and we're bullish on the execution of our strategic initiatives as Will outlined. But the biggest wildcard moving ahead with that positive backdrop is the pace and timing of recovery of market conditions. And so we'll take the fourth quarter to see what we think the market will give us for next year, plus our own actions and the things that we think we're going to be able to do and we'll update that and share that with you in February. Will Stengel : Scott, I might just add in the same way that we've articulated the higher interest rates have had the intended effect muting and slowing down overall growth, we are encouraged, obviously by the start of an easing scenario around the world. The U.K. has reduced rates once in the last, call it, six months, U.S. once, Eurozone 3 times, Canada 3 times. So obviously, there'll be a lag benefit to that, but we would hope as we move forward, those types of policy decisions provide a tailwind as opposed to a headwind. Scot Ciccarelli : Great. Thanks, guys. Bert Nappier : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Your SG&A dollars were up about $166 million in the quarter versus the same year ago. Can you outline a bit more what drove that increase? And should we expect the pace of increase to continue for the next several quarters given the investments that you're making? Bert Nappier : Hey, Michael, good morning. Look, a big part of the dollar increase in SG&A is going to come from acquired businesses. So I think that's an isolated activity, particularly here as you look in the second half of 2024 with the acquisition of our two largest independent owners on the NAPA side of the house. So I kind of outlined that and detailed that in my prepared remarks. On that particular point, we would expect that SG&A to abate over time as we continue to integrate those businesses and capture synergies. The great news is we're on track on that front. We're seeing our synergy capture come in consistent with our business case. And as I shared, both of those acquisitions contributed positively to our third quarter. As we look ahead on some of those other elements, I think we'll continue to see pressure here in the near-term on the cost side of things with inflationary impacts on wages and rent. I don't expect those to abate in the fourth quarter. And likewise, we're going to continue to invest in IT, that's an important part of our transformation going forward. And there's some positive things there. Unfortunately, as we modernize systems, many of those are cloud-based platforms that transition expense out of capital into operating expense, which is why we're highlighting that for you. But we're also making some great investments in the business, in particular with our Global Technology center in Poland. We benefit from exceptional talent, high productivity and these teams are doing amazing work on some of our initiatives around catalog and search, which is clearly making a difference with our customers. So when we think about investment, that's an example of a thing I think you'll continue to see. But at the same time, we're also trying to be very thoughtful about offsetting some of this with our global restructuring, which remains on track. We saw a benefit in the quarter as we've discussed, and we're continuing to control headcount. The restructuring is helping with that. Most of that has come from voluntary retirements in the U.S. But if we look at our global headcount, we're down somewhere between 3% and 5% in 2024, excluding acquisitions. And we're continuing to do hard work across the network with engineering standards and engineering productivity and RDCs that's reducing over time and allowing us to be more thoughtful about headcount there as well. Michael Lasser : Okay. My follow-up question is, your decision to make incremental investments in the decision -- in the business was inevitably prompted by something. You outlined your view that U.S. Auto business was down. Your business was flattish. So what is motivating the decision to make these investments? And how do you expect the return on these investments to play out in the next few quarters in terms of market share? Thank you. Will Stengel : Yes. Look, Michael, I think it's super important for any business to be investing in itself. And so I think as the management team organized their strategic plan, in particular, dating back to our Investor Day in 2023, we had a lot of compelling opportunities to invest back in the business in a different way, which I think is a function of the market realities, the changing technology landscape, the competitive dynamic. And so all those things put together set the stage for putting capital to work around the world in an accelerated way. Bert Nappier : And Michael, I'll just add that I believe, that if you looked prior to Investor Day in 2023, you would have seen the GPC business in totality spending about 1% of revenue in terms of investment in the business. And so that's across all of our business segments. And that quite frankly, I think is not the level of investment we needed to stay at pace and grow this business and keep it on its front foot going forward. We think the technology work that we're doing and leading with technology is going to be a differentiator. And we think investing in our supply chains, which will make a difference for our customers, and as we know, having that part and having it at the right place and the right time, both on the Automotive and the Industrial side is critical to being successful. And as we make these enhancements across DCs, which we've mentioned, we're doing that in the U.K. and France, here in the U.S., we have a new DC in Melbourne, we're doing this all over the world. And you combine that with the technology, I think that's going to position us for a much stronger growth, particularly as we come out of this weaker economic cycle. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Bert Nappier : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. So my first question is, I just want to be clear. So was there a decision to step up investments above the original plan for this year or is it really just the acquisitions? And as we think about moving forward, do the acquisitions that you made during this quarter -- during the third quarter take sort of the underlying dollar run-rate higher as we look at the fourth quarter, obviously, relative to revenues? Bert Nappier : Yes. Chris, we haven't changed our view on investment level on CapEx for 2024. We're still going to come in right around that 2% level. And as I commented in my prepared remarks, that's going to be around $500 million of investment. So there's no step up on the CapEx side of the house. We really think the 2% number is the right proxy. We did that last year. We'll do that again this year and we'll be thoughtful about how we look ahead to 2025. In terms of run rate on acquisition, I think, I would tell you that we expect that to -- that was never going to be linear. I think it's the best way to say it when you think about the independent owner strategy. As you've seen this year, we've acquired the two largest. And from there, acquiring 180 plus stores in May, as we've announced with Walker 75 stores, the next levels of independent owners drop pretty significantly in terms of store count size. And so I think you'll see, while we continue to march to maybe a more 50-50 target, the pace and timing of that will slow. So I think we get the first two big ones, which were important to do in the Q first and then we'll move at pace, but the pace will decelerate from what you've seen here over the last two quarters. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then as you think about just, what are we expecting, what are like implied same-store sales and organic growth in NAPA and Motion? And as you look out and you think about the industrial side of the business, does the election sort of like -- is that a clearing event or do we have to wait for these capital budgets to come through for your customers in 2025, such that this actually could prolong to perhaps the second quarter when that capital gets deployed? Will Stengel : Chris, I would say the election is a clearing event with a lag. So by the time you turn the calendar year, the election flips and there's at least kind of clarity on the margin relative to where we stand today, especially with the backdrop of lower rates. And I think that helps. Chris Horvers : In the implied comps for the fourth quarter. Bert Nappier : Not for the fourth quarter. I would say, the lag is coming into 2025. I don't think the election clarity in November, creates a business impact immediately in November and December. Will Stengel : And look, Chris, we don't give quarterly guidance. So the quarter comps we haven't provided. But I would just say, I'd go back to my thoughts in the prepared remarks, we really don't expect the fourth quarter thematically to look much different than the third quarter in terms of the underlying performance of the business given the market conditions. Chris Horvers : Got it. And I just want to ask one clarification question. So I think you talked about a $0.30 EPS headwind on $140 million shortfall in sales, is that right? Because that's like a 40% operating margin, I guess, ask the other way. If you expected sales up 2.5% next year, you would expect that -- next year, you expect 40% flow through on that. Bert Nappier : No, I wouldn't take it that way, Chris. I mean, I think we're trying to give you a reasonable proxy of what we felt like the sales loss was. I mean, given the gross margin rate impact of that and the lost sales in the quarter. So I wouldn't overread into that in terms of operating margin. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore. Your line is now open. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I have a couple of questions. I wanted to start maybe, at a high level, given that I think Bert, you described the investments ramping up to 2% now versus 1%. When we think about the growth algo that you outlined at the Analyst Day in '23, should we be thinking about this year as a new base to build that off of or should we still go back to where we were a couple of years ago and have the growth off of that base. Bert Nappier : I think this year is a tough year to use as a proxy, Greg, is my kind of initial response to that. We've had a lot of moving pieces. Market conditions have moved backwards. I think as you look historically, we've said that the growth algorithm is in that 3% to 4% top line range in the long, long term for the business in terms of top line and that we can lever off of that. This year with market conditions, particularly on the industrial side moving negative, it's not a year I would use as a proxy. So I don't think we're ready to move off of what we think are long-term algorithms, but obviously, we reserve the right to kind of update you as we get into 2025 and the 2025 guidance, particularly as we see with what the fourth quarter presents and how we think the beginning of 2025 will start. So let's not deviate from how we think about the health of this business on a long-term basis, as Will has said, I think we're very bullish on what the long-term can be and the investments we're making in the business. Those have stepped up from a 1% historical rate, but that 2% is the same level of investment we shared with you at Investor Day. So we think that does set a little bit of a new proxy there. But again, we'll come back to you with some more thoughtful outlook when we get to February. Greg Melich : Got it. And then my follow-up was you mentioned how dis-inflation has brought inflation down in both industrial and auto to sub 1%. Can you remind us of how that cycles, if you think about the comparisons from a year ago. And should that -- should we expect that to normalize back at maybe the long-term 2% to 3%? Or do you think we're sort of stuck at this flattish position? Bert Nappier : Look, again, I'll always reserve my right to update you when we build our models for 2025 and share those in February. But I think we're coming out of the period that we all expected. We saw this start last year in 2023 in the U.S., and we're seeing it now in Europe. We expected those high benefits of inflation in the top line to cool off, and they have. We're going through what I think is the unwinding of all that now. And again, if I go back to the first question about the long-term, if you think the long-term is a 3% to 4%, embedded in that long-term is a 0.5% to 1% range of price benefit. And we would expect in the long-term, absent something else coming to light that changes our view on the health of the markets fundamentally, that would be the case and we would vert to something more normalized as we move ahead. Greg Melich : Got it. And then last, I would just say how would you look -- how would you describe your market share positioning right now in U.S. auto and Industrial. I mean, I know there's a lot of macro headwinds. Do you think you're gaining share, holding share still slipping a little bit? Will Stengel : No, we feel really good about it. And we use on the NAPA side a third-party independent data that's got everybody's information in it and it's never been stronger, always opportunities. There's 120 categories that you have to look at to study SKU level share and we've made incredible progress there. So -- and then on the industrial side, we're right there or better than the market. There's some data points out there from peers and obviously, the PMI. So down a little bit in this market is at or better than market performance. Greg Melich : That's great. Thanks and good luck, guys. Will Stengel : Thanks, Melich. Operator : Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. Just following up on Greg's last question, thinking about the U.S. market, your comps were flattish ex the extra day sequentially, and slowed materially onto your stack basis. Do you think that market conditions got worse or do you think that the competitive environment got more difficult this quarter relative to last? Will Stengel : I think the markets got worse and the hurricane impacts put noise into the data. So a flattish market feels about right to us, a plus or minus a point. Bert Nappier : And on the second part of that Seth, on the competitive set, I mean, I wouldn't say that the competitive sets changed much. We have great competitors. We compete day-to-day with a competitive landscape that, thankfully remains very rational on pricing. And so we're encouraged by NAPA's position in the market as I said earlier, with its great footprint, legacy availability and quality. Seth Basham : And specific to the major account segment that you talked about getting a little bit better this quarter, what's driving that. Do you think it's the end markets. Do you think it's some of your initiatives? Any color there would be appreciated. Will Stengel : Yes. So we were really pleased with the sequential improvement in major accounts. As I think, we've talked about publicly before, inside our major accounts, we have four or five different books of business and each have their own specific initiatives. And those initiatives are gaining traction, specifically around some of our priorities in our regional quote, unquote major accounts and our independent affiliates. So we're focused intentionally there to make sure that, we're doing business that makes sense for our customers and for us, and we'll continue to be very thoughtful there. Seth Basham : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Will Stengel : Hey, Bret. Bert Nappier : Hey, Bret. Bret Jordan : A lot of it's been covered, but I guess ex the hurricanes, do you see any meaningful regional dispersion in U.S. NAPA? Bert Nappier : We have -- we haven't seen any dispersion ex the hurricanes and then ex the M&A benefit, everybody was around the same level of performance, no material difference. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about either nearshoring or reshoring some of your supply chain. Could you give us a little more color on that? And is there a margin impact one way or the other? Will Stengel : Yes. Look, I think we had a great update with the Motion team a few weeks ago. We detailed this deeply and we've got a lot of great sales leads and traction for that matter around specific projects. I think on one of the calls, somebody asked us what that opportunity set is. And if you just look at the U.S. business by itself for Motion, we're tracking somewhere over 150 different projects between now and 2030, that represent about $2.5 billion of MRO spend for us. So, some small portion of that is a pretty attractive incremental headwind or a tailwind for us and we put some resources to it and seen some nice traction by vertical. That's what we refer to as our new sales verticals. So definitely, in focus. We see it in Canada, and we've got the same chart in Mexico, all with exciting opportunities. Bret Jordan : Okay. Thank you. Will Stengel : Thanks, Bret. Bert Nappier : Thanks, Bret. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",
