Operator :  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Andy Clark. Mr. Clark, you may begin. Andy Clark : Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as our executive management team. Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement and in the press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our Web site bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, April 22, 2014, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Our press release and earnings review are available on our Web site, and we'll be using the earnings review to discuss our results. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald? Gerald L. Hassell:  Thanks, Wendy, Andy and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. As you\u2019ve see from our release we achieved good results this quarter with pretax earnings up 12% year-over-year. We\u2019re reporting earnings of $0.57 per share, with total revenues of $3.6 billion. We also achieved a 3% fee growth in Investment Management and Investment Services, which within a context of what is a persistently slow economic recovery is deep and see growth. Investment Management benefitted from our continued success in attracting new assets. We recorded our 18th consecutive quarter of positive long-term flows, with net long-term in flows of $21 billion. Assets under management was up 14% year-over-year to a record $1.62 trillion. Driven by the continued strong flows into our liability-driven investment strategies. Investment Services fees were also up, benefitting not only from strong growth in clearing, but also a nice growth in asset servicing. Now Investment Services business was also held by the growing contributions from Global Collateral Services. As usage of our optimization and segregation solutions continue to improve. And in Global Markets, the enhancements we\u2019ve made to our electronic foreign exchange platform have helped us attract greater volumes. Now during the quarter the strength and quality of our asset servicing capabilities were recognized in a key market service. Among our peer group, we earned a number one overall score in the R&M Global Custody survey of clients and fund managers. We were also the number one in the expert\u2019s category, which included investment managers who rated 5 or more global custodians. In total, we received 10 number one ranking in our peer group. It\u2019s the latest vote of confidence in our ability to provide the expertise clients need to navigate the challenging times as they struggle to manage regulatory change risk and cost. And we were able to achieve the growth in Investment Management and Investment Services fees in spite of some ongoing sizable challenges. One, the substantial impact of money market fee waivers; and two, the decline in the pretax income of Corporate Trust. As a revenue from structured debt securitizations has run-off faster than a revenue coming from new business. Year-over-year, our rough estimate is that money market fee waivers and a run-off in Corporate Trust fees, accounted for a drive for a total fee revenue growth of approximately 200 basis points. On the expense front, total expenses were down both year-over-year and sequentially. And Todd will cover more on expenses in a moment, but what I do want to emphasis, is that we are taking aggressive action in virtually every expense category from moderate to growth rate here. So, for example, we are controlling a rate of expense growth in technology by in-sourcing application development, reducing storage cost in consolidating platforms. We are reducing our real estate foot print. We are reengineering how we work including rationalizing our client-coverage teams, making it more efficient and allowing us to reduce costs while enhancing the client experience. And importantly, using evidence of all of these moves and our commitment to aggressive expense management this year. I should add that like all large financial institutions, our regulatory control and compliance costs have risen substantially and continued to be high, and I have to say it is a critical that we maintain a great control environment. But now that we are beginning to gain more clarity on the new rules, the rate of related expense growth should begin to slow and that\u2019s encouraging. On the capital front, our capital story is among the very best in the industry. Our key capital ratios continued to strengthen. We achieved an excellent return on tangible common equity at 18%. Now given that significant levels of capital that we generate and our strong capital positions, we have the financial flexibility to invest in our businesses and maintain a high payout ratio, which was more than 80% in the first quarter of 2014. Earlier this month, we announced another dividend increase of 13% which followed a 50% increase last year. So, the bottom-line is we are executing to drive our shareholder value and we are actively aligning our business model and we are focused on managing expenses well and generating strong returns on tangible common equity. With that let me turn it over to Todd. Thomas P. Gibbons :  Thanks Gerald and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the quarterly earnings review and we\u2019ll start on Page 2. As Gerald noted the EPS was $0.57, we should note that the $0.57 includes about $0.03 to $0.04 for the combined benefits of a lower tax rate. And also we had a loan loss provision credits. Looking at the numbers on a year-over-year basis, total revenue was $3.6 billion. Investment Services fees were up, 3% that is driven by strength in asset servicing in our clearing businesses. Investment management and performance fees were also up 3% and that number would be 5%, if you excluded the impact of money market fee waivers. FX revenue was down driven by the volatility we experienced in the quarter. NIR on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 2% and securities gains were down $26 million. Finally, expenses were down 1%. Turning to Page 4, where we recall some business metrics that will help explain our underlying performance. You can see that AUM of $1.62 trillion was up 14% year-over-year. And that\u2019s 2% sequentially, that\u2019s driven by both market as well as net new business. During the quarter we had net long-term inflows of $21 billion and revolver short-term outflows we can seen, it was $7 billion. You will note that, we\u2019ve enhanced our full disclosure providing flows by all of our major asset classes including the Index and LDI strategies. Assets under custody/administration at quarter end were $27.9 trillion. That\u2019s up $1.6 trillion or 6% year-over-year. That\u2019s primarily reflecting the impact of market as well as currency impact. Linked quarter AUC/A was up 1% due to improved market values. We had an estimated $161 billion in new AUC/A wins during the quarter. As you look down the list, most of our key metrics continue to fuel growth on a year-over-year basis. Average loans and deposits in Wealth Management, Investment Services were again up strongly. The market value of securities and loans at period end increased. All of our clearing metrics were up, with DARTS volumes particularly strong yet again. On the flip side, DR programs and average tri-party repo balances were down slightly. In terms of the key external indicator, markets were up, but most importantly for us the FX Volatility Index was down 14% and that really is what\u2019s driving FX revenue. The average Fed Funds effective rate was down 7 basis point or nearly 50% from last year, which had a negative impact on our money market fee waivers and our net interest income. Looking at fees on Page 6, asset servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher market values, net new business and organic growth. The sequential increase primarily reflects organic growth, but it did benefit from higher securities lending revenue and net new business. Clearing fees were up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher mutual fund fees, higher asset-based fees and an increase in DARTS, all of that was partially offset by higher money market fee waivers. Sequentially, higher clearance revenue was primarily offset by fewer trading days during the quarter. Issuer services fees were down 3% both year-over-year and sequentially. Both decreases reflect the impact of the continued net run-off in Corporate Trust. The year-over-year decrease was partially offset by higher DR revenue driven by corporate actions. The good news is we can see the net fee run-off abating in the next 18 months to 24 months, as the pace of the structure debt maturities slows and new business should more than offset that run-off. When you look in investment services, you will see that investment services fees as a percentage of noninterest expense were up versus the year ago quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by an increase in investment services fees with little additional expenses. Investment management and performance fees were up 3% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Excluding money market fee waivers, investment management and performance fees were up 5% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher equity market values and the net impact of new business. The sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonally lower performance fees and there were also fewer days in the first quarter. When you look at our Investment Management business, you\u2019ll see a new disclosure that we think provides a better basis for comparison to other investment managers, that is, it\u2019s an adjusted pre-tax operating margin, which excludes intangible amortization, net of distribution and servicing expense and also adjusts for fee waivers. On this basis, our pre-tax operating margin for the quarter is 35%. In FX and other trading, revenue was down 16% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. If you look at the underlying components, FX revenue of $130 million was down 13% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Comparisons for both prior periods were impacted by lower volatility. The good news here is we\u2019re capturing higher volumes driven by enhancements to our electronic FX platform. Other trading revenue was down $6 million from the year ago quarter and $14 million from the fourth quarter, decreases from both periods reflect lower fixed income trading revenue and the impact of market-to-market losses on certain hedges.  : Turning to page 9, total noninterest expenses were down 1% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, comparisons to both prior periods were impacted by lower pension expense and higher incentive expense due to the acceleration of the vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement eligible employees. The sequential decline also reflects the decrease in business development expense as well as lower professional, legal and other purchased services and risk-related expenses. The year-over-year decrease also results in a provision for administrative errors in the cost of generating certain tax credits both of which were recorded in the year ago quarter. On page 10, you can see at the quarter-end, we had a net unrealized gain on the investment securities portfolio of $676 million, the increase from $309 million at the end of the quarter was primarily driven by the reduction in market interest rates. Looking at our loan book on page 11, you can see that the provision for credit losses was a credit of $18 million. This was driven by the continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. That compares to a credit of $24 million in the year ago quarter and a provision of $6 million in the prior quarter. Turning to our capital story, as I mentioned which is a good one. As you can see on page 12, our key ratios strengthened over the quarter. At March 31, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio under the standardized approach on a fully phased-in basis was 11% that compares to 10.6% at the end of December. The 40 basis point sequential increase primarily reflects capital generation during the period. And that was partially offset by some increase in few of the risk-related asset categories. Our estimated supplementary leverage ratio also improved substantially during the quarter to approximately 4.7%, primarily reflecting two things. One are some changes to the treatment of unfunded commitments and the methodology is actually calculated average assets as well as the strong capital generation that we\u2019ve mentioned earlier. During the quarter, we repurchased 11.6 million shares for $375 million completing our repurchases under the capital plan for 2013.  : Turning to page 9, total noninterest expenses were down 1% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, comparisons to both prior periods were impacted by lower pension expense and higher incentive expense due to the acceleration of the vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement eligible employees. The sequential decline also reflects the decrease in business development expense as well as lower professional, legal and other purchased services and risk-related expenses. The year-over-year decrease also results in a provision for administrative errors in the cost of generating certain tax credits both of which were recorded in the year ago quarter.

During the quarter, we repurchased 11.6 million shares for $375 million completing our repurchases under the capital plan for 2013.  : We anticipate gross share repurchase is up to approximately $430 million, of course that\u2019s subject to market conditions. And we also expect to record a pretax gain of nearly $500 million on our interest in Wing Hang, when the sale closes, which is expected to be in the second or third quarter.  : That sale is beginning to take place in the second or third quarter. So as Gerald indicated you will see evidence of these actions this year. So wrapping up, we are taking actions to control expenses relative to our revenues, and we want you to see in our results. We are going to provide you with more details on this at our Investor Day that we are planning to be hosting in the fall. With that let me hand it back to Gerald. Gerald L. Hassell: Thanks Todd. And I think we can open it up to questions Wendy. Operator :  Thank you. At this time, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Hi, thanks good morning. Gerald L. Hassel: Good morning. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  A Couple of questions, one on expenses, one on capital. On the expense side, Todd you went through the outlook for the improvement in expenses associated with the space that you are getting rid off. Could you give us a sense of Joe whether that is going to be on a run rate basis? Is that exactly what the gain is going to be, but maybe you can help us on the run rate expense ratio side? Thomas P. Gibbons:  It\u2019s actually hard for us to put in exactly a number on that because we haven\u2019t decided we\u2019re actually going to be located. We haven\u2019t signed a lease on the new property or with some of the cost associated with that. We do know there will be improvement, but Betsy it\u2019s a little early to actually specify a number. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Maybe a little bigger picture on the expenses than Gerald mentioned during your prepared remarks that your expectations are that expense gross could slow down here with regulatory expenses falling down. Did you suggest there that regulatory expenses could exactly start to fall following the overall growth rate or just the regulatory expense gross will be slower? Thomas P. Gibbons: : : Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Gerald L. Hassel:  Hey Betsy let me add something there. The rate of growth in the risk and kind what we\u2019ll call the center or in the shared services, has been a two to three times the rate of growth in the businesses. And we are trying to bring that more in line. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So if we are thinking about just operating leverage generally and the kind of operating leverage you are looking to manage towards. Maybe you could give us a sense of what kind of range you are anticipating all the actions that you\u2019re doing is going to end up driving in terms of operating leverage. Thomas P. Gibbons: Yes, Betsy as we try to make it clear operating leverage is going to be driven both by the expense control that we implement as well as the revenue mix. So, when we see fee weighted risk for example increase, we are seeing a loss revenue with no additional expenses and we get replaced by increases either in Investment Management or Investment Services. Traditional fees, they are typically expenses that come with that, so I want to make it clear that revenue mix is absolutely essential to what actually happens to operating leverage. Now that being said, we are controlling nominal expenses. So, we are getting our hands around a number of things both in the center, just slowing the growth rate even flattening it for example, our capital budget is flat, we are getting more out of the tax spend that we currently have. And we can expand on that conversation a bit. But if all things fully constant, yes you will see in other words, if the revenue mix stays into this and the market stays into this, then you will see positive operating leverage even at relatively low growth rates. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay and that's great. Just one quickie separate question, you went through the capital ratios that all look good going up obviously, what was the reason that EBITDA came down? Thomas P. Gibbons: The tangible common equity is total\u2026 Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right, right, it just look like a 20 bps decline Q1 scale. Gerald L. Hassell: It\u2019s not much of a change if there is any change. The balance sheet might have averaged a little bit large of that. I don\u2019t think it must have changed balancing out. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, now it was 20 bps just wondering. Okay and then on SLR up nicely in the quarter, I mean that your SLR assumes that your deposits are fair or not, taking out or they are not in the denominators, they are in? Thomas P. Gibbons: No, they are in the denominator. Gerald L. Hassell: Cash has not removed from the denominator. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right, okay, so you are assuming that and I know it\u2019s not final rule, you have to, we\u2019re assuming that it can be in the final rule. So from here, is it just normal course to get up to the 5%? Is there anything special that you feel like you need to do right now, at one point we were talking about you potentially having to charge for deposits but doesn\u2019t seem like that in the run rate given how you\u2019ve gotten this up to now? Thomas P. Gibbons: Yes, I think that we can actually get over the hurdle pretty quickly. I think the one thing we made clear is, it doesn\u2019t make sense to get there just by holding additional capital. So we can look at the deposit base and the deposits that have less value to our net value under the SLR or even the liquidity coverage ratio, we could certainly put those types of balances off the balance sheet. But we are still looking at some point we\u2019ll be able to be consolidate some of the assets from our asset manager. So there are a number of ways that we can get there and we always have more room to issue preferred stock if we thought it was appropriate to bolster our Tier 1 leverage which should be a lot less expensive than holding common. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay great. Thank you. Gerald L. Hassell: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Schorr with ISI Group. Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Hi thanks. One quick one on the Investment Management side, I heard your comments and disclosure on the 25% versus 35% margin in Investment Management. Are you able to break down which is due to the distribution adjustments versus the money market fee waivers I think it\u2019s fair and interesting just curious on the breakdown? Thomas P. Gibbons: Yes, my recollection, Glenn is about 200 basis points over this related to fee waivers. And you can calculate, we disclose intangible amortization, so you can calculate that and the remainder would be the impact of the distribution fees. Some show there is a gross up and some show is a net to the revenue. Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Got it, okay that's cool, I could do that. And then, I don\u2019t know if you could talk a little bit about the lending growth inside Investment Services. I think it was up 18% year-on-year. Just curious what\u2019s driving that. Gerald L. Hassell: Sure. That\u2019s associated in some ways with our collateral services area where we provide some level of secured financing to the broker/dealer community as far the optimization segregation, but it\u2019s also around collateral services, around that area. So it\u2019s a program where there are good safe loans, highly collateralized to some of our largest clients around the world. Thomas P. Gibbons:  Hey, Glenn, this has come a little bit slower than we had hoped. We\u2019re actually starting to see a pickup and we\u2019re seeing that trend even in the second quarter. Gerald L. Hassell: Yes, and a little bit of it is called term funding. So it\u2019s having the dealers who rely on this short-term wholesale funding. So we\u2019re seeing six, nine months, in some cases one year maturity on these loans. So that helps their clients who have less reliance on wholesale short-term funding and it\u2019s a good earning asset for us. Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Okay. Last one, non-interest bearing deposit growth was up 16% year-on-year. If you look at your foreign deposits, you have like $100 billion. Curious what\u2019s driving the growth and more importantly what\u2019s in the Euro zone, has they contemplate the negative deposit rates? Just curious on how we should expect the balance sheet to react. Thomas P. Gibbons: Yes, good question. So they are fair amount of European as well as U.S. deposits and the actual average deposits is about flat, slightly down. Free deposits are actually up, but interest-bearing deposits are slightly down on a quarter-over-quarter basis. If the Euro zone were to go to negative rates that would actually present the opportunity for us to charge for deposits and we are giving that very serious consideration. In the two non-Euro zone, European countries that did go to negative rates, we did pass-through that through to deposits. Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : And now client pushback? And I guess where I\u2019m going with it is, one route is charging for deposits sometimes with large customers that\u2019s a bit of an issue. Is it possible to rather mismatch and move your assets outside the zone or is that not something anybody wants to take on in terms of a mismatch? Gerald L. Hassell: Well, typically you\u2019ll have the interest rate parity that comes towards the hedging of that type of a transaction as long as assuming you\u2019re not taking any FX risk. There is some opportunity to do some of that with the hedging, but again managing your liquidity and also the liquidity coverage ratio targets that the regulators we\u2019re establishing will have to be taken into consideration when you do that, Glenn. Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Okay. That makes sense. I appreciate that. Thank you. Gerald L. Hassell: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just a question on the Investment Management business. I guess if you look at the growth in assets and the fee rate quarter-over-quarter, it seems like it saw a pretty decent decline and understandably some of that is money market fee waivers, although it didn\u2019t seem like the dollar amount was that different sequentially. So I guess the day count counts for the rest of it, but can you guys just kind of walk us through the expectations for the fee rate and the Investment Management business ex-performance fees in the coming quarters and to tie into that, maybe just to address what kind of fees are you guys getting on the LDI mandates because that obviously seems to be a big driver? Curtis Y. Arledge:  Alex, Curtis Arledge here. So on a year-over-year basis then I\u2019ll talk about sequentially as well. The biggest drag as Todd, mentioned was the fee waiver impact. A very significant decline year-over-year in short rates and that has absolutely dampened revenue growth. So revenue growth of 3 would have been north of 5 actually is Investment Management a little more than 200 basis points, just a fee waiver impact. We also are comparing our third quarter of 2014 to a \u2013 with a very strong first quarter 2013 on the fee side. We actually have fees when we have a less than 20% an investment boutique, their performance fees and carried interest actually, our share up to the performance fees and carried interest actually runs through that fee line and it can be somewhat volatile. We had a very strong first quarter 2013, so if you just look at the normalized rate that probably is another 100 or 200 basis points of fee growth. So we are actually pretty happy that fee growth generally given the mix of assets that we have in the market performance overall, very nice performance on the new business front. The sequential story is really not that different, so fee waivers have a smaller impact as you said the days actually was a pretty meaningful impact, and then again the volatility in our management fee line from performance fees they are on at the boutiques where we have less than 20% stake also attributed to that also. It\u2019s small, but nonetheless it\u2019s still directionally the same hence the year-over-year results. LDI, obviously a business that we are doing extraordinarily well and not just the LDI business that insight in the U.K. that their ability to leverage that into other growth in active fixed income in absolute return products, so it\u2019s a springboard for many other businesses. LDI by itself is a business that does have lower fees, but on giant volume of assets and they are also want to make sure that everybody understands that the what the management fees might be, there also is a meaningful opportunity in a number of those mandates during performance fees. And so when you see our fourth quarter performance fees a meaningful portion of that is actually coming from LDI related mandates where we have given opportunity on our performance fees if we outperformed a client\u2019s benchmark. So it\u2019s a great business for us overall and again it\u2019s helping to drive not just revenues in LDI, but other revenues as well. Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks Gerald, it\u2019s a lot of color. And just a follow-up on expenses, I guess Todd bigger picture seasonally first quarter I guess tends to be a little bit lighter some of the myriad increases, things that have already kick in for you guys in the second half of the year. So maybe just taking a step back, how should we think about the expense growth of the current base because it does seem like that's the lowest or one of the lower kind of core expense numbers have seen from you guys in a while, so kind of $27 billion, $28 billion run rate quarterly is that a sustainable number or what kind of growth we should think about from off of this base? Gerald L. Hassell: In the second half you are right, typically July 1, since where a myriad increase pull through, but we are looking to, I think we are looking to keep most of the expense lines as flat as you can. I think you will see a little bit higher software amortization and it\u2019s going to be a little bit more in the noise than anything. The first quarter you got to remember does also, is also impacted by the acceleration of retirement to eligible employees on their deferred comp. So that should reverse itself in the second quarter. Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Got it. Thanks guys. Gerald L. Hassell: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning guys. Gerald L. Hassell: Good morning. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So my sense is you have been working on a benchmarking analysis so that your asset management segments margins versus your peers. Now I guess adjusting for few ever you said there in the mid 30% range, which I think seems a bit low for from your scale and $1.6 trillion asset management so. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re able at this point to communicate whether you think there is a good structural reason for that or if you see there is maybe a meaningful opportunities improve margins in the business. I think with that the revenue yields in LDI indexing cash are pretty low and those are probably 65% of the total, implied may be overall contribution margins in those businesses and could that be enough to offset revenue yields? Curtis Y. Arledge:  Hey Luke, it\u2019s Curtis. We obviously spend a lot of time on understanding the industry framework and working clients across a large different channels thinking by what means to margins. I do think as Todd walked through earlier the intangible amortization, the distribution netting \u2013 distribution costs and fee waivers get us into that mid 30 range. I also would highlight that as we\u2019ve talked about in previous earnings calls over the past year or so really last nine months or so, most impactful, and we\u2019ve also been investing in our business.  : So it would be nice to not our fee waivers obviously that would help a great deal. And then the nearest structural thing we\u2019ve also talked about is that if you look at our business and you commented on somewhat in your question, we are if predominantly focused on institutional clients in management firm. And it\u2019s why we have been over the past nine months or so, really making pretty meaningful investments in two ways to expand to reach more individuals as investors. We do that in two ways one directly through direct comp contact with individuals through our wealth management business here in the U.S., great business seven partners in the U.S., there is great room also great opportunity for us to expand and we\u2019ve been growing in markets where we\u2019ve had little presence and even in some cases no presence. That is actually on quite well. We\u2019ve talked about expanding our sales force by about 50% about a year-ago and we\u2019re about 60% already through that expansion. Starting to see revenues from having done that and we\u2019re really quite excited about it. It\u2019s just bringing the great offerings and investment offerings we have around our firm plus the power of being private bank and I\u2019ll highlight you that what we know in our earnings release, well we are named top ranked bank, our wealth management team is doing an exceptional job and expanding that reach is going to be fantastic. The other way we are expanding the individual investors, the second method is through intermediaries where we work with advisors and there has been some coverage of this and what\u2019s going on with us. I\u2019ll highlight this is not a startup effort on our part. In fact, Dreyfus was one of the original creators of mutual fund industry and BNY MELLON that has both U.S. presence to drive this but also has the global presence. We\u2019ve about $156 billion in long-term mutual fund assets. Which would make us $200 million just on retail basis, on what is 100 asset managers on a whole just on a retail asset base. So we already have a pretty significant presence here, but it isn\u2019t anywhere close to what we think it should be. So we\u2019ve also been investing there. And I think if when you look at firms you have margins higher than ours. They\u2019re able to take your investment offerings and get them through client channels. They are not just institutional but also reach individuals as well and interrupt while in doing that. We do a lot work like, look I talk about the study that \u2013 we used Mackenzie. We think Mackenzie\u2019s benchmarking study is one of the best in the marketplace and we got actually right out or slightly above peers who look like us. So that\u2019s sort of long-winded answer to your marketing question.  : So it would be nice to not our fee waivers obviously that would help a great deal. And then the nearest structural thing we\u2019ve also talked about is that if you look at our business and you commented on somewhat in your question, we are if predominantly focused on institutional clients in management firm. And it\u2019s why we have been over the past nine months or so, really making pretty meaningful investments in two ways to expand to reach more individuals as investors. We do that in two ways one directly through direct comp contact with individuals through our wealth management business here in the U.S., great business seven partners in the U.S., there is great room also great opportunity for us to expand and we\u2019ve been growing in markets where we\u2019ve had little presence and even in some cases no presence.

We think Mackenzie\u2019s benchmarking study is one of the best in the marketplace and we got actually right out or slightly above peers who look like us. So that\u2019s sort of long-winded answer to your marketing question. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC:  Okay. Just a follow-up on that. I guess, I\u2019m not \u2013 in terms of the investments you\u2019re making in retail business, I\u2019m not clear why do you think that\u2019s a higher margin business or that\u2019s more about having an underutilized retail platform that you\u2019re going to scale up. And then, I guess along with that, how do you rate the strength of the Dreyfus brand, especially in the warehouse distribution channel and are you considering a rebranding campaign or do you think that\u2019s the brand that you really want to build on? Thomas P. Gibbons:  So the first question is, I think there is a underutilized potential. I think the contribution margins of taking investment capabilities that we already have today that we are offering in some ways to the retail channels and directly to wealth management also, but expanding that will be pretty a meaning contribution margin. We don\u2019t have to expand our investment capabilities all that much and can reach a much broader universal clients, and again, this is a market where we are already very present and we just want to get a figure out of it, because we think there\u2019s big opportunity with what we have. On the Dreyfus branding side, I definitely think that part isn\u2019t just about covering clients. You also have to have the right products. We\u2019ve launched a number of products and are actually seeing very early success. I will tell you we\u2019re already seeing success. If you look at our line and the earning release today, we\u2019ve had a $2 billion of inflows and alternatives, as an example, and that has actually come through what we traditionally called retail channels. The new products we\u2019ve launched have been everything from long, short funds for the Newton and The Boston Company to multimanager and liquid our strategies that are managed by EACM, which is our fund of hedge fund investment firm and also launched a, we\u2019ll use the term smart data product as well. So it\u2019s getting us the ability to reach more clients with more products and again it\u2019s benefiting from the great position we already have in those channels. The Dreyfus brand, I think, will grow with our expansion here and any changes around branding \u2013 those are certain things we talked about. Gerald, if you want to comment. Gerald L. Hassell:  Yes, I guess I have one more comment, Luke, and that is we\u2019re not totally relying on the Dreyfus brand and so the other boutique brands, which have strong names in their own right, are being put on the various channels and various platforms around the world. And so, pick a name; a Newton, a Walter Scott, The Boston company, Standish, all have branding name recognition in their category space and placing those more aggressively on third-party platform is part of the goal here and I think they have good names in order group of assets. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And maybe the last one on this question is, we actually have a BNY Mellon fund family outside the U.S. It\u2019s quite large and actually inside the U.S., it\u2019s about $80 billion north of assets. It\u2019s been primarily used as the way that our wealth management business has managed mutual funds. So trying to assess that, long-term assets is about $66 billion. The Wealth Management in the U.S. being Mellon family is slight around $80 billion and there\u2019s north of $70 billion outside the U.S. So being Mellon brand globally actually is in pretty good condition. And then I would also tell you one of the places that we are very excited about is the ability to connect with our brethren in the Pershing organization who are reaching the RIA and the independent broker/dealer network. That\u2019s substantially more clients and it\u2019s actually a very difficult \u2013 quite challenge to reach unless you have the ability to partner with our firm with Pershing and call list they have with those clients. So a lot of opportunity here, we\u2019re excited about it, it will obviously take sometime. We\u2019ve been making investment center. We went a little over a year ago actually we had our board and management team here and approve this investment and we\u2019re excited about progress we\u2019re making already, the teams working very hard in coming together. you may have seen we made senior hire recently, and those people are very important to helping build the brand that we\u2019ll market. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Very helpful, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Gerald L. Hassell: Good morning ken. Ken M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC : I was wondering or I\u2019m sorry, just for anyone is most relevant. The new business wins on the custody study side, it\u2019s kind of been running at sub 200 for a couple of quarters. Now, just wondering because it\u2019s flavor for the business pipeline on the asset servicing side, whether it\u2019s a market effect or whether it is changes to the marketplace and how you are pipelines working? Gerald L. Hassell: Tim, why don\u2019t you take that. Timothy F. Keaney: Sure. Hi, Ken, Tim Keaney. We look at it Ken, both on an asset basis and revenue. I\u2019d say it\u2019s actually been pretty consistent particularly on the revenue side for the last six quarters we saw. And I think it\u2019s reflecting something we\u2019ve talked about on the last few quarterly calls and we\u2019ll shift in non-AUC/A types of business things like our transfer agency business or sub transfer agency or subaccoutning business and middle office outsourcing, which now is about a third of our pipeline and has been consistently slow now for the last several quarters as insurance companies and asset managers looked outsource. So, I wouldn\u2019t be overly concerned about that sub 200 number, I feel pretty good about the consistency of the revenue and it\u2019s sign of the mix. And the overall point on the sales pipeline it\u2019s about $2 trillion state tax been not quite a high water mark, but a very, very strong pipeline both in asset servicing and I would also Brian Shea say in Pershing. Ken M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay. Secondly, just Todd, to your points on the NII front, I\u2019m just wondering you saw a decent decline in your earning asset yields, and I hear your points about keeping duration short. But, can you just talk to us how you\u2019re balancing the rate environment with the longer-term asset sensitivity and where you\u2019re kind of new investments are versus your rolling-off rate? Thomas P. Gibbons: Yes. We\u2019re probably going to achieve a little more in the loan book. So that\u2019s one of things that you see pick up. As we\u2019ve seen a little bit of the decline in cash at central banks as well as Interbank placements. So that\u2019s rolling into the secured loan book that we talked about and it offset some of the slight spread tightening that we\u2019ve seen just from, generally from narrower spread. We are taking a hard look at the investment securities book now and given the new regulations that are meant to go into effect next year; we will probably need to reposition that book a bit. And there are certain types of asset that will become more attractive to us such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, we\u2019ll probably hold a little less of certain high quality asset-backed securities. We have to think about what we might want to do with communities for example because of how they get treated? Today, we\u2019ve actually build up a bit of a short-term treasury portfolio as well. Just to be defensive in case interest rates ever actually went south or the interest on accessories go south in the short-term. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, but it\u2019s the defensive position with very little risk. So we actually came in the middle of analyzing exactly what we were ultimately going to look like. Ken M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay and did some tough driver answer today, but is that something that we\u2019ll hear about you think in a quarter or two or is that something that will evolve over the next year or so and how do we get the sense of what the net effect of that all might be from an income statement perspective. Gerald L. Hassell: Right now, we are thinking it\u2019s probably neutral. So I will give you that much guidance but we\u2019ll give, this is one of the reasons that we targeted the late fall holding Investors Conference to give clarity around this, also around the capital implications, the balance sheet and so forth and some of our other strategies. So it fits pretty neatly into that timing. Ken M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC :  Okay. And then just last two quick clean-ups together. Do you have the accretion number this quarter and also was there anything notable in the nice reduction you saw in other expense? Gerald L. Hassell: The accretion and there are really two things that are helping us, they are actually negatively impacting the net interest margin; one is the accretion and both on year-over-year and sequential basis it\u2019s about $5 million, and the other is the amortization of the premium. And on year-over-year basis there was about $11 million so that's about $16 million impact, a little less than sequentially. And so that's what\u2019s driving some of that number, I don\u2019t expect that to change too much, so accretion should be kind of in that ballpark as we see these securities just continue the kind of burn off over time. Nothing particular notable in the other side, we did have a litigation recovery or release from our provision of about $12 million and so that\u2019s one of the beneficiaries there, other than that everything is pretty well controlled in the other category. Ken M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Cynthia Nevins Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks a lot. So a question on the Corporate Trust you mentioned the run-off the higher margin securitization over the next 12 to 18 months, and I was wondering if you can give us a sense of the magnitude of the revenues associated with that, and I saw for instance that your services were down about $8 million sequentially. Is that typical of the kind of step down, we could expect, or do you expect it to occur evenly, any color will be great. Gerald L. Hassell: Todd? Thomas P. Gibbons:   Cynthia what we\u2019ve in terms of fee revenue, what we\u2019ve explained or we\u2019ve disclosed is that we expect about a half of 1% of our total revenue to step down as a kind of the net run-off impact. So somewhere in the vicinity of $50 million to $75 million a year and within issuer services there are really two businesses now, there is depository receipts and there is Corporate Trust, and it\u2019s depository receipts actually did a little bit better and Corporate Trust is the difference so pretty consistent with the guidance that we\u2019ve previously given. Cynthia Nevins Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, so you expect that to basically to bottom out after 18 months and then be steady? Thomas P. Gibbons: Yes, there is a lot of these securitizations were in the ballpark of 10 years or so and so a lot of them were constructed back in 2006 and 2007, so we\u2019ll get to that end point, and I think the other thing to note is there is not a lot of reduction in expenses that comes, but you still have to do the same service and even though it\u2019s just on a small base. Gerald L. Hassell: And I will point out, we are getting more than our fair share of the new issuance market and we are seeing some CLO pickup activity in the CLO space, where bid encouraged that the housing market will see some recovering securities coming ahead of that. So I think we are bit more optimistic about seeing some new business come on to hopefully shorten that timeframe but it really depends on the markets recovering and new securities being issued. So the proposals that are currently coming out of the senate are looking for a private solution at least in terms of the securitization market which will present opportunities for us in our corporate trust functions, again that \u2013 those and that\u2019s going to actually be passed, but it\u2019s at least going to see some indication of what the future might look like. Cynthia Nevins Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay and then just a small one on set landing, I know you are planning a big business, but look like the market value of securities on loan was up quite a bit, sequentially what\u2019s behind that and how do you see that business. Is it ever going to recuperate the past levels do you think? Gerald L. Hassell: Yes, Cynthia. There was a very nice pick up, in securities that on loan picked up during the quarter and we are taking some action on our own parts to put some securities out in the marketplace and satisfy client demand. So, and we are optimistic we\u2019ll see that the rate of growth will continue to improve. Spreads are very low, but the volumes are up. So we\u2019ll take it. Cynthia Nevins Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay thank you. Operator : : : Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research : Hello there. A quick question on the asset from the cost of the growth which seems to be lacking some of the peers groups. So I guess the question If I to have is, if your customers are very satisfied you mentioned the Global Custody survey where you came out well, why isn\u2019t that translating into stronger growth in asset under custody and do you want to change that? Thomas P. Gibbons: : Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research : And you mentioned the need for price discipline and not chasing every piece of business. What are the areas where you think competition is particularly in terms of the movement? Gerald L. Hassell: Tim, why don\u2019t you take that one? Timothy F. Keaney: : Those are paying off. So it\u2019s about doing more with the largest clients but it is still very tough price competition at the high end of the market. Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research :  Thanks. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Gerald L. Hassell: Good morning. Robert Lee \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.:  Question really focusing on asset servicing and understanding that your underlying mix is, I believe, skewed towards fixed income and cash. So you don\u2019t necessarily get the full benefit of the market lift. But now we\u2019ve had a, I guess, pretty strong past year kind of at least equity market tailwinds. It does seem like business activity has been reasonably active and I think the 4% year-over-year growth excluding sec lending. So what does it take really to get that business kind of to a faster growth rate or high single-digits? Is it just structurally just even with some good tailwinds that structurally it\u2019s really just kind of in this low single-digit growth business or is there something else that we\u2019re not seeing that you think is really weighing on that particular revenue line? Timothy F. Keaney:  Robert, Tim Keaney again. I think if you pull out securities lending, which is probably the more helpful way to look at it, you\u2019d see fees in asset servicing up 5% year-on-year and 2% sequentially, very closely aligned with sort of AUC growth. But I think what\u2019s changing in the market is a shift towards financial institutions. We don\u2019t see a lot of defined benefit pension plan or central bank business moving and that\u2019s a good thing, because we have a big market share there, but they are very slow growers. What\u2019s really been growing the asset servicing business is financial institution. So mutual funds, banks, brokers and hedge funds and I think that really plays to our strengths, because we\u2019ve been investing in our outsourcing capabilities. Bridgewater is I think a great example of where we\u2019ve been making some big investments. I mentioned Collateral and FX and I think that\u2019s where the opportunity for us is going to turn as we focus on bundled players that are winners in the consolidating industries that they compete in. When our clients grow, we grow, but it also means we need to continue to invest in the products and services that our clients need. And those areas are ones that we really believe are going to continue to drive our growth. And I would also say there is a space that we have a unique position and that we don\u2019t see a lot of our traditional trust bank competitors and that\u2019s where private banks and other financial advisors are getting out of self-clearing and they are looking at Pershing and the platforms that we\u2019ve been investing in there. That, we believe, over the next year or two is going to be another really bright spot for us. So I guess those two or three things that will be real catalyst for us. And maintaining strong price discipline. Robert Lee \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And maybe just, I know it\u2019s both a question and a suggestion maybe. You talked about new business wins and you did mention that you\u2019re seeing a lot of business not coming \u2013 revenue streams that are tied to AUC or administrative assets, but possibly get a sense for what the revenue impact is on your new business wins if you have $160 billion of active wins. Should we be thinking enough? Though it\u2019s hard to translate that into what it really means. Is that $5 million of revenue, $25 million of revenue? So I guess it\u2019s a question or suggestion, it would be great to get some of those kind of metrics in the quarter and kind of the revenue impact of net new business? Gerald L. Hassell:  I think Robert, it\u2019s just a point. I\u2019m nodding at Todd here. It\u2019s really hard to answer that question with any specificity because of the business mix and I just will go back and say that question that was asked earlier. Am I worried at all about the sub-$200 million of AUC/A wins, I\u2019m not we\u2019ve been looking at and quantify what we see the value of the business be in each quarter. And it\u2019s been pretty darn consistent with the last six quarters or so, I don\u2019t know. Thomas P. Gibbons:  Yes, I think I just add the fact that our revenues in asset servicing is closely related to the growth rate than AUC, whether it\u2019s market driven or new business win, I think it\u2019s keeping that correlation pretty tight. Robert Lee \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: All right, well, thank you for taking my question. Thomas P. Gibbons: Welcome. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC :  Good morning. Gerald L. Hassell: Good morning. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC :  Just on the SLR here, a lot of encouraging moments here this quarter. I was just hoping just mechanically may be you could break down the improvement in the SLR to the different components in how much was retained earnings versus daily average balance on the asset side and such. And also give a reminder or some sort of sense Basel kind of what you intend to run rate above the 5% requirement, I hope. Gerald L. Hassell: Okay, sure Brennan. In terms of the break down between capital generation and what I\u2019ll call is the change in the denominator, it\u2019s about half in capital generation and half the change in the denominator. And so the change in the denominator where really two things as the U.S. is moving towards these Basel adoption of the denominator definitions. What is unfunded commitments get treated using the credit conversion factor that was established under Basel I that was worth about a $20 billion reduction in assets that we have to otherwise have put into our denominator. And then the rest of it was the change from going from an average calculation of the balance sheet to a month end calculation, so the average of three month ends. So, typically we would see balance sheets grow especially a quarter end so a little bit. And you can see our spot balance sheet versus our average balance sheet is almost always higher. That was probably worth about $12 billion or $15 billion in assets, so the combination of the two which is just about\u2026 Thomas P. Gibbons:  On the Basel part of your question given how much cash we have at central bank, we don\u2019t expect to run much in the way of Basel. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Okay that makes sense. And then on the money market fund business, can you may be give us the sense of the size of the institutional money market business if you have in the U.S. and how much of that is institutional account that institutional book breaks down in between prime versus treasury and other. Gerald L. Hassell: Well, virtually all of the money market business is U.S., we really don\u2019t have much in the way of outside the U.S. money market funds. Most of it is sourced through almost 50% of our money market funds come from our cash with servicing encouraging platforms less than one of the positive synergy, is not worth this much right now. But it is one of positive synergies kind of being associated with large asset servicing book of business. So a lot of the deposits in the money market funds are sourced from internal clients or encouraging platform. That\u2019s the way to think about it so it\u2019s really a U.S. based business. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Back to the split between treasury and client I don\u2019t have a stuff in my head, Gerald. Gerald L. Hassell: Yes it moves rapid, and we have a \u2013 so let me give you some general answer. So it\u2019s we have a much larger institutional in retail money market business, and a much larger treasury then client compared to many others. Again the numbers you\u2019re rounding, it\u2019s a pretty meaningful treasury business. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So, if we think about where the market is in those various break down. You guys probably \u2013 with its skew more to the treasury side than the product market business. Gerald L. Hassell: Yes. Exactly right. And so that\u2019s why you see everything is obviously, with treasury rates at zero\u2026 Thomas P. Gibbons:  More yields. Gerald L. Hassell:  Yes, exactly. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Sure, sure. Thanks, thanks for the color. Gerald L. Hassell: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse Ashley N. Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  Good morning. On collateral management, you touched a little bit about the investment you\u2019re making build out the business, but how should we think about the longer-term opportunity for you there? So any color on how much money you\u2019re making from the business today and how the competitive landscape is evolving would be appreciated? Gerald L. Hassell: Okay. We\u2019ve been making investments over the last year, year and a half in that stage. It\u2019s starting to show up in the investment services achieve, it\u2019s one of the contributors to the growth there. We don\u2019t break it out individually. Right now, we\u2019re seeing more in the segregation category, I being the custodian for the segregated assets around collateral services. At some point, we little start to move into the higher value transformational aspects of collateral services. Doing some secured financing is also been a contributor to the collateral services. We do see that\u2019s evolving, it\u2019s evolved more slowly than we would have expected as the new laws in regulations are kicking in. We expect this to pick up over the course of time and it\u2019s a global phenomena I might add. So we see opportunities to do this in all parts of the world. Ashley N. Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  Great. Thanks for the color there. And on the SLR, it could progress this quarter, but as the rule hopefully enters the final inning. What impact do you think the rule as it stands today has on business decisions for you and more probably the industry? And then, just broader update on the global regulatory landscape laws, we appreciate it. Thomas P. Gibbons: I\u2019ll deal with the SLR question maybe Gerald, you can handle the broader question on the regulatory landscape. In terms of \u2013 for I think everybody in the industry and certainly the big institutions. They can be more balance sheet sensitive. So use of the balance sheet is going to come to play with a higher cost. So that, as we look at any of our businesses, the balance sheet intensive businesses, they are going to come under tighter scrutiny, and can we make the returns, and how do we squeeze the returns out of them. Part of the reason that we frankly we like the investment management business because there is no balance sheet things that comes with that. So I think that is a question that we \u2013 that all large financial institutions are dealing with right now. Gerald, I don\u2019t know, if you want to comment on the regulatory. Gerald L. Hassell: Well. The regulatory fronts and I guess the thing that\u2019s challenging for all of us is, the lack of harmonization across the regulatory environment with Basel adopts the U.S. has a different standard, U.K. has different standard, the ECB has a different standard. It\u2019s particularly challenging to all of us to determine what's the right mix of businesses and use of balance sheet or not, with these changing environment. We\u2019re starting to get a little more clarity around it. And it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re certainly very focused as the company around making sure our business model performs well in the new environment, other firms are going to the same decision making process. I think as Todd pointed out anything that\u2019s balance sheet intensive is either to shrink or get priced up. And I think that\u2019s one of the things the regulators are looking for, is to make sure risk is peripherally placed in the marketplace or stop doing the activity and so I think that\u2019s going to be some of the changes you see more broadly across the industry. Ashley N. Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rob Rutschow with CLSA. Rob C. Rutschow \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. The first question is on expenses, you had close to a 10% decline in the employee benefit expenses sequentially. And if I\u2019m reading the numbers right, you also eliminated and some liability for capital purposes so, with the sequential change just through to a change in assumptions or is there something else you\u2019re doing there that allows you to produce those things and expenses. Thomas P. Gibbons: Rob, the reduction in the pension expense is the combination of the \u2013 there is nothing unusual there. The plan has been to define benefit plan, it\u2019s largely driven by I should say by the define benefit plan. The defined benefit plan was frozen two dimensions quite a few years ago. And the year-over-year changes first time that we actually saw interest rates go up quite a few years as the discount factor on the liability. That in combination with the very strong underlying performance with the assets the seasonal fund. Even though we reduce what we estimate our go forward returns in R&D. That reduced our pension expense we estimated by about, it should be by about $100 million this year. So $25 million or quarters so that\u2019s marginally the driver of what\u2019s you are seeing on the benefit side. Rob C. Rutschow \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. The follow-up question would be on the, I don\u2019t know if you guys have provided this or we can \u2013 what would be your total regulatory expense, and is there any way to segment that between servicing investment management. Thank you. Thomas P. Gibbons: Yes, we have not disclosed a specific number except for the cost of actually compliant with Tri-Party Reforms, where we have seen our expenses in that particular unit run rate go up, it\u2019s not exclusively related to Tri-Party Reform but most of it is by over $70 million. There is very limited impact in the investment management space around regulatory, it\u2019s almost all investment services related. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from\u2026 Gerald L. Hassell:  Wendy, we have time for one more question. Operator :  The final question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Maybe I could just ask about the TR business, and it looks like M&A is picking up cross border IPO activity seems to be picking up. Can you discuss that the pipeline, I guess and relative to the similar week results this quarter is just a little too early to tell. How do you think of that going forward? Gerald L. Hassell: Yes, let me start just by referring to this quarter, Jim it actually wasn\u2019t a bad quarter. We saw some decent corporate actions and revenues weren\u2019t too bad. So when you look at the issue with services downward, that\u2019s masked by the weaker performance in Corporate Trust that we discussed. Jim F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: It\u2019s sponsored programs I guess for now, this quarter. Thomas P. Gibbons:  Some of the sponsored programs are down mainly because of our own choice. We're just being again more disciplined - the category being more disciplined around the pricing of working with different programs where our market share is still holding in roughly 60% category. So you're just seeing a slight decline in number of programs. It's not a big deal and it's really that we've been proactively managing it. Jim F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.:  And in terms of the outlook. Gerald L. Hassell: The outlook, as M&A activity picks up and as IPOs pick up around the world, this is an area of the benefit and it\u2019s mostly an emerging markets business. And so, as you\u2019re seeing activity in that space DRs will clearly benefit from it. Corporate actions and M&A are the big revenue drivers for this business. That necessarily with day-to-day trading, although that\u2019s the foundation of it, all those things that you mentioned really turbo-charged the revenues in that business. So we\u2019re optimistic as you are. Jim F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, great. And then on the \u2013 quick follow-up on the capital ratio. I noticed that your Tier 1 common on the standardized approach rose, I assume with retained earnings, but the advanced approach declined by 30 basis points. Is that simply higher operational risk assumptions or is anything else in there? Thomas P. Gibbons:  No, that\u2019s largely driven by some of the parameter changes as we got ready to come out of the parallel run. There were some parameter changes around some of our risk-related assets that drove that change. Jim F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. All right, thanks. Thomas P. Gibbons: Great. Thank you. Gerald L. Hassell: Well, thank you very much everyone. And before closing the call, I just want to remind you we\u2019ll plan to host an Investor Day in the late fall and there we\u2019ll be able to share more details around our business model and our strategy. So, again, thank you for joining us today and look forward to taking with you. If you have any questions please follow-up with Andy Clark. Thank you very much everybody. Operator : Thank you. If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Mr. Andy Clark at (212) 635-1803. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I would now turn the call over to Mr. Izzy Dawood. Mr. Dawood, you may begin. Izzy Dawood : Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as our executive management team. Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our Web site bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, July 18, 2014, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Our press release and earnings review are available on our Web site, and we'll be using the earnings review to discuss our results. Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald Hassell : Great, thanks, Izzy and welcome everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. So a few key takeaways for the quarter, we\u2019re attacking our expense base, as we continue to align our operating model with the reality of the macro environment. We are absolutely committed to aggressive expense management and to reducing structural costs and it\u2019s paying off, helping us generate positive operating leverage during the quarter. Investment management fees and most of our investment services fees continue to grow, demonstrating our ability to meet the increasingly complex investing needs of our clients. Our capital position remains strong, adds to our ability to generate capital, providing us with the financial flexibility to continue to return capital to shareholders. So looking at our performance during the quarter. As you saw from the release, we reported earnings of $0.48 per share which included a $0.14 per share charge covering two items we previously disclosed. One was the charge related to certain investment management funds, and two, a severance charge related to progress in streamlining our organization which I might add, is expected to benefit our expense run rate in excess of $120 million charge. And we should begin to see the benefits this year with a full effect in 2015. Now when you add these items back, one might say that we earned $0.62 per share, but we think we really owned about $0.58 per share on an operating basis. So, turning to revenues. Total revenues were 3.7 billion. Investment management had a good quarter and continues to demonstrate why we value this business. Investment management and performance fees were up 4% year-over-year and they were also up 5% sequentially. Assets under management increased 15% year-over-year to a record $1.64 trillion. And we are continuing to execute on our initiatives to drive future earnings growth including our strategy to increase our focus on individuals as investors by broadening our reach to intermediaries and the retirement market and by expanding wealth management. Now another key strategy involves building out our local capabilities for clients looking to invest in Asia. In fact, in APAC we\u2019re currently on-boarding our first client onto the separately managed account platform that we built in conjunction with our purging operations. So we\u2019re not only attracting clients that will use our technology, but we\u2019re also getting asset management mandates on it as well. During the quarter, Insight Investment was named the winner of Global Investor Magazine to annual award for investment excellence as asset manager of the year in its category. Insight was also named the LDI manager of the year by the UK Pension Awards. So a great performance in our investment sector, in that regard. All-in-all a good quarter for investment management, which remains a significant earnings contributor and capital generator for our firm. We like the fact that this business is balance sheet light and that it continues to serve as a valuable role in allowing us to leverage and deepen our client relationships across the Company. In investment services, asset servicing, clearing and treasury services fees grew nicely, while issuer services was down. Investment services business was again helped by the growing contribution from global collateral services, which showed good growth during the quarter as usage of our optimization and segregation solutions continued to increase. In global markets, the industry-wide low volatility negatively impacted our revenues, but we\u2019ve been able to offset that partially as enhancements to our FX platform drove a significant increase in volumes. So again, our investments are paying off. Now during the quarter, our asset servicing and global collateral services capabilities received a number of awards for innovation, service quality and the strength of our capabilities and we again came out on top of our peer group in a key industry survey, this time in Global Custodian Mutual Fund Administration Survey. Now on the expense front, earlier this year we outlined some of the actions we\u2019re taking to manage expense growth, including streamlining our organization, reducing our real estate footprint, consolidating platforms, reengineering processes and getting more out of each technology dollar we have spent. I said you would see evidence of all these news this year, and our progress is now being reflected in our numbers. We\u2019ve succeeded in reducing operating expenses both year-over-year and sequentially, notwithstanding the impact of regulatory risk and control-related expenses. So let me highlight two important areas. The first item involves reducing employee costs. We made good progress in streamlining our organization, which includes reducing positions in layer in getting to fewer, more effective managers. The employee cost reductions are real and very sustainable. But while the cost savings are important, these actions are not just about costs, they\u2019re about creating an organization that is better aligned and connected with our clients and markets and cultivating a high performance culture. Now as part of these moves, we promoted Brian Shea to head investment services, bringing the front and back-end together to drive better client solutions and improve our productivity and efficiency. Curtis Arledge added to his responsibilities, the oversight of the newly formed BNY Mellon Markets Group, which brings together global markets, global collateral services and prime services. Now Curtis has extensive experience in capital markets and asset management and it gives to me unique insight into the markets and needs of our clients, both buyer side and sales side clients. That together with a new structure will help to further accelerate the delivery to clients of solutions and trading, securities financing and securities lending. And I might add importantly, our clients have told us this is how we should be organized to better serve them. The second expense item is our real estate footprint. You saw that we reached an agreement to sell our One Wall Street building for 585 million, which will reduce our New York City footprint by 750,000 square feet. Now in terms of the future financial impact, there will be some incremental expense in 2015 as we work through some overlapping occupancy expense. And in 2016, we will see the benefit of this action and Todd will cover this more in just a moment. Now our focus is on driving productivity improvement across our businesses, across geographies, across functions and doing it aggressively every single day. Turning on to the capital front, we continue to generate significant levels of capital, resulting in strong capital ratios which provide us with a financial flexibility to return more to shareholders and drive shareholder value. During the quarter we increased our dividend by 13%. We repurchased 12.6 million shares. Now another compelling statistic, since the financial crisis, our strong capital generation has enabled us to more than double our tangible capital while also reducing our shares outstanding below pre-crisis levels. Now before I hand it over to Todd, let me wrap up with an update on our corporate trust business. Back in May we told you we were exploring whether the corporate trust business is worth significantly more to someone else rather than to us. We have now completed that process. When we weigh the benefits of the sale of the current environment against both the near-term pressures on this business, in a more positive long-term outlook, we concluded that we can create more shareholder value by retaining it. We will continue to focus on driving profitable growth. This business is positioned to benefit from the significant upside for earnings and operating margins that will result from an eventual move to more normalized monitory policy, the expected vacant and structured debt maturity and a potential recovery of a non-agency mortgage backed market. I have always liked this business and our leading market share position and I am confident of its future growth potential. Now the bottom line is we\u2019re executing to drive shareholder value through our focus on three activities, one, streamlining our organization and continuously finding ways to improve our productivity and efficiency, primarily through enhancement to our technology and operations and by sustaining the momentum that we have established on the cost front. Two, executing our initiatives to drive revenues and profits, focusing on growth opportunities, such as individuals as investors, our APAC investment management strategy, leveraging our investment services scaled to develop highly affective mid and back office solutions and enhancing our collateral systems and FX trading platforms to provide clients with better liquidity management tools. And finally, complying with a host of new capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements and doing it as efficiently and effectively as possible. Now as I said before, we expect to see the benefits of all these actions, to continue to show off in our numbers this year. With that let me turn it over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Gerald and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the quarterly earnings review beginning on Page 2. As Gerald knows EPS was $0.48, the $0.48 include the $0.14 for the previously disclosed items. It also includes the benefit of approximately $0.04 between the credit provision which was negative for the period, as well as a little bit higher than normal investment and other income, so all in we view it as about $0.58 quarter. Looking at the numbers on a year-over-year basis total revenue was 3.7 billion, investment services fees were down 1% we saw some strength in asset service and clearing services but that was more than offset by the weakness in issuer services and we\u2019ll talk about that in a minute. Investment management and performance fees were up 4% and if you exclude money market fee waivers they were up 5%. FX was down on the lower volatility numbers and NIR was down 5%. Expenses on an adjusted basis were down 4% so for the quarter, our operating revenues were a little soft down about 2% year-over-year, but we more than offset that by the decline in expenses enabling us to generate 200 basis points of positive operating leverage. We do expect the revenue growth rate to recover in the third quarter. Turning to Page 4, what we call our some business metrics that help explain our underlying performance, you can see that we had record AUM of 1.64 trillion that\u2019s up 15% from a year ago, driven by higher market values as well as new business. During the quarter we had net long-term outflows of $13 billion and short-term outflows of $18 billion. The long-term outflows were primarily driven by our liability driven investments AUM where we had one client that opted to bring that service back in-house. Assets under custody and administration at quarter end were 28.5 trillion that\u2019s up 9% year-over-year it primarily reflects the impact of higher market values as well as some currency impact. Linked quarter AUC/A was up 2% due also to improve market values. For the quarter we had an estimated $130 billion in new AUC/A wins. Looking at to our key metrics you can see share growth over a year-over-year on most of them average loans and deposits in wealth management and investment services continued their growth trends. The market value on securities on loan at period end grew, and most of our clearing metrics were up while DARTS volumes were actually down. On the flip side, DR programs and average tri-party balances were down slightly. In terms of the key external metrics, both equity and fixed income in our markets were up, but I would point out that fixed income appreciation trialed the equity market improvement and as we have discussed before AUM and AUC/A are more oriented towards fixed income assets. The FX volatility index average was off 37% the lowest average in a quarter since pre-crisis, impacting FX revenue. And the average Fed Funds effective rate was down 3 basis points or 25% from last year, which had a negative impact on our money market fee waivers. Looking at fees on Page 6, asset servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year, 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher market values it also reflects the impact of a weaker U.S. dollars, net new business and organic growth, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. The sequential increase primarily reflects seasonally higher sec lending revenue and higher market values. Clearing fees were up 2% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by a higher mutual fund fees, partially offset by a decrease in DARTS and higher money market fee waivers. Issuer services fees were down 21% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower dividend fees partially due to timing and corporate actions and DRs. In addition the comparison was impacted by lower customer reversements in corporate trust, as well as higher money market fee waivers and that impact of the continuing net maturities in corporate trust. The good news as Gerald indicated is that we can see the net maturities of structured securities abating in the next 18 or 24 months, as the pace of the maturities slows and the impact of the new business should begin to more than offset. When you look at investment services, you will see that our investment services fees as a percentage of non-interest expense declined from 94% to 93%. However, if you adjust for the money market few waivers and also the impact of the issuer services business for the quarter, the ratio actually improved by 1%, demonstrating some operating leverage there. Investment management performance fees were up 4% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Both increases reflect higher equity market values and the average impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The year-over-year increase also reflects net new business, which was partially offset by money market fee waivers and lower performance fees. The sequential increase also reflects lower money market few waivers and higher performance fees. Excluding money market fee waivers investment management performance fees were up 5% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. In FX and other trading revenue was down 37% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. And looking at the components, FX revenue of 129 million was down 28% year-over-year and 1% sequentially and that\u2019s primarily reflecting lower volatility offset by higher volumes. In fact, if you look at the composite on Page 5, you can see that market volatility was down 37% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. So clearly we are capturing higher volumes. Other trading revenue was down 27 million from the year ago quarter and 5 million from the first quarter. The decrease from the year ago period reflects lower derivatives trading and the sequential decrease primarily reflects lower fixed income trading. In the second quarter, we exited one of the derivative business lines and Curt are considering further actions to improve the performance of this unit going forward. Investment and other income was $142 million in the quarter, compared with 285 million in the year ago quarter and 102 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects a gain related to an equity investment recorded in the second quarter of 2013 and that was offset by higher other income and seed capital gains. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher other income, equity investment revenue and asset-related gains, which was partially offset by -- we actually had lower lease residual gains in the quarter. Turning to Page 8 of the earnings review, you will see that NIR on an FTE basis was down 35 million versus the year ago quarter and down $8 million sequentially. The year-over-year decrease resulted from lower yields on investment securities and that was partially offset by the higher average earning assets which is largely driven by higher deposits. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by the higher premium amortization on agency mortgage backed securities. As you recall from previous quarters, when rates do go down, the premium amortization rate, excuse me -- when rates go down, the premium amortization rate actually increases. The net interest margin for the quarter was 98 basis points down from 115 a year ago and 105 in the first quarter. Turning to Page 9, our non-interest expense included two non-recurring items. The first was 109 million charge related to the previously disclosed administration of certain investment management funds with the charge we are adequately reserved for this issue, I would point out that the charge has been broken out in the investment management disclosure which will enable you to evaluate the segment\u2019s results on an actual operating basis. The severance charge of $120 million related to the streamlining actions which Gerald mentioned in his earlier comments, this charge was included in the M&I litigation and restructuring line. These actions will benefit our expense run rate in the second half of this year and I will give you a little more detail on that in a moment. Looking at our results adjusted for these items, total non-interest expenses were down 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, both decreases were primarily driven by a 5% reduction in staff expense and we were able to do that despite the impact of increased regulatory risk and control expenses. The year-over-year decrease also benefitted from a 24% reduction in the business development expenses. On Page 2, you can see that at quarter end we had a net unrealized gain on the investment securities portfolio of 1.2 billion. This increase from 676 million at the end of the prior quarter was driven by the lower rates that we saw in the quarter. Looking at our loan book on Page 11, you can see that the provision for credit losses was a credit during the quarter of 12 million which was driven by the continued improvement in the credit quality of the book. This compares to a credit of 19 million a year ago and a credit of 18 million in the first quarter.  Turning to capital on Page 12, at June 30, 2014, our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased in under the standardized approach was 10.4%, compared to 11.1% at the end of March and under the advanced approach it was 10% compared to 10.7 at the end of March. The 70 basis point sequential decrease primarily reflects an increase in risk weighted assets related to the assets of certain consolidated investment management funds. As a reminder, the fully phased in common equity Tier 1 ratio will be effective in 2019. Also in the second quarter, we exited the new parallel runned under the Basel advanced approaches and are now required to perform both standard and advanced transitional calculations. The binding of these ratios is the lower of the advanced standard common equity Tier 1 which is currently the advanced at 11.7%. Note that the quarter-over-quarter decline in our transitional risk-based capital ratios has two main components. First of all the switch this quarter using the advanced approach methodology is the most significant one. And the impact of the assets of the consolidated investment management funds I just mentioned also impacted that. Our estimated supplemental leverage ratio was flat during the quarter at about 4.7% and that's despite a 4% sequential increase in the average balance sheet. During the quarter we repurchased 12.6 million common shares for a total of $431 million and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.7%. Before moving to some outlook comments, let me spend a few minutes on the two transactions we expect to close in the third quarter, first of all the tale of our equity investment Wing Hang actually has already closed in the third quarter. This quarter\u2019s results or next quarter or the third quarter will include an after-tax gain of approximately $320 million. Note that our equity investment revenue related to Wing Hang totaled $20 million in the first half of 2014 and $95 million in 2013. The 2013 numbers includes a gain that we had with sale of property at about $37 million. Also the One Wall Street building is expected to be, the closing of it is expected to be done in the third quarter. It will result in after-tax gain of approximately $200 million, 345 million pre-tax. We have entered into a new lease now for our new corporate headquarters which we expect to occupy by the end of 2015. A few points to factor into your thinking about the current quarter and beyond, third quarter earnings are generally impacted by seasonal downturn in transition volumes and market-related revenues, particularly foreign exchange and securities lending, while DRs will it tends to be much stronger in the third quarter. Two transactions will impact investment in other income going forward. As I noted earlier, the Wing Hang investment contributed approximately 10 million per quarter for a line item in the first half of the year. In addition, we recently adopted the accounting standard related to low income housing. That will result in additional investment in other income of approximately 15 million per quarter. And that will be offset in the income tax expense. So these two transactions will increase the lower end of the previous guidance range for this line item by approximately $10. So we see investment and other income to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million on a go forward basis. In terms of net interest revenue in the second half of this year, we\u2019re also planning to reduce our exposure to introduce two inter-bank placements, asset so actually reducing the amount of cash that we have there and increase our securities portfolio, inventory of high quality liquid assets. The anticipated revenue as a result of these tactical actions should mitigate the impact of our net interest revenue as a result of the ECV interest rate actions, as well as this prolonged low investment rates in the U.S. Severance charge this quarter will benefit in our expense run rate beginning in the second half of the year. We expect the savings of our streamlining actions to more than offset the impact of the July 1st merit increase. As mentioned earlier, we expect our headquarter sales to close this quarter. In terms of the financial impact we\u2019ll see incremental occupancy expense of $30 million in 2015 as we absorb the rent expense on the new headquarters, as well as the expenses of transitioning of the One Wall Street. Once we do make that transition and get through the overlap, we expect to see a benefit of our expense base of approximately $10 million in 2016 and beyond, and that's versus staying here at One Wall Street. In addition the proceeds will enable us to pay down nearly $500 million of long-term debt, and we\u2019ll also receive some benefits from tax incentives provided by the State of New York. We intend to continue to buy back stock in the third quarter based on market conditions. We expect the tax rate to be around 27% for the quarter. Our focus has been and will continue to be on executing to drive shareholder value. As Gerald said, we\u2019re not relying on market activities to improve. We\u2019re continuing ways, to identify ways to increase our efficiency and we\u2019re ensuring -- working to ensure that the actions that we\u2019ve taken continue to show up in our numbers. With that, let me hand it back to Gerald. Gerald Hassell : Great. Thanks Todd. And Wendy I think we can now open it up for questions. Question: and: Operator : Thank you. We are now ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao : Good morning. Gerald, you just come off of a sizable expense program, you recently announced for the expense initiative that is supposed to begin in the second half of this year, yet you found some levers to pull this quarter as well. So my question is what else are you evaluating today? How quickly can you deliver? And should we expect this 4% year-over-year decrease to actually build going into the back half of the year or is there some investment spend taken into consideration as well? Credit Suisse : Good morning. Gerald, you just come off of a sizable expense program, you recently announced for the expense initiative that is supposed to begin in the second half of this year, yet you found some levers to pull this quarter as well. So my question is what else are you evaluating today? How quickly can you deliver? And should we expect this 4% year-over-year decrease to actually build going into the back half of the year or is there some investment spend taken into consideration as well? Gerald Hassell : Well, thanks Ashley for the question. We continuously look at all of our expenses as a way to try to control them better in recognition of the macro environment that we\u2019re in and rightsizing the size of company to the reality of the revenues that are being generated. So it\u2019s a continuous process, that's why we haven\u2019t announced any program, we haven\u2019t announced any separate initiative. It is day in and day out reduced any expenses and improving our operations and efficiency. I feel good about what we have achieved so far in the first half of this year. We\u2019re looking to do more in the second half. The severance cost that we are taking this quarter, the run rate will improve and offset the normal merit increase in the second half of this year. So I feel good about going into the second half in terms of continuing to control expense as well. Ashley Serrao : Got it. And then can you remind us of what your ROE and ROT targets are? And give us a sense of where you think you can go without any help from rates and how quickly you think you can get there? Credit Suisse : Got it. And then can you remind us of what your ROE and ROT targets are? And give us a sense of where you think you can go without any help from rates and how quickly you think you can get there? Gerald Hassel : Yes, we had indicated a few years back that our target on ROE was about 10%, and return on tangible common equity would be substantially higher than that, so far the first quarter, I mean excuse me for the second quarter return on tangible common equity was about 18%. We think we can continue -- in the first quarter we\u2019re going to be around 8% and 18%. We think they can continue to grind that up into that 10% range without a significant move with rates or volatility. Obviously I think we saw move in a better market conditions here than we would see a much more significant jump. Ashley Serrao : Alright, thank you for taking my questions. Credit Suisse : Alright, thank you for taking my questions. Gerald Hassell :  Thanks, Ashley. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Ashley. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Thanks guys good morning. A quick follow-up on the numbers I guess, on expenses and then a big picture question after. So, lots of moving pieces, you guys announced additional measures and you just have had obviously the -- some of the benefits will come in next six months or so in comp, but I guess if you look at the expense base overall, 2.7ish billion dollar run rate in the quarter today, like ex one of the, ex some of the one timers. Is that a fair run rate do you guys expect to grow that as the business continues to grow? Or is this kind of the run rate in expenses that we should think about over the next six months to 12 months as you realize some of these savings albeit offset by some of the goal initiatives? Goldman Sachs : Thanks guys good morning. A quick follow-up on the numbers I guess, on expenses and then a big picture question after.

Or is this kind of the run rate in expenses that we should think about over the next six months to 12 months as you realize some of these savings albeit offset by some of the goal initiatives? Todd Johnson :  Yes Alex, it\u2019s Todd, we are working real hard to try to maintain this expense level or keep it from growing so that the actions that we have taken around the headcount, the actions that we have taken around occupancy, the very careful analysis of all of our discretionary spend, we want to try to keep overall expenses flat and some of the benefit of that we are using to invest in some of the new revenue streams that Gerald has talked about, but all-in-all, there will obviously be some noise in those numbers we\u2019re trying to keep it as flat as we can. Alex Blostein : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And the second question, just on the current environment, over the last three to four months or so we\u2019ve seen increased pressure on the bigger banks to shrink the balance sheets to get faster compliance with SLR. You see that resonate in the retail markets declining 10ish percentage year-over-year. Just curious to think about how that impacts your business holistically. You guys are obviously a big tri-party repo manager. So curious to see how that kind of flows through to your operations, and just overall given the fact that you are big counter-party to a lot of the banks on Wall Street. Is that having any sort of impact on the business overall? Goldman Sachs : Got it, that\u2019s helpful.

So curious to see how that kind of flows through to your operations, and just overall given the fact that you are big counter-party to a lot of the banks on Wall Street. Is that having any sort of impact on the business overall? Gerald Hassel : Yes Alex, great question. Certainly some of our largest clients are shrinking their balance sheets and reducing their repo positions. So what\u2019s interesting is our tri-party repo program has essentially been flat so as the dealers in the U.S. have shrunk the marketplace the global tri-party program has increased. So we are able to maintain the revenues and their profitability in the business and get a good return on the investments we have made in the tri-party repo reform program. There is no question that as the big dealers in the U.S. shrink their activities, there is some impact in our revenue streams there. But we are making up for it through enhanced services and capabilities in other places like collateral services. Collateral services, as you may recall was originally designed for the sales side, the buyer side is the one that\u2019s going to serve using it much more heavily. And so we feel very good about our position to be able to offset the declines in the large broker-dealers with more activity from other clients. Alex Blostein : Got it, great. Thanks so much guys. Goldman Sachs : Got it, great. Thanks so much guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, two questions, first on the corporate trust, you indicated that, you went through the review and decided to retain it, could you just give us a little bit more color on the ends announced into that decision? Morgan Stanley : Hi, two questions, first on the corporate trust, you indicated that, you went through the review and decided to retain it, could you just give us a little bit more color on the ends announced into that decision? Gerald Hassel : Sure Betsy thanks for the question. When we said -- in May, when we made more public that we are exploring this, we said at the time, let someone was willing to pay us a premium value for this business, we wouldn\u2019t sell it, because we like the business, we like the attributes of it. It\u2019s a fee-based business. It has future upside potential with a more normalized monetary policy and is structured notes and mortgage backed securities come back on. We see light at the end of the tunnel. We would only sell it if in fact someone would pay us the premium what we thought the value of these businesses were it\u2019s a challenging environment for someone to acquire something of this size and complexity. And so we decided that we couldn\u2019t get the kind of premium that we thought that this business was worth, and we think that it\u2019s much more valuable in our hands and we can continue to build upon it and leverage it, and it\u2019s a great business. And that\u2019s why I said we have always liked it. It was only a question whether it was more valuable to someone else than versus us. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So, I mean obviously the Street know that there is a increased activism in the Company. And I guess the underlying question is, was this undertaken impart to answer questions to those folks or were you able to get to higher ROE, RTCE expectations the work you\u2019re doing now on the expense side? Morgan Stanley : Okay. So, I mean obviously the Street know that there is a increased activism in the Company. And I guess the underlying question is, was this undertaken impart to answer questions to those folks or were you able to get to higher ROE, RTCE expectations the work you\u2019re doing now on the expense side? Gerald Hassel : Well, the consideration to begin we have started a long time ago, so let\u2019s start with that. Our Board has always been very active and we as a management team have been very active. And looking at our -- all of our portfolio of businesses and making sure that they\u2019re best held in our hands versus someone else. And on corporate trust in some ways it was a simple math in a low interest rate environment with a level of deposits that were generated, if someone could make better use of those deposits and get a better margin on it and pay us a premium for the business that\u2019s when we would consider. To the extent that someone couldn\u2019t take advantage of it, we\u2019re happy to have the business and continue to own it and grow it and that\u2019s our leading market share of business. So that was the core reason for that. We think we can achieve our capital ratios, our leverage ratios, our liquidity coverage ratios, all within our own needs, irrespective of retaining the corporate trust business. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And then just separately, kind of ties into the collateral management question earlier, but as the fed starts to well ends tapering and then starts to increase reversed repo program, obviously you\u2019re in the middle of that. And with money market funds management product you have got as well as with the tri-party exposure that you\u2019ve got, maybe you could get, you\u2019re in a unique position to give us some color on how you think that higher increased RRP program is going to impact the financial markets? Morgan Stanley : Got it. And then just separately, kind of ties into the collateral management question earlier, but as the fed starts to well ends tapering and then starts to increase reversed repo program, obviously you\u2019re in the middle of that. And with money market funds management product you have got as well as with the tri-party exposure that you\u2019ve got, maybe you could get, you\u2019re in a unique position to give us some color on how you think that higher increased RRP program is going to impact the financial markets? Gerald Hassel : Well, I\u2019ll start with part of the answer and then I\u2019ll turn it over Todd, Todd has become a student of this as well as Curtis. We are the vehicle through which the reserve repo program of the Fed is -- we\u2019re the mechanism for allowing it to happen in the marketplace or for them to put the program in place. So and the Fed is a client of ours in that regard and so we do see the activity running through us and we\u2019re not going to violate any confidences there. But I think it is certainly one of the tools in the Fed\u2019s tool box in terms of managing monetary policy and interest rates. And so maybe with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Todd or Curtis. Todd Gibbon : Yes. I would just add Betsy that given the new liquidity and capital rules it\u2019s going to be difficult for the Fed to open market transactions the way they\u2019ve done in the past, hence the reserve repo program where they go directly to money market funds came into place. I think there is some question about just how much the Fed wants to expand that program. And obviously if they do expand it they would do through the tri-party repo so we do see that activity. The other alternative that they have to increasing interest rates or drain it\u2019s to either sell some of the assets that they have or increase the interest that they pay on access reserves or in this term deposit facility that they have in the banking system. So if they do reserve repo the cash will come out of the banking system and it will go into money market funds based on price, and then the banking system would have to bid against that some of the cash that went into those funds would come back into the banking system. But I think it composites it\u2019s kind of that simple, and as reserve repo grows the access reserves should decline. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Schorr with ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. So the actions that you\u2019d described taken to offset some of the lower rates and the actions in Europe, I am curious if you feel that has any material change on your asset sensitivity once all the changes are in motion I heard you on the revenue neutrality, but just curious on what that means in rising rate environment in the U.S.? ISI Group : Hi, thanks very much. So the actions that you\u2019d described taken to offset some of the lower rates and the actions in Europe, I am curious if you feel that has any material change on your asset sensitivity once all the changes are in motion I heard you on the revenue neutrality, but just curious on what that means in rising rate environment in the U.S.? Gerald Hassel : Yes. As you can tell from our NIR position we\u2019ve taken a bit of a defensive stance we\u2019ve actually reduced our asset sensitivity substantially from where we were last year. We do pay for that a little bit on our NIM there is no question about it. There will be a little bit of an increase as we do make that transition Glenn. I don\u2019t think it will be significant it will be in the vicinity of about 10% so our sensitivity would increase about 5% to 10%. And we will be users of the health and maturity account as well so there\u2019s less sensitivity to the capital ratios. Glenn Schorr : Got it, okay cool. And speaking the capital ratios, just looking for a drop more color on what specifically got consolidated from asset management to produce the drop in the ratios? And I am just curious on timing on why it happened this quarter I am just not familiar with it? ISI Group : Got it, okay cool. And speaking the capital ratios, just looking for a drop more color on what specifically got consolidated from asset management to produce the drop in the ratios? And I am just curious on timing on why it happened this quarter I am just not familiar with it? Gerald Hassel : Sure, we actually consolidated some of the CLOs that one of our asset managers managed, actually quite a few of the CLOs. So as we transition from Basel I to Basel III we actually reviewed the treatment of those consolidated assets. And we determined that even though we have no economic risk to them, we have no credit exposure at all that they should be included in our risk weighted assets. We actually expect this might be a temporary item FASB has just recently discussed the possibility of adapting a new standard that could be adopted as early next year and it would lead to us probably in consolidating some or even most of these assets as early as next year. Glenn Schorr : Okay, last one for me is just the 24% decline in business development cost. Is that -- is there a business to component to that impact or is that more of a sustainable decline because it actually -- it really moved the needle? ISI Group : Okay, last one for me is just the 24% decline in business development cost. Is that -- is there a business to component to that impact or is that more of a sustainable decline because it actually -- it really moved the needle? Gerald Hassel : Yes, there are two major components and there couple, but I\u2019d say the two major components in there Glenn is our marketing expenses and our travel and entertainment expenses. We\u2019ve been much more aggressive in managing our -- those discretionary expenses. For example, we have discouraged internal travel, we\u2019ve encouraged, increased use of video and audio conferencing. And so rather than pull some of our operating committee together from time-to-time, we are doing it virtually much more frequently. And we are doing that across the board, we are not decreasing important revenue producing travel, this is internal related travel. Also last year, we had a substantial campaign on our marketing and branding efforts and we\u2019ve reduced the spend associated with that. We are going to try to keep this discipline and sustain these levels. Now there is some seasonality to this with conference and so forth, so we would expect the third quarter is typically pretty good and the fourth quarter tends to be a little bit higher. Glenn Schorr : Okay, thank you for that. ISI Group : Okay, thank you for that. Gerald Hassel : Thanks, Glenn. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Just one follow-up on the NII, outside of the puts and takes, can you also tell us whether or not you think you can actually maintain this current level of NII, your comments were more focused on the offset between extending versus drags from ECB. But what\u2019s going on underneath that surface? Jefferies: Thanks. Good morning. Just one follow-up on the NII, outside of the puts and takes, can you also tell us whether or not you think you can actually maintain this current level of NII, your comments were more focused on the offset between extending versus drags from ECB. But what\u2019s going on underneath that surface? Gerald Hassel : Yes, I think we will be able to as we model this out and obviously it\u2019s going to be a bit sensitive to interest rates. But as we go through our modeling here, I think in the next few quarters, we will be able to maintain the level at this rate or in the ballpark of this rate, maybe slightly higher. Ken Usdin : Okay. Two questions on investment servicing, just core asset servicing ex-security lending was up only slightly sequentially but it was up 4% year-over-year. I am just wondering if you can walk us through trends underlying the asset servicing. You did have a seed growth and I get that you had not as much of an equity sensitive custodian. But just only a $5 million kind of core increase in servicing can you give us some flavor for the growth or the traction of growth that\u2019s underneath that? Jefferies: Okay. Two questions on investment servicing, just core asset servicing ex-security lending was up only slightly sequentially but it was up 4% year-over-year. I am just wondering if you can walk us through trends underlying the asset servicing. You did have a seed growth and I get that you had not as much of an equity sensitive custodian. But just only a $5 million kind of core increase in servicing can you give us some flavor for the growth or the traction of growth that\u2019s underneath that? Gerald Hassell :  Yes Ken, it is Gerald. Just a couple of comments there, one you\u2019d recall we did lose a couple of clients over the course of the last 12 months. Those losses are now in the full run rate and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen a softness in some of the asset servicing revenues that\u2019s now fully in a run rate and we think we feel good about the pipeline in a go forward. We\u2019re attracting good clients and so it\u2019s a little bit soft this quarter, but we expect it to pick up in the future. Ken Usdin : Okay. And my last one just about issuer services and you point out the drags of both sides of the business but second quarter is typically a seasonally stronger one that leads to the bigger jump in the third. So can you also just walk us through corporate trust and ADRs and the drivers there? Jefferies: Okay. And my last one just about issuer services and you point out the drags of both sides of the business but second quarter is typically a seasonally stronger one that leads to the bigger jump in the third. So can you also just walk us through corporate trust and ADRs and the drivers there? Gerald Hassell : Sure so the issuer services on a year-over-year basis I think it was down more than $60 million. Part of what we saw in the second quarter was last year we saw a little more dividend action in the second quarter, and due to timing, we\u2019re going to see some of that in the third quarter. So we would expect the third quarter to show the typical bounce that we get in seasonality around DRs and probably even a little bit higher than typical. So that was one of the reasons for softness there. And the reason is we also had fewer of these, kind of pass through, where some of our technology investments in corporate trust paid for clients and we see that in our revenue as well as in expense line. We had a little bit few -- a little bit less than that. Ken Usdin : Okay, great thank you.  Jefferies: Okay, great thank you. Gerald Hassell : Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi. Two as you say, reduced structural costs maybe you need to further reduce the structure and at the annual meeting I asked about the merits of having both assets serving along with asset management and Gerald you said that you have done the work and my thought is perhaps you need to show your work. Because the way we look at, the reported ROE has not been over the target of 10% since at least 2009. And so if this is a superior structure should there at least be an ROE in the double-digits? CLSA: Hi. Two as you say, reduced structural costs maybe you need to further reduce the structure and at the annual meeting I asked about the merits of having both assets serving along with asset management and Gerald you said that you have done the work and my thought is perhaps you need to show your work. Because the way we look at, the reported ROE has not been over the target of 10% since at least 2009. And so if this is a superior structure should there at least be an ROE in the double-digits? Gerald Hassell :  Well, Mike we -- just as I said at the shareholder meeting, it\u2019s a business we like a lot. We think there is a lot of good benefits with the two businesses together. Investment management is a great contributor to our earnings, it\u2019s capital light it\u2019s fee-based. We\u2019re getting collaboration across the businesses we learn from each other, we are collaborating our new products, new services, new capabilities. When we have done math as I said at the annual meeting, we don\u2019t take the math works, there is a lot of tax challenges, a lot of regulatory challenges associated with it. We are in fact improving the margins both in investment services and in investment management and that was evidence this quarter, in investment management you saw a 2% improvement year-over-year in the margins in the business, why we\u2019re still investing in it? So we think we can improve the returns and the margins and drive a great business together. We like the diversity of the earnings, we like the fact that they mutually service the same client, I think it\u2019s a great combination. Mike Mayo : I have three follow-up questions, should I ask one and then re-queue or ask all three now? CLSA: I have three follow-up questions, should I ask one and then re-queue or ask all three now? Gerald Hassell : Ideally one now and then re-queue Mike. Mike Mayo : Okay. Well, so what is the dollar amount of synergies and to repeat what I said before, again this is such a good combination, why is the ROE been below the cost of capital for the last five years? CLSA: Okay. Well, so what is the dollar amount of synergies and to repeat what I said before, again this is such a good combination, why is the ROE been below the cost of capital for the last five years? Gerald Hassell : So Curtis maybe you want to touch base a little bit on some of the synergies. Curtis Arledge : Yes. So Mike I think that when you think about investment management we\u2019re serving the same clients. In so many cases that our clients run investment services business, you\u2019ve asked for a very specific number. Truthful what is happening is these clients become clients with both parts of our organization, but with this continuous ability to connect to the investment services clients that's such powerful part of investment management. Let me give you a -- just in this quarter, a couple of examples. We had a foundation, a line of the investment servicing business that is expressing interest and expanding their portfolio in a direction of direct lending investment vehicles. The team that covers them for investment services are well aware of our capabilities in this space introduced us to that client and it became a win for us in terms of getting an investment management mandate. The other part of the investment services business that\u2019s been a real winner for us from past several months has been offering our private banking services for the clients approaching. So the financial advisors that approach and serves, many of them don\u2019t have access to their own private banking activity, so we\u2019ve linked those two actually invested in having a team in our private bank, make lending available to them and have seen nearly $0.5 billion of loan volume over a pretty short time and actually on really what we call the pilot effort that we\u2019re now actually planning to make it a much bigger part of the business. If you look at our cash business today, because we\u2019re at a low interest environment, the overall economics of the cash business are not really what we think the contingent opportunity is in a more normalized rate environment, but just think of all the changes that occurred in the money market fund world with the question was asked earlier about the basic change in market structure. We think we\u2019re well positioned to provide services around cash products into the higher rate environment that will be very valuable to the shareholders of BNY Mellon. So those are some examples of the places where there is real synergy. Mike Mayo : Okay. I\u2019ll re-queue. Thanks.  CLSA: Okay. I\u2019ll re-queue. Thanks. Gerald Hassell : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. So I guess I\u2019m just, I\u2019m a little bit confused about why you would want to be give up your asset sensitivity or lose some of the asset sensitivity here. I mean the NIM currently at like roughly 100 basis points is just far from heroic you have got Yellen in making comments that rates might be moving higher. So can you help us understand what drove that decision a little bit with a little bit greater clarity? UBS: Good morning. So I guess I\u2019m just, I\u2019m a little bit confused about why you would want to be give up your asset sensitivity or lose some of the asset sensitivity here. I mean the NIM currently at like roughly 100 basis points is just far from heroic you have got Yellen in making comments that rates might be moving higher. So can you help us understand what drove that decision a little bit with a little bit greater clarity? Gerald Hassell : So you\u2019re talking about moving a little bit of the cash that we have in the form of placements into high quality liquid assets. Part of that is compliance with LCR, so we are sitting on a massive amount of cash, placements are not LCR compliant. So this is a fairly easy way for us to comply and we will generate a little bit of additional NIR. We don\u2019t want to give up much of our interest rate sensitivity, so you\u2019re not going to see a significant move there. We do think that there is growth in opportunity cost and the capital cost to join that Brennan. But you will see a modest adjustment. Curtis Arledge : Yes. And Brennan some of the other activities we\u2019re working on, you\u2019ve seen the loan book and our wealth management business grow, we like that sort of that asset. You\u2019ve seen some of our secured financing for some of our collateral management clients\u2019 increase. We are looking at other area within our asset capabilities to generate better returns on those assets and still keep the interest rate sensitivity available to us for our win rates to improve. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that color. And then if we think about your asset management business and the sort of adjusted pre-tax margin there, if we look at what happened last year in that business, it contracted about 100 basis points versus 12 and I understand the majority of that was investment in distribution. But if we look at other asset management firms, they saw a rather significant expansion in margins last year. So I guess what's holding back the asset management business given how constructive the market is? Is there a structural impediment there, does it have something to do with how the agreements with the affiliates are structured. If you can maybe help us understand that a little bit that be great? UBS: Okay. Thanks for that color. And then if we think about your asset management business and the sort of adjusted pre-tax margin there, if we look at what happened last year in that business, it contracted about 100 basis points versus 12 and I understand the majority of that was investment in distribution.

So I guess what's holding back the asset management business given how constructive the market is? Is there a structural impediment there, does it have something to do with how the agreements with the affiliates are structured. If you can maybe help us understand that a little bit that be great? Curtis Arledge : Yes Brennan, it is Curtis. So first of all I would say that last year in addition to the investments that we made to grow our wealth management to expand our reach to financially expand our budgets through primarily in the U.S. to drive us and also to grow geographically. Those investments they sort of dampen margin, but I would also would call out the fact that we had a pretty some meaningful fee waiver environment, so we have a big part of our business is absolutely impacted by low or short rates. When you compare our overall enterprise to other peers that are sort of over the $1 trillion mark, we have a substantially smaller percentage of assets that are any equity asset class, and so the -- and I would also point out that our equity AUM is also pretty diversified, lot less as a percent is U.S. equities which have -- and especially did here last year. So we don\u2019t -- well it was certainly a tailwind for us. It was not nearly the tailwind that it would have been for investment firms that are less diversified and more similarly exposed to equity AUM. I don\u2019t think that the boutique structure certainly is one of our investment firms is very focused on their client base, their asset classes. They have a wider array of their own activities, both institutional and through retail distribution channels. But I actually think that they would benefit from the scale. We have firms that are 30, 40, 50 people highly focused on a very specific asset class, and we give them geographic reach in terms of clients and have a firm on the East Coast of United States that\u2019s raising money all over Asia and throughout the Sovereign Wealth Fund World without having to actually build their own infrastructure to do that. So I think it is a -- we\u2019re pretty excited about what we do. We are investing in it and you\u2019re absolutely focused on improving margins. That\u2019s why we are investing with where we are. If you look at the peers who have higher margins than us, they generally have substantially larger percentage of their assets in the retail space, and they have a larger share currently, they are benefiting from the equity tailwind. Of course that creates more profit volatility and margin volatility, if you look at it through time. But we are investing to improve our margins and are pretty excited about our opportunities there. Gerald Hassell : Yes just one final bit of color, I think you are seeing evidence of it in the 200 basis points improvement in margin year-over-year. This year and early next year are sort of the high watermarks in terms of the level of investment and we showed you in April. We expect an improvement in margin as those investments start to pay off. And also I might add, the investments we are making are not high risk investments. It is investing in wholesalers and distribution. It\u2019s investing in wealth managers. We are bringing in clients. That\u2019s starting to show up in numbers now. These are investments we have very-very conference on the returns. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks for the color.  UBS: Okay, thanks for the color. Gerald Hassell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi. Great, thanks. Good morning. Deutsche Bank : Hi. Great, thanks. Good morning. Gerald Hassell : Good morning, Brian. Brian Bedell : Yes good morning. On the, just back to the corporate trust, on the expense side of this can you just talk a little bit about to what degree some of the consolidation of this platforms were involved in the prior cost reduction program, and whether the dynamic changed upon your decision. And then, so should we be thinking about any other further backdrop of consolidations as the potential expenses on the corporate trust now that you are keeping in? Deutsche Bank : Yes good morning. On the, just back to the corporate trust, on the expense side of this can you just talk a little bit about to what degree some of the consolidation of this platforms were involved in the prior cost reduction program, and whether the dynamic changed upon your decision. And then, so should we be thinking about any other further backdrop of consolidations as the potential expenses on the corporate trust now that you are keeping in? Gerald Hassell :  Yes, the primary operating platform for corporate trust is the trust accounting system. It\u2019s really dedicated to corporate trust. They are the last user above it, and actually we were in a migration mode to our end-stage platform called GSP, for those of you who are interested in acronyms. We\u2019re in the process of doing the conversion and we are going to continue the process and it should be completed next year. And so there is no change in that going forward. And we will realize better operating metrics as a result of it. Brian Bedell : Okay. So that\u2019s yes, it\u2019s interchanged through sort of expense -- based on you keeping that. Deutsche Bank : Okay. So that\u2019s yes, it\u2019s interchanged through sort of expense -- based on you keeping that. Gerald Hassell : Brian, you\u2019re breaking up, if you could\u2026 Brian Bedell : I\u2019m sorry, so there is no change in the expense fee based on you are keeping that, it\u2019s the takeaway there? Deutsche Bank : I\u2019m sorry, so there is no change in the expense fee based on you are keeping that, it\u2019s the takeaway there? Gerald Hassell : No, not at all. Brian Bedell : And then on the revenue side, maybe question for Curtis and Brian -- and congrats on your extended role by the way. On the clearing business, you know the revenue, hope that well given charges definitely declined in the quarter. So I was just wondering if that was due to the component that\u2019s related to licensing and asset management or are you gaining new clients and is the run rate better there? And then similarly for Curtis, you know the organic growth has been very strong in asset management recently, this quarter little bit weaker, maybe if you could just address the LDI outflow and your view of the organic growth coming in the next one to two quarter overall? Deutsche Bank : And then on the revenue side, maybe question for Curtis and Brian -- and congrats on your extended role by the way. On the clearing business, you know the revenue, hope that well given charges definitely declined in the quarter. So I was just wondering if that was due to the component that\u2019s related to licensing and asset management or are you gaining new clients and is the run rate better there? And then similarly for Curtis, you know the organic growth has been very strong in asset management recently, this quarter little bit weaker, maybe if you could just address the LDI outflow and your view of the organic growth coming in the next one to two quarter overall? Brian Shea : Brian, it is Brian Shea. I will start with the clearing question and then I will turn it over to Curtis. The clearing business has been pretty strong with core fee growth driven by significant growth in mutual fund assets and asset-based fees offset by higher cash earnings receivers and lower DARTS as you recognized. I think the underlying metrics behind the clearing business are all really pretty strong. In this quarter we have a record level of client assets in custody. We have a record number of total individual investments on our platforms globally. We have a record levels of mutual fund assets on our platform overall. And growing margin balances as you can see in the metrics year-over-year, and you know the slight -- lots of low rates and discussions about money market industry, pretty solid cash management balances. And I would not actually to reinforce Curtis\u2019 point that the market share urging clients choosing, because they decide which cash management alternatives they use. But the clients have chosen Dreyfus more than ever before, and so we have a record level of market share of Dreyfus cash management on the purging platform. Again, when an interest rate environment changes that will be a much more valuable linkage in synergies between the investment management and investment services business. So that\u2019s my perspective on clearing I am going to turn it over to Curtis. Curtis Arledge : Yes and on the organic side, first of all we will tell you that we had a long-term out flows this quarter of 13 billion. It\u2019s a pretty unique situation actually and that one of our large LDI clients actually decided to take their LDI activities in-house. So it was not any way related to our investment performance or service, we always hate losing any business, but completing our standard decisions that they may -- to do that. I will tell you that our pipelines around LDI specifically continue to be robust, pension de-risking is still very much alive and well and I would actually say it\u2019s expanding geographically. So our largest business is Insight, which has a large book of UK, LDI business and I can tell you that the global interest in LDI is definitely not shrinking. One of the nice things about just -- since we are talking about the Insight, I will tell you the Insight, the tools that you\u2019ve to be able to perfectly model the liabilities, especially UK liabilities are having inflation sensitivity component. You have to be very good at understanding market dynamics and what drives risk and return and in the quarter, Insight specifically actually had a very significant amount of inflow into alternative strategies absolute return strategies where they are taking a lot of their capabilities and creating absolute return products, if their clients, who have been very satisfied with them in the LDI space are allocating to them and also getting broader interest. We like the short term side like the rest of the industry did experience outflows our outflows we think are roughly in inline with that the industry saw in the second quarter both some of it being tax payment, some of this being that clients were certainly in the beginning of the quarter reallocating short-term cash into some of the higher yielding on assets and actually that\u2019s the story in fixed income as well. Our product outflow there is related to mostly short duration fixed income where clients are reallocating. In equities the dynamic there has really been three things. The equity rebalancing so the increase in equity markets has caused clients to move money. But we\u2019ve also seen clients move assets around into past strategies. So in this quarter, you actually will see our increase of 7 billion was almost entirely equity index. So it\u2019s nice thing you have a diverse range of products to be able to -- it\u2019s leaving one place, it\u2019s going another money in motion is big part of our advantage here. Brian Bedell : Great, great thanks very much for the thorough answer. Deutsche Bank : Great, great thanks very much for the thorough answer. Gerald Hassell : Wendy, I think we have one more question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Cynthia Mayer :  Hi, thanks a lot. So just getting back to the expense management, you and others have been mentioning for a while that the pressure of compliance cost and I am just wondering looking ahead, do you see those leveling off? Is that a pressure that you feel is abating, so that to the extent you do streamlining, more of it will fall to the bottom line and same question and I guess the combining of your platforms, is there upfront IT for that? Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Hi, thanks a lot. So just getting back to the expense management, you and others have been mentioning for a while that the pressure of compliance cost and I am just wondering looking ahead, do you see those leveling off? Is that a pressure that you feel is abating, so that to the extent you do streamlining, more of it will fall to the bottom line and same question and I guess the combining of your platforms, is there upfront IT for that? Gerald Hassell : Great question, Cynthia, so first on the regulatory side, the rate of increase is slowing down, it is creating greater clarity around the rules and the regulations and what we need to do to be in compliance with them. But importantly, we cannot sacrifice having a well-controlled, well risk-managed firm we are absolutely committed to that and we\u2019re not going to sacrifice having a great firm in those categories. But we do in fact see the rate of growth moderating and our expense management is taking into consideration, continuing to fund those activities and so that\u2019s why we are very diligent around all the other things that we can control so that we can fund new investments, we can fund having a well controlled environment and continue to grow our businesses and serve our clients well. So it\u2019s all factored into the expense control programs that we put in place. And the platform consolidations again the technology investments that we\u2019re making are factored in the expense base and we\u2019re realizing the synergies out of the platform consolidations and it\u2019s in the run rate. Cynthia Mayer : Okay. Thanks a lot.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. Todd Gibbons : Thanks. Gerald Hassell : Thank you. Everyone thank you very much for dialing in today. I know you had a lot of interest in our results and so follow up questions to Izzy Dawood or Andy Clark they are available to answer your questions and thank you for your interest in us. Have a great. Operator : Thank you. If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Mr. Izzy Dawood at 212-635-1850. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I would now turn the call over to Mr. Izzy Dawood. Mr. Dawood, you may begin. Izzy Dawood : Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as our executive management team. Let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our Web site bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, October 17, 2014, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Before we begin, I would like to note two changes in our earnings materials. Firstly, I have introduced a financial highlights presentation which is a summary review of our revenue, expense and business segment trends along with related commentary. We will use the financial highlights presentation to discuss our results. In addition, we have consolidated our earnings press release and earnings review documents into one earnings release document. The earnings release and financial highlights presentation are available on our Web site. Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald? Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Izzy and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. Let me highlight some of the key takeaways for the quarter. We achieved continued momentum in investment management and investment services as we saw strong fee growth in these businesses reflecting our focus on developing and delivering the very best capabilities in the marketplace. We drive continued progress on the expense control front. As our expense growth rate was well below the growth rate of our fee revenues. We maintained a strong capital position, which prepared us well to comply with all the regulatory requirement, while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses and maintain a high capital payout ratio. And as you can see on Page 3 of our highlight deck, we had earnings per share of $0.93 and that included $0.29 per share for previously disclosed gains net of litigation and restructuring charges. Investment management had another excellent quarter with investment management and performance fees up 7% year-over-year. Asset center management increased 7% to a new record, 1.65 trillion driven by net new business. And also during the quarter we had 13 billion of net long-term flows reflecting the strength of our liability driven investment strategy, and interesting as we also had $19 billion of short-term inflows. Turning to investment services, fees grew at 5% year-over-year driven by strong growth in asset servicing, clearing and treasury services, which more than compensated for a decline in the issuer services. So in spite of the continued runoff at high value securitizations in corporate trusts investment services overall had a very healthy revenue increase. Assets under custody or administration were up 3% to $28.3 trillion. In foreign exchange our continuing enhancements are helping us gain new clients on our FX platform and that contributed to the sharp volume gains that helped mitigate the significant decline year-over-year in industry-wide volatility. Now of course recently market conditions have increased that volatility which is generally good for market participants. Now we also saw an increasing contribution from our collateral services, which helped our growth as clients are increasing their use of our optimization and segregation solutions. On the expense front, our aggressive commitment to reducing expenses and improving productivity is showing up in our numbers, particularly when you look at the trend and staff expense. Our normalized expenses were flat year-over-year and up only 1% sequentially, very strong results when given against the revenue growth that we experienced in investment management and investment services. Our capital position remains strong even after giving effect to the repurchasing of 11 million shares during the quarter for $431 million. Interestingly, we have repurchased about 3% of our shares outstanding this year. Now we also delivered an outstanding return on tangible common equity of 18% for the quarter. So all-in-all, good fee momentum, good progress in reducing the growth rate of expenses and an enviable capital position. Now at our Investor Day Conference on October 28th, we\u2019ll discuss in more detail how we plan to enhance our revenue growth, continue to control expenses, manage to the new liquidity and capital standards and how we intend to deploy the significant level of excess capital that we generate. And much of the focus will be on the work underway to maximize returns and create value for our shareholders, above and beyond what we\u2019re delivering today. And importantly we\u2019ll also share the key performance targets that you could hold us accountable too. And before I turn it over to Todd I want to highlight two recent actions that we\u2019ve taken as we continue to optimize our business mix. First, we repositioned our market group exiting derivative sales and trading. This will improve our operating margins and return on capital. We simply were not large enough player to get an adequate return on capital and bare the increasing risk management and over say cost. Second, last week we announced an acquisition that we will add new specialized fixed income solutions to our diverse portfolio of capabilities. We agreed to acquire Cutwater Asset Management which is a U.S. based fixed income and solution specialist. They have a 20 year track-record and approximately $23 billion of assets under management. Cutwater will operate as part of our investment management unit and we\u2019re closely with Insight our highly successful LDI specialty boutiques. It will allow us to extend our LDI and fixed income specialist strategy into the U.S. marketplace so we\u2019re very excited about that acquisition and also the repositioning of our markets group. So with that, let me turn it over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thanks Gerald, and Page 5 of the financial highlights document details of our reported results. As Gerald mentioned, we had EPS of $0.93 that included $0.29 per share for those previously disclosed gains net of litigation and restructuring charges. As you look at our numbers, you will note that we had a $0.01 benefit related to our loan loss provision credit so we see it as a $0.63 quarter. Now given the significant asset gains in the quarter, I think it\u2019s best that we start with the summary of our adjusted results which are on Page 6. Revenue was down year-over-year as strong growth in investment management and investment services fees was offset by lower investment and other income and lower net interest revenue. However, if you look at our revenues excluding the volatile investment line, it was up about 2%. I will provide more color on the revenue drivers shortly. Expenses were flat year-over-year and up slightly sequentially representing the continued progress on expense control. Our operating leverage was up 245 basis points year-over-year if you exclude the impact of the investment and other income. Our pre-tax margin was 29% and our return on tangible common equity was a strong 18%. On Pages 7 and 8, we will call out some business metrics and I think help explain our underlying performance. In terms of our investment management business, on Page 7, you can see that record AUM of 1.65 trillion was up 7% year-over-year driven by higher equity market values, as well as net new business. During the quarter, we had net long-term inflows of 13 billion and short-term inflows of 19 billion. On Page 8 you can see that assets under custody and administration at quarter end were 20.3 trillion that\u2019s up 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values. Linked quarter AUC/A was down 1% due to lower market values as the Footsie, MSCI and the Barclays bond index were all down in the quarter. We had an estimated 115 billion in new AUC/A wins during the quarter. Now many of our key metrics showed growth on a year-over-year basis as well. The market value of securities on loan at period end showed strong growth. Average loans and deposits in wealth management and as well as in investment services continued their trend upward. Our key broker deal and metric of average tri-party repo balances was also up. Our clearing metrics were also good, although DARTS volumes were off slightly as we typically see in the third quarter, active clearing accounts were up and long-term mutual fund assets showed especially strong growth. The number of DR programs declined in the quarter, reflecting an increase in the number of terminations that exceeded the number of new issuers. In addition to that, we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in this business. Looking at fee and other revenue on Page 9, asset servicing fees were up 6% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth, higher market values, net new business and higher collateral management fees. Sequentially organic growth was partially offset by seasonally lower securities lending revenue. Clearing fees were up 7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Both increases were driven by growth in clearing accounts and mutual fund positions and by overall higher asset levels. The sequential increase also reflects higher DART volumes. Issuer service fees were down 2% year-over-year and up 36% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower Corporate Trust fees, partially offset by new business and DRs. The sequential increase is primarily due to seasonally higher dividend fees partially offset by lower Corporate Trust fees. When you look at our investment services you will see that our investment services fees as a percentage of non-interest expense, what we call the coverage ratio was 100% in the third quarter. That\u2019s up approximately 300 basis points from the year ago quarter primarily reflecting strong fee growth with little changes in our expenses. The impact of the currencies for the full quarter had a neutral impact to our pre-tax income, but it's worth noting that it caused a slight revenue increase that was offset by an equal expense increase, most of that impact in investment management. Investment management and performance fees were up 7% year-over-year and down slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily resulted from higher equity markets, the currency impact and higher performance fees. The sequential decrease was driven by seasonally lower performance fees. FX and other trading revenue was down 4% year-over-year and up 18% sequentially. FX revenue of 154 million was unchanged year-over-year and up 19% sequentially. Year-over-year, higher volumes offset lower volatility. As Gerald mentioned the enhancements we\u2019ve made to our FX platform helped us capture more client activity. The sequential increase reflects higher volumes. Turning to Page 10 of the financial highlights, you\u2019ll see that net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was down 6% versus the year ago quarter and essentially flat to the second quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily resulted from lower asset yields and lower accretion that was partially offset by higher average interest earning assets and of course those assets were driven by higher deposits. The net interest margin for the quarter was 94 basis points it is down 22 from the year ago quarter and 4 from the prior quarter. Now we also point out here that euro-denominated for deposits now make up approximately 15% of our average deposit liabilities. During the quarter as you\u2019re probably aware the European Central Bank lowered the rate it pays on funds left at the bank to minus 20 basis points. To mitigate the impact of that move, we\u2019ve taken a number of actions. As of October 1st we began charging for deposits. We\u2019re also continuing to reduce our interbank placements and as we mentioned before we are increasing high quality liquid assets with the cash related to that. For the quarter, our securities portfolio increased by $10 billion, that\u2019s about 10%. We added agencies, treasuries and severance so that\u2019s increasing our high quality liquid asset portfolio. Turning to Page 11, you\u2019ll see that non-interest expense decreased slightly year-over-year and was up 1% sequentially. We have reduced staff expense year-over-year as lower pension expense and the impact of technology in-sourcing and streamlining actions offset higher professional legal and other purchase services, the currency impact and the annual employee merit increase. The sequential increase primarily reflects the incentive reduction recorded in the second quarter that was related to an administrative air, as well as the impact of the factors that I just noted. You will notice that headcount increased by 100 year-over-year, it was down by 200 sequentially. I want to remind you of our technology talent strategy of in-sourcing developers to reduce our application development cost. Year-over-year, we have eliminated more than 700 contractor related roles in technology and replaced them with permanent staff. Despite this our employee count is only up 100 position and compensation expense is lower, clear evidence that the strategy is working. As we indicated last quarter, we continue to believe that our operating expenses for the full year should be about flat. Turning to the capital ratios on Page 12, they were unchanged despite the growth in capital. This was largely driven by an increase in risk weighted assets, that\u2019s associated with the calculation for operational risk. Our estimated supplemental leverage ratio was down 10 basis points to 4.6% due to the increase in our balance sheet in the third quarter. A few points to factor into your thinking about the fourth quarter, we would expect a reduction in depositary receipt fees and there will be a limited offset in expenses on that. Seasonally higher performance fees in the fourth quarter will somewhat mitigate the DR drop-off but will cause the related expense increase. Net interest revenue is expected to be approximately flat to the third quarter. Expenses should be up sequentially driven by seasonally higher business development, legal and consulting expense as well as the higher staff expense reflecting to rise in performance fees. The effective tax rate should be around 25%-27%. And finally we intend to continue to execute on our CCAR capital plan, of course subject to market conditions. All-in-all a strong quarter, good fee growth in our two segments, good expenses control and we continue to execute on our capital plan. With that let me hand it back to Gerald. Gerald Hassell :  Alright, great, thanks. And Wendy I think we can open it up for questions now. Question: and: Operator :  Thank you. At this time, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with ISI. Gerald Hassell : Hi, Glenn? Glenn Schorr :  How are you? ISI Group :  How are you? Gerald Hassell :  Good. Glenn Schorr :  So, I guess the question has is, it\u2019s not a big move but capital ratio is down a little bit, SLR down a little bit. I wondered if you could just get a little color on that? ISI Group :  So, I guess the question has is, it\u2019s not a big move but capital ratio is down a little bit, SLR down a little bit. I wondered if you could just get a little color on that? Todd Gibbons :  Sure Glenn, this is Todd. In terms of the risk weighted asset ratios you did see a little pop in our capital. It was somewhat offset. It would have been larger but there was an OCI adjustment related to the accumulated transaction account, largely driven by the change in the dollar value over the quarter. And if you look in the denominator on the risk weighted assets there was a pretty significant increase related to operational risk. And what happened to those models are informed by external losses and there have been quite a few external losses even though they are not losses that we have incurred when others take large provisions it can inform those models and drive higher operational risk calculation. And that\u2019s what we have seen. Glenn Schorr :  And what is ops RWA as a percentage of total? ISI Group :  And what is ops RWA as a percentage of total? Todd Gibbons :  I don\u2019t think we disclose that, but it is a substantial percentage of the total for the advanced approach, it doesn\u2019t apply to the standardized approach. Glenn Schorr- ISI Group :  Okay. Todd Gibbons :  If you notice Glenn that\u2019s why you will see the standardized approach actually increase. Glenn Schorr :  Yes, yes I got it. Okay, you said limit it to one. I appreciate it. ISI Group :  Yes, yes I got it. Okay, you said limit it to one. I appreciate it. Todd Gibbons :  Thanks Glenn. Glenn Schorr :  Thanks. ISI Group :  Thanks. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin :  Hi, good morning. Todd I was wondering if you could expand a little bit upon the pushes and pulls within NII as it relates to LCR the final rules. You addressed the commentary about extending placements and charging for the deposits. But just on LCR and just how much more you need to go. And then how you will be adjusting to the final rules? Thanks. Jefferies:  Hi, good morning. Todd I was wondering if you could expand a little bit upon the pushes and pulls within NII as it relates to LCR the final rules. You addressed the commentary about extending placements and charging for the deposits. But just on LCR and just how much more you need to go. And then how you will be adjusting to the final rules? Thanks. Todd Gibbons :  Sure. As you know we got the final rules earlier in the September. And they were a little more favorable for the treatment of operational deposits. And they are below top on Muni assets for example. So we look well positioned our estimates right now on these our estimates and obviously we -- it is easy to compute the high quality liquid assets, it\u2019s still fairly difficult to compute the actual denominator. But our estimates are that we are well in excess of the 80% that we need to be on January 1st. Given that we still are looking to do a little restructuring and some of that you might know in what we did this quarter the municipal was down a little bit. That\u2019s still open for discussion. There is a possibility that that position on municipals could change. And agencies, treasuries and some severance we increased as we brought down some of our placements. We are actually kind of -- we are going to give a lot of detail on this on the Investor Day. But I think the good news is we are meeting the standard. We are well positioned to meet the future standard. And it\u2019s not having a dramatic change in our portfolio or in our estimates around our net interest income. Ken Usdin : Okay, thank you Todd. Jefferies: Okay, thank you Todd. Todd Gibbons.:  Thanks Ken. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck :  Hi, good morning. Morgan Stanley :  Hi, good morning. Todd Gibbons :  Good morning. Betsy Graseck :  So, I just wanted to understand the methodology and process for charging for deposits over there in Europe. Just wanted to make sure I understood how you were doing that is it a one side that\u2019s all is it how you\u2019re dealing with how people paying you via soft dollars, if you could just give us a little color there? Morgan Stanley :  So, I just wanted to understand the methodology and process for charging for deposits over there in Europe. Just wanted to make sure I understood how you were doing that is it a one side that\u2019s all is it how you\u2019re dealing with how people paying you via soft dollars, if you could just give us a little color there? Gerald Hassell : Betsy, why don\u2019t I and Brian Shea address that, so Brian? Brian Shea : Hi, Betsy, generally, what we\u2019re doing is essentially passing through the 20 basis point fee that we\u2019re absorbing from the European Central Bank clients understand that we are actually not initiating this but actually passing through the fee that we\u2019re absorbing. We\u2019re working collaboratively with our clients to help them manage their cash in a way that reduces their exposure to that and to the extent we can find other short-term investment vehicles or off balance sheet cash management vehicles we\u2019re helping them do that to reduce their exposure to that cost. Betsy Graseck : So if you have had people leaving excess deposits as a form of paying you for services. Does that then drive some higher hard dollar fees if they\u2019re moving off of soft dollar pay? Morgan Stanley : So if you have had people leaving excess deposits as a form of paying you for services. Does that then drive some higher hard dollar fees if they\u2019re moving off of soft dollar pay? Brian Shea : Well generally with rates being so low there has really been no earnings credit on the deposits to start with. So there really isn\u2019t that issue and that hasn\u2019t been for some period of time. We\u2019re really just trying to work with the clients to make sure that they have, there is limited amount of deposits on our balance sheet that they are subjected to that cost. And so in some ways we\u2019re seeing some of our euro deposits come down not surprisingly which is good because we don\u2019t have to hold capital against that item. So we\u2019re really trying to work very collaboratively with our clients to mitigate that cost and there really hasn\u2019t been any earnings credit on the deposits to start with. Gerald Hassell : And typically that\u2019s not something that takes place much in Europe it\u2019s nowhere near like in the U.S. Betsy Graseck : Got it, so in your two weeks into it, I mean I guess the question is how much impact do you think this is likely to have on being able to shrink the balance sheet? Morgan Stanley : Got it, so in your two weeks into it, I mean I guess the question is how much impact do you think this is likely to have on being able to shrink the balance sheet? Gerald Hassell : I think the -- not a whole lot Betsy because we\u2019re seeing everybody else do it. So this is becoming a fairly common practice. We have seen and we\u2019ve indicated that we had about 15% of our total deposit base is in the euro it\u2019s denominated in euro. We\u2019ve probably seen that come down a little bit. Betsy Graseck : Alright, thank you. Morgan Stanley : Alright, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just another follow-up I guess on the balance sheet. We\u2019ve seen the deposits kind of continuing to balloon across the system for some time. Are you guys, in particular, do you guys have a slightly better sense the source of these deposits is essentially the same clients are you starting to see different mix shift within that? And I guess Todd just as a follow-up to your point on moving some of the cash and securities portfolio. Can you give us a sense of the pace at which you guys are willing to do that and does the current moving rates change that strategy for you at all? Goldman Sachs : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just another follow-up I guess on the balance sheet. We\u2019ve seen the deposits kind of continuing to balloon across the system for some time. Are you guys, in particular, do you guys have a slightly better sense the source of these deposits is essentially the same clients are you starting to see different mix shift within that? And I guess Todd just as a follow-up to your point on moving some of the cash and securities portfolio. Can you give us a sense of the pace at which you guys are willing to do that and does the current moving rates change that strategy for you at all? Gerald Hassell : Sure Alex. Why don\u2019t we start with where the deposit growth has come, I think there were some dislocations in the third quarter. And I\u2019d say there are a couple of drivers to that. I mean one of the things that you saw is that the Fed put a limitation on its total amount of reversed repo that is intended to do at quarter end so it reduced it from really no cap to 300 billion. That meant that towards the end of the quarter that there were substantial money market funds that had nowhere to place the fund. So the likely recipient of that is going to be the custodian for those money market funds. So, I think that\u2019s a little bit of a temporary distraction if you will or disruption. I think also you\u2019ve seen the large dealers take down their matchbooks which had a similar impact. And there was a particularly important period and this is, I think this is a permanent reduction but right now the impact of the reduction is ending up in the banking system and it kind of needs to I think work its way through. So we do think we\u2019ll probably see a little bit more of this before we see this cash kind of find a permanent home. In terms of your other question I think we\u2019ve made substantial. We did increased the duration of the securities portfolio in the third quarter a little bit. I think now the repositioning is going to be what we wanted to do within the H2 ally. We do have a fair amount of Central Bank deposits they\u2019re low risk they\u2019re low yield. And really the only action that you could take would be to extend duration within that portfolio if you wanted to increase the NIM. And I think we\u2019d be a little bit defensive about that. There is potential capital risk to it and I think the opportunity cost to taking on very low yielding securities at this point is pretty high. Alex Blostein : Got you, make sense. Thanks. Goldman Sachs : Got you, make sense. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning guys. So, a quick one, could you, do you see -- it just may be helpful to try to think about how much of these restructuring and litigation is environmental and how much is management action? Is it possible to break those two out or at least give us some color on how those break down? And then also why the litigation and restructuring drove up the tax rate like was there an accrual for fines are something in there. Just maybe help us understand some of that? UBS: Good morning guys. So, a quick one, could you, do you see -- it just may be helpful to try to think about how much of these restructuring and litigation is environmental and how much is management action? Is it possible to break those two out or at least give us some color on how those break down? And then also why the litigation and restructuring drove up the tax rate like was there an accrual for fines are something in there. Just maybe help us understand some of that? Todd Gibbons : There is about $60 million of restructuring expenses and $160 million of litigation expenses. When we look at the restructuring that\u2019s largely around the actions that Gerald mentioned around the markets group and we think that\u2019s going to have some long-term positives on us, for us. I would say that when we think there is appropriate actions like that to take in the future we will taken them. In terms of the litigation we apply a tax rate that\u2019s reflective of the jurisdiction related to the matter. And that\u2019s why that tax rate was relatively low and the after tax impact relatively high. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then thinking about volatility here we\u2019ve seen not only last quarter the reflected results but quarter to-date. A lot of the investment banks had walked through how the volatility we\u2019ve seen here this current quarter is not really as helpful to drive revenues. Is that, well also what you\u2019re seeing or is volatility, volatility and you\u2019re going to benefit on either side. In other words are the trends that we\u2019ve seen so far sustainable here into the fourth quarter from your perspective? UBS: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then thinking about volatility here we\u2019ve seen not only last quarter the reflected results but quarter to-date. A lot of the investment banks had walked through how the volatility we\u2019ve seen here this current quarter is not really as helpful to drive revenues. Is that, well also what you\u2019re seeing or is volatility, volatility and you\u2019re going to benefit on either side. In other words are the trends that we\u2019ve seen so far sustainable here into the fourth quarter from your perspective? Todd Gibbons : Yes just a quick comment on that some level volatility is generally as we said it is helpful to most market participants. That being said, with more and more going to electronic trading and more and more within time spreads and more and more within a very, very, very narrow range, the volatility benefits that we\u2019ve all experienced in the past are less, but volatility generally helps more important for us since most of our foreign exchange trading is really on the backs of our servicing businesses. It\u2019s more important for us to capture volumes. And so we\u2019re a volume driven shop and that\u2019s why we feel pretty good about the level of volumes increases on our FX electronic platforms associated with our investment services businesses. So generally it helps but it\u2019s not nearly as impactful as it once was. Gerald Hassell : And I would add to that, the volatility we look for primarily since we\u2019re not a big fixed income or equity trading shop it\u2019s really around the FX, our FX business is related to FX. And we do print a volatility index number that I wouldn\u2019t say it is perfectly correlated but it\u2019s correlated to what we\u2019re looking at and you can see in the third quarter versus the second quarter it\u2019s basically flat down substantially from last year but basically flat, so recent events have tended to move that a little bit. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks for the color.  UBS: Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : First, just a clarification, the new asset manager that you bought Cutwater Asset Management you said they\u2019ll be working with Insight. Will that be a new investment management boutique or it will be folded in to an existing one? CLSA: First, just a clarification, the new asset manager that you bought Cutwater Asset Management you said they\u2019ll be working with Insight. Will that be a new investment management boutique or it will be folded in to an existing one? Todd Gibbons : Mike it\u2019s going to be a new boutique as part of our own enterprise. It\u2019s Cutwater. Mike Mayo : Okay, thanks, okay. And then just my main question for the Investor Day on October 28th which I\u2019ll ask now, but I am guessing we\u2019ll get a bigger answer. If you look at investment -- in the servicing fee for this year relative to assets under custody when you look at that ratio overtime it\u2019s one of the lowest levels that it\u2019s been if you go back 10, 15 even 20 years. And that\u2019s despite additional market share by BNY Mellon especially but by all the largest players. So, why don\u2019t you have better pricing given increases in market share overtime and given all the scale benefits that you guys talk about? CLSA: Okay, thanks, okay. And then just my main question for the Investor Day on October 28th which I\u2019ll ask now, but I am guessing we\u2019ll get a bigger answer. If you look at investment -- in the servicing fee for this year relative to assets under custody when you look at that ratio overtime it\u2019s one of the lowest levels that it\u2019s been if you go back 10, 15 even 20 years. And that\u2019s despite additional market share by BNY Mellon especially but by all the largest players. So, why don\u2019t you have better pricing given increases in market share overtime and given all the scale benefits that you guys talk about? Todd Gibbons : Mike I think this quarter is a good example where we actually saw the fees rise faster than the assets under custody. So some of our other services our so called value-added services like collateral and some of the other things are starting to kick in. So, this is a good example this quarter and I can\u2019t promise that every quarter but this is a good quarter where we actually are seeing this fee increase and some other pricing discipline we\u2019re putting in place around the transactions and clients that we do business with are starting to pay off. So assets under custody were up 3%, asset servicing fees were up 6% for the quarter, so we\u2019re trying to accomplish exactly what you\u2019re suggesting. Mike Mayo : And looking ahead I guess this is a preview of October 28th the main reasons you think that might continue would be what? CLSA: And looking ahead I guess this is a preview of October 28th the main reasons you think that might continue would be what? Todd Gibbons : Well again some of the collateral services, some of the value-added propositions we\u2019re offering our clients are fee-based irrespective of assets under custody and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to drive. Mike Mayo : Okay, alright. Thank you.  CLSA: Okay, alright. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao : Good morning. I had a two part question on interest rates, as far as how you\u2019re thinking about the current reinvestment environment and what your reinvestment yields look like and I was hoping you could contrast U.S. versus Europe given the very different rate dynamics, and the second given the recent move down into 10 years and long-term rates, how should we be thinking about pension costs next year? Credit Suisse : Good morning. I had a two part question on interest rates, as far as how you\u2019re thinking about the current reinvestment environment and what your reinvestment yields look like and I was hoping you could contrast U.S. versus Europe given the very different rate dynamics, and the second given the recent move down into 10 years and long-term rates, how should we be thinking about pension costs next year? Todd Gibbons :  Sure, Ashley, a couple of things. In terms of reinvestment typically what we model is we look at the market and the forward rate curve and we estimate around that, we\u2019ll also model whether rates are just flat that they don\u2019t change. Given they are extraordinary low levels, we don\u2019t typically model them going down a lot more but we obviously do sensitize to that as well. So, when we look forward we are assuming that we will reinvest and when we show our sensitivity in our Q, we will assume that we\u2019re reinvesting at the existing market levels. In terms of the discount rate and the lower interest rates and the lower tenure, the discount rate is a corporate credit discount rate, so it's not quite as severe as the drop that should speak to in the tenure. But it is down a bit from where we saw it last year and obviously that means retention obligation would increase in the costs associated with the pension expense would also increase. We give estimates in our Annual Report and what those numbers might look like depending what that discount rate is. So you need to get a good handle around the discount rate. Ashley Serrao :  Thanks for taking the question. Credit Suisse :  Thanks for taking the question. Todd Gibbons :  Thanks, Ashley. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Adam Bedi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Adam Bedi :  Thank you and good morning. Just one question, what is your thoughts are around trends in LDI, I know there were some new outflows, last quarter inflows this quarter given some of that recent market volatility has there been anything about a rush to the exit on behalf of some clients who may have hesitated for one reason or another, how do you see it tracking versus pension plan funded status and maybe any quick color on the strategic role on the capabilities of Cutwater versus what Insight already has? Thanks.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Thank you and good morning. Just one question, what is your thoughts are around trends in LDI, I know there were some new outflows, last quarter inflows this quarter given some of that recent market volatility has there been anything about a rush to the exit on behalf of some clients who may have hesitated for one reason or another, how do you see it tracking versus pension plan funded status and maybe any quick color on the strategic role on the capabilities of Cutwater versus what Insight already has? Thanks. Todd Gibbons : Sure, Adam it is a great question. The LDI business still has very robust pipelines as mentioned broadly are looking to derisk. In fact if you remember last quarter we actually had one sizeable outflow net of that we had pretty meaningful inflows. So the business is robust, the pipelines are strong and I would tell you that it has obviously been a very big business for us in the UK specifically and around the world generally, but we see the U.S. opportunity to really continuing to expand. Your question about how are pensions thinking about in the current environment, when we saw that the tenure approached 3% yield here in the U.S. last time and the stock market was doing really well, funded status levels actually got to a point where more people were interested in it and I think the general view was rates were going to continue to move higher. There were obviously two sides to every market, but I think there was a view that maybe rates would continue to move up and the funded status would even be better in the LDI move in our pension plan might become even more attractive. This last move down I think has made people more thoughtful about looking at the opportunity to derisk their plan and to take advantage of it when it make sense to them to do it and to, we do think that people will, people who have made the decision, pension planners who have made the decision to derisk their plan will be more active in doing so as the opportunity to the exists. So, and another thing I would you just to extend that point, the skills involved in doing LDI and every plan is different. And in the UK you have an inflation component and that can be more complicated than some of the plans in the U.S. But the skills involved really are about being able to create a solution around a liability. So buying assets against a match liability that looks a lot like and is actually absolute return investing generating risk adjusted returns for clients and I would tell you that the skills there really can be to other large growth opportunities for us. One is around the retirement space for individual, so a lot of the techniques and capabilities are quite similar for creating retirement solutions for individual investors. And then also there continues to be a lot of interest both on the institutional end broader investor front, four absolute return strategies that look like these strategies. So absolute return, real return, investing that you hear a lot about is going to leverage those same capabilities. And so Cutwater brings a much deeper capability in U.S. fixed income markets. Again we have the LDI businesses in Spanish and Mellon Capital as well. But Insight as now largest LDI driver in the world continuously winning awards for the great capabilities they have being able to have the intellectual capital sharing from our Insight team with our Cutwater extended capabilities in that new boutique it really is going to position us quite well we think to continue to benefit from pension derisking trends. Adam Bedi :  Appreciate the detail. Thank you.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Appreciate the detail. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell :  Hi. Good morning, folks. Could you talk a little bit maybe expand a little bit on the collateral management business. You say you\u2019re obviously getting some traction there now, if you can opine a little bit about some of the discussions on tri-party repo in the marketplace including potential centralized clearing of that? And then if -- I don\u2019t know if there is any way to frame that contribution as we model that and that growth for you overtime. Is that something you\u2019re thinking about maybe starting to disclose in terms of the actual revenue as opposed to just the balances? I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll stop there and I\u2019ll ask the other one if you let. Deutsche Bank :  Hi. Good morning, folks. Could you talk a little bit maybe expand a little bit on the collateral management business. You say you\u2019re obviously getting some traction there now, if you can opine a little bit about some of the discussions on tri-party repo in the marketplace including potential centralized clearing of that? And then if -- I don\u2019t know if there is any way to frame that contribution as we model that and that growth for you overtime. Is that something you\u2019re thinking about maybe starting to disclose in terms of the actual revenue as opposed to just the balances? I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll stop there and I\u2019ll ask the other one if you let. Gerald Hassell : Sure. So I will start with part of that the collateral services I think we said in our commentary that the traction we\u2019re seeing is really on the optimization and the segregation side of it. We\u2019re beginning to see the early signs as equal to transformation where someone has the wrong collateral in the wrong place and also as more and more transactions are required to be collateralized all around the world there is more increasing activity. It has been slower over the last eight years than we thought it but it\u2019s now picking up pace and it is showing up in our numbers and some of our growth rates. And that\u2019s one of the contributors to solid investment services fees growth for the quarter. Tri-party repo and tri-party repo reform certainly the technology expense that we have put into that is largely behind us. We have a couple of more waves to complete but they\u2019re really very-very technical in nature. And generally as you can see our tri-party balances are going up they\u2019re probably shrinking in the U.S. and growing outside the U.S. with the others in the U.S. are getting smaller in their positions but it\u2019s being taken up by the secondary the others and the non-U.S. players. So it\u2019s a global business for us not only in tri-party but collateral services broadly. So we are actually quite encouraged with the potential growth rates of the business. Your last point or question should we give more clarity around it, that\u2019s something we\u2019re thinking about. But we will to be continued as they say Todd I don\u2019t know if you want to add? Todd Gibbons : Or Curt you want to add anything to? Kurt Woetzel : No I just maybe Brian a little color of what\u2019s maybe some of the activity that are really driving the growth and it\u2019s really the equity securities financing that is going on around the globe it\u2019s one piece of that puzzle. The other is, is that the collateralization of things like ETFs that need collateral underneath them and third is really the OTC market having to be now collateralized and segregated and we are a natural place for that to happen between two parties. And lastly we\u2019re helping the CCPs around the globe in segregation capabilities whether it be providing our technology, our knowhow or being a custodian on behalf of those of those segregation activities. So really those are the underlying drivers to the growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last year and even a little longer. Todd Gibbons : Brian, probably also worth noting that, the FSB put out a proposal this week around required minimum margins for transactions done with the banking system. At this point I don\u2019t know Curt if you want to comment on that, we don\u2019t really see that having a tremendous effect. It will take a little bit of leverage out of the market but we don\u2019t see it either as a positive or a negative at this point. Kurt Woetzel : Well, the one thing it will drive is people have got to be smarter about their collateral and how to optimize it and make sure it\u2019s in the right place to reduce the capital cost associated with the margin cost associated with it. That\u2019s where I think our technology and algorithms are great vehicle for being able to do that. And we\u2019ve always said that our benefits in the marketplace is really our technology not the margining that we do. So, if it\u2019s a standard margin across the world, we don\u2019t see any impact to us in terms of strength of our business model. We believe in technology and algorithms and solutions. Todd Gibbons : And Brian in response to the disclosure and we have components of this is in net interest income and the securities finance some portions of it\u2019s in our securities lending activities some of it\u2019s in our asset servicing fees and the tri-party itself the custodial function that we show there it\u2019s not a huge number. So this is hard for us to break out something like that. Brian Bedell : And then just maybe talk about Investor Day a little bit more deeply would help since it is a good growth area but that\u2019s helpful. And then two tiny clarifications I think Todd did you say that tax rate was 25 to 27 or did you say 27? Deutsche Bank : And then just maybe talk about Investor Day a little bit more deeply would help since it is a good growth area but that\u2019s helpful. And then two tiny clarifications I think Todd did you say that tax rate was 25 to 27 or did you say 27? Todd Gibbons : No, I meant to say 27 and I slipped 20 some and I would like it to be 25. Brian Bedell : And then just if you could confirm the corporate trust run off is it still an 18 months drag on the fee revenues? And then I just want to squeeze in one there on the money in motion on the fixed -- on the active income side Blackrock said they thought they can gain about something in the 10s billions of over about a year or so in terms of market share. Maybe Curtis if you could opine on that. Deutsche Bank : And then just if you could confirm the corporate trust run off is it still an 18 months drag on the fee revenues? And then I just want to squeeze in one there on the money in motion on the fixed -- on the active income side Blackrock said they thought they can gain about something in the 10s billions of over about a year or so in terms of market share. Maybe Curtis if you could opine on that. Curtis Arledge : We\u2019ll let you know with all of those follow-ups we\u2019re trying to restrict it to one follow-up. Brian Bedell : I am sorry, yes okay. Deutsche Bank : I am sorry, yes okay. Todd Gibbons : I think the first question was related to corporate trust I would say that that\u2019s consistent. We still -- we feel pretty confident that that\u2019s starting to slow and we\u2019ll turn over that time period. And then I will turn the other one over to Curtis. Curtis Arledge : So that there clearly money in motion as you pointed out we\u2019ve already seen it. We have both funded wins and to be funded wins as well as verbal commitments that we\u2019re seeing both in the U.S. and beginning to happen globally as well. We do think this is something that is going to play out overtime. A lot of commotion right now, but we actually think it will be sustained and do think that money in motion is always on to our benefit. I will tell you that we feel very well positioned here both because we have strong performance an array of vey deep capabilities and very importantly a tremendous amount of capacity. A lot of people who are thinking about whether they should put their own in motion are evaluating just how large any centralized investment thing can be. And so because our multi-boutique model is perfectly suited for those people who are looking for deep capabilities but not too big, so that\u2019s a big part of our focus. Brian Bedell : Thank you very much. Deutsche Bank : Thank you very much. Todd Gibbons : Thanks Brian. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeffery Elliott with Autonomous Research. Jeffery Elliott :  You mentioned the decline in large broker\u2019s matchbook, what do you think is behind that? Is it this daily reporting of the Form SLR 2052 to the Fed do you think that what has prompted them to bring down the matchbooks or do you think it\u2019s growth of assets? Autonomous Research :  You mentioned the decline in large broker\u2019s matchbook, what do you think is behind that? Is it this daily reporting of the Form SLR 2052 to the Fed do you think that what has prompted them to bring down the matchbooks or do you think it\u2019s growth of assets? Todd Gibbons : I think it\u2019s very simple. And you have said supplemental leverage ratio and cost-to-capital being applied against this, and the cost of financing has significantly increased so the cost of them to carry that matchbook is much greater than what it once was. Gerald Hassell : And Jeff the other thing I would add to that is. The leverage ratio even before you get into the SLR the leverage ratio could be a constraining factor in somebody\u2019s CCAR analysis. So that the very low yield and very low return treasury type of repo really doesn\u2019t make sense for them to continue to hold in a matchbook if it\u2019s going to put pressure on their CCAR performance. Jeffery Elliott :  And then just one quick bit of clarification, you mentioned flat expenses for the full year. What\u2019s the base we should be looking at for that, should we be taking out any of the one offs in year-to-date 2014? Autonomous Research :  And then just one quick bit of clarification, you mentioned flat expenses for the full year. What\u2019s the base we should be looking at for that, should we be taking out any of the one offs in year-to-date 2014? Todd Gibbons : Yes. The way we disclosed operating expenses it excludes M&I litigation and restructuring. So that\u2019s what I mean by flat operating expenses on a year-over-year basis. We would expect those to be flat. Jeffery Elliott : Great, thank you very much. Autonomous Research : Great, thank you very much. Todd Gibbons : Thanks Jeff. Gerald Hassell : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Todd you mentioned that you extended out the duration of the securities portfolio with the change in strategy. How far out is that duration and how far out are you willing to go with the rate environment the way it is? RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. Good morning. Todd you mentioned that you extended out the duration of the securities portfolio with the change in strategy. How far out is that duration and how far out are you willing to go with the rate environment the way it is? Todd Gibbons : Yes, not much Gerard. We are bold and we are buying two and three year types of securities. So the duration of that portfolio would have just inched up a little bit. The contraction and interest rates that we have seen on the securities that have negative convexity has probably brought that duration back to flat over the past few days actually. But where there is a huge opportunity cost for us to do that. And we don\u2019t think that getting a little bit of current income at that that kind of an opportunity cost makes a heck of a lot of a sense right now. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, thank you. And then on the operating expense side, the quarter expenses you guys have done an amenable job in keeping that down. Can you share with us from a regulatory cost standpoint, I don\u2019t know if you want to give us the dollar amount but what percentage of your operating costs would you define as regulatory related today versus three or four years ago. How much has it -- obviously it\u2019s gone up and we are just trying to frame out how much has it gone up? RBC Capital Markets : Okay, thank you. And then on the operating expense side, the quarter expenses you guys have done an amenable job in keeping that down. Can you share with us from a regulatory cost standpoint, I don\u2019t know if you want to give us the dollar amount but what percentage of your operating costs would you define as regulatory related today versus three or four years ago. How much has it -- obviously it\u2019s gone up and we are just trying to frame out how much has it gone up? Todd Gibbons :  Gerard it\u2019s a substantial number. It\u2019s hard to tease out with any real procession. Because you might have some areas for example that have got more efficient but they have had take on a lot more regulatory. So we can certainly look at projects and the costs associated with executing projects whether it\u2019s compliance with the LCR, the new BASAL standards, the resolution recovery back and so forth. When we look at some of our key functions we are seeing substantial rises. We also had indicated that specifically in our tri-party reform efforts that our cost in operating that business went up as much as $80 million for all of the broker dealer and tri-party clearance business. So we have not reported anything more specific than that but I would say it is substantial. Gerald Hassell : That $80 million is just one example for one narrow business. So you can project that across all of our businesses. And put a multiplier factor on that. And it\u2019s a big number. Gerard Cassidy : Would you guys say that regulatory costs are cresting? Obviously there has been a big ramp over the last five years. But are we near peak where they will just stabilize I know this is still just an onward and upward number? RBC Capital Markets : Would you guys say that regulatory costs are cresting? Obviously there has been a big ramp over the last five years. But are we near peak where they will just stabilize I know this is still just an onward and upward number? Todd Gibbons : Gerard the statement that we have made is we don\u2019t think that the rate of increase is increasing. So I wouldn\u2019t say that is necessarily cresting. We are still seeing we have new items coming on. You have the NSFR that we are going to eventually have to report. There is going to be more work around resolution and recovery planning so you have a number of new items that we face. We\u2019re putting some things behind us some things are still in the developmental and so there are some things that we\u2019ll probably see in the future and it is hard to project if there might be additions. So that\u2019s what we know. So it seems like our spend rate is stabilizing, the growth rates not nearly as significant as it was but it is on a bigger base. Gerard Cassidy :  Thank you, I appreciate the color. RBC Capital Markets :  Thank you, I appreciate the color. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell :  Hey. Good morning. Just a quick question on the asset management business, I mean LDI have seem some good flows. But if you look at the equity side of the equation you\u2019ve had net outflows for the last four quarters is that a performance thing or can you just kind of help us think through the flows on the equity side? Buckingham Research :  Hey. Good morning. Just a quick question on the asset management business, I mean LDI have seem some good flows. But if you look at the equity side of the equation you\u2019ve had net outflows for the last four quarters is that a performance thing or can you just kind of help us think through the flows on the equity side? Todd Gibbons :  Yes, absolutely. I think there are a couple of things going on in there. One is we absolutely saw re-bouncing, as you saw at the end of last year markets have done well, a lot of the activity there was from clients who had come to us and invested when the equity markets were at lower valuations and were taking money off the table. Through this year has been a continuation of that there had not been any significant outflow from any one place. Again we have an array of equity investment firms and each of them had experienced some level of outflow across some of their product offerings. Where performance is always going to be differentiated across our entire platform and where performance had been on the softer side close have absolutely been more in those areas. So, there is absolutely some linkage when a client is taking money out of the equity market that they think about what performance has been. So there is some linkage but it is nothing that I would say is systemic in any one place. I will tell you that where we one of the things that a number of our firms do is focus a lot on generating returns against the risk that they are taking so very focused on TARP ratio and also in managing against downside scenarios. And the last month some of the strategies that might have lagged a bit during the past year or so have actually done exceedingly well so you have the broad story. Jim Mitchell : And has it been mostly concentrated in institutional or across both retail and institutional? Buckingham Research : And has it been mostly concentrated in institutional or across both retail and institutional? Todd Gibbons : Better to the size of institutional it's much more institutional. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. Thanks. Buckingham Research : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein :  Thanks. Sorry for a follow-up here it is a quick numbers question. But Todd I just did double check on the expense comment you made I mean it looks like if you take your core number last year and you\u2019re seeing kind of the same and back into the fourth quarter you got a pretty meaningful step up closer to like a $2.9 billion run rate which is like a two, six and change you\u2019ve been doing it is a lot or what kind of over the course of the year. Is that the right way to think about it and then if so like what essentially would cause the step up in the fourth quarter? Goldman Sachs :  Thanks. Sorry for a follow-up here it is a quick numbers question. But Todd I just did double check on the expense comment you made I mean it looks like if you take your core number last year and you\u2019re seeing kind of the same and back into the fourth quarter you got a pretty meaningful step up closer to like a $2.9 billion run rate which is like a two, six and change you\u2019ve been doing it is a lot or what kind of over the course of the year. Is that the right way to think about it and then if so like what essentially would cause the step up in the fourth quarter? Todd Gibbons : That sounds a little bit high Alex, take a little sharper look at it and we are excluding M&I restructuring and litigation. Alex Blostein : Okay. So you are saying like 267 is still the number essentially for the next quarter? Goldman Sachs : Okay. So you are saying like 267 is still the number essentially for the next quarter? Todd Gibbons :   I would expect again we had indicated that we would expect it to increase from the third quarter for all the seasonal factors that I mentioned. Important for example DR revenue doesn\u2019t have a lot of expense with it, it can be likely but not all of that will be replaced with lower margin business that will be one of the drivers that you have to take into consideration. The other driver is that we have quite a few of our business development conferences and so forth in the fourth quarter that will step up and also our consulting and legal expenses we would expect to be higher in the fourth quarter. So making adjustments for those you will see them up but in aggregate for the full year, I think you\u2019ll see it flat maybe for, maybe a little bit down. Gerald Hassell :   And Alex just adding, I think we have a line item in the statements for you where the third quarter of last year was 2.682 versus the third quarter of this year 2.673 and that\u2019s why, and that\u2019s the way we look at it in terms of the core operating expense to the company was actually down slightly year-over-year and we want to try to hold expenses flat for the entire year. Alex Blostein : Got it. Alright. Thanks we can follow-up offline. Goldman Sachs : Got it. Alright. Thanks we can follow-up offline. Gerald Hassell : Okay. Thanks, Alex. Operator :  Thank you. Our final question today is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao :  Hi, guys. I just wanted to get back in, and just ask your broader bigger picture question. Just given that your influence in the fixed income markets, I was just hoping to share some color on any of the portfolio the liquidity challenges or investment options you\u2019re seeing out there today? Credit Suisse :  Hi, guys. I just wanted to get back in, and just ask your broader bigger picture question. Just given that your influence in the fixed income markets, I was just hoping to share some color on any of the portfolio the liquidity challenges or investment options you\u2019re seeing out there today? Gerald Hassell :   There is not a whole lot of investment opportunities in a very-very low interest rate environment and they are negative interest rate environment in Europe. So we can let the equity challenges are Todd sited in earlier, you look at money market funds trying to find places to invest when the dealer book is shrinking you have got to reverse repo market that has a demand much greater than the $300 billion cap. The demand was 407 billion. At the end of the third quarter I suspect the demand is going to be even higher than that in the fourth quarter, so if that sort of photonic plates working against each other the dealers the dealer books their balance sheets are shrinking by design for capital and cost purposes. And the liquidity that\u2019s in the system is even higher. So there is a lot of search going on for some plates to put the liquidity and get some yield. And it\u2019s a really hard equation right now. Curtis Arledge :  And actually it\u2019s Curtis. I would add it has been a lot of chatter about market liquidity has resulted in change in regulation, change in repo markets. And I do think that there is nervousness among market participants about the idea that if there were a rush out of asset classes that we would see limited liquidity. We saw a little bit of that I think over the past couple of weeks where markets were more volatile and there were some balances on the liquidity. One of the things that\u2019s interesting about that period is it was while interest rates were falling. And so generally the valuations and fixed income markets in aggregate we are not as stressed. I think that periods of that liquidity in a rising rate environment are the ones where a lot of scenarios get drawn out and that\u2019s actually if you sit here at BNY Mellon and you watch the entire evolution of market structure from both investment services and investment management perspective. We really do believe that the electronic platforms are being put in place, and that the all the work around collateral for all our transactions are going to occur critical. And we thing it is actually a pretty big opportunity for us to help recreate the tools of liquidity that the markets are going to need with whatever market environment we are in, so Kurt I don\u2019t know if you want to. Gerald Hassell :  Okay. Well thank you everybody for dialing in. Just again to summarize we are encouraged by our results in the third quarter. However, we strongly believe we can in fact improve our financial performance even greater than what\u2019s reflected in this quarter and we will be discussing more of that in the -- and our upside at our Investor Day later this month. So look forward to talking to you all and seeing in person at the end of the month. And just as a reminder if you have additional questions please follow-up with Izzy Dawood. So thank you very much for joining us today. Operator :  Thank you. If there are any additional questions or comments you may contact Mr. Izzy Dawood at 212-635-1850. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie Haertel : Thank you, Wendy. Good morning and welcome everyone to the BNY Mellon fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as our executive management team. The fourth quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in our discussion of results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Gerald and Todd begin their remarks, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only of today, January 23, 2015, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald? Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Valerie, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. Our performance in the quarter caps a solid year of delivering for our shareholders. Throughout 2014 we demonstrated our focus on and commitment to controlling expenses to create positive operating leverage. We were disciplined in our efforts to continue to drive profitable revenue growth. We maintained our strong capital position and executed on our capital plan. And we created value added solutions for our clients and good returns for our shareholders. So looking at the full year, earnings per share were up 5% on an adjusted basis. We generated significant positive operating leverage even while absorbing elevated regulatory compliance costs and investing in our business to support future growth. Approximately 79% of our earnings were returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. If you exclude a couple of the sizable gains that we had, our payout ratio was 94%, which is in line with our targeted payout ratio objective of 80% to 100%. And from a total shareholder return perspective, we outperformed the trust banks, the S&P 500 financials and a median of our 11 member peer group in 2014. We also achieved that same feat over a three-year period, which is really nice to see. So all in all a good year. We got a lot done. Now focusing on the fourth quarter in comparison to the same quarter a year ago, I'll provide you with some high-level overview and Todd will take you through the financial details. Earnings per share were $0.70, which included $0.12 per share primarily for a previously disclosed tax benefit net of litigation and restructuring charges. Importantly, on an adjusted EPS basis, we were up 7% year-over-year. We believe we did an excellent job in demonstrating our expense discipline and we are confident that it is sustainable. Now just as a reminder, some of the actions that we've taken include rationalizing staffing levels, insourcing application development, reducing our real estate portfolio, simplifying our operating environment and focusing on all of those little items and big items in the discretionary expense category. Now these actions are paying off as total adjusted expenses were down 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Now as we pointed out at our Investor Day conference, we are committed to EPS growth in all environments as we work through the challenges of low interest rates and increased regulatory compliance requirements, which are impacting the industry at large. Now looking at investment services, during the quarter we delivered solid growth in asset servicing, which was up 4%, clearing services was up 7% and treasury services was up 6%. Now those areas of strength more than offset the decline in issuer services, which was down 19% due to seasonality in depositary receipts and the episodic nature of that business as well as the ongoing maturation of high-value securitizations in corporate trusts. Now the good news is we are increasingly confident that we are near the inflection point for the improved revenue growth in corporate trusts. Now I should add that assets under custody or administration were up 3% to $28.5 trillion and we had $130 billion in new assets under custody and administration wins in asset servicing. Now turning to investment management and performance fees, they actually declined 2%. However, investment management was most impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar. If adjusted for currency swings these would have been up 2%. Now also impacting our business results were lower performance fees versus a strong quarter a year ago. Now assets under management increased 8% to a new record $1.71 trillion benefiting from improved equity market values and net new business. During the quarter we had a long-term inflow of $27 billion reflecting continued strength in our liability driven investment strategies and we also had short-term inflows of $5 billion. Wealth management fees were also up 5%. As you know we've been investing and expanding our wealth management sales force and entering new markets. Those efforts are starting to generate revenue, which we are very pleased to see. And we've also been working to position investment services and investment management for long-term success by focusing on several areas for growth. Within investment services collateral services is a great example. Usage of our optimization, segregation and securities financing solutions have been increasing and as a result the revenue contributions from these services have been growing very nicely. Now another example is foreign exchange where we have enhanced our platform. We are now capturing more volume as clients are increasingly utilizing our electronic trading capabilities. In investment management some of the strategic initiatives we've discussed are coming through in the results. I have already mentioned wealth management growth initiatives and now how that's beginning to generate revenues. But we've also focused on expanding distribution of our investment solutions through the intermediary channels and further accessing our Pershing platform that services broker-dealers and financial advisors. Now these are just a few examples of where we're investing in growth to leverage our strength and business synergies to further extend our competitive advantages. Turning to capital, it remains very strong even after investing in our businesses to fuel future growth. And also importantly, we repurchased 11 million shares during the quarter for $432 million. And we also delivered a strong return on tangible common equity of 16% on an adjusted basis for the quarter and 18% on the same basis for the full year. So turning to 2015, we remain confident in our ability to execute on the strategic priorities we shared with you back in October. They include driving further improvement in productivity and service quality while reducing cost and risk throughout the organization, investing in opportunities that will help us deliver innovative solutions and differentiate our service offering, achieving profitable revenue growth and maintaining a strong capital position while returning significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. And we continue to look for ways to deliver even greater value to clients and shareholders. And we've implemented processes, capabilities and organizational enhancements that are making us more efficient and effective. And we've added new executive talent to our leadership team and to our Board to complement our existing expertise that will help drive the execution of our plan. So with that, I'll turn it over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document starting with Page 6 that details our non-GAAP results for the quarter. As Gerald noted, reported EPS was $0.70. That includes the $0.12 benefit related to the tax carry-back claim. And it is also netted of litigation restructuring charges in the quarter. We had a number of items impacting our fourth quarter and our full-year results, the larger of which we've listed on Page 21. So as I go through this report, I will focus on the numbers adjusted for those items. Revenue in the fourth quarter was down approximately 3% year-over-year as strong growth in asset servicing, clearing services and treasury services was offset by lower issuer services fees and performance fees. Expenses were significantly lower year-over-year and down slightly sequentially, representing our continued expense discipline and the progress on driving efficiency and transformation. Our strong commitment to expense control resulted in us generating 232 basis points of positive operating leverage year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Income before taxes was up year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, our pretax margin increased approximately 200 basis points to 28% from 26% in the fourth quarter of '13. Return on tangible common equity remained strong at 16%. We had a modest negative impact to pretax income from a stronger U.S. dollar, that's for the whole company. It reduced, and this is in the fourth quarter, it reduced our revenue and expense each by approximately 1%. At the business unit level, the currency impact was unfavorable to investment management and slightly favorable to investment services. Our capital ratios were not affected by the currency moves. For the full year shown on Page 9, revenue declined slightly and expenses were down even more enabling us to generate 87 basis points of positive operating leverage, or 190 basis points if you exclude investment in other income and securities gains. Income before taxes was up slightly and our operating margin remained unchanged from the prior year at 28%. EPS for the full year was up 5%. Return on tangible common equity for the full year was approximately 18%. Page 10 shows the drivers of our investment management business that help explain the underlying performance. In the fourth quarter we achieved record AUM of $1.71 trillion that's up 8% year-over-year, driven by the equity market values, new business and it was partially offset by the dollar impact. During the quarter we had long-term net inflows of $27 billion and that reflected the continued strength in the liability driven fixed income and alternative investments. Short-term net inflows were also positive. They were up $5 billion. For the full year we experienced net long-term inflows of $48 billion. We had net outflows in equities in the fourth quarter and we also had them on a full-year basis. And that has been consistent with what we've seen elsewhere in the industry. Our wealth management business continues to perform well. Average loans and deposits continue to trend up nicely. Turning to Page 11, you can see our financial results for investment management. I will touch on just a few points before I move on to investment services. Performance fees were $882 million which include -- excuse me, investment management and performance fees, which includes the performance fees of $44 million. Investment management fees reflect the dollar impact, also benefited however by higher equity market values. Compared to the third quarter of 2014, our performance fees doubled from $22 million. That is a seasonal event for us. And as Gerald noted performance fees were lower versus a much stronger than average year-ago quarter. Other revenue was $7 million in the fourth quarter compared with $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $16 million in the third quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower other revenue related to hedging activity within a boutique and then also lower seed capital gains. The hedge is designed to mitigate the impact of market movements in future fee revenues. Given the substantial growth in related AUM, we would expect future revenues to more than offset the loss on the hedge. Income before taxes excluding amortization of intangible assets and the charge related to investment management funds net of incentives was 8% lower year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially. If you adjust for the other revenue and currency impact the earnings would have been up 7%. Turning to our investment services metrics on Page 12, you can see that assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $28.5 trillion. That's up 3% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Linked quarter AUC/A was also higher. Many of our other key investment services metrics show growth on a year-over-year basis. The market value of securities on loan at period end again showed strong growth, especially as compared to the fourth quarter of '13. Securities on loan were up 23% to $289 billion, largely due to higher levels of equity collateral as well as higher value of fixed income and equity securities. Average loans and deposits were both up. Our key broker-dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances also grew. All of our clearing metrics recorded solid gains with DARTS volume and average long-term mutual fund assets each showing double-digit growth. Looking at the DR program metrics you will see that we had a focus on exiting low activity programs and programs that did not meet profitability criteria. This combined with routine disclosures due to corporate actions has resulted in a net decline in the number of DR programs in our portfolio. On Page 13 you can see detailed segment reporting for investment services. The key variances are reflected in fee and other revenue in our consolidated results on page 14. Moving to that page you will see that asset servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth and net new business partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the impact of the dollar. It was also offset a little bit by new business. Clearing services fees were up 7% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Both increases were driven by higher clearance revenue reflecting higher DARTS volume. The year-over-year increase also reflects higher mutual fund and asset-based fees. Issuer service fees were down 19% year-over-year and 39% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower corporate actions and dividend fees and depositary receipts. The sequential decrease is primarily related to seasonality in depositary receipts but that was partially offset by slightly higher corporate trust fees. We are pleased to see signs that corporate trust revenue is stabilizing as expected. Treasury services fees were up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially as we saw higher payment volumes. FX and other trading was up 3% year-over-year and down slightly sequentially. For this line item you can also refer to the table at the top of Page 8 in the earnings press release to see the details I'm going to go through right now. FX revenue of $165 million was up 31% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially and that reflected higher volumes and volatility in both periods. In the fourth quarter we did see a seasonal drop in DR-related activity that offset some of the effect of the higher volatility. In other trading we had a loss of $14 million, which compared with revenue of $20 million in the year-ago quarter and a loss of $1 million sequentially. Both period comparison decreases and other trading revenue primarily reflect lower fixed income derivatives trading since we are exiting our derivative sales and trading businesses as well as losses on hedging activities within one of the investment management boutiques that I discussed earlier. Partially offsetting this was the favorable impact of interest-rate hedging activity, which was offset elsewhere in net interest revenue. Turning to the net interest revenue on Page 15 of the financial highlights, you will see that NIR on a fully taxable equivalent basis was down 7% versus the year-ago quarter and down slightly from Q3. The year-over-year decrease primarily resulted from lower asset yields and higher premium amortization on agency mortgage-backed securities. As you may recall in the fourth quarter last year a sharp rise in interest rates temporarily slowed the amortization of premium mortgage-backed securities. The year-over-year decrease also reflects lower accretion and the impact of interest-rate hedging, which is primarily offset in other trading. The decrease was partially offset by a change in the mix of assets and the higher average interest earning assets driven by higher deposits, so we did see a little bit of growth in deposits. The sequential decrease in NIR was driven by the impact of the interest-rate hedging of approximately $13 million and that is offset in the other trading revenue. In the fourth quarter we completed our plan to reduce interbank placements and increase our high-quality liquid assets in the securities portfolio to better and more efficiently comply with the evolving liquidity requirements. On page 16 you will see that non-interest expense decreased by 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Both comparisons reflect lower staff expense, lower asset-based taxes and the favorable impact of a stronger dollar. That was partially offset by higher professional, legal and other purchase service expenses. The increase in that line item was primarily related to the implementation of strategic platforms to support future revenue growth. Both comparisons also reflect the fluctuations in business development expenses which was higher quarter over quarter and lower year-over-year. Turning to capital on Page 17, capital ratios were flat. That is largely driven by an adjustment in the other comprehensive income related to pension liabilities, reflected changes in the discount rate as well as the mortality assumptions there. Our estimated supplemental leverage ratio declined by 10 basis points to 450 and that was driven by a modest increase in quarterly average total assets. One final note about the quarter, as you will see in our release our effective tax rate was 9.4% which includes the 16.5% benefit related to the previously disclosed approval of a tax carry-back claim and the impact of a consolidated investment management fund. Now a few points to factor into your thinking about the first quarter. We would expect total staff expense to increase sequentially by approximately $100 million from the fourth quarter and that's driven primarily by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense. As you recall that typically takes place in the first quarter of each year. Occupancy costs should rise by about $7.5 million related to the sale of One Wall Street as we are planning to move into our new headquarters. That will result in double rent in 2015. That will more than reverse itself in 2016 when we begin to see the quarterly benefit from consolidating our New York space. We also need to note that we are subject to the European resolution fund in 2015, although we are not certain of the actual expense that might create. We believe the impact of all of these items offset somewhat by our expense management efforts should result in expenses up around 1% to 2% in the first quarter of 2015 versus the first quarter of 2014. This is as expected and well within our Investor Day guidelines. Net interest revenue should be about at the level we saw in the third quarter. The effective tax rate should be around 26% to 27%. So to summarize we had a good quarter. Overall, we are pleased to see the results of the expense control efforts falling to the bottom line and creating significant positive operating leverage. As we look ahead we are focused on creating value for our clients and shareholders by driving organic revenue growth and by continuing to be relentless in the pursuit of additional efficiencies and the savings as we execute on the strategic plan that we discussed at Investor Day. We are also focused on maintaining our expense discipline to reduce costs and maintaining our strong capital position. With that let me hand it back to Gerald. Gerald Hassell : Great, Todd. Thanks a lot. And Wendy, I think we can open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we're ready to begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. So looking through all the disclosure I'm not sure I missed it yet, but have you disclosed what you think your TLAC ratio is and where you need to be? Todd Gibbons : Yes, we've not, Glenn. We would estimate that we're probably around 20%. We do have a fair amount of debt at the holding company, as you can see. I think the talk out there -- the ranges are 16% to 20%. At this time there is a proposal, but I don't think it's adequately defined to really go much beyond that. Glenn Schorr : And just making sure, the 20% does not exclude the buffers, which for you guys isn't as big as most, but that's another 3.5 off? Okay, the bottom line is you are in a reasonably comfortable range is the bottom line? Todd Gibbons : From what we can tell at this point. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And then I apologize, I missed all the commentary on the $14 million loss and other trading related to the fixed income trading. So one, if you could just repeat what was it specifically related to and then two, am I reading too much into -- exiting the business that should not repeat. Is the balance sheet related to that business all closed out? Just curious on where we are at in that process. Todd Gibbons : Okay, well there are really three unusual items in there Glenn. One is that the exit did and certainly on a year-over-year basis had an impact because we had pretty decent revenues there in the fourth quarter of last year, but we did incur some losses in the exit process. We could see some little impact on a go-forward basis. We wouldn't expect it to be much one way or the other. Obviously we're not going to see an increase in revenues as we exit. To answer the second question there, it has had some modest reduction in our trading assets at this point and we will continue to see that reduce going forward. So A, it was the derivatives exit. The second thing that went on in there is we had a hedge in one of our boutiques against fee revenues. That hedge actually had a loss. And those two things were partially offset by gains on our interest-rate hedging which actually was a negative to interest rates but a positive to other trading. That's where the minus $14 million came from. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate it. That's my one and one. Todd Gibbons : Okay, thanks Glenn. Gerald Hassell : Thanks Glenn. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more detail in terms of magnitude when we try to separate what the impact on investment management fees and servicing fees is from the FX translation and then the underlying growth that we don't quite see on the surface because of it. Todd Gibbons : Yes, so if you look at it, Ken, it's about probably a little bit over 1% on the overall revenue growth rate and a little bit over that on the expense rate. So that puts you you're talking around $40 million or so in the quarter. Ken Usdin : On total revenues? Todd Gibbons : Yes. And so if you really look at the drivers of the revenues in the quarter it is a combination of that and what we saw in issuer services. So issuer services was down substantially both sequentially on a year-over-year basis. That's almost all DRs. That tends to be episodic. And so last year we saw quite a few transactions that fell -- or we saw some transactions that fell into the fourth quarter. We didn't see any of that in this fourth quarter. So that is our most capital markets transactions-like business that is a little bit less predictable. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then my second question is just you guys did a really good job certainly relative to how you had talked about expenses at the third-quarter conference call and adjusting to the revenue environment here, but Gerald I was wondering if you can just take us a step further? I know expenses will be up 1% to 2% year-over-year. Are there other things that you are contemplating now from an expense control perspective that we might not have heard at Analyst Day in terms of your view of the overall revenue environment and any incremental need to just tighten things up even more? Gerald Hassell : Well Ken, it's a great question. I think that the continuous process improvement program, if you want to call it that, that we have all throughout the Company in every expense category it is really taking hold. And it is an operations, it's in technology, it's in business partners, it's in every single line item in the Company and we see further opportunities to continue to ratchet those expenses down as we get more efficient and more productive. And so that's why we are very confident that our expense control environment is very sustainable going into the future. A lot of the regulatory costs that continue to rise, the rate of rise is flowing down, so we've gotten a lot of that in the run rate. So I think we feel very good about the ability to continue to control and manage expenses into the future, certainly within the guidelines that we gave you at Investor Day. That being said, we are very cognizant that it is a very tough revenue environment. And so we are going to be even more diligent on the expense side to offset any potential slowness in the revenue side. Ken Usdin : Understood. Thanks, Gerald. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Couple quick questions on the revenue side, just a follow-up on one of Glenn's questions and thinking about the derivatives, the bond derivatives trading. That $34 million year-over-year revenue delta, is that the sort of run rate we should be looking for a headwind for the next three quarters as that rolls off, or was that comp particularly difficult? Can you give us an idea about what kind of run rate we should look to reduce? Todd Gibbons : Yes Brennan, I think that comp was a particularly difficult one. We weren't making a whole lot of money in the derivatives business. As we went through the course of the year there was probably one good quarter and it was a little bit of softness and some of the unwinding in the fourth quarter. So I think that is not something that I would factor into your model. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, what do you think drove -- FX was certainly good versus history but when we look at what State Street and Northern printed this quarter you came in comparably a little weaker. Is there something that happened in FX that prevented you from capitalizing on the environment to the same extent that competitors appear to, or can you help us maybe understand the delta there? Todd Gibbons : Sure. I think we outperformed a bit in the third quarter. That's not unusual for us because we have a lot of ADR activity in the third quarter that we don't see in the fourth quarter. And in fact we saw almost zero ADR activity in the fourth quarter, so that is probably the differentiator for us. If you look at us on a year-over-year basis we are up strongly. Brennan Hawken : Terrific, thanks very much. Todd Gibbons : Thanks Brennan Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. I don't know if I missed it, but I know you went through the SLR ratio at yearend at 4.5%. Could you just give us the plan to get to 5% and can you get there without a rate rise meaning does getting to 5% require some of the excess deposits to come out? Todd Gibbons : Yes. It would certainly be easier to get us, Betsy, if the excess deposits ran off. We think that could generate as much as 100 basis points on its own. We will have to be a little more aggressive, so the downside is if we don't see any rate movement we will probably have to generate 20 or 25 basis points or so on the way we manage deposits. We mentioned on Investor Day that one of the things that we would be doing is if we are in the 90% to 100% on our payout ratio we still get pretty significant capital retention, as you saw this year. That generates about 70 to 80 basis points by the time this gets implemented. We have a matched book that is run out of treasury that is consuming about 25 basis points or so that we could unwind. That would come with a little bit of expense, not much, we do earn a little bit on that matchbook. But that would be something that we might be able to take down. We do think that we're going to be able to deconsolidate our variable interest entities. That is another 10 basis points or so. The trading book that we have talked about, that is coming down. That is probably going to create another 10 basis points. So there is a lot of things that are underlying this that will slowly grind its way up to the 6% to 7% where we think we will be. We also have the ability to issue preferred, which would be a lower cost of capital. We haven't made a decision around that but those are the steps. We printed them in the Investor Day and we are going to move along that course. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just on the managed deposits point there, can you give us some color on how you are thinking about that especially given what is going on in Europe recently with the Swissies going to negative 75%, etcetera? Todd Gibbons : Sure. With the negative interest rates, as you know, not only in Europe but Swiss and Denmark, we are passing that impact on through charging for those deposits and we will adjust as the markets adjust. We saw a little bit of a decline in euro deposits over the course of the quarter, not much but a little. So there was -- and I'm not sure that's directly in reaction to that. But we can get more aggressive as we feel -- as we might need to be in order to charge for the use of the balance sheet. Betsy Graseck : Right. And even with you charging for the use of the balance sheet directly like that you really haven't seen that much movement in deposit as a result? Todd Gibbons : We did see some. Betsy Graseck : Some. All right. Thank you. Todd Gibbons : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi. Good morning, folks. Todd Gibbons : Hi Brian. Brian Bedell : Just a little bit more on the balance sheet. Can you talk about what you view as your excess deposits -- I'm sorry if I missed this -- the excess deposits level and trends coming into 2015 I guess in conjunction, Todd, with being able to pass through the lower central bank rates and just how you think that might play out as we move through the year? Todd Gibbons : We probably see it if we look at what happened to us mostly in dollars from the quantitative easing in the U.S., most of that came through institutional depositors so the trust banks were big recipients of that. Our estimate that that is probably in the $50 billion to $70 billion range, Brian, so if we were to see a normal drain that we would see that money go away. Brian Bedell : Consistent with what you have outlined on Investor Day still? Todd Gibbons : Yes. I don't think that has changed. Now the mechanism for the monetary policy change is still a bit uncertain, so it might have to be done through pricing. Brian Bedell : Right. Okay. As we move through 2015 you are expecting only part of that to move through, this is more of a two-to-three-year evolution, is that correct? Todd Gibbons : Well it would actually depend on the course of monetary policy. If nothing happens we wouldn't expect any of it to move. And eventually we will start to, like I had mentioned earlier, we will just start to charge more and more and drive some of the deposits away based on the cost. Gerald Hassell : Brian, it's Gerald, we're managing the company assuming that there is no rate rise and therefore both on the revenue and the expense side and the balance sheet we are really trying to make sure the expenses are in line with a slow revenue growth environment. And if we need to be more aggressive on the deposit side to make sure we achieved the capital ratios that are expected of us we will be more aggressive there, too. Brian Bedell : Okay. That's great color. And then just on a couple of revenue items, maybe just the outlook into 2015 within issuer services the DR side, it looks like the corporate trust, like you said, is beginning to inflect. So maybe what your view is on depository receipts coming into 2015 on a year-over-year basis versus 2014. And then also on the collateral service side it sounds like you are gaining good traction, in there any kind of color on revenue growth in collateral services? Gerald Hassell : Brian, why don't I ask Brian Shea to take that one? Brian Shea : Okay, hi Brian. Look, the depository receipts business, as Todd mentioned, tends to be volatile, high-margin revenue for us. And what you saw in the year-over-year comparison is we had a large corporate action activity last year and not this year. So it didn't repeat itself in the fourth quarter this year and the rest of it in the sequential quarter is really the seasonality. The third quarter tends to be a high dividend quarter. And the fourth quarter in falls off, so that is pretty typical. But overall we are still winning more than our fair share of new depository receipts assignments. I think we had a significant increase in new programs year-over-year and the net issuance in the fourth quarter was up. So I would say that while it is seasonal/cyclical we don't have any structural concerns about the DR business and we feel like the year-over-year comparison will be solid in 2015. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi. I'm looking at third quarter to fourth quarter and the expenses didn't decline quite as much as the revenue declined. So on the expense side you had a $67 million increase in professional fees and I am guessing that is somehow related to retiring one of your platforms and if so shouldn't a retiring of a platform help to reduce expenses? And on the revenue side, I hear what you are saying corporate trust is at an inflection point, you are winning more than your fair share in the DR business but the issuer services line, the revenues look like the worst since 2007, so what can you say? It seems like you are confident yet the results are down, so can you talk about the backlog? What do you think about the first quarter for that business, so just I think those two items would help with this expense to revenue relationship? Todd Gibbons : Okay, Mike. It's Todd. I'll take that question. You asked two questions, so I am not sure we will give you a follow-up here. But the first question on the quarter to quarter, so from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we typically see exactly that because there is a very sharp decline in DR revenue. And DR revenue is the cost of basically fixed associated with that. It gets offset somewhat by the increase in performance fees that we -- the seasonal increase that we see in performance fees but that comes with quite a bit of compensation expense attached to it. So that's not unexpected. Your point around us being at the lowest level since 2007, I haven't looked that up but it sounds accurate. As we have been pointed out since the crisis, corporate trust has been contracting but it has been contracting at a slower rate. It has been painful and it has been a differentiator for us. We now see and actually saw it flat to slightly up from Q3 to Q4. We actually now see corporate trust turning the tide. So rather than contracting at a 5% to 10% type of level it is actually going to be flat to showing some growth. DRs, I think Brian just gave you -- DRs tends to be a cyclical business. As you see flight to risk, that is a good thing. If you see a flight to quality it is typically not a good thing but we have been through that cycle and I don't think there is anything structurally different in that business. I think your other question was related to the increase and where did the increase in consulting and professional services and legal. We did see a sharp increase -- we do typically see a seasonal increase in the fourth quarter in that line. Some of that is in the business partner. Some of that is investment in our risk and finance systems. Most of it is related to the buildout of our platforms that we have discussed at Investor Day and then some of that is related to higher legal costs. We would expect that run rate to decline somewhat in the first quarter. Actually, it should decline substantially in the first quarter but all within the rates -- the growth rates -- that I had mentioned to you in my comments that is that I think we will be up 1% or 2%, primarily because of the acceleration we have. We are going to have a little more cost to do the acceleration of long-term incentives in the first quarter of this year than we did last year. Mike Mayo : And just the last point was the custody platform, did you actually retire a custody platform and when do you see the benefits from that and can you talk about headcount reductions in the recent quarter? Brian Shea : Mike as you know, we had three -- it's Brian Shea, we had three custody platforms. We have consolidated that down to two. We completed that over the summer by the end of the third quarter of 2014. And we're now working on consolidating the remaining two to one and we are deep into that process and that will carry us into early 2016. And as we've mentioned at Investor Day, we are in the process of simplifying our technology infrastructure overall so we have other platform consolidations under way. Overall we have retired a couple of hundred applications in the last couple of years and we have a roadmap to do more. And that is why, I think Todd and Gerald have said, we are not only managing discretionary expenses carefully, which are kind of short-term things, the transformation process that we laid out at our Investor Day includes technology simplification, insourcing, real estate and facilities actions and other actions which are long-term contributors to the structural costs \u2013 reductions, which is why we have confidence that we can sustain good expense discipline over the long term. Todd Gibbons : And Mike, I'll take the -- in terms of headcount we were able to manage headcount down for the year. As you know we took some actions in the second quarter and that helped us to do that. I think you'll see the headcount is down about 800 for the full year. That also includes the fact that we were insourcing into our technology, our application development team. So that insourcing process is now over or pretty much completed and so on a sequential basis you also saw a decline in headcount. Part of that is because we are no longer insourcing the other heads that were offsetting some of the benefit from reductions we had made elsewhere as we make ourselves a bit more efficient. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Todd Gibbons : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Great. Hey, good morning, everyone. Todd Gibbons : Hey Alex. Alex Blostein : So a couple of quick follow-ups here. So I guess on NIR as we kind of take a look at in 2015 the moves and rates we are obviously seeing this year are pretty onerous. I was just curious how you guys think about the prospects for NII into 2015 and if we do not see much move in rate until kind of the end of the year, maybe an update on where you guys are in terms of remixing the composition of the balance sheet out of cash into securities to help sustain the same level of net interest income. Todd Gibbons : Yes, our estimate for that is that we will see a little bit of growth in net interest income for the year even with this difficult backdrop. It is not great in Europe and it is not great in the US either. We have moved a fair amount of cash into the securities portfolio so it has grown by about $20 billion over the past six months or so and we expect to see some additional growth over the next few months in that as well, so we are putting more cash to work. We discussed at Investor Day how we are going to work through the HQLA, so you are seeing a continued growth in our HQLA assets. And that will I think be able to offset some of the lower rate environment. So we think the fourth quarter was a bit of an anomaly because of the way the hedging worked itself out. But we think that we are running at about 725, 730 and we should be able to see a little bit of growth to that. Alex Blostein : Got you. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then just another follow-up I guess on the DR business and understanding the seasonality and the choppiness of it, but if we take a step back, can you guys help us understand the impact of just maybe a structurally stronger dollar and maybe a little bit of weaker emerging markets on that business over the course of the cycle? So if U.S. dollar continues to strengthen does that matter for the issuance? Todd Gibbons : Yes, I think for all of our businesses if we see continued flight to quality, less transaction, less cross-border transactions, that is not good for us, Alex. It reduces volumes. It moves things into treasuries and banks rather than in the capital markets. We went to see capital market activity. Where that is displayed somewhat is in the ADR business. The ADR business has a fairly large energy component to it and there's a lot of action there and that is somewhat helpful. It has actually been kind of interesting, we've seen interest in it and some growth in issuance rather than contraction. So with prices and the dollar down it is actually brought -- in some ways it has made it more attractive. Gerald Hassell : And again Alex, DRs in some ways a luck of the revenue growth is around corporate actions and episodic events. So if you see or believe there is going to be increasing either merger and acquisition activity, particularly in the energy sector, that could actually be beneficial to the business. Alex Blostein : Yes, understood. Thank you so much for the color. Todd Gibbons : Thanks Alex. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Adam Beatty : Thank you. Good morning. Question on wealth management. You're good enough to give the overall flows for the asset management business, just wondering if what you are seeing in wealth management is similar suggestive of maybe a risk off and how your clients are reacting? Are they spooked by volatility, or encouraged by what is still at least domestically a rising market year-over-year? Thanks. Curtis Arledge : Hi, it's Curtis. Adam, how are you doing? Adam Beatty : Hi Curtis. Curtis Arledge : Our wealth management experience has been that low rates have had an impact on the amount of income that clients are getting from their portfolios. And some clients are absolutely looking for ways to increase the overall return on their portfolios but within the framework of definitely aware of the risk environment being challenging. I would tell you that we -- I think our wealth clients have generally had a view of the equity markets being reasonably positive and have not been afraid of risk in the U.S. equity markets generally. But as you think about expanding portfolios and making them were global, some of the things that they are reading and hearing about they have definitely taken a bent to be biased away from it. So again, it's hard to describe an entire client base all in one answer, but generally I would say that there definitely is still sensitivity about volatility in markets in those portfolios overall. Adam Beatty : But a search for income too, yes? Curtis Arledge : The search for income is real and it's one of the great things about the business we have is the breadth of clients that we are dealing with. As rates are falling there continues to be -- income continues to be the thing that people are increasing their search for whether they are sovereign wealth funds or wealth clients or any other array of our client base. Gerald Hassell : And Adam, just as a reminder as a business, it's a business -- it's a terrific business. We like it a lot. The fees are growing nicely. Loans are up. Deposits are up. We are utilizing the Pershing platform and the advisory network to source business. It's a terrific business and that's why we're investing in it. So it's very good margins, very good growth rates on a relative basis and while the clients may have different investment strategies and concerns, as a business overall it is very attractive. Adam Beatty : Agreed. Thanks for a much. And then just a quick follow-up on collateral management and where that stands; is it living up to your expectations so far? As regulations get layered on, are clients kind of holding off to a steady-state or are they trying to get out in front of it? Just where you see that and what inning you are in right now? Thanks. Gerald Hassell : I think I will have Kurt Woetzel answer that, who is running our markets group now. Kurt Woetzel : Hey Adam. So great question. The business still is performing as we outlined in the Investor Day. We are actually at all-time highs in our balances in our program. It is really being driven by three factors. One is equity financing is still a strong business in the sell side; secondly, as you pointed out a little about regulation, regulation continues to drive the fact that synthetic structures need to be collateralized; and the third component of that really is that the OTC derivatives market is now a market that you need to segregate, if you will, the initial margin and we're the likely place for that to occur. So those factors really continue to drive the business. And I would say a fourth component -- again, this goes back to regulation -- is that there is a shifting of the sell side's books around to places that may be more efficient from a capital structure standpoint. That shifting is also playing well into our global program as we have a program that's very much global in nature and allows us to take advantage of where that shifting may happen. Adam Beatty : So not just collateral but capital efficiency? Kurt Woetzel : That is correct. Adam Beatty : Excellent. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Gerald Hassell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao : Good morning. Sorry to come back to DR activity but I thought in your prepared remarks you said that you were proactively exiting certain portfolios that didn't meet your profitability thresholds. I was wondering if you could size that and if both on the revenue side and also the expense benefit? Gerald Hassell : Yes Ashley, that's why we point out to the number of programs. It's really not very material on either the revenue or the expense side. It is just the fact that we are having to carry the positions and actually have some staff or people looking at them. It's really not material to the overall business. We are generally just focused on the profitable business and making sure we are applying the best resources to the prophet end of it. So I wouldn't look at it as a material event for DRs. Ashley Serrao : Okay. Todd Gibbons : And Ashley, this is Todd. Just one other comment. We've struggled to find a metric that is helpful to project where you might be able to expect performance to be because it just is so episodic. But ultimately if you look at issuance and cancellations and you kind of look at the number of programs you've got, that is some basis but it's not greatly correlated to revenue. Ashley Serrao : Okay. I think just one quick one on expenses. So what is your outlook for pension expense next year -- this year, I mean? Todd Gibbons : We do expect pension expenses. We had talked about on Investor Day to increase could be by as much as $60 million or so. And in directions that I give you around the expense increased for the first quarter that would reflect that as well. Ashley Serrao : Okay. Thank you. Todd Gibbons : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Gerald and Todd. Gerald Hassell : Hi Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Question on the strength of the U.S. dollar. Is it right to assume obviously it's a negative drag on revenue but you get the positive benefit on expenses, so the net of it is it is not a negative for the bottom line? And if that assumption is accurate, is there any environment of the dollar going forward by strengthening even further as it has since the first of the year that concerns you? Gerald Hassell : Well your first statement is pretty accurate. Net, net it really didn't have a tremendous bottom-line impact because as you suggest, the strengthening of the dollar had negative impact on revenues and positive impact on expense. So the net, net was pretty marginal for the Company broadly but the further strengthening, Todd, that's you. Todd Gibbons : So almost all of the impact from the dollar took place in the fourth quarter. When we talk about the impact on revenues and expenses, so when you look at the full year it is about the same -- not exactly -- but it is about the same number. So we talked about a 1% move and for the fourth quarter so you can figure it is not too meaningful for the full year. I guess there is a correlation to the strengthening of the dollar as a flight to quality and less transactions, something I had mentioned on one of the earlier questions. That would be my concern. My concern is that there is less issuance, less cross-border transactions other than flight to something like U.S. treasuries. That's not great for our business model, if that were to persist. Gerald Hassell : And in this strengthening is it primarily against the euro that you are referring to, or is it a basket of currencies? Todd Gibbons : I would say it's a basket of currencies. One offset to that, Gerard, is this is coming with quite a bit of volatility and volatility has always been healthy for us. So we are seeing the benefits of that in the first quarter. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then as a follow-up, Gerald, you mentioned in your opening remarks about the inflection point for improved revenues in the corporate services area, can you share with us some of the improvement -- what type of products are doing better now? What are some of the actual numbers that you are seeing that gives you that comfort to say that it's working? Gerald Hassell : Yes sure. In corporate trust, as you know, we've suffered the last few years from the high-value securitization has been rolling off, that is coming closer to an end so that is one step in the process. Secondly, we are seeing new issuance. With low interest rates you are seeing traditional new issues on the debt side. We have seen growth in the CLO marketplace again. We are not seeing as much traditional securitizations although some asset-backed securitizations are starting to reemerge, plain vanilla ones. So we are starting to see that, we are getting our fair share. I will say that for a good part of 2014 with the rumored sale of corporate trust in the marketplace we were not getting as much revenue as we would like. Now that that is over and done with I think people realize that corporate trust is a key component of our business and we are back in the growth mode. So I feel pretty good about both the new issuance market, the decline in the old business and us being able to get back into business is giving us the feeling that we are at that inflection point. And I would say Europe continues to see more debt issuance and as bank balance sheets can't support whatever development occurs, and bank balance sheets have to come down, the securitization market is the place to go. So all of those factors are giving us a lot more confidence that we are reaching that inflection point sooner than we perhaps said to you earlier in the year -- earlier last year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein. Luke Montgomery : Good morning. Thanks. So just a quick question on the money market fee waivers. I think you said the impact is roughly $0.06 to $0.07 per quarter split 50-50 between asset management and clearing? So maybe an update on those estimates. And then do you calculate that against the contractual rate or some effective rate before you start weighting fees? And along with that has there been any change to your thinking about possible competitive pressures as rates rise and you try to recapture those fees? Todd Gibbons : Why don't I take some of this, and then I'll ask Curtis to fill in some of the other color. So the net relationship it is not quite 50-50 between investment services and investment management. It's a little bit more in investment services, Luke. In the year-over-year and the sequential it really hasn't changed. We have been running at about the same rate, so we have indicated the net income hit to us is about $0.06 to $0.07. What's going to happen competitively from here, I think Curtis, maybe you can answer? Curtis Arledge : Yes, I will make a couple of comments and then I know Brian Shea also has the view from all the business at Pershing and across investment services as well. We have talked about this a lot. There is no question that there are actually are now lower fee money market funds in the market and they are typically delinked from the intermediaries and the sources of a lot of the cash. So remember a lot of money market fund assets actually are connected to client accounts where there are significant other services being provided and distribution fees are a component of the overall fees that are earned in the money market fund business. So a lot of these products that exist now with lower fees actually don't gather assets in any significant way as a percentage of market share. So I completely understand your question. We are in a world where passive products and lower fee products and asset management across many asset classes are growing in more the norm, so the question makes sense. But I do think that understanding the distribution and the relationships with distribution partners to gather assets is a really important component of this. Brian, I don't know if you would add anything to that? Brian Shea : I would add, we still see significant cash balances in money market funds and FDIC in short sweeps-type products. So I think particularly in the fourth quarter there was a little increase in cash management balances on the Pershing platform, for example. Having said that, as Gerald mentioned, we are running the business as if the rates aren't going to rise. But we do think eventually there will be some increase in short-term rates which will help restore yield and fees in the money market fund business. So I guess my one comment -- summary, is the fundamental agreements and structures of the arrangements have not really changed between the money market providers and the distribution platforms. And so my expectation, which is not 100% necessarily right, but it's my expectation is that since the fundamental structure hasn't changed and everyone has shared in the fee waivers on the way down that I think you'll see a sharing of the restoration of fees and yields on the way up. And so we feel pretty good about -- that we will have some improvement as rates rise. Luke Montgomery : Great, thanks. Very helpful. I think I'm going to leave it there. Gerald Hassell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Hi. Good morning. The shift within the investment management business towards liability driven investment continues for another quarter. So could you discuss as that mix shift takes place how it impacts profitability, how the profitability of LDI compares with the other major elements of AUM on the investment management side? Curtis Arledge : Yes, hi Geoff, it's Curtis Arledge. So first of all let me tell you that one of the things that is happening -- one of the most significant trends that is happening in the investment landscape is the de-risking of pension plans globally. And so the growth of our LDI business has a lot to do with the fact that pensions -- changes in accounting, substantially lower tolerance for pension surplus volatility has caused pension plans, again on a global basis, to look to de-risk and there are cases where they are hedging that through LDI strategies. And actually as you may have seen, there have been an increasing number of pension risk transfer transactions where pension plans have actually purchased risk insurance and effectively eliminated their pension risk from a market perspective. And that is a major trend that BNY Mellon was very early on playing a pretty important role in, Insight specifically an investment firm that was acquired several years ago is a market leader there. We have other LDI products at Standish and Mellon Capital and really work closely with pensions globally on this. I like the way you asked the question about the profitability. It's a very profitable business. Sometimes in the marketplace people use the fee and the word fee and the word margin interchangeably. The fees are generally lower but the margins are attractive. It's a great business. Also in the fact that you are not just providing a product to a client, you are actually evaluating their entire asset liability framework and truly the word solution that gets used too much I think in the marketplace. You do help them with the overall portfolio solution. So for the portion of their portfolio that they don't hedge you still have to help them think about how that should be invested and that has actually led to follow-on capabilities that we have being used by those clients. And so it has been a great springboard into other businesses with those clients. So it's a very large trend. As you are seeing with falling rates, pensions are once again experiencing falling funding ratios. Funding ratios had gotten into the mid-90s. They are kind of back into the high 80s, sort of on average. And it is just continuing to be one of the things that private corporate plans are very focused on and increasingly public plans also. Geoffrey Elliott : So if we think about it as basis point fees then it is lower than some of the other products. But if you kind of look at the overall profitability of the relationship it's something you think is very attractive? Curtis Arledge : Yes, it's very attractive. Again, the fees per AUM are lower. The AUM is quite large, generally. We are talking about some clients will actually hedge the majority of their plan and then again it also leads to a broader relationship. I will tell you that some of the -- some clients will pay a slightly higher fee and others want to pay a lower fee and have a performance element to it, and some of our performance fees actually come from that. So the management fee is not always the entire fee. You have to look at the total fee dynamic. Gerald Hassell : And it is a scale business, so therefore as a business it is a very nice one and it's growing very healthy. And so we like it a lot and the team does a fantastic job in servicing our clients. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. Thank you very much. Gerald Hassell : Okay. Well thank you very much, everyone, for dialing in to our call. If you have any further questions, please give Valerie Haertel a call and we look forward to catching up with you real soon. Take care, everybody. Operator : Thank you. If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.",

And welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded, and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie Haertel : Thank you, Wendy. Good morning. And welcome everyone to the BNY Mellon first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as our executive management team. Our first quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in a discussion of our results and can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in the documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements on this call speak only as of today, April 22, 2015, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald? Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Valerie, and welcome everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. As you can see, we are achieving the results consistent with the goals that we shared on Investor Day. For the first quarter, earnings per share were $0.67, which was up 18% year-over-year. Now focusing on our year-over-year comparisons on an adjusted basis, total revenue was up 4%, total expenses were down 2%, so we generated more than 500 basis points of positive operating leverage. Now the stronger U.S. dollar reduced both our revenue and expenses, but had a limited effect on net income, and Todd will cover that more in a moment. Our return on tangible common equity in the quarter was 20%. Now we also returned significant value to our shareholder in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Simply put, we are executing against our strategic priorities and it\u2019s showing up in our numbers. Let me remind you of what those priorities are and how we are doing against them. Now our first priority is driving revenue growth. During the quarter, revenue in Investment Services benefited from continued growth in both clearing and Global Collateral Services. As we have been saying, we are investing in both of these areas to deliver enhanced capabilities to our clients. Across Investment Services and in Asset Servicing in particular, we have been quite targeted about the business we are taking on, we are just going aftermarket shares. We are focusing on deepening our client relationships, delivering the highest value to our clients and growing profitably, and I think our results are showing just that. And you also recall that late last year we created the Markets Group to bring together existing capabilities from a number of different areas. We have been repositioning the business by exiting various activities that no longer fit our strategy, while investing in foreign, securities lending, collateral management solutions for our clients. Now these initiatives are already improving our performance and reducing our costs. Now for example, our enhanced electronic foreign exchange platforms are capturing more client driven volumes and when volatility increases as we saw in the first quarter, we clearly benefit. But the Markets Group had stronger foreign exchange results, stronger collateral management and securities financing activity, while simultaneously existing derivatives divisions and reducing the capital and costs associated with it. Good overall results that helped improve the company\u2019s operating margin. Turning to Investment Management, to further diversify our assets under management, we are building out our retail distribution capabilities, and investing and expanding our Wealth Management platform. The inflows from these retail distribution initiatives are in fact improving, but not yet at the point of being able to offset the active institutional equity outflows that we and the entire industry have been experiencing. Now after quarter end we reached an agreement to sell our Meriten boutique, which is our German based boutique. This is part of our business portfolio review process to identify opportunities to better redevelop our capital. The sale will allow us to focus on those boutiques with global scale that most benefit from being part of BNY Mellon and where we see the greatest growth opportunities. And we expect the sale will close at the end of the second quarter and our Investment Management operating margin should improve with this divestiture. On the Investment performance front, during the quarter we strengthen our capabilities and they were recognized through two rankings. In the first quarter as a testament with continued growth and success, the Dreyfus/Standish Global Fixed Income Fund hit the number 1 ranking in the World Bond category for long-term investors and has been consistently a top performer. Our Wealth Management business was named the 2015 top National Private Asset Manager and top Private Bank Offering for Family Offices by the Family Wealth Report. Now our second priority is executing on our business improvement processes, where we have been taking actions from top to bottom, transforming our company through our continues improvement process, it is reducing structural costs and risks, and improving client productivity and service quality. Now let me share some examples. We are simplifying and automating our global processes. We are continuing to optimize and streamline our technology infrastructure, particularly in Asset Servicing, leveraging a common architecture to reduce our costs and increase agility, so we are delivering new solutions to our clients even faster. We mentioned last week that we are succeeding and reducing our annual infrastructure spending and that share on trend continued in the first quarter. Now we are also shrinking our real estate portfolio in consolidating locations. Now we have been able to accelerate some of our efforts, which allowed us to come in better than expected in our net occupancy expense line. Now also as part of our business improvement process, we are improving our return on technology investment. Today, we have best-of-breed applications in most of our important business activities, such as tri-party, clearing, payments, settlements and collateral management. Our technology is well-regarded by industry professionals and we are particularly proud for our most recent acknowledge. Now one of which was the Anita Borg Institute recently named us as a top company for women technologists for achieving the highest overall score for all companies evaluated. Now this recognition helps us attract and retain top talent in the industry. Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. The results of the 2015 CCAR demonstrated that under severally adverse scenario, our projected minimum Tier 1 common ratio and our common equity Tier 1 ratio under stress were the most resilient among all the 14 advanced approached bank holding companies. So we are well-positioned for all stress scenarios and feel confident that we can continue to execute on our capital plans going forward. Now we also fully recognize the importance of our organization to the financial marketplace and that our reputation is in assets that we must uphold everyday. To further protect and enhance our safety and soundness, we are investing and focusing on compliance risk management and control functions. We have recently resolved some very important issues on that front and the actions we have taken will significantly reduce the probability of future issues. Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying our capital effectively. So during the quarter we repurchased 10.3 million shares for $400 million. And our capital plan calls for the repurchase of up to $3.1 billion of common stock over five-quarter period. And finally, our fifth priority is to attract and retain top talent. We have been executing against an integrated talent management strategy across the entire company and have been focused on developing talent from within, as well as infusing expertise with key strategic hires in areas where we benefit from new prospectus and capabilities. We recently promoted several individuals identified through our talent management process. The greater responsibility, including our newly formed BNY Mellon Technology Solutions Group, Global Fund Accounting, Middle Office Solutions and our European bank. Additionally, we added key external talents, including our new Chief Auditor and a new Board member was our fourth new director in less than year. Fresh perspectives, ideas and the right team composition make us stronger. So, in summary, we are executing against our priorities and firmly believer we are on track to achieve the earnings, expense and operating leverage goals we outlined for you on Investor Day. So, with that, let me turn it over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document and start with page six that details our non-GAAP operating results for the quarter. As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.67, that\u2019s up 18% versus the year ago. Revenue in the first quarter was up approximately 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, reflecting growth across all of our key businesses. We\u2019ve particularly strengthened asset servicing, clearing services and foreign exchange. Expenses were down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially as the business improvement process is helping to increase efficiency and reduce our cost. Our ability to drive revenue growth and control expenses resulted in a little more than 500 basis points of positive operating leverage year-over-year. Now, let me point out that we\u2019ve estimated that the stronger U.S. dollar reduced our revenue by approximately 200 basis points and reduced our expenses by approximately 300 basis points and had a slightly negative impact on total net income. Business most impacted was Investment Management while currency had lesser impact on our investment services businesses net results. We\u2019ve added new foreign exchange metrics on page six of the new release that\u2019s kind of help you capture the impact of the two currencies. If you look at that, you will see that the pound was down approximately 9% year-over-year and euro was down 18%. So I\u2019ll discuss briefly the estimated impact to each of our business unit as I cover the segment results. Income before taxes was up 16% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our pre-tax margin increased approximately 300 basis points to 30%, that\u2019s up from 27% in the first quarter of 2014. Return on tangible common equity was 20%. Page seven shows the drivers of our Investment Management business that help explain our underlying performance. We had 7% year-over-year AUM growth and $17 billion of new net inflows during the quarter. You\u2019ll also note that we experienced net outflows in equities in the quarter while our LDI business continued its rapid growth. Our Wealth Management business also is performing well benefiting from our investments and promoting our brand in the expansion of our sales for us. Average loans and deposits continue to trend up. Turning to page eight, you can see our financial results for Investment Management. As I previously noted, Investment Management was most impacted by currency translation since we have a large number of our boutiques outside of U.S. and results in about 42% of our revenue actually being non-U.S. First quarter Investment Management performance fees were $850 million. Investment Management fees were up 1% year-over-year or 7% on constant currency basis, reflecting the higher equity market values, the impact of the Cutwater acquisition and strategic initiatives. We had a performance fees of $15 million that compares to $20 million in the year ago quarter. Other revenue was $47 million in the first quarter, up from $16 million in the first quarter of last year and $7 million in the fourth quarter. Both increases primarily reflect higher seed capital gains. The sequential increase also reflects reduced losses on hedging activities within one of the boutiques. Net interest revenue increased 6% year-over-year and 7% sequentially reflecting the higher loan and deposit levels mostly at the private bank. Revenue growth on a year-over-year basis was up 4% in Investment Management but adjusted for the currency translation we estimated, it would have been up about 9%. Earnings were also negatively impacted. Income before taxes excluding amortization and tangible assets was up 6% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Turning to our Investment Services metrics on page nine, you can see that assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $28.5 trillion, that\u2019s up 2% year-over-year and that\u2019s really driven by higher market values, net new business and partially offset by the stronger U.S. dollar. Linked quarter AUC/A was flat, adjusted for currency effects, year-over-year growth would have been roughly 5%. The market value of securities on loan at period end showed strong growth on a year-over-year basis. Securities on loan were up 10%, they are now at $291 billion and that\u2019s due to the expansion of the receipt of securities\u2019 potential collateral as well as the impact of new clients joining our lending program and existing clients increasing their lending activity. Our average loans and deposits were both up significantly here as well. The key broker-dealer metric of tri-party repo balances grew 9%, all of our clearing metrics recorded pretty good gains with DARTS volumes and average long-term mutual fund assets, each showing double-digit growth. Moving onto Depository Receipt metric, we\u2019ve had a focus on exiting some low activity programs, the ones that are at the low end of our client base as well as programs that do not meet our profitability criteria. This continued with the routine closure of programs due to corporate actions has resulted in a net decline in the number of sponsored DR programs in the portfolio. On page 10, you can see detailed segment reporting for Investment Services. The key variances are reflected in fee and other revenue on our consolidated results on page 11. So let\u2019s move to that page. We will see that asset seed servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects net new business largely driven by global collateral services and securities lending as well as the increase in market values. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher client expense reimbursements and higher securities lending revenue and global collateral services fees, both increases were partially offset by the stronger dollar. Clearing fees were up 6% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The increase from the first quarter \u201814 was primarily driven by higher mutual fund and asset based fees and higher clearance revenue driven by higher DARTS volume. The sequential decrease primarily reflects fewer trading days in the first quarter. Issuer service fees were up 1% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. Both increases reflect higher corporate actions in DRs. Additionally, Corporate Trust fees seem to stabilize. Treasury services fees were up 1% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. The sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonally lower payment volumes. FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 68% year-over-year, that\u2019s up 52% sequentially. For this line item, you can also refer to the table at the top of page eight in the news release. See the details I\u2019m discussing. FX revenue of $217 million was up 67% year-over-year, that\u2019s 32% sequentially, reflecting higher volumes and volatility as well as DR related activity. Other trading revenue was $12 million. That compares with revenue of $6 million in the year ago quarter and the loss of $14 million in the fourth quarter. Both increases reflect higher fixed income trading revenues. The sequential increase also reflects reduced losses from the hedging activity by one of our investment boutiques. Investment and other income were $63 million, with $39 million lower year-over-year and that was driven by lower leasing gains. One final impact on the currency impact on our Investment Services business while less impact than we see at Investment Management. We estimate that both revenues and expenses would have been up roughly 2% on a constant currency basis, would have been up by an additional 2% on a constant currency basis. Pre-tax income was not meaningfully impacted. Turning to net interest revenue on page 12 of the financial highlights, you will see that NIR on a fully tax equivalent basis was unchanged versus the year ago quarter and up 2% from the fourth quarter. Year-over-year the increase in deposits drove growth in our securities portfolio and offset the impact of lower yields. The sequential improvement reflects the benefit of putting more cash to work as you can see in loans and securities which also increased our margin for the first time in years. The net interest margin for the quarter was 97 basis points, 8 lower than the year ago and 6 from the sequential quarter. On page 13, you will see that non-interest expense decreased by 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower expenses in all categories except the sub-custodian expense which is volume related and other expense. And I should point out that other expense include the impact of the new European Union Single Resolution Fund as we\u2019re accruing our estimated annual contribution requirement. The lower expenses primarily reflect the favorable impact of the stronger dollar and we\u2019re seeing the impact of our business improvement process here as well. Our total staff expense decreased 2% year-over-year. As you might have seen in our annual report, we elected to freeze the defined benefit plan and we replace it with a defined contribution plan. In the first quarter, we recognized that\u2019s $30 million benefit related to the curtailment of the defined benefit plan. For the full year, we expect to have a positive benefit to the DD plan itself, resulting in a $10 million net credit that include the curtailment gain we just received. In addition, we expect to have about $12 million of additional expense in the back half of the year for the participants that were formally in the defined benefit plan. As a result, you can see that you can expect benefits to increase about $30 million in the second quarter. Our headcount was 900 lower year-over-year. There was a sequential increase of 200. That reflects the onboarding of employees related to the January Cutwater acquisition, the liftout of the Deutsche Bank private equity and real estate administration business and new hires to support several largest client onboarding initiatives. The decrease in total staff expense was partially offset by higher incentives, reflecting better performance as well as a lower adjustment related to the finalization of the annual incentive awards and the impact of long-term stock award vesting for retirement eligible employees. Both of these last two items typically occur in the first quarter. As a reminder, the first quarter usually has a spike related to long-term awards and we will expect incentives to decline in the second quarter by somewhere in the vicinity of $65 million based on performance. On our last earnings call, I told you that occupancy costs should rise related to the sale of One Wall Street as we move into our new facility, which will result in double rent in 2015. This increase was not reflected in the first quarter because it was offset by the outsourcing of maintenance costs, a stronger dollar and the subletting of some vacant space. For the full year, we still expect occupancy costs to increase as we previously indicated, as we take further actions in our real estate portfolio. Turning to capital on page 14. With respect to our capital ratios this quarter, the fully phased-in common equity Tier I ratio under the Advanced Approach declined from 9.8% to 9.1% and that was driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets primarily related to operational risk. Now as we\u2019ve highlighted in previous periods, our operational rigorous model was impacted by external losses incurred by other financial institutions. This quarter, one notable external loss in the payments space go through our model and added approximately $11 billion of risk-weighted assets and therefore negatively impacted our ratio. I might want to add -- I want to add here and let you know that in the second quarter, we expect to have a benefit to our risk-weighted assets, as we believe we will be deconsolidating many of our Investment Management funds, as we intend to be an early adopter of the reason we issued consolidated accounting standard. So we effectively expect to reverse the impact of what we saw in the first quarter. Our estimated supplemental leverage ratio increased to 4.5%, as we generated capital and reduced the average balance sheet size slightly. Our estimated LCR is already over 100% and compliant with the fully phased-in requirements, which is 80% and will step up to over 100% over the next couple of years. Now, a few final notes about the quarter. As you will see in our release, our effective tax rate was 24.5% but that includes 2% benefit related to income versus variable interest entities, which if you included in line -- excuse me, if you included that in our numbers, our tax rate would be in line with the guidance of about 26%. So, I think that\u2019s the appropriate way to look at it. I will also point out that we\u2019ve increased our tax-advantaged investments, including energy credits, which are now having the effect of reducing our tax rate but also reducing our pre-tax income and therefore our operating margin. So if we were to gross up the revenue from the tax credits and report the impact on the tax equivalent basis, our pre-tax income would have been higher by about $64 million and our operating margin would have increased by approximately 120 basis points. We have elected to disclose this impact on footnote on page 25 of our news release rather than included in our financials. But we think it\u2019s important as we make these investments and you see a reduction in some of the pre-tax. Also in the earnings release on page 11 on some investment securities portfolio highlights. You will see that the net unrealized gain in our portfolio was $1.7 billion at quarter end, that\u2019s up from $1.3 billion at the end of December. During the quarter, we transferred $11.6 billion of available-for-sale securities to held-to-maturity securities and we also purchased additional held-to-maturity securities during the quarter. Our strategy is designed to reduce the volatility of our capital account from interest rate fluctuations. Now, I\u2019d like to discuss a few points to factor into your thinking about the second quarter and the years we look ahead. Net interest revenue was expected to be slightly higher in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of \u201915, as we benefit from the change in the asset mix and day count. We would expect incentives to decline in the second quarter from the first quarter as we did last year. We expect Investment Management continue to be impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar due to its non-U.S. presence while the impact in the overall company is expected to be nominal. The effective tax rate is expected to be in a range of 25% to 26%, and we anticipate proceeding with our capital plans subject to market conditions and the other factors. To summarize, we are achieving results, consistent with the goals we shared on our Investor Day, executing against our strategic priorities and on track to continue to hit our Investor Day targets. With that, let me hand it back to Gerald. Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Todd. And Wendy, I think we can open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao : Good morning. Gerald Hassell : Good morning, Ashley. Ashley Serrao : Gerald, a two-part question on headcount. One, I was hoping you could help me just reconcile your commentary from the shareholder meeting where you noted that the company look good on a revenue per employee metric, but then at the same time you reduced headcount by over a 1,000 positions over the course of last year. And two, as we think about the potential, if we do leverage technology across the franchise, why shouldn\u2019t decline in headcount continue? Gerald Hassell : Well, as you know last year, we took an increasingly aggressive action on the headcount side and were able to get some structural changes to our headcounts. We saw actually a continued positive trend in the first quarter of this year, except for the fact we\u2019ve acquired a couple pieces of business. And we\u2019ve been building out some capabilities for some new clients in certain key areas. Clearly, our goal as part of our business improvement process is to drive down the labor component of our company and use technology as the strategic asset. So, one of our goals is to get to revenue per employee up, the employee expense down and use technology as a strategic asset to get there. So clearly part of our plan is to reduce that employee headcount per revenue. Ashley Serrao : Great. And my follow-up is for Todd. On the balance sheet and reinvestment of cash, how much more run rate you have there and then can you give us a sense of the duration and reinvestment yields here? Thank you. Todd Gibbons : Sure, Ashley. Why don\u2019t we start with duration? So what we\u2019ve effectively done is we\u2019ve got about half of the duration of the portfolio or we call, half of the sensitivities of portfolio in held-to-maturity about half in the available-for-sale accounts. And the duration of the total portfolio is probably around 2.5. So we softened the volatility, dampen the volatility pretty substantially to our OCI for movements in interest rates. We still are structured to see a pretty significant benefit from a rise in interest rates. So if we wanted to in our net interest income, as well as in fee waivers and other parts of our portfolio. So if we wanted to, we could probably continue to increase the portfolio a bit. LCR is not necessarily a limiting factor here because we can increase the duration of our HQLA assets, which is effectively what we\u2019ve done here. So, I would say there is a little bit of room there actually but not a lot. Ashley Serrao : All right. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter. Gerald Hassell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research. Luke Montgomery : Morning, guys. Just another stab at the headcount question. Investor claiming that your firm has too many employees relative to comparable peers and the difference isn\u2019t explained by business mix. I think though, if you adjust for the sale gains you had last year, it looks like the comp to revenue ratio has been tracking just a couple percentage points higher than your closest peers. So maybe there is a little work to do there. You\u2019ve acknowledged the plan but I think the sensible question is whether there are underlying explanations like lower cost, offshore support or outsourcing by others that you don\u2019t do, maybe labor intensity of the businesses you had that they don\u2019t. So, I just want to give you an opportunity to speak to that. Gerald Hassell : Sure, Luke. Thanks. There is a couple of things that you should factor into your thinking on a comparable basis. One, we\u2019ve been in-sourcing our application developers where others have been either outsourcing it or moderating it. They were actually getting more capacity or less dollars in our technology application volume, sourcing those capabilities. And we\u2019ve laid out some of those numbers for you last week and in prior weeks. The second issue is we do internally transfer agency businesses, both in the U.S. and in Europe whereas our principal competitor actually does it through a joint venture or outsources it. Transfer agency services are very labor intensive and therefore, if you were to combined the outsourcing or joint venture arrangement with a competitor you\u2019d probably find a larger headcount on a percentage basis than we may experience. Last but not least, we do have things like corporate trust and clearing services, treasury services that some of our competitors do not have. They do have a labor component associated with it. But they are also good operating margin businesses. So, I think that\u2019s where the comparable basis starts to bring in a question that headcount versus revenues. That\u2019s why we are focused on a revenue per employee. And I think we compare very favorably to other institutions. Our goal is still to improve in that category and our goal is to still improve the operating leverage of our company. That\u2019s what we laid out in Investor Day, that\u2019s what we are committed to delivering. Luke Montgomery : Great. Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, I wonder if you might take a stab at breaking out employees by business or maybe consider adding some disclosures to that and in the future? Gerald Hassell : Okay. We will give it some thought. Thanks. Luke Montgomery : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Quick question on FX, pretty solid this quarter, nice bounce back from last quarter. Was DR switching to a tailwind here this quarter or was that neutral? And did some of the adjustments that you made to that business that you referenced in your prepared remarks make -- help to make that -- help to impact that revenue line here this quarter? Gerald Hassell : Yes, Todd. Todd Gibbons : Yes. You had a couple of questions there, Brennan. In terms of DRs, DRs were a little stronger in the first quarter and some of that was timing from things that we\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter. So we did get a benefit of that, and there is some FX related to corporate actions in DRs. And so we dig at a pickup there. And then some of the FX was substantial increases in volumes, which is somewhat market related as well as just trying to capture on the systems more of the volumes. And then the remainder of the pickup was market driven with some of the events in the Swiss and the higher volatility that we saw in the first quarter. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that. And then I know you referenced that you expect the asset management margins to improve on the German divestiture, but is it possible to quantify the impact to the margins there? Gerald Hassell : Yes. Curtis, do you want to? Curtis Arledge : Yes. The marine business was not a huge contributor to our overall pretax and was a large contributor to both revenues and expenses. But the strategy around our divestiture being that we really do have strong fixed income capabilities in Europe and other boutiques and the business didn\u2019t drive a significant amount of pretax such that it made sense to continue to have as much of an offering in Germany as we had there. So it\u2019s not going to be a dramatic impact on margins, but absolutely positive. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks very much. Curtis Arledge : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Great. Good morning, everyone. Gerald Hassell : Hi, Al. Alex Blostein : Todd, question for you on the balance sheet, actually couple of questions there. So your comment earlier around putting some of the excess cash to work, I was wondering if you guys could quantify that. We obviously see the mix of the balance sheet kind of moving out of the cash and cash sitting at the fed and to securities portfolio. How much I guess of the actual deposits you guys could consider moving over time? And should we I guess take that maybe the sign of confidence that you guys are starting to see some of that nonoperational cash becoming operational year-over-year, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re doing that? Todd Gibbons : Yes. I think, A, there is greater clarity or there is perfect clarity now around the -- I shouldn\u2019t call perfect. There is better clarity around the LCR, Alex, which gives us some confidence. And now the HCM account would be traded under the LCR. So we have put prudency limits around how far we would go with that. So if you can see in the quarter I think cash declined by about the size of the increase in the securities portfolio. We do have a very stable core deposit base well in excess of the amount of cash that we -- or securities that we have in the high quality liquid assets in HTM account. There is probably a little bit more room for that. I think most of what you will see us do now is work on both the assets in the non-HQLA to see if we can bump up the yields a little bit in the assets in the HQLA with the same push. But we are kind of sticking -- we are at 97 basis points in NIM. Our guidance is 95 to 102 rate environment that we try to stick with that out. So I think that\u2019s probably the best estimate of where we are going to be there. Alex Blostein : Got you. And then a follow-up on just the overall size of the balance sheet, so this is the first decline in average earning assets of the size we see from you guys in a while. I was just curious I guess where is the decline in deposits coming from, what kind of decline base is that, where is it going, just to get some better sense of the moving pieces there? Todd Gibbons : It is not. As you look at into the details out, you will see it\u2019s not in our deposit base and deposit base is about flat to up slightly, where you see it is in other borrowed funds. And occasionally, we do put securities out in repo and we will take advantage of some interest earning opportunities. There were less of them, so we bought down the balance sheet by $10 billion. That was self-induced by our treasury team. Alex Blostein : Got you. Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Gerald Hassell : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. One on just an SLR, you made a little bit of progress this quarter, just wanted to understand how much of the benefit the deconsolidation of those investments you mentioned earlier were going to have, if you could refresh our memory on that, as well as opportunity to improve maybe sooner rather than later with pref issuance? Gerald Hassell : In terms of the deconsolidation, we think it\u2019s probably in the ballpark of about 2% of the assets. So if it\u2019s 2%, we\u2019ve got a 4.5% ratio, you can kind of do the arithmetic about 9 or 10 more basis points there, Betsy. It\u2019s not a huge mover, but every little bit helps and there is -- obviously there is no cost to doing that. As we disclosed in our CCAR, we are giving some consideration to doing a preferred and preferred could be an additional, it\u2019s a cheaper source of capital obviously than common. And it maybe something that we could do on our path to compliance if we felt it was appropriate based on what we see happening to deposit base. The deposit base is relatively stable. It might be up a little bit what was since the end of quantitative easing. But I think there is going to be some shifting around and the future of the deposit base is going to be a function of how the fed actually conducts its monetary policy. Betsy Graseck : Great. Okay. And then just separately on clearing, we heard from JP that things get tougher there is possibility they might fade the clearing business. I mean, how do you think about that, how do you think about the future of clearing? Is there any efforts to potentially put clearing into a shared entity -- industry shared entity? Gerald Hassell : I will take part of it, and then I will turn it over to Brian Shea. So Betsy, as you know, we have sort of two forms of clearing businesses. One is the institutional side, who brought the dealer clearance business where we have a very significant market share. It\u2019s always been a basis for some of our tri-party collateral management capabilities that\u2019s allowed us to build our collateral management and enhance in on a global basis. So it\u2019s been a core business for us and to differentiate it for us in the marketplace. As you may know, the Federal Reserve is our client in that space is well on the reverse repo program. So we see it as an important activity. We are mindful of the fact that central clearing houses and other market participants want to utilize some of those activities, but today it\u2019s a good earner for us. We are investing in it and it\u2019s allowing us to bring to market new capabilities. And our other clearing business which is really a financial advisory solutions platform, i.e., Pershing, now we see that as a credibly strategic asset for the company growing very, very nicely, wealth managers, private banks, advisories around the world want to utilize that platform to serve the end investor. That\u2019s a strategic growth asset of our company. And Brian, you may want to add some to it? Brian Shea : I think you\u2019ve done a terrific job. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could talk about, we\u2019ve gotten to the point there it seems like we may have seen that turn in professional, legal and other services, you guys are taking care of a bunch of the litigation. And I am just wondering if you can give us a line of sight there, that\u2019s been the second biggest category, that\u2019s been a pressure on earnings for quite a while. Are we at an inflection point there? Are you at the point where you can at least feel confident that we\u2019ve kind of peaked there or starting to turn down? Gerald Hassell : Yes. I think Ken there are couple of items there. I mean, we -- a lot of our purchase services are things like data sources and information that we used to our business. Our procurement activities are actually helping us drive some of those services. We think actually it\u2019s a little bit more room there. In terms of the management consulting and some of the consulting expenses that we\u2019re incurring related to some of our major platform initiatives, those will probably be running at the rate that we\u2019re seeing now or in the ballpark, there was quite a spike in the fourth quarter. We wouldn\u2019t expect that to recur, but they could be in the same level that they are at today. Legal is a little bit early to call. It should be a piece driven with our settlement, so we might see some benefit out of that through some of our litigation defenses which also fall on that line. So I think in the short term, I look for it to stay down at this level that we saw come from -- down from in the fourth quarter. There might be some room going out, but I am not going to -- at this point I don\u2019t think I really give guidance to a big number yet. Ken Usdin : Okay. And my second question maybe one for Curtis just on the -- in the investment management business, Todd hearing your points on the effect of FX, but the growth rates even adjusted for the three individual investment management lines are somewhat subdued, meaning implies that the fee capture rates look like they are still under some pressure with your mixing still into LDI and out of act of equity. Just wondering if you can kind of shed some additional light on just continued optimization there and what should we expect thus far is the outlook for fee capture. Curtis Arledge : Yes. So fee capture when you blend assets, we have fees that are very different in each asset class. And so what we have seen is the fee capture declines really have been result of the success of our rapidly LDI business. So LDI, again the U.S. LDI and European, UK specifically LDI businesses are somewhat different. The biggest part of our LDI business is in the U.K. and Europe through Insight and they have continued to garner assets as pension plans are derisking. The business -- that business is actually quite active business as you\u2019re trying not just to manage against an interest rate liability but also an inflation liability. They earn both base fees and performance fees. So when they perform well, their fee realization is actually meaningfully higher. But again, what\u2019s happening on the total fee capture is that the declines -- we cover this at Investor Day you may remember Ken that it really had a lot to do with the fact our LDI business is growing so rapidly. But again, it\u2019s not a passive business, it\u2019s very much an active business, and much of our performance fees over the past many quarters have been from our LDI business. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thank you, guys. Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi. I have one question with three parts. At the annual meeting, new director Ed Garden said that Bank of New York is focused on being best-in-class in everything we do. So first, are you benchmarking versus best-in-class? Second, what is the best-in-class number for ROTCE and the margins for investment management and investment services? And third, when you look at best-in-class, wouldn\u2019t it be more appropriate instead of looking at revenue per employee to look at net income per employee and on that measure it seems like you rank below peer? Thanks. Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Mike. We certainly aspire to be best-in-class in everything we do. And to be recognized as the industry leader in the areas we operate in. We do metric ourselves against the variety of different institutions and a variety of different metrics to try to achieve those goals. We challenge our teams across the company to aspire to those metrics. For the public consumption we give you broad metrics. It\u2019s tough to give you every single metric that we operate in the company within. And so things like fee to expense ratio across investment services, you see continuous improvement there. The revenue per employee is admittedly a broad metric but it\u2019s an indicative metric of one other things we\u2019re trying to work towards. We look at client survey and client satisfaction surveys. We measure those that we shared with you at the shareholder meeting last week are extremely high scores. We want to get to 100%, I\u2019m not sure we will ever get there, but those are some of the things we\u2019re trying to work towards, things like straight through processing rates, accuracy rates are all things that we measure in investment services. Investment management side, we look at the investment performance of the boutiques and the asset classes versus their fee realization. So we have a lot of metrics across the company where we\u2019re aspiring to be the best to everything we do. Will we always get there? It will be a challenge to get there in every single category, but that\u2019s certainly our aspiration. Mike Mayo : All right. One follow-up then because last week you did mention the revenue per employee and after getting back to my desk, I\u2019m looking at net income per employee. It didn\u2019t look quite as good or like underperform peer. So why is revenue per employee the right metric to look at instead of net income per employee? And also, when you sell your German boutique, will that help that metric? And can you elaborate on that sale because that seems new? Gerald Hassell : Okay. Mike, whether it\u2019s revenue per employee or net income per employee, I think they are a metric. But I think the metric ultimately that you need to follow is what is happening to our operating margin and how are we performing, because if we in-source or outsource, whichever way you go is there is good reason for one company do one way versus another doing it another way. Ultimately, it\u2019s got to drop to the bottomline. And I think what you\u2019ve seen in our performance this quarter a 300 basis point increase in our operating margin is pretty substantial. And we continue to focus on driving the margin. We think the strategies ultimately will pay off. We think the in-sourcing of our application developers not only do we have the intellectual property close to our clients, which can make us the best-in-class in terms of providing technology solutions, we also have it at a lower cost because we own it. And that\u2019s being reflecting in our technology costs, which are declining. So I think that that\u2019s how ultimately you have to measure us, because it\u2019s just too hard to tell exactly what\u2019s going on with headcount and how people compute it and whether they\u2019ve got contractor in versus full time employees and so forth. In terms of Meriten, I\u2019ll turn it over to Curtis. Curtis Arledge : Yes. Thanks. One thing I would want to make sure that we highlighted that we in addition to selling Meriten, we also acquired Cutwater. There is actually a net reduction in staff as a result of that, but it\u2019s not going to meaningfully change any of the metrics that you\u2019re looking at, Mike. So that really was a strategic repositioning of our portfolio. Again, we had more fixed income capability in Europe than we felt like we needed. And we also want to grow Insight\u2019s terrific LDI capabilities in the U.S. So partnering them with an excellent firm at Cutwater really was we thought fantastic move. So I just want to make sure we capture both of those. Gerald Hassell : And I think, Meriten is part in by itself, it\u2019s not going to move the needle a lot. But as we pour over the portfolio, as we change our derivatives businesses we streamlined our capital markets activities as we exited the futures clearing margin, as we exited two corporate trusts activities in Japan and Mexico, now throw Meriten into that. As we continue to pore over what makes sense in aggregate, they\u2019re starting to move the needle. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi. Good morning, folks. Gerald Hassell : Hi. Brian Bedell : Maybe just following along that path on the actual cost saves from strategic actions. And maybe if you can just update us on the aggregate level of cost saves on a year-over-year basis that you expect from consolidating some of the back-office platforms in asset servicing like moving to the one platform in custody? Brian Shea : Yes. So Brian, this is Brian Shea. We continue to drive forward with our business improvement process, which is transforming for success. And as Gerald mentioned earlier, we\u2019re going across the board. So from a business excellence perspective, can\u2019t just talk about the business portfolio review actions, Meriten was the latest in a series. We continue to drive more leverage across the franchise in terms of enterprise team work. We\u2019re executing on a global location strategy to reposition people to lower cost locations. Lets talk about the in-sourcing of technology development, which not only improves our speeds to market and intellectual capital leverage, but it also reduces our costs and reduces our dependency on contractors and consultants. We are moving forward with the platform consolidations in the latest quarter or in the last month we completed the final stage of our corporate trust replatforming to a new -- to our target platform and that will enable us to retire another large historical legacy platform of the company. So there\u2019s a lots going on. But the key message I\u2019d say is one, we gave you a target at Investor Day. We\u2019re going to meet that target and we\u2019re on track to meet that target. And the work that we\u2019re doing is not one-time cost driven, it\u2019s sustainable continuous improvement and so we believe we can continue to drive improvement in this process so over the long-term. Todd Gibbons : And Brian, I would just add that, we\u2019ve learned the lesson of announcing a big program and then delivering on the program and unless it shows up in the operating margin and the operating leverage, it doesn\u2019t count and it\u2019s showing up in the operating leverage and the operating margins. So our margin went up by 300 basis points in the first quarter of last year. Our fee-to-expense ratio has improved in Investment Services and we produced over 500 basis points of operating leverage. Those are the facts. Curtis Arledge : And I would add to that Brian, all the actions that we\u2019re taking to streamline the organization and transformation that, Brian, just talked about make us a little simpler, a little less risky, but there are also continue to be significant regulatory requirements for us, the resolution planning, meeting some of the data requirements that are substantial. So the regulators continue to increase the bar and we need to be prepared to be able to fund those investments and some of this will drop to the bottomline and some of it will enable us to fund the increasing demands from the regulators. Brian Bedell : Great. Right. So that remains the wildcard on the regulatory front from the expense perspective its sounds like. Gerald Hassell : Yes. Brian Bedell : And then just to follow up, this might be too early to try to figure, but you talked a little bit about the NEXEN platform at the shareholder meeting. Maybe if you could -- is there a way to quantify the competitive advantage if you think you will be able to get from that from new product rollout, some of the internal sourcing that you just mentioned, say over a two or three-year period from a revenue perspective? Gerald Hassell : Yeah. I would -- I don\u2019t want to give you a specific revenue target, but I can say that, we\u2019re committed to be the investment industry technology leader, partly in-sourcing strategy that we mentioned is not just around being more cost effective, its about transferring domain business knowledge into the technology development team in a way they create the competitive advantage. NEXEN will be a visible manifestation of that to our clients. It\u2019s a sort of the next-generation technology platform that\u2019s going to allow us to connect the various applications across the various businesses and deliver more seamless and state-of-the-art intuitive platform to BNY Mellon\u2019s clients. It\u2019s going to be -- it is based on the secure cloud-based -- private cloud-based platform, which accelerates our speed to market for new capabilities and actually reduces our cost of infrastructure. It has an EPI marketplace essentially allowing seamless integration with our clients in much so will be an easier firm to do business with and integrate with from a technology perspective. It will be completely mobile in a way that we deliver. So any mobile device anywhere, anytime people will be able to connect through NEXEN. It has the equivalent of an app store, which means that we are going to be able to easily integrate third-party providers of choice into the platform. So that we reduce our clients\u2019 vendor management and integration costs, and ultimately, it will be the delivery vehicle for our big data solutions, which we are already developing delivering to clients in the area of liquidity management, collateral management, but will allow us to deliver insights to our clients. So we\u2019ll -- we are rolling this out internally in the beginning this quarter and we\u2019ll start rolling out to customers in the second half of the year for selected businesses and over the course of 2016 we will rollout more broadly to the broader client base. Hope that helps? Brian Bedell : Yeah. That\u2019s pretty color. Thank you. Gerald Hassell : Thanks Brian. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. Gerald Hassell : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : A quick question in money market land, I'm curious if you feel like you have the product offering set where you wanted to be as we transition next year and what kind of sensitivities you think you are looking at in terms of client bounce migration, prime funds, the treasury funds and what kind of fee give up and fee waiver give up that might be -- may -- that we are thinking gets recaptured that might not be based on how clients migrate? Curtis Arledge : Hey, Glenn. This is Curtis. Let me give you the view from the Investor Management perspective and then maybe, Todd or Brian, talk about it on the other side. So, first of all, you are seeing people reposition their money market offerings, as we get closer to next year\u2019s floating rate NAV for institutional prime funds and we\u2019ve actually been spending a lot of time on that as well. And so not ready to announce anything just yet, but I think, it's fair to say, that the industry will position itself for, what we do believe will be a shift in asset, there are a lot of people who currently -- institutional clients that use fixed NAV prime funds that will not be able to have them be in floating in status. So we know assets are likely to move. We continuously survey our clients and not just across investment management but the whole company. We are obviously a very large player here. And we do believe that -- between the third and 50% of the clients will shift to treasury funds. And so to answer your questions about what that means from a fee waiver perspective, I actually has -- it\u2019s very significant where interest rates are when that occurs fee waivers are more challenging in treasury funds. And so, if in October of 2016 interest rates haven\u2019t moved, there will be a negative impact from fee waivers from that activity.  One of the other thing, it is somewhat offsetting that though and you\u2019ve seen some banks begin SLR is having an impact changing their views on deposits and so we have absolutely seen hedge funds and other clients who would have left the deposits on bank balance sheets move those two money market funds. And so we are actually in the first quarter across our platform and within investment management, we saw balances remained relatively stable, the seasonality would have suggested that they would have been down somewhat. So there is a growth in money market funds occurring as a result of regulation, so there are some countervailing at play here. Todd Gibbons : Yeah. So, I think, going for the company as a whole that if interest rates were to stay at zero and you did see a movement for prime, again let\u2019s talk with, what Curtis just indicated is the movement you are seeing into treasury funds not necessarily coming from prime right now, it\u2019s coming from bank deposits. But if in the event as we -- as we move forward money market would fund reform, we would expect prime to go to more toward treasury. And that -- if interest rates stayed at zero that would be a negative for us because there is lower yield in treasury and therefore they are going to be a modest increase in fee waivers as a result of that. If interest rates normalize than the recovery track of fee waivers would be as we\u2019ve described. Glenn Schorr : Got it. Okay. I appreciate it. And then just one little catch up on occupancy cost. You mentioned that we couldn't see the double occupancy cost in first quarter. I just want to make sure they were there but they were offsetting items because I would just want to make sure we are modeling second, third and fourth quarter correctly for the...? Todd Gibbons : I\u2019d love to -- let me clarify that and make it absolutely clear. So yes, we do -- we are paying the double rent. We had a little benefit from currency translation. We also had a little benefit from our outsourcing of maintenance which falls through that occupancy expense line. And in addition, some of the costs associated with the move have not been reflected in that line. So I think the best guidance I could give we had indicated that we thought the line would be up about $30 million for the full year, it\u2019s probably best to think of it at about that amount. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Yeah. Good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the deposit discussion, obviously given leverage constraints across the industry it\u2019s sort of a difficult problem for everybody. How do we think about it long-term up -- is it more that hey we can\u2019t really tell our clients what to do because we don't want to lose relationships and push deposits down like a JPMorgan and longer term the economics with higher rates you kind of get to a crossover point where you actually earn your cost of capital on those deposits? Is that sort of the strategy that -- or is there something more proactive you can do to push down leverage and move into money markets. So just wondering if there's any kind of constraints on money markets for a lot of corporate treasures if they have a risk of being locked up for 30 days and things like that? Gerald Hassell : Well why don\u2019t I start and I\u2019ll turn it over to Todd. Well, it\u2019s a very dynamic situation. Supplemental leverage phases in and we work our way towards it. Obviously the level of the balance sheet becomes increasingly more important. We\u2019d like to earn some money on those deposits in the short run. We are watching our deposit base and our client activity. We clearly want to try to drive the deposit base towards operational deposits which are having more favorable treatment. We are educating all of our teams around the company around client activity and whether it's operational deposits or not and therefore the value associated with that. That helps us engage with our clients better and really drive better outcomes for our clients and ourselves. So it\u2019s a very dynamic situation. We are very engaged with our clients on it where we think it\u2019s appropriate as we\u2019ve done in Europe where we are charging for deposits we are but we are modeling this and watching it very carefully. Todd Gibbons : Yeah. Jim, I would just add to that, that it\u2019s hard to predict how deposits are going to move until you are clear about what the Fed monetary policy is going to be. So if they are drained in a traditional way which would be through reverse repo then we would think deposits would be -- would run off and it would be price based. Another alternative is literally just to price them. So there are going to be non-operational deposits which mean they aren\u2019t very attractive under the LCR. And I think banks will be not willing to pay a lot for them especially if they are somewhat constrained by the SLR ratio. In the event, net interest rates rise and those deposits want to stick with institutions that are very strong institutions, there will be a cross over at 60 or 70 basis points that looks pretty attractive as a return on capital even just leaving it at the Fed. So there might be a point where you probably race in for further capital just to keep the balance sheet -- keep them on the balance sheet to make it very -- actually a zero risk return but a decent return on regulatory capital. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Thanks for that. That's very helpful. And then may be a quickie on the net share count. I think you -- last year's buyback, I think net of employee stock issue was about, I guess, at 35%, 40% dilution. Is that the way to think about it going forward or should we think about the employee issuance is more of a fixed cost and as the buyback increases the net share count reduction improves? Todd Gibbons : It\u2019s relatively stable. So you\u2019ll see a little bit of a higher one as the buyback increases but not a lot. So you should still I think, think in the same terms that you just mentioned that there will be share issuance with the employees. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Todd Gibbons : That\u2019s kind of a ballpark. Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Adam Beatty : Thank you and good morning. A couple of questions on Investment Management, specifically on the multi-affiliate model. I appreciate your comments so far on Meriten and Cutwater and Insight. Just more broadly across the affiliate portfolio, is there additional streamlining that you're thinking about? Are there capabilities that you're looking to add or maybe some affiliates that are subscale? Just more broadly how are you thinking about the affiliate portfolio? Thanks. Gerald Hassell : Yes. So one of the things that we announce recently was the formation of a actually a new investment boutique from start with the state of Texas as a cornerstone investor. We actually launched a firm called Amherst Capital and it\u2019s designed in many ways to benefit from a lot of regulatory change that we are talking about where banks are having to hold more capital, much of the changes in real estate finance have been impacted by that. And so that boutique will actually manage funds in real estate finance as result of this change. And so that\u2019s an example of the kind of thing where we are continuously looking for places, where we believe our clients can earn some very attractive returns, relative to their liabilities and also to their needs. And so we -- one way that we manage our portfolio was by starting new things, launching new things. And it was a great thing to have a very well-known, sizable institutional client launch that with us. On the other hand, the Meriten sale very much was looking at our portfolio and seeing the great growth that we\u2019ve seen from other investment firms in our mix and so both, Insight, Standish, Alcentra, Newton even had some very good European fixed income capabilities. So when we feel like our capabilities get to the point that there is more attractive owner of the firm, we have sold it. And in the past, we closed firms that become subscale and didn\u2019t deliver the investment performance, we\u2019re always looking to find those investment capabilities that we think are excellent that fit, meets that we think our clients have and that are in line with market trends such as I described around the Amherst. It is a continuous process. I will tell you that we are not traders of our investment boutiques. I want to make sure that we don\u2019t send that message because the truth of the matter is we are trying to have investment lineup that satisfies the complete solutions for our vast global client base. And again, the Meriten enterprise by itself is not our core strategy of ours to sell firms but really just made more sense to do something different. The Cutwater acquisition again expanding pension derisking capabilities into the U.S. is a major market trend and that\u2019s why we made that acquisition. Adam Beatty : Makes sense. Thank you for the color. And then just turning to the equity capability, which stands out a little bit from an otherwise strong franchise on those terms are there product gaps that maybe you're looking to fill? Is it a question of current products maybe being out-of-favor or mainly a performance issue? I know you've done some work on distribution and how is that coming to fruition? Gerald Hassell : Yes. Thanks for that question. It\u2019s a good one. Again, most of the assets under management that we have are with institutional clients who are very disciplined around rebalancing. And so as equity markets have performed well, the client base that we have is very thoughtful about managing their overall asset allocation. And so rebalancing has absolutely been a big part of the trend we\u2019ve seen not just this quarter but in previous quarter. If we look across the industry and some of what we see in retirement channels and in retail channels that have been -- there has been less volatility. There are actually inflows into some equity products and a lot of the investment we\u2019ve been making in our wealth management business and in our U.S. retail intermediary business have been around being able to capture those flows. And just year-over-year, I can tell U.S. retail across all products had a very nice uptick, about 60% increase in sales. And our wealth management business is also showing some very nice growth. In active equity, we\u2019ve seen some impact at the institutional level where clients have moved from active to passive. I\u2019d tell you that about a third of what we\u2019ve seen in our business in this quarter was a move from active to passive. So that\u2019s a dynamic at play as well. Adam Beatty : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. At the Investor Day you talked about 11% to 12% range for the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio. Clearly even with the reversal of the operational risk here you're going to be a bit below that. Are you still thinking about that 11% to 12% range as the right number or do you think it\u2019s kind of shifted down? Gerald Hassell : No, Geoff. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the impact of the increase in the operational risk capital will be offset by the deconsolidation of certain assets, as we believe we are going to be an early adopter of the consolidation standards. So that will bring us back closer to the 10% range and then there will be some natural accretion of capital, as we both increase our SLR requirements. And we like to be about it. I think being optimal is being about 2x. So if we have 5.5% of the SLR based capital, leverage capital that would probably put us in about at 11% or so for a common equity Tier 1. So, I\u2019d still keep it pretty close to the range of 11% to 12%. Geoffrey Elliott : And then just a quick question on the numbers. There was a big increase in non-controlling interest to $90 million and there was also a big step up in the income from consolidated investment management funds. It sounded like you were saying there was some sort of hedging effect that drove that, but I just wanted to make sure I understood what was going on. Gerald Hassell : Yeah. This refers back to the consolidation of the variable interest entities that we are just talking about in the balance sheet. So effectively what happens when we have a small interest in our fund, we have to consolidate the entire fund. And as we consolidate that, we recognized the revenue not only from our own small interest but of our clients. And then we take that revenue -- so in the first quarter, it did very well. So it went up substantially and our clients saw much more in the form of revenue that we typically see. And if we go through the balance sheet, you\u2019ll see there is deduction on an after-tax basis of that minority interest. And so what it looks like is we have a large pre-tax income and therefore have a very low tax rates and that\u2019s not our income, doesn\u2019t get included in the tax rate but in effect it\u2019s best just to take the way we report our numbers on an adjusted basis. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t say our revenue grew 6%, which is what the GAAP number was. It actually grew 4% because we took the client revenue out of the revenue line. As we adopt the new standard, we\u2019ll get a lot less noise from that because it will eliminate most of what you see coming through there. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. Thank you very much. Gerald Hassell : Okay. Thank you very much, everyone. And we really appreciated you dialing in. If you have further questions, please give Valerie Haertel a call and we look forward to catching up with you soon. Operator : Thank you. If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call.

These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in the documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements on this call speak only as of today, July 21, 2015 and we will not update forward-looking statements. Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Valerie, and welcome everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. Our results reflect the successful execution of our strategic priorities to achieve the three year target we shared on Investor Day. We are growing our earnings, investing in next generation operating platforms and risk management controls, attracting new clients, and improving the long term value of our firm for the benefit of our clients and shareholders. Now turning to earnings, earnings per share were $0.73, or $0.77 per share after adjusting for the previously announced litigation expense and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were up 24% year-over-year.  Now focusing on our year-over-year comparisons on an adjusted basis. Total revenue was up 3%, as we saw strength in Asset Servicing, Global Collateral Services and Clearing and improvement in our market sensitive businesses. Our markets group in particular had another excellent quarter, helping to drive growth in investment services and the improvement in our return on tangible common equity.  Net interest revenue was also a strong contributor to results this quarter. Total expenses were down 1% and we delivered more than 460 basis points of positive operating leverage and improved our pre-tax operating margin to 33% by executing on our revenue growth initiatives and through continued expense control. Our return on tangible common equity in the quarter increased to 22% and we continued to deliver significant value to our shareholders by returning more than $1 billon in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Now looking at our progress against certain strategic priorities. Our first priority is driving profitable revenue growth. We are laser focused on leveraging our firm\u2019s capabilities to strengthen and expand our existing client relationships and selectively building new ones. Investment Services revenues benefited from the areas where we\u2019ve been investing, that is Asset Servicing, Global Collateral Services and clearing.  Now the investments we are making in strategic technology, platforms and applications are clearly paying off and our solutions are resonating with clients. We won a significant middle office contract to service $770 billion in assets for a prominent investment manager. That win was part of a strong new business quarter for Investment Services. Now, while our costs will increase in the short run as we prepare to onboard this new business, our platforms are designed to be leveraged by a broader client base and to take advantage of our economies of scale.  Foreign exchange revenue was also up strongly year-over-year, as we continue to benefit from both higher volatility and volumes captured through the expansion of our services.  Now we also strive to deliver a great client experience, which is critical to driving revenues. Third party recognition of our capabilities continued. We took the top spot in this year\u2019s Global Investor ISF Global Custody Survey in EMEA and single custody weighted categories. We also topped the weighted rankings for clients with assets under management greater than $3 billion in the Global EMEA and Asia Pacific categories. We were named the best ETF service provider in the Americas for the ninth year in a row by Exchangetradedfunds.com. And we were named custodian of the year for Latin America in the Custody Risk Americas Award which recognized the growth in quality of the custody service we launched in Brazil less than three years ago.  Now turning to Investment Management, we continue to make progress on several key initiatives. We are already seeing positive results from expanding our reach to the US retail investors as our investment strategies to becoming more visible on third party platforms. In addition, we are connecting with our Pershing financial advisory clients. In fact, the private banking growth we\u2019ve seen in Wealth Management with Pershing clients is a powerful example of our ability to leverage the synergy between investment services and Investment Management for the benefit of our clients. Our initiative to grow our Wealth Management presence in attractive new locations is beginning to add to our revenue growth there as well.  Now switching to Asset Management, our LDI strategies continue to see strong inflows as do inflows into alternative assets, continuing the trend of the last few quarters. Both are areas where we are working to expand our presence. Now, while we\u2019ve made significant progress on those fronts, it was not enough to offset the industry-wide impact of active institutional equity outflows. In fact, while we had a total net long-term outflows of $15 billion, two non-US institutional clients drove $20 billion of the outflows as they liquidated holdings to address cash needs and changes in in their investment strategies.  On the investment performance front, during the quarter, the strength of our capabilities was recognized through a number of awards. Insight Investment was named LDI Manager of the Year and Fixed Income Manager of the Year and Newton the SRI Provider of the Year by the European Pension Awards. Insight was also named LDI manager of the year for the third consecutive year by the CIO European Innovation Awards. And ARX was named Top Brazilian Managers by the Standard & Poor\u2019s for the fifth consecutive year.  Now, our second broad priority is executing on our business improvement process. Our success on this front is reflected in lower expenses in nearly all categories. We are making continued headway on reducing structural costs and risks while improving the productivity and quality and it\u2019s clearly showing up in our results. From a structural standpoint, we continue to optimize our business mix. We shut down our central securities depository and began to reposition our UK transfer agency business because they simply did not meet our return criteria.  We made progress in streamlining our Investment Management operations in APAC and also made a tough decision to shut down our separately managed account offering for now. It\u2019s a solution that we were really excited about and we are not ruling out the possibility of re-establishing it down the road. But when we didn\u2019t gain the traction on the market that we expected, we held to our discipline. During the quarter, we renegotiated certain vendor contracts and made progress in reducing data storage costs in our real estate footprint as we continue to improve the profitability of our business. Now our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, and trusted counterparty. We\u2019ve reduced and simplified our counterparty exposure by exiting the derivatives business. We practically eliminated the intra-day credit risk within the US tri-party repo market and we submitted our fourth annual global resolution plan to the FDIC and the Fed.  Now, we are one of the few banks that propose a tried and proven resolution strategy involving the use of a bridge bank run by the FDIC, something we can do because of our inherently smaller and more liquid balance sheet versus other G-SIBs. Now, to be able to deliver on this plan, we have made commitments to fund more than 30 initiatives over the next two years. It\u2019s expensive, but it will make us even more resilient company in the future.  Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. We are focused on ensuring our capital ratios are compliant with evolving regulatory requirements. During the quarter, we successfully issued $1 billion in preferred stock, which further strengthened our capital position and enabled us to repurchase more than 800 million in shares and distribute almost $200 million in dividends. Our fifth priority is to attract and retain and develop top talent. During the quarter, we had a talent and corporate trust to position us to capitalize on the increased debt issuance market and regain some momentum there. We added staff to support our strategic growth initiatives and we also continued to insource the people who power our technology, productivity, cost and speed to market initiatives. As we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to achieve our three year investor day goals and to deliver even more value to our clients.  With that, let me turn it over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. As in the past, my commentary will follow the financial highlights document, so if we start with page seven that details our non-GAAP, or what we call our operating results for the quarter. As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.77, up 24% from the year ago quarter.  Revenue in the second quarter was approximately 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, and that reflected growth across most of our business, with particular strength in asset servicing, especially global collateral services, as well as in clearing services, foreign exchange and our financing related activities.  Expenses were down 1% year-over-year and 1% sequentially as our business improvement process and the stronger US dollar are driving lower expenses in almost every category. Our ability to grow revenue and control expenses resulted in more than 460 basis points of positive operating leverage year-over-year.  As you can see on page six of the earnings release, the pound was down 9%, and that\u2019s on a year-over-year basis versus the dollar and the euro was down 19%. We\u2019ve estimated that the stronger US dollar reduced both our revenue and expenses by approximately 300 basis points and had a slightly negative impact on net income. Now the business that was most impacted was Investment Management, while currency had less of an impact on Investment Services. We expect the strength of the US dollar to continue to impact Investment Management more than Investment Services, since about 43% of Investment Management revenue comes from outside the US and it\u2019s non-dollar, while the impact to the overall company is expected to be nominal. Income before income taxes was up 14% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our pretax margin increased approximately 300 basis points to 33%, and that\u2019s from 30% in the second quarter of last year. Return on tangible common equity was over 22%.  Now page eight shows consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth, especially in Global Collateral Services and net new business, partially offset by a stronger US dollar. The sequential increase primarily reflects organic growth and seasonally higher securities lending revenue.  Clearing services fees were up 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The increase from the second quarter of 2014 was driven by higher mutual fund and asset based fees, clearance revenue and custody fees.  Issuer service fees were up 1% year-over-year and also 1% sequentially. Both increases reflect higher depository receipt results, partially offset by lower Corporate Trust fees. As we\u2019ve noted previously, the Corporate Trust revenue decline has stabilized and we actually are encouraged by the current pipeline.  Treasury services fees were up 2% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher payment volumes, while the sequential increase reflects the fact that there were three additional business days in the quarter.  Second quarter Investment Management performance fees were down 1% year-over-year, but on a constant currency basis they were up 5%. And that was reflecting higher equity market values, the impact of the first quarter Cutwater acquisition, which was partially offset by lower performance fees. We had performance fees of $20 million compared to our very strong $29 million last year.  FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 44% year-over-year and down 18% sequentially. FX revenue of $181 million was up 40% year-over-year, 17% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects the higher volatility, higher volumes and higher DR related activity. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the benefits of unusually high market volatility in the first quarter of this year. Financing related fees were $58 million compared to$ 44 million in the year ago quarter, and $40 million in Q1. Both increases reflect higher fees related to secured intra-day credit provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity. Now, these fees probably won\u2019t grow beyond Q3 as we expect clients to moderate their usage or possibly find alternative sources for this financing.  Investment and other income of $104 million was $38 million lower year-over-year and $44 million higher sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower other revenue, equity investment revenue and asset related gains and that was partially offset by higher leasing gains. The sequential increase reflects the higher lease residual gains offset by lower seed capital.  Looking ahead to future quarters, given the sale of Wing Hang and some other actions that we\u2019ve taken, we expect investment in Other Income on average to be in the range of $60 million to $80 million. However, we would expect there to be some volatility in this particular line item.  Page nine shows the drivers around Investment Management business that will help explain our underlying performance. You can see the 5% year-over-year AUM increase and the $15 billion of long-term outflows in the quarter. As Gerald noted well, we in the industry have been experiencing outflows in active equities over the last few quarters. We have seen a few very large non-US institutional clients both rebalancing and liquidating parts of their portfolio which has magnified the impact this quarter. Partially offsetting the activity, the active equity outflows were flows into higher fee alternative assets and LDI, a trend we\u2019ve seen for the last few quarters and has been a continued focus for our business -- will be for our business going forward. At this time, the higher proportion of active equity outflows versus the alternative in LDI inflows has resulted in a lower fee mix. Our Wealth Management business continues to grow, benefitting from our expansion initiative. We\u2019ve now completed the investment phase of this initiative and are beginning to see revenue growth as well as an associated increase in loans and deposits.  Turning to our Investment Services metrics on page 10, you can see that assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $28.6 trillion. That\u2019s up $100 billion year-over-year and that\u2019s reflecting higher market values, organic growth and it was partially offset by the stronger US dollar. On a linked quarter, AUC/A was in line with last quarter. Adjusted for currency, year-over-year growth would have been roughly 3%.  We had estimated total new assets under custody and administration business wins in the second quarter of $1 trillion. Now that does not include a recently announced expansion of services to an existing client that has about $140 billion in assets, a deal which closed after the quarter end. We were pleased to see that our investments in our services to clients have been paying off and is being recognized in the marketplace.  The market value of securities on loans at period end was up slightly year-over-year. Average loans and deposits were both up significantly. Our key broker-dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances grew 8%. All of our clearing metrics recorded nice gains, DARTS volumes in particular and the net decline in sponsored DR program reflects our focus on exiting low activity programs.  If you turn to net interest revenue on page 11, you\u2019ll see that NIR on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 8%, versus the year ago quarter and 7% from Q1. We benefited year-over-year from a shift out of cash and into loans and securities and increase in deposits, nice to see a lower interest expense incurred on those deposits and also the positive impact of interest hedging activities. The yield on interest earning assets decreased to two basis points year-over-year while the yield on interest bearing deposits decreased four basis points. The decline in the deposit yield was driven by our efforts to charge clients on Euro denominated deposits primarily.  The net interest margin for the quarter was 100 basis points, two basis points higher than the year ago quarter and three basis points higher than the prior quarter, driven by the reduction in rates paid on interest earning deposits. On page 12, you\u2019ll see that non-interest expense on an adjusted basis decreased by 1% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower expenses in all categories except business development. The lower expense primarily reflects a favorable impact of the strong dollar and the benefit of our business improvement process.  Total staff expenses essentially flat year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the dollar, lower headcount and the impact of curtailing our US defined benefit plan, partially offset by higher performance driven incentives. The year-over-year decline in headcount reflects the progress of our business improvement process. The sequential increase of 200 employees reflects insourcing and revenue initiatives as well as new hires to support new business and asset servicing and Corporate Trust and strategic platform investments in asset manager, alternative asset manager and Global Wealth Programs.  Our occupancy costs have not risen as we expected. The additional costs such as paying double rent for our move out of One Wall Street have been offset by a number of factors, including the strength of the dollar, lower utility costs, we sublet more vacant space and the reduction of maintenance cost. We\u2019re on target to vacate One Wall Street before the end of the third quarter and expect an improvement in the occupancy line beginning in the first quarter of 2016. Now turning to capital on page 13. With respect to our capital ratios, as we highlighted in our last earnings call, we adopted the new consolidations accounting standard during the second quarter which require retrospective adoption to January 1, thus requiring us to revise our Q1 reported numbers. The adoption resulted in a benefit to Q1 of about 75 basis points increasing it to 9.9%. The Q2 2015 ratio is flat at 9.9.  A few notes about the quarter. As you\u2019ll see in our release, our effective tax rate was 23.7%, 1.4% lower than the income statement presentation of Investment Management funds. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate was 25%. Also in the earnings release on page 11 are some investment securities portfolio highlights. You will see that -- I'm sorry, I'm losing my voice here. You will see net unrealized pre-tax gain on portfolio of $752 million, ending up with a hit to our capital of about $300 million.  Now, I'd like to factor in a few points about the second half of the year. Third quarter earnings are generally impacted by seasonal -- I'm going to turn it over to Izzy. Izzy Dawood : Following on our third quarter earnings. As you are aware, third quarter earnings are generally impacted by a seasonal slowdown in transaction volumes and market related revenues, particularly foreign exchange, Global Collateral Services and securities lending, offset by seasonally higher activities in DR. We see expenses coming in flat to slightly down to 2014 for the full year, which will entail an increase in the run rate in the remaining quarters, reflecting the investment in our strategic platforms, increased regulatory compliant costs and the annual merit increase with respect to July 1.  Net interest revenue is expected to be slightly down to Q2, assuming no change in monetary policy. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%. We anticipate proceeding with our capital plan, enabling us to return up to $3.1 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends subject to market conditions and other factors. In summary, we are executing against our strategic priorities. We\u2019re continuing to improve our bottom line and generate significant positive operating leverage and we remain confident in our ability to hit our three year investor day target.  With that, on behalf of Todd, let me hand it back to Gerald. Gerald Hassell : Great. Thanks Izzy for finishing up. Todd is alive and well, trust me. With that -- well he\u2019s certainly alive. With that, why don\u2019t we open it up to questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from the line of Luke Montgomery from Bernstein Research. Your line is open sir. Please go ahead. Luke Montgomery : Good morning, guys. So broadly I'm just wondering how you're feeling about the sustainability of the progress you\u2019ve made on expenses in operating margin. I think clearly some of that is driven by FX translation, but you've now exceeded the high end of the range of your 30% to 32% longer-term operating margin target and that was in a normalized environment. I'd say the same for your 20% to 22% target and we have yet to see rates increase. At this point would you feel comfortable revising these targets a bit higher? Have you considered that at all? Gerald Hassell : Let me start with that. We do feel good about the progress we are making on our business improvement process and pulling it through into the income statement to the bottom line. We are onboarding some new clients and there\u2019s some upfront cost associated with that. We do have increased regulatory costs that we are facing in the second half of this year. I think we are going to stick with our guidance of having expenses essentially flat versus last year. And we are going to work to continue to improve upon that, but we do have some opportunities to bring on some clients that have some upfront costs associated with it. We feel good about hitting the targets that we laid out for investor day. We are within the ranges and we are going to keep driving forward on meeting those targets. Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research :  Okay, thanks. Todd Gibbons : Hey Luke, I would add one thing. We\u2019ve had the benefit of a good revenue mix here. So some higher margin businesses improved faster than we had anticipated at investor day. Luke Montgomery : Okay. And then maybe if you could give us a rough indication of the additional expenses for the T. Rowe outsourcing mandate you won and then when do you expect that business to convert and be reflected in revenue? Also maybe talk about whether that deal reflects any change in the trends in the marketplace for fund accounting or was it more of a one-off opportunistic deal? Gerald Hassell : A couple of questions in there. We will start to -- we\u2019ve already started to incur some of the expenses associated with T. Rowe as we speak. We are talking on board some of their staff, which we are delighted to do. You\u2019re seeing some of the upfront costs associated with the onboarding of that business now and you\u2019ll see it through the course of this year. And then you\u2019ll start to see the revenues kick in towards the end of this year, first part of next year as we convert over the assets. We do actually see it as a long term trend where investment managers in general are really trying to focus on their investment management process and less focused on providing -- doing the mid-office and back office services internally. We do see it as a long term trend. We want to be very thoughtful about which clients we take on and make sure we\u2019re leveraging our platforms and driving profitable revenue growth for ourselves rather than just taking on any one at any time. T. Rowe is a fantastic client. It\u2019s a great partnership. We worked on this together for well over a year and we think we have a good rapport with them and a very similar culture. We feel good about this one. Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercare ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thank you. I'm just curious if you can give some sort of summary comment on what happened to asset sensitivity during the quarter. It's great to see all the growth on balance sheets, both deposits and loans. I think you were in the process over the last two quarters of extending duration a little bit, but if you could just tie that all together, that would be super. Todd Gibbons : Sure, Glenn. I\u2019ll try to take it. It\u2019s Todd. The sensitivity, NIR sensitivity is going to be about flat from where we were in the first quarter. We had put a fair amount of securities on late in the first quarter and we got the benefit of the NIR mostly in the second quarter and actually securities at the end of the period were down slightly. I think you\u2019ll see the asset sensitivity to be basically unchanged where we were in the first quarter. There\u2019s a lot of things that went on with NIR. Actually the duration of our available for sale accounts declined slightly and we\u2019ve used the held to maturity account. That\u2019s where most of the duration of the assets now is. About half the risk is in each so that we can protect the capital account.  But we saw a lot of things go on in the quarter. We saw higher balances. We did see the loan growth that you talked about. We saw a sharp drop in the interest that we paid on deposits. We also had the benefit that accretion on the non-agency securities did not decline as the performance of those securities increased, so we would have expected that. We had some hedging gains. So we don\u2019t anticipate that NIR is bumped up to this level. We don\u2019t expect to grow. In fact we expect it to contract a little bit unless interest rates change. Glenn Schorr : Okay, that's great. Thanks. And then curious on even after the restatement of the capital ratios, let's call it a function of 10%, your buffer is now officially 100 basis points. Even with a very wide 200 basis point AOCI buffer on buffer, that brings you to right about where you're at now. Do you still feel the 11% to 12% is the right range or could we see that work down over time? Todd Gibbons : Yeah. The binding constraint for us, Glenn is not the risk weighted assets. It is the SLR. So as we build the SLR; we would expect the CET1 to grow. We will stick with the previous guidance. Glenn Schorr of Evercore : Got it. Okay, thanks very much. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir. Alex Blostein : I'll try to keep this quick, Todd, to save your voice. A couple of follow-ups on NII. A, could you just define the hedging gains to get us a cleaner run rate for NII for the quarter to think for the third quarter? And then just kind of bigger picture question, when you continue to see growth in your deposits, maybe a couple of comments on where do you guys think it's coming from and again do you still think that there's not a ton of room to reinvest them into securities alone. So this has a positive mix shift in the balance sheet that we've seen from you guys over the last couple of quarters is probably a full in run rate. Is that a fair way to summarize the NII picture? Todd Gibbons : Yeah. I think the answer to your last question is yes. I think that\u2019s a fair way to summarize it. In terms of the hedging gains, accretion had been contracting at about $3 million to $5 million a quarter, so it didn\u2019t. So the combination of accretion and hedging gains is probably in the $10 million ballpark and we expect the balance sheet to be about flat. Alex Blostein : Got you. And then just my follow-up on expenses, just to step back again, when you guys talked about expenses being flat on a year-over-year basis, given the amount of new business you picked up this quarter and the timing of the onboarding, is it still fair to think that 2015 expenses are going to be in that $11 billion run rate? Todd Gibbons : Alex, the guidance we\u2019ve given, I would say it\u2019s going to be flat to slightly down from our operating expenses in 2014. That does mean the run rate will pick up in the second half for all the items that we discussed, whether it\u2019s the merit increase, the onboarding. We are taking on a couple of hundred people soon, to the regulatory costs that we\u2019ve been talking about. All and all, we would still for the full year expect to be flat. Previously guidance was made flat to slightly up. We are a little more optimistic it might be flat to slightly down. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ashley Serrao : Good morning. First question just on Investment Management, I appreciate all the color you gave on the positive attraction of your various growth initiatives. But wanted to get a sense of where you are versus your plan as far as the investment curve goes. And then how should we be thinking about the payoff to the plan laid out at Investor Day? Curtis Arledge : Ashley, it\u2019s Curtis Arledge. Can I just ask you what you mean by investment curve? I want to make sure I understand the question. Ashley Serrao : That would be the investment of the margins that you outlined. Curtis Arledge : Yeah, okay. At investor day we described [indiscernible] our Wealth Management business in our US intermediary distribution platform and some other initiatives. And as Gerald mentioned, those are actually going quite well. Our Wealth Management expansion is now complete. We\u2019ve added about a 50% increase in our sales force and we\u2019ve seen revenues that have actually come in above our original plans. On the US retail side we\u2019ve made a number of investments and changes and our sales there are actually pretty attractive. We\u2019ve seen a boost north of 50% in growth sales in our US retail intermediary platforms, which includes the real exciting part about being connected to Pershing, because Pershing obviously their relationships with financial advisors is important to that effort as well. The private banking piece of our initiative, as Gerald also mentioned, is really starting to work. We feel pretty good about getting the revenues that came with the investments that we were making that we talked about at investor day. Ashley Serrao : Okay, appreciate the color there. And then during the quarter JPMorgan exited its third-party broker-dealer clearing business. I just wanted to get your sense on how are you thinking about the business. Should we expect Pershing to pick up share? And then in a similar vein, how are you thinking about your stake in ConvergEx? Gerald Hassell : Brian, why don\u2019t you take the JPMorgan Pershing Question? Brian Shea : Okay, sure. You can see from Pershing\u2019s metrics overall that we have pretty good momentum in revenue. In terms of our new business pipeline, we are certainly benefiting from JPMorgan\u2019s decision to exit and we are attracting quite a number of those clients to our platform, some of which we\u2019ll be converting, quite a few of which we\u2019ll be converting to our platform in the third quarter. If you look at the overall metrics, the fundamental asset gathering statistics, mutual fund positions, total client assets in custody, prime brokerage lending and margin balances, are a custody all the way through. We have solid growth in the Pershing business unit, so we feel good about that business. Gerald Hassell : Regarding ConvergEx, we just have a small equity piece in that firm and it\u2019s something we\u2019ve had for a long period of time and we just continue to track it. Ashley Serrao : Okay, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. Operator : The question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning. Todd, I was wondering on the capital front now that SLR is pushed out of CCAR for another year and given the potential for rates to go up, I was wondering can you talk to us about how much excess deposits you had on hand and then your trade-off of considering your more preferred issuance in the capital structure. Todd Gibbons : Yeah. We would estimate, Ken that there\u2019s probably about $50 billion to $70 billion of excess deposits, but what ultimately will happen with those deposits is going to depend on the course of monetary policy. So we are poring through our balance sheet to prioritize where we are most efficient with it and actions that we might take against the balance sheet. If those deposits -- if rates were to rise and those deposits were not to lead, we think we would be a heavier issue of preferred and would get a pretty reasonable return on that preferred. We may be in a preferred market as we were this past quarter where we issued $1 billion. We have a fair amount of space to do more. It really will depend on how things play out. It just means that for 2016, the CCAR will not have to consider the SLR, but we still have to prove to ourselves the path to compliance, because we are still 40 basis points below the 5% target. We need a cushion above that. Ken Usdin : And so where's the fine line between go, no go on that? Is it a rate of Fed funds, so like the earnings capacity on that excess deposit if they stay around? Like where's your break even decision tree on that? Todd Gibbons : Yeah, it\u2019s a fairly low yield. Fed funds go to six year 70 basis points and you\u2019ve got that kind of a margin it\u2019s a very attractive return on your equity. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then second follow-up, issuer services. You mentioned just the stability that you've started to see. Can you just give us some underlying trends inside those businesses? And I know we do see the typical seasonality, but the last few years have been anything but typical. So just help us understand what kind of lift we should expect to see in the back half. Brian Shea : Yeah, this is Brian Shea. The issuer services business includes both corporate trust and DR. As Todd mentioned and we\u2019ve been signaling for some time that we thought we see a moderation in the run off of high value securitizations and corporate trust and that the revenue decline that we\u2019ve experienced over the past few years would moderate and flatten out and that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing happen at this point. On the DR side, that business is obviously a capital markets driven business and it has volatility associated with it, but it\u2019s had good year to date performance and we expect a similar seasonality possibly in the third quarter this year. So far so good. Ken Usdin :  All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Hi, thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe just to start on the T. Rowe deal. In looking at that I guess more strategically as you think about the longer-term operating margins on either that deal or that business in general, you\u2019re obviously starting to bring it revenues by year-end. When do you expect that that particular investment to be, or that deal to be operating margin positive? And then how do you think about that deal and/or that business from an operating margin perspective, longer term versus your overall Asset Servicing business? Brian Shea : This is Brian Shea. The transition of the T. Rowe Price team, about 225 people to BNY Mellon we expect to take place in August, so starting next month. That will be followed by a fund accounting conversion nine to 12 months out and then a middle office platform conversion roughly a year after that. It\u2019s a long term arrangement and it\u2019s the largest middle office client, asset manager client that\u2019s committed to us. But you should know that we are driving a shared economy to scale model and a much more standardized leverageable platform. We have about 40 middle office clients today. This is the single biggest one we have and we think it\u2019s a real validation of our strategy in the platform that we are putting in place to serve more. Fundamentally, we feel that there is a way to create shared economies of scale in this model that haven\u2019t historically been created by custodians and we are executing a strategy to bring technology strategy to create that leverage. But there is a fundamental trend where asset managers, just like other financial institutions in a high regulatory change, lower growth environment, are getting back to basics and fundamentally focusing on the investment process as their value proposition and relying more on firms like us to verbalize their middle office costs and actually their front office technology cost.  We are going to be driving a strategy to drive more end to end solutions for investment managers and alternative investment managers and I think it will be a positive driver of our long-term results and we have a very significant pipeline of middle office clients and we\u2019re being careful and selective about which assignments we take on. Gerald Hassell : The other thing I would add, Brian is that we\u2019re not relying on foreign exchange securities lending, other quote high margin business to make this transaction profitable. We have priced it and we\u2019re building the operating platforms such that it is profitable on its own. Brian Bedell : Great, that\u2019s really helpful color. I appreciate that. And then maybe just on the \u2013 just to verify the expense outlook again, making sure I have the base right, it is $11 billion for the guidance for 2015 for flat expenses? Todd Gibbons : What we\u2019ve guided is that our operating expenses last year were about $10.7 billion, $10.65 billion. And Brian, what we\u2019ve guided is that we\u2019ll be relatively flat to that number. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hey, thanks, good morning. A couple of questions, one on the Investment Management metrics page. You\u2019ve got your AUM outflows as well as inflows listed on the page and net currency market and acquisition impact. I noticed liability driven investments have continue to be positive, but maybe a little bit slower paced. Can you just speak to what's going on there? And then your market impact was actually better than what I've seen at other shops and maybe could help us understand how much of that was acquisitions versus market. Curtis Arledge : Betsy, it\u2019s Curtis. I would say our LDI business still has a very healthy pipeline. Quarter to quarter, there are dynamics around the funded ratio for our clients. So if interest rates rise and equity markets remain stable, then the funding ratio improves and clients are generally compelled to move forward with launching a de-risking of their plan and vice versa. And so there is some dynamics of how markets are moving in a quarter. We do have clients occasionally who add to their existing strategies. Maybe they de-risk some portion of portfolio when they add. It makes some quarters stronger than others and when that doesn\u2019t happen, it\u2019s a bit weaker and then clients -- we\u2019ve also had clients who have unhedged portions of their portfolio in the past as well. So quarter-to-quarter fluctuations are somewhat related to what\u2019s happening in the marketplace.  But I can tell you that the pipeline is still very healthy where as funding ratios improve, there is continued interest in removing that volatility or that risk from pension plans overall exposure. So generally the business is very healthy. In terms of marketing, I think one of the things that it\u2019s important to appreciate is that various assets we have across different markets and LDI is actually a really good one. It\u2019s a very long duration asset and it links not only to interest rates, but also to inflation rates. So as inflation rates and interest rates fall, the value of the liability and therefore the value of the assets we manage rises. And so that\u2019s contributing to some of what you\u2019re seeing. We have a very diversified portfolio of assets that we manage when we look at it versus many peers, our US and non-US mixes is very diversified. If you look at equity markets, you also need to appreciate that we have assets. We are showing AUM on a spot basis and because of what happens in some currency markets, our spot rates move right at the end of the quarter based on currency movements and we saw a little bit of that in the year-over-year dynamics. So I would say it\u2019s both currency and duration of some of the assets we manage. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay, that's helpful color. Thanks very much. Just Todd, just an overall question for you on the FX impact on revenues and expenses and I'm sorry if I missed it. I noticed throughout the presentation you talked about the impact there, but do you have an FX adjusted revenue and expense overall for total BK or how it impacted the growth rates in revenue and expenses? Todd Gibbons : Yeah. I had indicated that it\u2019s about 3% negative on revenues and it\u2019s about 3% positive on expenses, meaning lower expenses. Net-net, it was very slightly negative to us so there\u2019s some rounding in those calculations and that\u2019s about what we would expect going forward, Betsey. There could be -- we\u2019re pretty well hedged in Euro and Sterling. There could be \u2013 we are short one or two other currencies. So if the movements change, it could be a little bit different, but we would expect if the dollar were to get stronger or weaker from here, it shouldn\u2019t have a meaningful impact to our pre-tax. It just might change the geography a bit. Betsy Graseck : Okay. The currency you're not hedged to, the biggest is the yen, is that right or? Todd Gibbons : No, it\u2019s going to be Rupee. Curtis Arledge : No, with Indian Rupee. Todd Gibbons : Indian Rupee. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay, got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Mayo : Hi, just a clarification of what you've said so far. The results in the first half of the year have exceeded expectations and you're in your target ranges, but it doesn't seem like you're changing your guidance for the full year. So should we think of these results as simply frontloading some of the benefits in the second half of the year or if you can just give us some more color on this? Gerald Hassell : Generally, Mike we put out three-year investment targets during Investor Day. We\u2019re sticking to those and we\u2019re executing against them. The first half of the year, we\u2019ve done some level of outperformance. We want to continue that and not let the targets restrain us, but we certainly want to keep performing well. Todd Gibbons : The targets weren\u2019t meant to be annual targets. They were compounded growth rates over the three-year period, Mike. And so we\u2019ve certainly gotten off to a good start. We\u2019ve gotten much more market benefit than we would have anticipated at that point in time. But that\u2019s not to say that\u2019s going to continue. Mike Mayo : Okay. Perhaps as a follow-up to that, Gerald you mentioned your three-year targets and your five priorities and I think you guys had a board meeting in June where you talk about strategy and topics like that. Can you highlight what was talked about at that Board meeting or any perhaps nuanced changes that you have in the strategy or other areas for additional emphasis that came out from that meeting? Gerald Hassell : Mike, we have a Board meeting every other month, so that\u2019s just part of the standard fare. We share with our Board obviously not only what we share publicly, but the ups and downs and the positives and negatives throughout all our businesses. So we\u2019re sticking by our strategy. We\u2019re sticking by our business model and we\u2019re sticking by the Investor Day targets we laid out there and I would say we\u2019re executing against them and we\u2019ll continue to drive value for shareholders and clients. Mike Mayo : Last follow-up. We've had a few months since Investor Day. Now that you've had this period and you've gone back a little bit more aggressively, which areas would you say you're more confident about or perhaps less confident about? Todd Gibbons : From a financial perspective, I think there are a couple of positives. As you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve seen probably a little stronger revenue growth, especially when you take into consideration currency. I think our business improvement process continues to work well. I think the balance sheet grows and the need to retain additional capital may be higher than we had anticipated. And net-net I think we\u2019re still comfortable with the ranges that we had established. The course to get there will never be the direction that we initially anticipated, but I think we\u2019re still pretty comfortable with the direction we\u2019re going. Mike Mayo : All right, thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open sir, please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. So one follow-up on the onboarding expense for the back half of the year. How much of that should we consider ongoing and how much of that would be one-time charges? Brian Shea : It\u2019s Brian. We signaled at Investor Day that we have over year-over-year growth in expense as we build out these strategic platforms for asset managers, alternative managers and the Global Wealth platform and that is going to be the case as we suggested obviously. And then over time, the revenue comes on as the clients start to leverage the platform. And so ultimately we think these are really strategic -- good strategic investments that are going to create long term client shareholder value, but there\u2019s obviously a drag year-over-year on expense this year and then it moderates next year and in 2018 these investments are significantly positive for the shareholder. Gerald Hassell : I would add it's in our running rate expenses today, those investments. Brennan Hawken : Okay. I guess what you're saying is they are ongoing but we see the revenue pickup which enhances the returns. Is that a fair way to paraphrase it? Gerald Hassell : Yeah. That\u2019s the right way to think about it. Brennan Hawken : Great, thank you. Then a quick one on the excess deposits. So can you help us maybe understand why you would, if we get higher rates and we don't see the behavior anticipating, why you wouldn't explore pricing changes as opposed to raising preferred in order to just provide motivation for those $50 billion to $70 billion to move off the balance sheet? Gerald Hassell : First of all, it's not one or the other. As you can see, in this particular quarter, the second quarter we just finished, we actually did manage our deposit rates down. You can see that we are in fact charging for deposit, particularly in Europe or in Europe I should say. And so the cost of our deposits is actually declining. We are proactivity managing the cost of our deposit base. But as Todd said earlier, if the return on those deposits in a rising interest rate environment are such with little or no risk associated with them, then we should think about whether additional capital is warranted and making sure we get good return on that capital. There\u2019s also as you know as our businesses grow, we tend to get more deposits, frictional deposits associated with our businesses. It's going to be interesting to see when rate rises what happens to those excess deposits, not only here but in the industry at large. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. As a follow-up on the deposit commentary that you guys have made, what percentage of your European depositors now are paying you interest for you to hold those deposits? The second, how many have decided to leave or take some of the deposits out because they didn't want to pay the fee? Brian Shea : Most of them where we can pass through the fees are paying them. We did see some behavior when we initially started charging for deposits where there were some out flows and those have come back, so we are about flat through the beginning to where we are now in the actual volume of European deposits. Gerard Cassidy : Would you say the experience has been a pleasant one for what you had to do to convince folks to pay for you to hold their deposits? Brian Shea : I look around at my relationship people, I'm not sure they feel exactly that way. Karen Peetz : Yeah, I would say -- it\u2019s Karen Peetz. I would say clients understood it, that we weren\u2019t going to pay them to keep the money with us, but it was a series of difficult conversations. Many of our peer followed suit so we weren\u2019t alone. Gerard Cassidy : Good. And then a technical question. On the buyback, you guys were quite successful this quarter in buying back just over 19 million shares. I see the average share count dropped only about, I think 4 million shares from 1.126 billion to 1.22 billion. Could you give us some color why it didn't fall further? Todd Gibbons : Average share count is -- so you start this period and at the end of the period, so it's -- it would be the timing of it, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, just a timing issue then? Todd Gibbons : Yeah. Gerard Cassidy : Great, okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW. Your line is open so please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, good morning. I just had a quick question on the new business wins. Even if you back out the T. Rowe, it still was $254 billion in the quarter. Can you give us some color on the geography or service that's driving that and that compares to $131 billion last quarter? Brian Shea : Yeah, I would say that\u2019s an asset -- that\u2019s a servicing metric and we are getting -- again we are getting a solid pipeline and some solid new business commitments. I think it\u2019s indicative of the secular trend of asset managers refocusing on the investment process and their core value proposition and leveraging us for more of those core back office, middle office and eventually front office services. Gerald Hassell : As we\u2019ve said in the past, quarter to quarter we can have a couple of sizeable new pieces of business. And so it could be $150 billion, $200 billion one quarter, $250 billion another quarter but the pipeline is good and this was a good quarter for our new business wins. Brian Kleinhanzl : Then just a second question on the Wealth Management business. You said that the Wealth Management growth was improving, but if you look at the revenues year-over-year they are only up 3%. Can you give us a little bit more color maybe on an AUM or some other metric that shows the improvement and also when you expect those revenues to inflect in the future? Brian Shea : Yes, so it's a little -- Wealth Management also uses some of our mutual funds and when we look at our Wealth Management business, it also includes our private banking activities. The lines that\u2019s Wealth Management fees doesn\u2019t describe the entirety of our Wealth Management business. If you look at our loans and deposit growth on the investment management page, you can see that we are additionally having real success growing our balance sheet. The NIR here is up 18% and it's really helping the overall. Wealth Management is growing, not just within our current footprint. We\u2019ve opened new offices and so being able to go into those offices with both investment offerings and a private banking offerings is really where our revenue growth is coming from. Brian Kleinhanzl : Good. Thanks. Operator : Thank you and the last question on queue is coming from Adam Beatty from Bank of America. Your line is open so please go ahead. Adam Beatty : Good morning. A question on asset servicing, specifically collateral management, which you mentioned a couple of times. I was wondering if you could maybe size out of the contribution to growth or the growth rate of that service line and also let us know how far along you are in terms of penetrating your existing client base? What inning are you at with that opportunity? Thanks. Gerald Hassell : Curtis, you want to take it? Curtis Arledge : Yes, so on the active servicing line, probably quarter over quarter growth, we probably approached 50% of the cloud services benefiting that after servicing lines. As far as where we are in, we are probably in still the early innings and I mean by the early innings is that the buy side really hasn\u2019t yet benefited fully from shifting some of their business to enjoy collateral as a means to help finance some of what they\u2019re trying to take and leverage or fully embrace or fully put in place the collateralization of margins, especially in Europe. We think we are in early innings still when it comes to collateral business and as far as the growth opportunities that exist around it. And so and our product set really fits well with those needs that those buy side clients have as collateral continues to be needed to pledge against obligation. Adam Beatty : Excellent. It sounds like more to come. Thank you. Then on Investment Management, you mentioned some perhaps more acute funding needs from some international clients driving some of the outflows. How much risk do you see of maybe some additional drawdown across your client base? Thanks. Brian Shea : We\u2019ve seen through the course of the past several months some clients re-balancing their portfolios. Equity markets over the past couple years obviously did quite well, especially in the US. I think understanding the US, non-US equity performance important to this when you think about what people are doing with re-balancing. We\u2019ve seen huge growth in our AUM and LDI as clients have reduced their exposure to equities. And I\u2019m drawing an inference that sometimes we actually see clients sell equities and move into fixed income or de-risk their pension plans. I think it\u2019s been overall a drawdown in assets is not what we are seeing at the moment. We are seeing a re-balancing from equity to fixed income. Again, there\u2019s a lot being talked about of the re-positioning of investor portfolios towards more risk and what I would say, we see really instead is really focusing on getting returns while being thoughtful about risk and that\u2019s why our alternatives growth \u2013 we\u2019ve had eight straight quarters of growth in alternatives and those have been strategies where clients are either getting uncorrelated exposures or they are getting absolute returns on asset allocations strategies that give them better diversified portfolios exposure. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an overall drawdown. It\u2019s more of a mix shift. Adam Beatty : Okay. So it sounds like you're not seeing anything material in terms of funding needs that may be sovereigns or what have you driving those outflows? Todd Gibbons : We\u2019ve seen \u2013 I think to Gerald\u2019s opening comments, we\u2019ve absolutely seen -- the thing about our client base is very significantly global institutions who from time to time do manage their liquidity needs across their portfolio. And again quarter to quarter we do see that happen. Adam Beatty : Got it. Thank you very much. I appreciate you taking the questions.  Gerald Hassell Okay. Thank you very much, everyone for dialing in. If you have additional questions, which I\u2019m sure you will, please give Valerie Haertel a call. We\u2019d be happy to engage with you and thank you very much for your attention today. Operator : If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie Haertel : Thank you, Anna and good morning everyone. Welcome to the BNY Mellon third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO, Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as members of our executive management team. Our third quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website at bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, October 20, 2015 and we will not update the forward-looking statements. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald? Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Valerie. Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining us this morning. Our results demonstrate our focus on delivering significant value for our clients and shareholders in all market environments. Given the global market instability and continued low interest rates, it has been an exceedingly challenging revenue environment. So, we remain laser focused on the key priorities we discussed with you at our Investor Day a year ago. We are executing our strategic plan, which is enabling us to deliver solid results in line with our 3-year financial goals. For the quarter, we again controlled our expenses, while continuing to make strategic investments to enhance client service delivery as well as improving our technology platforms and capabilities to drive future revenue growth. In addition, we are making ongoing investments in risk management and regulatory compliance practices. So, turning to earnings, earnings per share were $0.74, up 16% on an adjusted basis, which excludes the third quarter 2014 sale of our equity investment in Wing Hang Bank and our 1 Wall Street headquarters. It\u2019s also net of litigation and restructuring charges. Now, focusing on the year-over-year comparisons on an adjusted basis, we generated more than 370 basis points of positive operating leverage and improved our pre-tax operating margin to 31%. Total revenue was up 1% as growth in Investment Services, including contributions from our volume and volatility sensitive businesses, was largely offset by softness in investment management, which was negatively impacted by the strong dollar as well as declines in equity market values globally. Net interest revenue was up 5% and total expenses were down 3% and our return on tangible common equity in the quarter was 21%. So, looking at our progress against our strategic priorities, our first priority is driving profitable revenue growth. We are working to deepen our client relationships and grow revenues, but we are also maintaining our pricing discipline when competing in the marketplace. Now, during the quarter, revenue in Investment Services again benefited from growth in Global Collateral Services and Asset Servicing. We also on-boarded nearly 230 new staff during the quarter in association with the mid office services of T. Rowe Price that we are taking on. This strategic relationship further endorses the market demand for our expertise and platform capabilities. Foreign exchange revenue was also up strongly year-over-year as we continue to benefit from both higher volumes captured through the expansion of our services and higher volatility. Investment management revenue reflected the reset in the equity markets and the impact of the strong dollar. That said the diversity of our investment management business, combined with our growth initiatives in business improvement efforts, helped mitigate the market impact on our financial results. On a constant currency basis, investment management fees were flat year-over-year. Our LDI strategies continue to see strong inflows reflecting continued client demand. And we also saw some good momentum in fixed income and our alternative strategy. Our initiatives to align our investment management portfolio to the largest growth pools are delivering results. Our U.S. retail initiative, which is focused on third-party intermediary advisors and expanding the Dreyfus distribution platform is contributing to our results. As is our wealth management sales force expansion which has built a strong pipeline and is benefiting from the growing synergies with our Pershing business. Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process that leverage our scale and expertise to deliver efficiency benefits to clients, while reducing our structural costs. Our success on this approach is reflected not only in lower expenses in nearly all categories, but in our industry leading market positions across all of our businesses. Now, some highlights of our business improvement program include the sale of Meriten, our German-based boutique, where we had a marginally profitable business and identified the opportunity to better redeploy our capital. That closed in the third quarter. We have realigned our UK transfer agency operating model to improve its profitability. We have created a new client pricing strategy group to develop, analyze and measure service delivery costs to better align our cost with our client pricing. We have implemented an automated process to measure market data usage to identify opportunities to reduce the number of pricing feeds and terminals. And we have created what we call MyDashboard, which improves employee productivity as part of our digitization strategy. And MyDashboard provides our managers with a convenient snapshot of key data on their employees such as expenses, performance measurement status, training and other key metrics. The capability was recently named best new digital project for financial services as part of the Gartner Financial Services Cool Business Awards. And we have also been analyzing our current real estate portfolio to reduce cost. And we are selecting locations and workplace standards that enable collaboration and innovation. During the quarter, we completed our exit from 1 Wall Street ahead of schedule and we now occupy our new, more cost efficient headquarters at 225 Liberty Street and we are taking a very similar approach across many of our locations globally, which will help reduce our real estate footprint. Given the more difficult-than-expected equity markets, it will be critical for us to keep driving efficiencies to meet our Investor Day goals. To that end, we continue to identify additional opportunities to reduce corporate overheads and to leverage scale and operations, technology and distribution in both Investment Services and investment management while continuing to deliver a high level of service to our clients. Many of our efforts are singles and doubles, but they have been adding up, helping us fund some of our revenue growth initiatives and increasing regulatory compliance costs. Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. We continue to have among the highest credit ratings in the industry. This quarter, our credit ratings were affirmed by the rating agencies, including our A1 rating from Moody\u2019s. Now, during the quarter, we implemented a new system to meet the bulk of reporting requirements and completed a program to measure and monitor intraday credit risk exposure. We also established a more granular and rigorous CCAR approach that strengthens our capital adequacy process. Our business improvement process has helped us fund some of these investments. Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and capital and liquidity position. With respect to our capital ratio, we are pleased to report progress towards achieving compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio which increased to 4.8% this quarter. Now, as a reminder, SLR is expected to be effective, it\u2019s the beginning of 2018 and we are on a good path to meet the requirement by then. Now, in accordance with our 2015 capital plan, which authorized us to return up to $3.1 billion to our shareholders, we repurchased 690 million in shares and distributed $190 million in dividends during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased more than 1.9 billion in shares and distributed nearly $575 million in dividends. Our fifth priority is to attract, develop and retain top talent. Across our organization, we have been enhancing our talent strategies and culture to ensure we have the right people in the right jobs. Great talent enhances our ability to win. This quarter, we named a new President of our markets group, Michelle Neal, who starts next month. She exemplifies the kind of talent we have been attracting and developing in our organization. Michelle has a special combination of experience in electronic trading and settlement and she is well equipped to continue to drive the markets group\u2019s strong performance. And we are very pleased to welcome her to our team. Now as we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to achieve the 3-year financial targets we shared with you on Investor Day a year ago. With that, let me turn it over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thanks Gerald and good morning everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document starting with Page 7, which details our non-GAAP or what we call our operating results for the quarter. As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.74, that\u2019s up 16% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Now adjusted, it excludes the sale of our equity investment in Wing Hang and the sale of 1 Wall Street and is also net of litigation and restructuring charges. Revenue in the third quarter was up 1% year-over-year reflecting strength in asset servicing, especially global collateral services as well as in clearing, foreign exchange and financing related activities. It was offset by the impact of the stronger dollar and lower equity markets, especially on our investment management business. Expenses were down 3% year-over-year. Our success in lowering legal and consulting expenses and in bringing savings from our Business Improvement Process as well as the stronger dollar are driving lower expenses in almost every category. Combination of our revenue mix and ability to control expenses through the business improvement process resulted in more than 370 basis points of positive operating leverage year-over-year. On Page 6 of our earnings release, you can see the key currencies that impacts our business, the strength of the U.S. dollar against the pound and the euro, which were down 7% and 17% respectively, continue to impact investment management more than our other businesses, since 42% of the revenue is from outside the U.S. As we have noted in prior quarters, the overall company impact from currency translation is nominal. Adjusted for the stronger U.S. dollar, revenue would have been up approximately 4% and expenses up approximately 1%. Income before taxes was 8% year-over-year on an adjusted basis and is up 10.5% if you exclude the provision for credit losses. On a year-over-year basis, our pretax margin increased approximately 200 basis points to 31% in the third quarter of 2015. And finally, return on tangible common equity was 21%. Page 8 shows our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth in global collateral services, our broker dealer activities and asset servicing and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Sequentially, organic growth and net new business was offset by the typical seasonal step down in securities lending revenue as well as lower market values. Clearing services fees were up 2% year-over-year, down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher mutual fund and asset based fees. Issuer services fees were down 1% year-over-year and up 34% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower fees in depositary receipts and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar in Corporate Trust, now is partially offset by net new business in Corporate Trust. The sequential increase primarily reflects seasonal higher fees and depositary receipts versus the second quarter. Treasury service fees were down 4% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, both decreases reflect lower payment volumes as we continue to be highly selective exiting client relationships that don\u2019t meet our risk criteria. Third quarter investment management and performance fees were down 6% year-over-year and sequentially. On a constant currency basis, investment management and performance fees were down 2% primarily driven by lower performance fees, lower equity market values and net outflows, partially offset by the impact of the first quarter Cutwater acquisition and strategic initiatives. The sequential decline primarily reflects lower equity market values, net outflows and seasonally lower performance fees. Both decreases also reflect the sale of Meriten Investment Management in July. Performance fees were $7 million compared to $22 million a year ago. FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 17% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. FX revenue of $180 million was up 17% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher volatility and volumes. Financing related fees were $71 million compared to $44 million in the year ago quarter and $58 million in Q2. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher fees related to secured intraday credit provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity. As we noted last quarter, some of our clients may moderate their usage or possibly find alternatives of sources with this financing. Importantly, both increases also reflect higher underwriting fees. Investment and other income of $59 million compared with $890 million in the year ago quarter and $104 million in the second quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the gains on the sales of our equity investment in Wing Hang and the 1 Wall Street building. Those are both recorded in the third quarter of \u201814. There is also a $17 million loss on seed capital investments that\u2019s recorded in consolidated investment management funds versus the $16 million gain last year that is not reflected in these numbers given the required separate gross presentation for consolidated funds. The sequential decrease in investment and other income primarily reflects lower leasing gains and the loss associated with the sale of Meriten Investment Management. Page 9 shows the drivers of our investment management business that help explain our underlying performance. You can see AUM was $1.63 trillion, unchanged from last year. Note that assets under management for the current and prior periods have been restated to exclude Meriten. We had $5 billion of long-term net outflows during the quarter. Those were primarily in index strategies, active equities and fixed income offset by continued strength in LDI where we retain a leadership position. Our wealth management business expansion initiative is helping to drive an increase in loans and deposits. Year-over-year, we saw a 19% increase in loans and 11% increase in deposits. Turning to the investment services metrics on Page 10, you can see that assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $28.5 trillion. That\u2019s up $200 billion year-over-year reflecting net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar and the lower equity market values. Adjusted for currency, year-over-year growth would have been roughly 3%. Linked quarter, AUC/A was essentially flat. We had estimated new \u2013 total new assets under custody and/or administration business wins of $84 billion in the third quarter. Now, while this is relatively low, it\u2019s mainly due to the timing of new business wins this year. In the second quarter, we announced the significant new strategic relationship, which resulted in an upside win for that quarter. We continue to see strong demand for our services and we have a solid pipeline of opportunities. It is important to note that this quarter we changed our methodology for reporting our estimated new business wins. Moving from reporting based on the day the mandate was granted to the date that it was actually contracted. Although it\u2019s not a significant, we have restated our historical new business wins beginning in 2014 through this quarter for better comparative purposes. Additionally, year-to-date new business wins totaled $1.42 trillion, so we are still trending above our historical average. Now to \u2013 turning to a review of other metrics, the market value of securities on loan at year end again was up year-over-year increasing by 2%. Average loans and deposits continue the strong year-over-year growth trend. Our broker-dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances grew 4%. All of our clearing metrics were up with global DARTS volumes up 18%. The net decline in sponsored DR programs primarily reflects our continued focus on exiting low activity programs. Turning to net interest revenue on Page 11, you will see that NIR on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 5% versus the year ago quarter and down 3% from Q2. The overall balance sheet was stable this quarter. We benefited year-over-year from higher average deposits and a better asset mix. The yield on interest earning assets increased 3 basis points year-over-year and the yield on interest bearing deposits decreased 4 basis points. The decline in deposit yield was driven by our efforts to charge for deposits in non-U.S. locations to cover our cost, where negative interest rates exist. Sequentially, NIR was lower reflecting lower average securities and the impact of interest rate hedging activities. The net interest margin for the quarter was 98 basis points, 4 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 2 basis points lower than the prior year and in line with our expectations and remained in the range of 95 to 100 basis points as we noted on our Investor Day last year. The year-over-year increase reflects the shift out of cash and into investments in securities and loans. The benefit of which was mainly realized in the second quarter. Turning to Page 12, you will see that non-interest expense on an adjusted basis declined 3% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in non-interest expense reflects lower expenses on all categories, except other expense. Other expense includes concessions we gave to clients impacted by the system \u2013 the SunGard systems outage to cover out-of-pocket and other incidental expenses they incurred. Lower expenses compared to a year ago reflect the favorable impact of a stronger dollar, lower legal and consulting expenses and the benefit of our business improvement process. The third quarter decrease was partially offset by higher consulting expenses associated with regulatory requirements. Total staff expense declined 3% year-over-year reflecting the favorable impact of a stronger dollar, the impact of curtailing our U.S. defined benefit plan and lower incentive expense partially offset by our annual employee merit increase effective on July 1 and higher severance expense. The sequential increase in headcount of 600 employees primarily reflects the on-boarding of staff related to two strategic relationships as well as our continued in-sourcing of technology talent to both reduce cost and retain institutional knowledge in-house. Sequentially, the annual employee merit increase and higher severance and other expenses were almost completely offset by lower incentive, business development and sub-custodian expenses. Turning to capital on Page 13, our fully phased-in advanced approach common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased by 60 basis points to 9.3, that was driven by increases in risk-weighted assets primarily related to credit risk and operational risk. In addition, we are also no longer assuming use of a methodology that is subject to regulatory approval, which reduced the ratio by approximately 25 basis points. As Gerald noted, we made good progress on our supplemental leverage ratio and we are at 4.8% this quarter due to higher capital and a lower average balance sheet. While our ratio is now 20 basis points below the required 5% minimum, we do plan to maintain a cushion above that. As we have noted previously, this ratio was expected to be our binding constraint and we are confident that we will be in compliance when the regulation becomes effective. To the extent that excess deposits did not run off as we anticipate with an increase in rates, we have many levers to pull, including the issuance of additional preferred, if necessary, to achieve compliance. Few final notes about the quarter. As you will see in our release, our effective tax rate was 25.4%. Also on Page 11 of the earnings release, you will see some investment security portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our net unrealized pre-tax gain in our portfolio was $1.05 billion. That compares to $752 million at the end of June, with the difference owing principally to a decline in interest rates. Now, I would like to discuss a few points to factor into your thinking about the fourth quarter. We expect to see the typical seasonal decline in depositary receipt fees with the limited offset in expenses. We estimate the decline of the fourth quarter from the third quarter to be approximately $120 million in revenues. We expect to generate seasonally higher performance fees in our investment management business in the fourth quarter, approximately in line with last year. Net interest revenue is expected to be flat. We expect to see seasonally higher business development expenses. Additionally, we expect an increase in consulting expenses related to our investments in regulatory compliance initiatives. I would also like to note that the fourth quarter of last year was when we began to see the U.S. dollar strengthened. So, you should keep that dynamic in mind as you model us. We expect total expenses to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period, adjusted for litigation and lower for the full year 2015 as compared to the full year 2014. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. I will also remind you that we are going to pay a dividend on the preferred that we issued in the second quarter. And finally, we continue to expect to execute on share buybacks in accordance with our planned authorization. So in summary, we are executing on our strategic priorities and we are pleased with the progress we are making even with the relatively challenging market headwinds. We are continuing to generate significant positive operating leverage even while we invest in initiatives to drive further growth and absorb higher regulatory compliance cost. We are focusing on managing our balance sheet, generating capital and deploying it effectively to deliver value to our shareholders and we remain on track to achieve the 3-year targets we shared at Investor Day this time last year. With that, let me hand it back to Gerald. Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Todd. And operator, I think we are ready to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ashley Serrao : Good morning. Gerald Hassell : Good morning. Ashley Serrao : I was just curious, what portion of the $500 million in savings that you outlined at Investor Day have been achieved so far? And also what portion of that has been reinvested in the business? Ultimately, I am just trying to get a sense of the net savings that have dropped to your bottom line. And I may have misheard this, but it sounds like you have also identified incremental opportunities that you think would be additive. Any color there would be appreciated? Todd Gibbons : Yes, Ashley, let me say that \u2013 this is Todd, let me just say, first of all, that the $500 million was a number that we put out last year and we have been working hard to add to that total figure and this is a continuous process improvement. These are structural changes and not one-time events. And we do continue to see increasing opportunities and the number continues to get bigger. In terms of how much is adding to the bottom line versus what\u2019s being reinvested into regulatory or other strategic platforms. I think the best way to look at that is to look at the increase in the operating margin. Some of that is that \u2013 the 377 basis points this quarter, some of that, on a year-over-year basis, some of that is related to the dollar, probably about 77 or so, so even on a constant currency basis were 300 basis points better. So that\u2019s what you are seeing dropped to the bottom line. Ashley Serrao : Okay, thanks for the color there. And then I guess the other question was I noticed cash into bank placements ticked up sequentially for what looks like the first time in the year. I know you have proactively been trying to shift away from cash. So, I was curious how we should be interpreting the increase? Todd Gibbons : Yes, I think if you look at the average period, it\u2019s probably a better way to look at it. You will see it\u2019s relatively flat and actually cash at the Central Banks is down a little bit. So, we do get spikes from time to time on quarter ends. In fact, the period ends have been spiking by about $15 billion or $20 billion, but you could guess get noise there, but general, cash at other banks should be flat and Central Bank deposits is going to be down on a year-over-year basis as we put more in loans as well as in securities. Ashley Serrao : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Alright, thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ms. Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. And your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, thank you. Todd, I wondered if you could give us an update on how you are dealing with negative rates over in Europe, the degree to which deposit pricing strategy is done and why with an expectation to reduce deposits there? Todd Gibbons : Yes, there is a slight decline, Betsy in deposits since we initiated that strategy, but not much. We did up the charge for some of those deposits in the third quarter, late in the third quarter. And I would say just seeing a modest decline, if any. Betsy Graseck : And so as you think about the size of the balance sheet and this lower for longer rate environment, could you talk through thoughts on the SLR and whether or not that includes issuing incremental preferreds? Todd Gibbons : Sure. So, we did get to 4.80 on the quarter. We do accumulate even at 100% payout ratio, we accumulate somewhere between $600 million and $800 million a year in incremental capital from the amortization of intangibles as well as equity that\u2019s issued for compensation plans. So if you take that into consideration that moves us up a bit over the next couple of years. We have also gone through \u2013 if we kind of look at our balance sheet through two lenses, one is in a zero rate environment and one is on normalizing rate environment that\u2019s reflected in the forward curve. In the normalizing rate environment, as you know we would expect quite a bit of deposits to run off and we could probably comply in the normal course with the SLR with a pretty decent cushion. If it stays in a zero rate environment, we have got a team working together with investment services in the treasury group. And we have prioritized all of our balance sheet consumption and where we might either look at interest rates going even negative on interest rates to discourage deposits or in other words pushing off other SLR related activities. And we would hold as a kind of a last resort if it makes sense economically to issue preferreds. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And I am sorry if I missed it, but have you given your bank SLR, I know you talked about the hold co level? Todd Gibbons : Yes. The bank SLR is about 20 basis points below the hold co level right now. Betsy Graseck : Alright. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Luke Montgomery of Bernstein Research. Sir, your line is open. Luke Montgomery : Thanks. Good morning, I would like to know what your thoughts are on the application of block chain technology to securities settlement in tri-party repo, I think you know that there is a number of start-ups out there that are looking at this. Do you think that technology would be more likely to disintermediate the settlement infrastructure, which would be maybe the central securities depositories or could it also be some of the services that global custodians like you provide. And then do you see any limitations in the technology or maybe vested interest that would prevent it from being adopted by this the securities markets and just how closely have you been examining it? Gerald Hassell : That\u2019s a mouthful of questions. We are studying block chain technology quite intensely. It has some very, very positive attributes. Clearly, the whole idea of two sides showing up on a public ledger and being able to swap values instantaneously is very appealing. So we are looking at it and whether it can be deployed in some pilot programs we have internally. And therefore see how the technology can be used to improve our core operations, both on the clearance and settlement side. We have been trying to engineer our company for same day or real time settlement regardless. And so whether it\u2019s through block chain or through other means, it\u2019s something that we think about a whole lot. We do have some pilot programs going on in the payment space, I mean our treasury services area, where that\u2019s the area most impacted at the moment by third-party technology companies are going after the payments. Typically, it\u2019s the small payments, consumer payments, but anything that happens at the consumer level, we assume is going to happen at the institutional level. As it relates to clearance and tri-party directly, that is an extraordinarily complex operating platform with incredibly complex algorithms built into it. So, we are not na\u00efve to think that technology can\u2019t disrupt even that, but I think we feel pretty comfortable at the moment there. The last but not least, for a block chain to work, you need to have everybody on both sides, the buy side and the sell side, to show up simultaneously in volume to have it make sense. And so we are looking at some technologies on how it can be applied. So a lot of \u2013 there is a lot of room ahead of us before it\u2019s fully implemented but we are studying it very carefully. Luke Montgomery : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. And then I was just hoping you could sketch out in a little more detail what you are attempting to achieve with Dreyfus and retail distributional, I think I recall one of the possible explanations for the low to mid-30% range operating margins in the asset management business, is that the retail platform is expensive but maybe not up to scale. So as you execute against that plan, do you expect to see operating margins in the asset management business improve? Curtis Arledge : Yes, this is Curtis. Absolutely, what I would point you to is that while we are the sixth largest asset management in the world, in terms of U.S. mutual fund families, we are currently 37th. So we have all of the investment capabilities or a large majority of the investment capabilities in-house that is used by investors that use mutual funds, financial advisors and individuals, ultimately as the end users. But our platform to reach advisors is below where we think it should be or where it could be to really improve our distribution of our investment capabilities through that channel. It\u2019s very important to appreciate the large scale shift of assets from defined benefit plans, ultimately into what we will refer 1K after they go through retirement plans. And so a major industry shift to these assets that have been managed by CIOs, pension plans are now even managed again by individual advisors. So, we want to obviously be in sync with that shift. The investment that we\u2019ve began over a year ago we are actually pretty excited about U.S. retail, despite a pretty challenging environment for the industry. We have done quite well. And so recent statistics around flows actually have come out and we were 18th in terms of the third quarter in terms of net flows. So, the 37th largest family is 18th and net flows over an extended period of time, we should see our market share grow and it\u2019s a very important part of our initiative that we outlined at Investor Day. I would also highlight that we do reach clients directly through our wealth management business. Our wealth management business tends to focus on individuals and family offices with higher net worth. And we have seen through our expansion fantastic growth there. Todd mentioned the 19% increase we have seen in loans and deposits. I would share with you that our partnership with Pershing has been a really important contributor to that, nearly a quarter of our growth in loans and deposits came from connecting to the financial advisory clients of Pershing. So both U.S. retail coverage of advisors and wealth management are important parts of our future investment management. Operator : Alright, thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Thanks very much. So, everybody likes the positive operating leverage even without the currency impact, a quick question on the delta in the legal and consulting expense year-on-year. I don\u2019t know if you can give us the dollar amount for each quarter or just the delta, just curious how much that was a contributor? Todd Gibbons : Yes. The consulting and legal expense did decline on a year-over-year basis a little. We are seeing some of the dividends from the lower litigation defense charges as well as lower consulting expenses related to a number of our strategic platforms. That was offset somewhat by higher consulting expenses related to some of the regulatory compliance efforts, especially around improving the qualitative process in our CCAR as well as the resolution recovery planning. So on a year-over-year basis I think it was down about $20 million. Glenn Schorr : That means the bulk of the 300 basis points on your operating leverage is the structural improvements stuff? Todd Gibbons : That is correct. Yes, it\u2019s beyond that. A lot of it\u2019s coming \u2013 obviously the biggest expense is in the staff expense and so that\u2019s where most of it\u2019s coming. Operator : Alright. Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Sir your line is open. Alex Blostein : Great. Good morning everybody. Todd, it might be a little premature, but as we think about 2016 you guys obviously had a great job this year controlling expenses and some of that\u2019s FX related, but as you noted and a lot of it is just kind of core improvement. Given the fact that it sounds like you made a lot of progress on the regulatory front and getting those systems in place, where are we I guess in the pace of growth of regulatory-related expenses and as we think out into next year, is there still enough you guys can do in the core business to keep expenses kind of flattish to down? Todd Gibbons : Yes, I think, Alex it\u2019s a little early in our planning process. We continue to identify through the business improvement process additional actions that we can take. We do anticipate as I had indicated in the fourth quarter, a bit of a pop on some of the regulatory cost as we further build out some of the compliance and risk functions. I would say it\u2019s a little early to call it for next year, but we do see a number of continued opportunities and our goal is, as you will even see in this quarter, as the guidance that we gave for the fourth quarter is to keep things flat on a year-over-year basis. Depending on the revenue growth and where the revenue comes from, that could be more challenging. Alex Blostein : Got it. And then just around balance sheet management, so you guys have been charging forward deposits in Europe for the last couple of quarters, I guess. Any thoughts in doing the same in the U.S. given the fact that the balance sheet came down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, but overall still pretty elevated? So, any thoughts around charging for deposits here? Gerald Hassell : Yes. Alex, I will take that. We do have a team working with our Treasury group and our Investment Services group at the U.S. client base. And making sure whatever deposits we do have from them are ideal operational deposits versus non-valuable deposits and experimenting with certain types of clients and client segments whether they can be priced differently than what they are today and either they pay for it or pay for the use of the balance sheet or they move the deposits somewhere else. And so we are doing it on a selected basis. We haven\u2019t put through any charges yet, but we are having conversations with certain clients in certain client segments. Todd Gibbons : I think we also benefit from having the ability in the portal to be able to help our clients sweep cash into money market mutual funds, both our own and other providers. So, we can at least retain some of the distribution fees associated with it. Operator : Alright, thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. On the asset servicing side, you are able to keep fees flat quarter-to-quarter even with sec lending and equity market declines. I am just wondering, did you always start to recognize revenue from the T. Rowe contract? And how do we start to understand how that builds forth over time? It seems like the underlying core servicing and new business was quite good relative to the market conditions. So, I was just wondering if you could flush that out for us? Brian Shea : Yes, the asset servicing \u2013 it\u2019s Brian Shea speaking. The asset servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year. It\u2019s driven by a combination of global collateral services, broker dealer services and the core asset servicing fees, so pretty good performance overall. I think, from a T. Rowe Price perspective, we on-boarded the T. Rowe Price middle office team in August and we began to receive some revenue from middle office operational services from T. Rowe Price in August. We will be then \u2013 we will be moving towards a fund accounting conversion from their existing fund accounting platform to ours and then a new middle office platform in stages. And as we implement each stage, we expect to have additional revenue growth from each stage through the execution process. And importantly, we see this as a secular trend among investment managers who are looking for much more variable cost by share economies of scale services both from middle office services and technology platforms as well. Gerald Hassell : Very little revenues in the third quarter from T. Rowe. Ken Usdin : Okay. So, then what was the \u2013 what drove the sequential growth ex-T. Rowe then across the businesses aside from sec lending decline? Todd Gibbons : Organic growth, global collateral services growth, broker dealer services growth, all contributed to asset servicing year-over-year improvement. Brian Shea : Sequential improvement, yes. Todd Gibbons : And sequential improvement, yes, sure. Operator : Alright, thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Just to maybe zero in on the short-term rate environment, a couple of things, I guess. What\u2019s your outlook for money market fee waivers into fourth quarter given just the recent pullback in some of the treasury and repo yields? And then also on the balance sheet for the quarter, we saw an uptick in securities portfolio yields, maybe you just talk about the driver of that. It looks like the rate on the MMDAs went to zero on the liabilities side. So, maybe if you can talk about those dynamics? Todd Gibbons : Okay, I will \u2013 good morning, Brian, it\u2019s Todd. In terms of fee waivers, there is not a heck of a lot of noise there. We have given a $0.06 to $0.08 impact overall per quarter. And I would expect it\u2019s going to be well within that range. It was kind of in the middle of that range in the third quarter. And so we are seeing some noise on yields with the potential government shutdown. And your second \u2013 what was your second question, Brian? Brian Bedell : On the results in the third quarter on the drivers of \u2013 there was an uptick in the government and other securities lines in the securities portfolio and then also on the, in fact, the MMDA went from 13 basis points to 0, I just wonder if that\u2019s sustainable? Todd Gibbons : Yes. In terms of the \u2013 and you are talking about the securities portfolio, our proprietary portfolio, it is up from last year at this time fairly substantially and we did get some yields out of it. Basically, we repositioned cash once we had a full understanding of the LCR and it was acknowledged that we could use to help the maturity account and still have an asset considered as a high-quality liquid asset. So, at that point in time, we took down inter-bank placements and we increased our securities, increased our duration for a little bit in the portfolio and also increased the yield. That\u2019s been a little bit of change over the past couple of quarters, but we think that\u2019s relatively stable and that\u2019s why we are forecasting into the fourth quarter flat NIR relative to the third quarter. In terms of the MMDAs going down, I don\u2019t know of course \u2013 I don\u2019t see any impact to that degree at this point in time. Brian Bedell : Okay. And the interest deposits are still in that 50 to 70 billion camp? Todd Gibbons : That\u2019s where we would estimate them. Yes, Brian. Brian Bedell : Okay. And then just a follow-up on asset management, it is really benefiting in the LDI side from the flows coming out of defined benefit pension plans. As you think about the revenue capture that you get in the LDI versus the stuff that you will be losing in the index and in the active, is that an accretive swap? It sounds like that could obviously a longer term trend, if you just want to comment on that? Todd Gibbons : Yes. So, index fees, as you know, are very low and the large majority of our index assets are institutional, so they are truly on the low end of the fee range. LDI has single-digit management fees, many of those mandates also have performance fees, so a lot of the performance fees that we are in actually come from LDI mandates. So, it\u2019s \u2013 so, we have to think about it from a blended management and performance fee perspective. The only thing I would tell you is that when we take on an LDI mandate, we are frequently taking on a large majority of a client\u2019s total portfolio. So, they maybe reducing their equity and other exposures that are managed by others and moving their portfolio, sometimes their whole portfolio to us in LDI. So, a lot of the LDI growth we have seen have been \u2013 where pension plans have either taken a portion, or again, in some cases, the large majority of their plan and moved it to us. Index assets are a pretty interesting flow dynamic to watch. They have a lot to do with just the overall exposure, some very large clients will have the used index products to get data exposure to equity markets and fixed income markets. And given the volatility you have seen the outflows we have had in equity index strategies that we have mentioned in the last quarter and I will say again this quarter, some of the flows in index are very large flows from single clients and so not really as connected to what we are seeing in LDI. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Brennan Hawken of UBS. Sir, your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I understand that what you can say on this might be limited at this point, but is there anyway you can help us think about any potential liabilities and other headwinds from the SunGard outage at this point? And how you feel about your ability to pass those liabilities on to SunGard? Todd Gibbons : Okay. Brian, this is Todd. I will take some of that, maybe I can turn it over to my colleagues as well. In terms of the financial impact, we did incur some incidentals as you might expect in the quarter and those ran through the numbers. And we did cover the related charges that are \u2013 some of our clients would have experienced and we did take that as a charge in the third quarter as well. In terms of any differences in making investors whole, we don\u2019t see as we have gone through the reconciling process, we don\u2019t see much in the way and there certainly could be some of that. And we have of course have reserved our right to include SunGard any recoveries that we will be looking to make. That\u2019s about where we are financially. Gerald Hassell : And just broadly Brennan, we have been very proactive with our clients, making sure that they were \u2013 they have been covered in terms of their out of pockets or when they have went through a challenging week, so we wanted to make sure we were proactive in covering their costs and taking care of them. Investors, at the end of they day between the \u201cmachine generated NAVs\u201d and the process, the protocol we followed at the time, was miniscule. So we felt good about the process that was employed. And so we are actively working with the clients, working with their fund boards, making sure that they fully understand what happened and how we recovered and why the system is stable and safe. So we are moving forward. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. And then certainly, we have talked actually to some of your clients and they have described as good partners for this, so heard that on the other side as well. So thanks for that. And then just a quick one on capital, can you quantify or give us a sense about how much of your advanced RWAs are in up risk at this point? Todd Gibbons : Yes. So Brennan, this is Todd again. It\u2019s a very big number. And that may change as the regulators reconsider the standardized approach. But as there have been \u2013 the methodology is informed by external losses or losses at third parties and as there have been bigger and bigger losses, that gets filtered into our model and as a result, keeps driving up the risk weighted assets. So the number is about a \u2013 really probably a little over a third or right around a third of our total risk weighted assets in the advanced approach. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Mike Mayo of CLSA. Sir, your line is open. Gerald Hassell : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : Can you hear me? Gerald Hassell : Now, we can hear you better. Thank you. Mike Mayo : Sorry about that. Can I just get a clarification, your assets under custody are flat in a down market, second quarter to third quarter, is that explained by the global collateral services and broker dealer services or is there something else going on? Gerald Hassell : It\u2019s organic growth. Brian Shea : Yes. So Mike assets \u2013 it\u2019s Brian Shea, assets under custody most recently are up 1% year-over-year, flat sequentially as you mentioned. Currency and market values had a negative effect. If you had a constant currency and constant market, you would seem more like a 3% growth rate in our AUC/A which is pretty solid. And as you know, our focus is not exclusively on AUC/A growth or pure revenue growth or pure market share growth, but we have shifted our focus towards better profitability and creating more value for clients and shareholders. I guess, the best example of that which Gerald mentioned earlier is that we are repositioning our UK TA business and we are actively repositioning as a global institutional bundled service and reducing the focus on local UK retail TA. So, we are actually pushing AUC/A out in that environment, but we are going to improve our profitability in the process and that\u2019s the goal. Todd Gibbons : And it was in the quarter that we on-boarded T. Rowe, Mike. So that was a substantial reason for the sequential \u2013 not having any material sequential impact. Mike Mayo : Okay, that makes sense. We have heard a lot about pricing for better profitability for 3 years, 4 years, not just from you but for the whole sub-segment. I mean are you raising your hurdle rates, are you instructing your relationship managers to do something differently. I know you have mentioned that you have had these sorts of pricing conversations with the kind of lower tier accounts, but can you provide anything else more tangible, more than just the UK example? Brian Shea : Sure, Mike. It\u2019s Brian again. So I think you have heard us talking in the past about up pricing small accounts, raising minimums, enforcing minimums and etcetera. And we have done quite a bit of that over the past few years and made some progress for sure. But now, what\u2019s happening is a slightly different thing, which is we formed a client pricing strategy group and the focus of it is to align the drivers of our costs and our client pricing to drive more rational behavior and to end with the clients. We believe there is a real opportunity to lower costs end to end with our clients in partnership and we are using pricing strategies and data to inform the clients in a way and to incent the clients to actually implement low cost behavior. So for example, we have online systems that clients can use, which are more efficient and to provide better service and yet clients are still faxing us things. So we are putting incentives in place to move towards the online systems and use the more rational service delivery, that actually lowers the client\u2019s costs and make them more efficient as well. And so there is a series of things like that that we are working on and we will be consulting with our clients and trying to drive lower end to end cost with them in a rational way. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Sir, your line is open. Jim Mitchell : Okay, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on capital, with the bank SLR at 4.6, needing to get to 6, is there anything you could in terms of shifting around assets from the holding company to the bank to kind of shore that up, because that\u2019s obviously more of a constraint than the firm wide SLR, how do we think about that if we are in a lower for longer and higher deposit type environment? Gerald Hassell : Yes. Jim, that\u2019s exactly what we intend to do. So I think you hit the point. We think we can probably downstream capital in a way that pumps up the capital at the bank over the capital at the holding company. There will be a little bit of cost of that, but it won\u2019t be huge. So we don\u2019t need to execute that right now. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And do we have to think about \u2013 do you have to incorporate I mean maybe we don\u2019t know yet, but just thinking about next year\u2019s CCAR, it will capture 2018, do you need to build a glide path into next year\u2019s CCAR for SLR in any way or do you have time to get there? Gerald Hassell : Yes. The CCAR, next year\u2019s CCAR specifically excludes the SLR, so that will go into effect in 2017. But I think any prudent analysis, so this kind of get into the qualitative side of it. I think that we are going to have to demonstrate that we have a reasonable glide path and we have a way to get there. So I think that will be from a qualitative side, but it\u2019s excluded from the actual quantitative side of next year\u2019s CCAR. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Adam Beatty of Bank of America. Sir, your line is open. Adam Beatty : Thank you and good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups on asset servicing, firstly on SunGard, I want to close the loop on that. Have you seen any kind of extended duration of the contracting process, any impact on your discussions with perspective clients due to that? And then on the cost side, is there any run rate cost that you would expect from maybe additional safeguards or what have you? Thanks. Brian Shea : Yes, it\u2019s Brian Shea. So, we have been in constant communication with our clients throughout \u2013 especially the affected clients during the period of time that there was an impact. But actually, we have extended our outreach to clients to put this in context and to help them understand the details of \u2013 and had meetings and dialogues of well over a thousand clients to make sure that they understand what\u2019s going on. I would say our clients have been working with us very closely and been very supportive and understanding during the incident and are getting tremendous amount of transparency from us and from SunGard around the actual incident. And what we are doing about it going forward in terms of ensuring our ability to deliver service on critical activities and have systems in place that are more reliable and more resilient both from a vendor management perspective and our own internal system. So we are using every opportunity here that we \u2013 to learn from this experience and to actually make us a more resilient, reliable partner. And I think our clients appreciate that and are getting very good insight from us about that. In terms of the financial perspective, I will let Todd... Todd Gibbons : Yes. At this point, we have not identified any material increase in costs as a result of this. We did incur pretty meaningful cost in the third quarter, which we ran through the numbers. But we \u2013 there could be some to your point, but we don\u2019t \u2013 at least we haven\u2019t identified any that would be material. Adam Beatty : I appreciate that. Thanks. And then on the T. Rowe relationship, it sounds like there is going to be some layering on of costs and revenues, what\u2019s your expected timing given your implementation plan of number one, achieving kind of a net profit contribution from that and also in terms of just getting to steady state in terms of revenues and costs? Todd Gibbons : Yes. We are still in the investment stage of the strategic relationship. And as you know, we have on-boarded a couple hundred plus people in August, and we began to receive some revenue although as Gerald mentioned, it\u2019s on the modest end. We will do the fund accounting conversion in 2016 and that will have the additional \u2013 providing more services and we will get some more revenue associated with it. And the final stage will be the middle office platform conversion, which I don\u2019t have the timing directly in front of me, but let\u2019s just say \u201817. And at the end of which, we expect to have a good strategic relationship that\u2019s profitable and beneficial to both parties. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will be coming from the line of Mr. Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Sir, your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Todd, can you share with us on the deposits that you are assessing a fee on what percentage of your total deposits are actually in the environments that actually have negative rates and of that amount what percentage are you charging a fee and one non-interest bearing deposits included in that as well? Todd Gibbons : Non-interest bearing deposits could be included in that, typically overseas. You can go either way. So about a third of our deposits are non-dollar and so of that, the majority are euro and so that would be the number that would be, at this point in time exposed to a fee. I mean, any other currencies like Swiss franc and the Danish currency, it\u2019s a pretty small number that doesn\u2019t even move the needle. So it\u2019s really basically the euro where we are assessing anything of any size. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just as a follow-up, I may have missed it. You mentioned about the other operating expenses, including the one-time costs associated with the SunGard issue, what was the dollar amount of that, those one-time costs? Todd Gibbons : We didn\u2019t disclose the dollar amount, Gerard. But if you look at that number and you can see the sequential increase in other, most of that was related to \u2013 or a substantial part of that was related to SunGard matter. Gerard Cassidy : Great, thank you. Gerald Hassell : Okay. Well, thank you very much everyone for dialing in. We really appreciate it and your questions. If you have additional follow-up questions, please give Valerie Haertel a call. And again, we thank you for your participation and support. Operator : If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.",

And welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie Haertel : Thank you, Nicole and thank you everyone for joining us. As Nicole mentioned, we are reporting our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as members of our executive leadership team. Our fourth quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call today speak only as of today, January 21, 2015 and we will not update forward-looking statements. As a final note, we plan to file our 2015 10-K on February 26th. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald? Gerald Hassell : Great. Thanks, Valerie and welcome everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. Our fourth quarter results capped off what I think was a very good year. We demonstrated that our strategic plan has positioned us well to perform in all operating environments. Even with geopolitical instability, emerging market weakness, higher regulatory compliance requirements and low interest rates, we executed on our strategic priorities and focused on what was within our control. For the full year, EPS was up 19%, total revenue was up 2% while total expenses were down 2%, resulting in more than 400 basis points of positive operating leverage. Net interest revenue was up 5% and we improved our pre-tax operating margin to 31%. And finally, our return on tangible common equity was a very healthy 21%. So, we are on track to achieve our three-year goals, targets which call for healthy earnings growth, not reliant on improved market conditions. So, turning to the fourth quarter itself, adjusted earnings per share was $0.68 and that excludes $0.11 per share for the impact of the previously disclosed impairment charge related to a recent court decision, which Todd will discuss in more detail in a moment, and litigation and restructuring charges. That puts earnings per share up 17% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. For the quarter, again on an adjusted basis, total revenue was up 2%, total expense was down 2%, and we generated over 300 basis points of positive operating leverage, mainly driven by our business improvement process. Net interest revenue was up 7% year-over-year and our return on tangible common equity was 19% for the quarter. Now looking at our progress against our strategic priorities, as I said in the past, our first priority is driving profitable revenue growth. We have heightened focus on disciplined revenue growth, which means paying particular attention to our clients, profitability, and shareholder value versus gross revenues and market share. During 2015, we made progress in a number of different fronts. We are focused on deepening our client relationships by leveraging our expertise and determining how we can add further value to them and increase the acceptance rates of our services. At the same time, we\u2019re also examining each business and service that we offer to ensure that we are receiving value for what we deliver. The strategic platform investments we\u2019ve been making continue to pay off. We\u2019ve been able to create efficiencies and savings for us, and in many cases, for our clients as well. We are now in the early stages of rolling out our new platform NEXEN, which will deliver additional functionality and capabilities to all of our clients. On investment management, we extended our liability driven investment strategy into the U.S. market through our Cutwater acquisition. Our U.S. retail and wealth management initiatives continue to add to our new business platform. This week, we announced plan to acquire Silicon Valley wealth manager Atherton Lane Advisers, which have $2.7 billion of assets under management. This investment further strengthens our footprint in one of the fastest growing U.S. wealth markets. And we\u2019re also pleased to welcome them to the BNY Mellon team. And in the U.S. retail space, we had success with the Spanish global fixed income strategy, which was the highest growth product in Morningstar\u2019s world bond category in 2015. And in the markets group, we continued to enhance our collateral management systems and foreign exchange trading platforms, all to drive efficiencies, capture more volume, and improve the opportunities for future revenue growth. And our second priority is executing on our business improvement process. We\u2019ve been meeting or exceeding our business process goals and are on target to achieve the structural cost reductions that we shared at Investor Day in October of 2014. During 2015 we simplified and automated global processes, optimized and streamlined our technology infrastructure, and shrank our real estate portfolio. During the fourth quarter, we took a number of additional actions to improve the Company\u2019s business and financial performance. Let me give you couple of examples. We are implementing robotics and machine learning to eliminate repetitive non-value added work, enabling a quicker automated process while reducing wasting costs. We completed three proofs of concept, all demonstrating a high degree of accuracy and processing, reducing transactional processing time, and eliminating manual steps, all of which enables us to redeploy resources to activities that create greater value for our clients. Last quarter, I mentioned the new client pricing strategy group that we created to analyze and measure service delivery costs to better align our costs with client pricing. This group is now reviewing balance sheet related business practices such as overdraft as well as manual transaction activities, a new strategy around physical securities as well as standardizing pricing across our business units. We\u2019re also continuing to build out our global delivery centers in lower cost locations to allow for further expansion and position migration. And we moved over 230 full time staff positions to global delivery centers during the quarter and more than a 1,000 full time positions in 2015. And we\u2019ve also begun to implement bring-your-own-device strategy reducing number of data terminals across the Company and have cut back redundant price increase. These efforts, large and small are part of our continuous, comprehensive and sustainable process to create efficiencies and savings consistent with our continuous improvement culture. Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. During 2015, we reduced and simplified our counterparty exposures, invested in and focused on compliance, risk management and control function, examined and enhanced our vendor management practices following the SunGard incident, incorporating license learned and sharing those with our clients, and made significant investments in our resolution and recovery plans. We also introduced a more robust data governance framework that will strengthen our data collection and analytical capabilities, which is important in meeting all of our regulatory requirements globally. And lastly, we demonstrated our strong business recovery capability in response to the historic flooding in Chennai, India where we have thousands of employees. Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively and wisely. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet as well as capital and liquidity positions while returning value to our shareholders. So, in accordance with our 2015 capital plan which authorized us to repurchase up to $3.1 billion of our stock, we repurchased $431 million in share and we distributed a $188 million in dividends during the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased approximately $2.4 billion in shares and distributed more than $760 million in dividends. Over the last four years, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 13% which is among the best in the industry. And from a regulatory ratio standpoint, all of our key capital ratios improved as we move toward full compliance. This quarter, our CET1 ratio under the fully phased-in advanced approach, improved to 9.5%, and we increased our supplementary leverage ratio to 4.9%. We also remain in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio which became effective in 2015 for the full phase-in period that extends through and 2017. We remain very confident that we will be in full compliance with all of the regulatory ratio requirements at the time of or ahead of the required dates. And our fifth priority is to attract, develop and retain top talent. We have continued to focus on investing in our people; we have refreshed the tools and processes we use to manage, grow and get the most of our talent. And we are seeing the benefits of prioritizing talent, as reflected in our financial performance. So, as we look ahead, given the rocky start to the year in the financial markets, we expect our business improvement process to be increasingly critical to our results going forward. We remain confident that our strategy and relentless focus on the execution of our priorities will enable us to achieve the three year financial targets we shared on Investor Day and importantly, deliver value-added services and solutions to our clients. So with that, let me turn it over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thanks Gerald and good morning everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document, will start with slide seven. Before I walk you through the details of the financial results, let me provide you with an overview of the court decision that Gerald noted which resulted in a fourth quarter after tax impairment charge of $0.10. The charge resulted from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision related to $312 million secured loan we had to Sentinel Management Group, which filed for bankruptcy in 2007. Following a favorable December 2014 decision favorable for us by Federal Court finding that our lien against Sentinel was valid, we received payment of the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. Subsequently, the bankruptcy trustee appealed the decision and the appellate court invalidated our lien on the collateral that supported the loan. The impact of this decision is that we will have an unsecured claim in Sentinel bankruptcy. As a result, we took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of $170 million on the pretax basis or a $106 million after tax, representing our estimate of the probable losses. Turning now to our fourth quarter results and the financial highlights document, we will start with slide seven. I\u2019ll focus on our non-GAAP or operating results for the quarter and the year-over-year comparisons. On an operating basis, our fourth quarter EPS was $0.68 that\u2019s up 17% versus year ago. On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter revenue was up 2%, expenses down 2%, and we had 308 basis points of positive operating leverage. As we\u2019ve noted in prior quarters, the strength of U.S. dollar continues to impact results negatively for revenue and positively for expense. Net impact from currency translation is minimal however to our overall consolidated financial results. Adjusted for the dollar, revenue would have been up approximately 3% and expenses a little less than 1%. However, our investment management business is impacted more significantly from the strength of the dollar as significant component of investment management revenue is from non U.S. dollar sources. If you reference page six of our earnings release, you will see the two currencies that impact investment management the most, it\u2019s the pound and the euro, and they were down 4% and 12% respectively against the U.S. dollar. Income before taxes was up 10% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. On a year-over-year basis, our pretax margin increased approximately 200 basis points to 30% in the fourth quarter. Return on tangible common equity was 19% for the quarter. Now moving to slide 10, that details our operating results for the full year; you can see the 2% revenue growth and 2% decline year-over-year in expenses as Gerald mentioned that resulted in 420 basis points of positive operating leverage. Income before taxes grew 12%, EPS up 19%. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 5%, expenses were up 1%. Slide 11 illustrates key metrics of our performance that demonstrate solid execution of our strategic priorities in 2015. You can see the four quadrants here. EPS up 19%; non-interest expense down; pre-tax operating margin expanded nearly 300 basis points; and return on tangible common equity is also up 300 basis points to 21%. Slide 12 shows our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 1% year-over-year, down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects growth in global collateral services, broker-dealer services, and higher securities lending revenue, which is partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower client activity. Clearing services fees were down 2% year-over-year and sequentially. Both decreases were primarily driven by industry consolidation as three large clients had transitioned to self clearing firms. Partially mitigating this impact is the new businesses we are on-boarding from a competitor who exited the business and through a combination of net new business and expense control. We expect clearing to be pre-tax income neutral in 2016. Issuer service fees were up 3% year-over-year and down 36% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects net new business and lower money market fee waivers in Corporate Trust that was offset a bit by the stronger dollar. The sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonality in DRs. As we\u2019ve noted in prior quarters, our Corporate Trust performance has been improving; this quarter it was a positive contributor to our growth. Treasury services fees were down 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects higher compensating balance credits and lower volumes. Fourth quarter investment management and performance fees were down 2% year-over-year that would have been up 1% on a constant currency basis. And that was driven by higher performance fees and a slight reduction in money market fee waivers, partially offset by lower equity markets. Sequentially, investment management and performance fees increased 4% and that\u2019s primarily due to the normal performance fees seasonality. Performance fees were $55 million and that compares to $40 million a year ago, driven by stronger performance across a wide breadth of strategies including a sharp increase in equity long-only fees. FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 15% year-over-year and it was down 3% sequentially. FX revenue of $165 million was flat year-over-year, down 8% sequentially. Year-over-year, we saw lower standing instruction volumes and lower volatility which were offset by higher volumes in other trading programs. Also included is the impact of hedging activities of foreign currency placements. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower volumes and volatility and seasonally lower deposit receipts related activity and that was partially offset by the hedging activity for foreign currency placements. Other trading revenue increased to $8 million compared with the trading loss of $14 million in a year ago quarter and a loss of $1 million in Q3. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the losses on hedging activities within one of the investment management boutiques that we recorded in fourth quarter of last year. Financing-related fees increased 19% to $51 million and that\u2019s compared to the year ago quarter and decreased 28% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher fees related to tri-party repo activity. In the second quarter, we noted that some of our clients could moderate their usage or possibly find alternative sources for this financing in the future; we actually did end to see this take place during the fourth quarter. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower underwriting fees and the impact of lower fees related to the superior secured intraday credit I just mentioned. Investment and other income of $93 million compared with $78 million in the year ago quarter and $59 million in the third quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher other income related to termination fees in our clearing business and that was associated with the client transitions that we mentioned, as well as seed capital gains and that\u2019s partially offset by lower asset-related gains and lease gains. The sequential increase in investment and other income primarily reflects higher asset-related gains, income from corporate and bank owned life insurance, and other income related to clearing termination fees partially offset by lease residual losses. Slide 13 shows the drivers of our investment management performance that should help explain the underlying business. Assets under management of $1.6 3 trillion were down 4% year-over-year, driven by stronger dollar and lower equity markets, and they were flat sequentially. We had long-term outflows of $11 billion, $16 billion out of index funds and $5 billion into active funds. Additionally, we had $2 billion of short-term cash flows. For the full year, we had long-term outflows of $17 billion, mainly in the equity and index investments, partially offset by flows into LDIs and alternatives. Our wealth management and U.S. intermediary expansion initiatives continues to show some progress. Wealth management loans were up 21%, deposits were up 6%. In addition, we announced the acquisition of the Silicon Valley wealth manager, there is AUM of 2.7 billion and 700 high net worth clients, an investment that expands our presence in this fast growing market. In U.S. intermediary, we had strong performance in a number of investment strategies, bringing to organic growth rates that exceeded their Morningstar categories. Turning to our investment services metrics on slide 14, assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $28.9 trillion, up 1% or $400 billion year-over-year, reflecting net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower market values. On a constant currency basis, year-over-year growth would have been up approximately 3%. Linked quarter, AUC/A was also up $400 billion. We estimate total new assets under custody and administration business wins are $49 billion in the fourth quarter. And that gives us a total of $1.2 trillion of new business wins during the year. Fourth quarter net new business was below average. Just as a reminder AUC/A wins are episodic and they can vary from quarter to quarter. Our pipelines continue to look healthy. And as we\u2019ve discussed, our strategy has been to prioritize organic growth by deepening our existing client relationships and selectively adding new businesses -- a new business versus simply growing market share. Now looking at some other metrics for investments services, the market value of securities on loan at period end was down 4%; average loans grew 4% while average deposits were down slightly. Our broker-dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances grew 2%; the clearing metrics were mix; DARTS volume in large long-term mutual fund asset were down, while active accounts were up modestly. The net decline in sponsored DR program reflects our continued focus in exiting low activity programs. Turning to net interest revenue on slide 15, you will see that NIR on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 7% versus the year ago quarter and it was flat from the third quarter. The year-over-year increase in NIR reflects higher yields due to a shift out of cash into securities and loans as well as lower interest expense on deposits. While the volume of earning assets declined 2%, their yield increased 6 basis points year-over-year and the yield on interest bearing deposits decreased to 2 basis points. Sequentially NIR was flat. Our net interest margin for the quarter was 99 basis points, 8 basis points higher than year ago quarter and 1 basis-point higher than prior quarter. Deposits were down 9 billion sequentially on average that was the expected response to the Fed\u2019s a first rate move. Our models continue to estimate some additional loss of deposits as the fed continues to raise rates, as implied by the forward curve at year end and then increasing in line with our Investor Day goals. Turning to slide 16, you will see that non-interest expense on an adjusted basis declined 2% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. Year-over-year increase in non-interest expense reflects lower expenses in all categories except staff expense. Now, there are few expense items that were both positive and negative to earnings that I\u2019d like to call out and I think it will help give you a bit of context. Staff expenses grew by 4% year-over-year and that\u2019s reflecting severance cost of approximately $55 million in ongoing support of our business improvement process and an adjustment of roughly $30 million related to updated information received from an administrator of health care benefits, all that was partially offset by the impact of curtailing U.S. pension plan earlier in the year. Decrease in other expense primarily reflects adjustments of approximately $35 million to our estimate for bank assessment charges. And that estimate included the European single resolution fund and it was partially offset by higher asset based taxes. Factoring in these items, we once again showed strong expense control. Turning to capital on slide 17, fully phased-in and common equity tier 1 ratio increased by 20 basis points to 9.50 that was driven by lower risk-weighted assets as capital was about flat. Our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 4.9% this quarter, principally due to a reduction in our balance sheet as well as reduction in off balance sheet exposures. A couple of other notes about the quarter from our press release, as you will see in the release on page three, the effective tax rate was 20.1% which is approximately 5% lower than our previous guidance. The rate is lower approximately 3% due to the impact of the impairment charge that I mentioned at the beginning of my comments and approximately 2% lower, driven by the benefit of a more favorable geographic mix of earnings and a little higher tax-exempt income. On page 11, you will see some investment securities portfolio highlights. At quarter-end, our net unrealized pre-tax gain on our portfolio was $357 million that compared to $1.05 billion at the end of September, the difference in value is principally due to the increase interest rates. Before I wrap up, let me summarize several items that I\u2019ve discussed in this quarter. As we\u2019d indicated, the impairment and litigation charges resulted as $0.11 charge, and we\u2019re negatively impacted by increased compensation cost driven by severance and health care cost adjustments that I just spoke out that amounted to be about 5%. On the benefit side, we benefited by reduced bank assessment charges, lower tax rate, and termination fees related to our clearing businesses which added about $0.06 to earnings. These items in aggregate had a negative impact of about $0.10 in the fourth quarter to our reported earnings. Now, I\u2019d like to provide you with a few points to factor into your thinking about 2016. As you know, we\u2019ve been planning and managing to the flat rate scenario as outlined at our Investor Day in late 2014. Now that the Fed has increased rates, we\u2019re using the forward rate curve assumptions. The rate increases obviously are positive for us but we are still facing global economic and geopolitical challenge as evidenced by the market\u2019s sharp decline year-to-date. As a result, we are cautious about how this set of challenges will impact the Fed thinking about future rate increases. Additionally, we are concerned about the equity market performance impact to our organization. With that said, let me provide you with our current thinking as we look ahead to the first quarter and the full year. We expect the modest increase in NIR and NIM in the first quarter. With respect to the recapture of money market fee waivers, we continue to expect to recover 70% with the 50 basis-point increase in rates, 25 of that increase has already occurred. On expenses, our goal is to keep expense growth flat in 2016. However, higher rates will eliminate fee waivers and that will drive the higher distribution expenses. Largely as a result of the higher distribution expense, we expect the total expense growth to be in the range 1% to 2% next year. In the first quarter, we expect to see a $15 million increase in the bank assessment charges and it should run at that for the full year. And we would expect staff expense to be impacted in the first quarter by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense for retiree eligible employees that typically takes place in the first quarter. We expect our tax rate for the full year to be approximately 25% to 26%. We expect to continue to repurchase shares under our current authorization, both in Q1 and Q2. Our repurchase for the second half of the year will be contingent upon the Federal Reserve not objecting to our CCAR request later this year. We think our performance, both in the quarter and throughout 2015 underscores that our strategic plan has positioned us well to perform in some tough operating environments. We are focused on our strategic priorities; we\u2019re executing on them; and we remain on track to achieve our three-year goals. With that, let me hand it back to Gerald. Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Todd. And Nicole, I think we can now open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, on the expense front, thanks Todd for walking through some of the onetimers that impacted the results. How should we think about the go forward or the direct [ph] jumping off point, based on some of that noise that we saw here in the fourth quarter? Todd Gibbons : Yes, I would -- so, as I walked you through each one of those, I would take the category run rates down by about the amount that I mentioned. Brennan Hawken : Okay. The specific numbers you gave, offsets and upward pressure, were the right numbers to rebase and then come up with the baseline starting off point, right? Todd Gibbons : I think that\u2019s a fair start, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. And then thinking about the clearing headwind, how should we think about that rolling into next quarter; what\u2019s the right way to think about the revenue? Because I know that I think you had said at a conference that there might be some further headwind here in 1Q, maybe their timing of when the clients came off in 4Q might not have been fully reflected in the 4Q run rate. So, how should we think about that coming into 1Q from here? Todd Gibbons : Yes, I think that\u2019s right. Maybe Brian Shea can take it on, Brain? Brian Shea : Yes, sure. I mean the clearing revenue fee pressure is really driven by few large client exists, primarily driven by the exit of Barclays and Credit Suisse from the U.S. wealth management market entirely, which were two large clients. And those -- Barclays exited in the middle of the fourth quarter and Credit Suisse began their exit in the fourth quarter, so they are partially out. I think you will see continued pressure on the fee revenue line in clearing services for the next few quarters. I think it will be partially offset by a couple of things. We actually had a really strong new business year in clearing services in 2015. We were benefiting by the exit of a large clearing competitor from the market and picked up quite a few high quality clients. Those clients tend to be less fee revenue driven and they tend to be a little bit more balance sheet and lending driven, so that the growth they drive will partially offset the fee decline but you will see some other growth in the NII instead of the fee line. And we also have pretty strong growth in the RIA custody and the prime business, and Pershing is also going to benefit immensely from the fee waiver restoration as rates rise which will help the fee line win as the Fed continues to move over whatever period of time they act on. So in the meantime, we\u2019re focused on strong expense discipline in the clearing business. And as Todd mentioned, we think we can keep the PTI flat in 2016 despite pressure on the fee line. Brennan Hawken :  Okay, Brain. Thanks for that. So basically, are you saying that the revenue headwind that we saw axing out the new business wins, right, just focusing on that first, should sustain for another couple of quarters and then you\u2019ve got the offsets that you highlighted picking up from there? Todd Gibbons : Yes, partially offsetting that with NII growth and some of the fees from the JP Morgan [ph] more clients offsetting. But I think there will be pressure on the fee line specifically for the next couple of quarters and we\u2019ll work hard to manage the expense to make sure the PTI impact is neutralized. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : So, just picking up on the clearing question, just want to make sure that we kind of put that question a bit. Are all the clients or all the transaction in the wealth management space as sort of been announced over the second half of 2015 or any kind of like reflected in the guidance, because I think some of them are closing later in 2016? Todd Gibbons : Yes. Alex Blostein : So, should we expect another kind of step down in fees in the second half of \u201816 or everything is already reflected from the clients that exited in 4Q? Gerald Hassell : No. So, it\u2019s a good point. There has been another large U.S. wealth manager that\u2019s announced the exit; it\u2019s another global SIFI that\u2019s announced their exit from the U.S. wealth management business. That transition out will probably take place in the fourth quarter of \u201816. So, that\u2019s not positive. On the other side of that though, we continue to have a strong pipeline of new business in clearing services. And frankly, we have a number of self clearing firms that are considering outsourcing their clearing. So, I hope that we are able to attract some significant new business that offsets that potential loss or the likely loss in the fourth quarter. Alex Blostein : And then Todd, shifting gears a little bit on to the balance sheet. It looks like if you kind of move across the buckets on the yield side, doesn\u2019t seem like many have them moved, I guess just as obviously the Fed hiked later in the quarter. Help us understand maybe just kind of the run rate of what the NIM we should look for starting 2016, assuming no further rate hikes, and kind of your expectation for the balance sheet, just kind of trying to rightsize NII outlook for 2016 versus 2015? Todd Gibbons : Yes. We would expect Alex modest growth. I think one of the frustrating things that you\u2019ve seen the 25 basis-point increase in the short rates and long rates have actually come down. So, the reinvestment activity is not going to benefit what we would have modeled or some percentage of the reinvestment. So, we would expect balances to come down a little bit, NIM to widen and overall net interest revenue to show a little bit of growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Luke Montgomery from Bernstein Research. Luke Montgomery : I just wanted to ask about the energy exposure in your C&I loan book. I think outstanding is $500 million, but there is another $5 billion unfunded commitments. So, I was wondering maybe if you could characterize the customers you\u2019re lending to, speak to covenants or other protections against those lenders drawing down lines of credit, if they get stressed, and then just generally your sense of whether this exposure is something to be concerned about? Gerald Hassell : Most of -- almost all of the exposure in the energy sector is to investment grade names. So, a lot of integrated firms, we do have some pipeline and refiners, and there is a little bit of E&P but that is to very high quality names. So at this point, we think it\u2019s a pretty solid growth. We might see some transitions in credits, but I do not expect to see any losses. Luke Montgomery : And then at your Investor Day a little over a year ago, I think you laid out the path to SLR compliance that you\u2019re targeting year-end 2017. Since then, you\u2019ve added 30 basis points; I think the total you\u2019re hoping for is 250 to 350 basis points of improvement. So, I wonder how you\u2019re thinking about accelerating the path there as we get closer phase-in date. And I think the biggest piece of the plan was deposit reduction. So what\u2019s the contingency plan given that rates, I mean you said yourself that you might not expect anymore rate hikes. So there is no help there. Todd Gibbons : So, what we\u2019ve seen to-date, so if you look at the -- we can\u2019t really look at the spot balance sheet, you\u2019ve got to look at the average balance sheet, because we do see some noise on your end on our balance sheet, but it\u2019s average that drives the ratio. So, if you look in the quarter, we did see a $9 billion reduction in balances in the quarter. And that\u2019s a pretty quick response to the rate move that we had seen. In addition so far this year, it\u2019s probably down an additional $8 billion. So we would have estimated that we\u2019d see about a $20 billion reduction in the first move. And if we see more, we\u2019ve indicated that would be in the 40 to 70 basis-point-- excuse me, $40 billion to 70 billion type of range as we get to a more normal range. If that doesn\u2019t happen, what we have done is we prioritized the entire balance sheet. We might have to take some actions against that for some of the less value deposits. At this point in time, we don\u2019t think we need to rush into compliance. We are building capital; we build about 800 million in a year even with 800 maybe a 100% payout ratio. And if the balance sheet does come down but -- and we can do some other things actually to track the balance sheet a little bit. We think we will grow ourselves pretty well into a reasonable rate without going anything exceptional to our clients. Operator : We will take our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Just one more on clearing, just to be clear on that. So, I think Brian or Todd, you were saying, you expect pre-tax profit for the clearing business in total to be flat from 2015 to 2016, do I have that right? Todd Gibbons : That\u2019s correct, Brian. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. And then\u2026 Brian Shea : I can add something there for you. The clearing fees are about 12% of our total revenues, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. And it has been a decent grower in the 5% to 6% range. So, it\u2019s going -- I think the team has done a great job managing our expenses and responding to the consolidation in industry that we\u2019ve seen here little bit. So, for a year, it might pause on its growth. Brian Bedell : It was good color from Brian on the fee dynamics there but maybe if I can just dovetail into the money market fee waivers, obviously 70% coming off of two hikes. What percentage do you think you will get at a full run rate on just the one hike and do you really need to wait to like get through 1Q and into 2Q to see that? Todd Gibbons : I think, it\u2019s just the beginning here; it\u2019s fairly linear. So, we right now the behaviors are seeing are consistent with what we had projected. So, we\u2019re seeing it now. Brian Bedell : Okay. Todd Gibbons : And it didn\u2019t show up very much in the fourth quarter, yes, we saw a little bit in the asset management side and little bit in the corporate trust side. Pershing tends to lag in the fee waiver abatement. So, we do think that there is always some acceleration into the first quarter. Brian Bedell : And then maybe just to -- I know you gave out the EPS drag from fee waivers, if you can give that number for 4Q and what you think it might be for 1Q? Todd Gibbons : Well, we\u2019ve indicated it\u2019s in the $0.06 to $0.08 range. And so, our file lets you do the math but we\u2019ve indicated the 50 basis-point move and I just indicated it was linear, would reduce it be 1%. So, I don\u2019t have to mess it up on the call here; you can figure that out. Brian Bedell : Fair enough. And maybe just then switching to the asset management business, maybe if Curtis is there, if he can comment on the acquisition. I guess more broadly on the potential from making more acquisitions for the business, given the recent declines in valuations and just comment on sovereign wealth spending exposure across the franchise? Curtis Arledge : First of all, we\u2019re very excited about the acquisition that we announced yesterday afternoon of Atherton Lane. And it\u2019s consistent with the strategy that we\u2019ve had in wealth management which is to go into a market. We actually have a team in San Francisco and in Palo Alto who are BNY Mellon employees and have been there for some time in San Francisco and then about a year ago in Palo Alto. But then to find a firm that fits culturally who has a great client base, as Todd said, 700 clients, very fast growing economy, and have that firm fit culturally with what we\u2019re doing, meaning that they think about the entire -- the holistic client need, everything from financial plans to how they think about generational wealth transfer, using trust, insurance and then obviously investments. So, we\u2019re going to bring them the sixth largest asset management firm in the world and all of the banking capabilities of BNY Mellon. And they are eager -- a big part of what makes this work is that they are eager to transition a firm that they\u2019ve grown very nicely since 2005, really to the next level and become part of a global franchise. So, we did this in Chicago with Talon in 2011, with I(3) in Toronto in 2010 and acquisitions that precede that. It\u2019s pretty much our strategy to get a toehold and then bring the full power of our institution to the clients in that region. And we love that strategy. And to the extent that we can -- in other MSAs, other markets where there is -- we think there is real opportunity for what we can do for clients to grow our capabilities, we love to continue to look at those acquisitions. I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019re extremely thoughtful about not just the terms and conditions of the acquisition but also that cultural fit is there. And it takes some time to identify and ensure that we have that in place. So, it\u2019s a pretty methodical process. Brian Bedell : Do you see more opportunities, given the valuation to clients; I guess I would say, is there pipeline significant? Curtis Arledge : Yes. So, I think that we\u2019re certainly spending time looking for other opportunities like Atherton Lane. So, I want to balance this, so yes, we would love to find other opportunities like that in other markets. And we look at them all the time. It\u2019s one of the great things is we\u2019re connected, Brian talked about Pershing and the rest of our Company has a lot of insight into high quality RI firms around the country. So, we\u2019re always monitoring it like scouting report as to who would be a good fit, who culturally is positioned and yes, we absolutely would love it. We also want to make sure that we execute because we want to make sure every time we do one of these that it works for both acquiring party and their clients. Brian Bedell : And just the sovereign wealth fund exposure in the institutional segment? Brian Shea : It\u2019s been an interesting year. You\u2019ve read I\u2019m sure many articles about sovereign wealth funds. At our Investor Day, we described that we were the second largest manager of sovereign wealth fund assets. So we obviously have a lot of clients in this client channel -- clients and assets. And I will tell you -- and I think we highlighted this at Investor Day, a significant portion of that is indexed assets. Todd and Gerald both referenced our flows. And a big portion of our outflows, both for this quarter and this year have been indexed related assets where the fees are quite small. So, we have absolutely -- you can see our outflows and index for the year. And without -- may not be appropriate to talk about any specific clients or client activity but in line with what you\u2019ve seen from the industry. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Todd, on the core businesses, can you just talk about -- I know ex market impacts, the servicing business ex securities, lending was a little soft. You cited in the press release activity. The wins this quarter across the assets were pretty low also. Can you just talk us to what do you think again ex the market impact; what\u2019s your outlook for servicing fee core ex securities lending growth and how much of a weight was the lower activity on the line this quarter? Todd Gibbons : And you also need to factor in the impact of the currency a bit of the stronger dollar because there are a fair amount of non-dollar revenues. So that\u2019s costing us somewhere between 200 basis points and 300 basis points in revenues. Ken Usdin : Sequentially, Todd? Todd Gibbons : Not sequentially, sequentially it\u2019s almost neutral. So it\u2019s not a big impact sequentially. Gerald Hassell : Ken, I think one way to look at it is revenue growth is a challenge. I mean look at everyone across the marketplace, trying to generate significant revenue growth is a challenge for everybody. We are winning in the places that we want to. We would certainly like to deepen our client relationships and provide more services to many of our existing clients. And I think we have a great solution set to offer. And so that\u2019s one of our key priorities is doing more within existing client base with great set of value-added services and solutions. But revenue growth is tough and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve said and remain incredibly diligent on the expense side. And that remains a focus and we still think we have more opportunities there. And that\u2019s what really propelled our earnings growth this year. And it\u2019s going to be one of the reasons for our success in 2016. So yes, it\u2019s a bit soft, we acknowledge that. We are redoubling our efforts on our client relationships but we\u2019ve got to pay a lot of attention to the expense base to deliver the earnings that you all are looking for and that we are looking for. Ken Usdin : Yes. And just on that point about operating leverage, again the market environment is going to make this a tough one to answer. But how much additional flexibility do you have on the expense base, if the environment doesn\u2019t quite pan out; can you commit to getting operating leverage? I know it\u2019s tough given where the start of the year is but how much flexibility do you think you have on top of the actions taken to continue to ratchet down expenses further? Todd Gibbons : Why don\u2019t I start that one and Brain then you might add. Brian has really been leading a significant component of our business improvement process. We still see a number of additional things that can generate some additional cost benefits. I must admit that fruit\u2019s probably a little higher on the three but there is still a fair amount of fruit. We\u2019re seeing our infrastructure cost continue to come down, we are using more automation tools, we\u2019ve got things like bringing our own device that Gerald alluded to, some of these are smaller dollars versus others, and our real estate strategy I think is paying off. We\u2019ve got ahead of where we thought we would be this year as we moved out of one lawsuit faster than we could and that brought our guidance for expenses in the occupancy space down and we reviewed our guidance because of that. We also see other real estate strategies that could add a bit. We see opportunity in some of our market data, actually probably find cheaper sources of market data and more appropriate, so we got better tools in place to determine who is using what and how we can deliver better services that are less costly. I don\u2019t Brain you have anything to add to that. Brian Shea : I would add Todd, I think you and Gerald covered many of them already but our mentality on this is, it is continuous improvement. So, we are going to keep driving this business improvement process regardless of the market environment whether it\u2019s worse or better. Even if rates rose 100 basis points, we\u2019d still be driving this because we think we can create sustainable shareholder value. So, all of the things that Todd mentioned, we are excited about the potential from these three pilots in robotics and the ability to start to scale that impact in 2016. The real estate portfolio, you know what we\u2019ve done in New York but that\u2019s actually a global process, so we will be getting more yields from that over time. We\u2019ve in-sourced a lot of application development, our cost per unit for development is better, and our capacity has actually increased. So, we see the opportunity to continue to do more on that. We\u2019ve talked about executing the private cloud; we have moved to significant amount of our legacy servers to a private cloud environment but we have more to do still, and that will create ongoing structure of cost savings. We continue to reduce our dependency on contract developers and temporary services and lower our people related expenses. And as you can see, even from the severance charge Todd took, we\u2019re executing global location strategy. We moved a 1,000 people to global delivery centers last year and I expect we\u2019ll do a similar amount in 2016. So, we continue to execute every component of this process. And I think we have more value to leverage from this franchise. One other part of this, which is enterprise team work, which is they were really collaborating more effectively between investment management and investment service, a great example is the private banking partnership between Pershing\u2019s broker-dealer and RIA clients and our own wealth management group. We are now -- have established now something like $2.3 billion in credit facilities for the clients of independent RIAs and broker-dealers who are trying to compete in the wealth management market. And that\u2019s creating some real lift for the wealth management business and some real leverage to our clients. And it\u2019s another example of working differently. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo from CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi. I wasn\u2019t sure about the answer to the last question. So, Gerald or Todd, do you expect to grow revenues faster than expenses in 2016? I understand you\u2019re doing a lot of different things, but when you add it all together, when you look out, can you commit to having that or can you not commit to it? Todd Gibbons : I think Mike we do expect to grow expenses -- excuse me, revenues faster than expenses. But with this market disruption, we have to keep that in mind. The equity markets do have an impact on our business. We\u2019ve indicated in the past a 100 basis-point move -- 100-point move in the S&P 500 is worth about $0.02 to $0.04 for us. And that assumes if it moves on average from the beginning of the year, so on average it\u2019s down 50. So that would be -- if the market continues to sell off that could be a headwind. We will still target trying to generate positive operating leverage, but there are market conditions where that would be impossible. Mike Mayo : So flat markets, flat rates; you\u2019d expect to have positive operating leverage. Todd Gibbons : That\u2019s correct. Gerald Hassell : Yes Mike. Mike Mayo : And then just some of the ins and outs on the expense side, I still don\u2019t understand why the combination of custody platform wouldn\u2019t provide you with some expense savings and is that simply delayed or that I\u2019m thinking about that the wrong way, and on the negative side the regulatory cost that\u2019s the expenses and then the revenue side still with the asset servicing linked quarter, it was -- third to fourth quarter it was down and why is that down I guess that some of the headwinds that, probably thinking about here? Gerald Hassell : So Mike, if you look at the expenses, almost every single category with the exception of total compensation, which Todd explained was largely affected by the severance costs in the fourth quarter, every single category our expenses are down. So all of the things that we\u2019ve talked about, whether it\u2019s custody platform, transformation or conversions, whether it\u2019s simplifying our operating structure, whether it\u2019s taking advantage of technology and robotics, it\u2019s showing up in our numbers, it\u2019s showing up in every single line item. So, I would dispute to your claim that it\u2019s not showing up in the numbers, it is. So, I think you\u2019ve got to look at it across every single line item, look at the positive operating leverage, the improvement in the operating margin, it\u2019s there Mike. Mike Mayo : And then as far as the regulatory headwinds which I guess you\u2019re managing and then on the revenue side. Gerald Hassell : Regulatory headwinds are included in our expense base. We\u2019re offsetting those regulatory headwind costs with aggressive reductions in the operating expenses in all the other categories. So yes, we\u2019re funding investments in resolution and recovery plans, better analytics, better CCAR process, better controls across the Company, improve risk management capabilities. All of that is being funded and we\u2019re still reducing the operating expenses year-over-year and improving the operating margin of the Company. Now on your question on investment services fees and asset servicing in particular, yes, it\u2019s a tough revenue environment and we have to up our game, [ph] engage with our own client clients even stronger than we have in the past and really try to put our best solutions and best services in front of them to gain more traction there. So that is one of our objectives and priorities for 2016 is enhancing our client experience and gaining revenue growth. Mike Mayo : And then last follow-up. Can you remind us how much asset servicing relates to fixed income versus equities, because shouldn\u2019t you be impacted a little bit less than some of your peers? Todd Gibbons : Yes, we believe that we will be less impacted than most of our peers. We\u2019re probably the reciprocal of what they\u2019re somewhere between 35% and 40% equity and that would mean [ph] fixed income in many markets. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Thanks very much. I\u2019m good. Those are all my questions. Gerald Hassell : Thanks Betsy. Thanks for dialing in. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now move along to Adam Beatty from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Adam Beatty : Maybe just one more on expenses, I know that outside services came down pretty nicely year-over-year. If you could give some color on that in terms of how much of that is sort of core services, like outsourcing, basically headcount replacement versus more traditional pro-services like legal and technology, and the trends and the outlook there. Thanks Todd Gibbons : Yes, we are definitely trying to trend away from relying on outside services, typically across substantially more than what we can do internally. We\u2019ve even seen that on the legal side as well as temporary services that are provided in various functions. We follow it very closely. Anytime somebody has been -- outside service has been around for a while, supervising that service gets a notification, questioning why it\u2019s still around and why we haven\u2019t internalized it. I don\u2019t know Brian, you might want to comment; you\u2019ve done a lot of things there. Brian Shea : Yes, I think we\u2019re just -- in general on our major strategic projects and investments, we\u2019re relying more on our team and developing our own team whenever we think it\u2019s a sustainable need and a capability we need rather than rely as much on contractors, consultants. Part of that\u2019s also the ongoing IT application development in-sourcing which is reducing contract consultant cost, and actually we think improving our speed to market and our actual development productivity at the same time. So, it\u2019s a variety of things, not one single thing but we\u2019re really focused on every part of these expenses. Adam Beatty : So, it sounds like ex maybe some episodic things, there is room for further reduction there? Brian Shea : Probably a little bit. Todd Gibbons : Yes. Adam Beatty : And then turning to investment management and the flows, specifically wealth management, the outflows came a lot from indexing, I assume that\u2019s somewhat institutional. In wealth management, you\u2019ve mentioned 5 billion of active inflows, not sure how much of that was wealth management but what are you seeing amongst your clients now and how they\u2019re reacting to the market? Thanks. Curtis Arledge : I think it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect it to be, which is a mix of the uncertainty; the volatility has been very significant. And I think August really shocked people and then you got a little bit of recovery and the first part of this year has been challenging. People are trying to understand that this is a beginning of something greater. We\u2019re talking with them a lot about the differences between now and the financial crisis. Banks have substantially more capital and are a lot less averaged. Obviously the China impact is something we\u2019re really trying to understand, with everyone struggling for the data and really be insightful. So trying to help our clients understand what\u2019s happening is something that they\u2019re all interested in. I\u2019ll tell you that there are also many who have been since the financial crisis underinvested; there\u2019s been a lot of people who have been more in cash and we stressed them that having a solid investment plan and overall financial plan is critical. Being too conservative is not a good thing and many of them have been so. So, we\u2019re seeing some people who are beginning to put money to work, they\u2019re scaling in. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a -- until volatility settles down, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see the dramatic shifts. I will tell you that flows in the industry and we see -- as we\u2019re in both investment management and investment services see so much what\u2019s happening, a lot of clients rebalanced when the equity markets did well. And I do think that we will see people who reduced their equity exposure earlier, they are absolutely going to rebalance, see it in the other direction; as markets decline, they may wait from a timing perspective for things to settle down a bit and just make sure they understand what\u2019s really happening with the economy, the impact of lower energy prices. I still think there is a pretty significant lag effect on what it\u2019ll mean for the real economy which would ultimately be positive. So, I think our clients are uncertain but also interested in figure out whether this is an opportunity to add investment risk to their portfolio. Operator : We\u2019ll take our final question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us the -- you\u2019ve touched on this in past calls I believe, the blockchain technology, how you are pursuing that and what the implications are for it longer term; should it ever become a reality, one of the opportunities for you with it and one of the negatives that it could cause to your Company? Gerald Hassell : We are spending a lot of time and energy in different parts of the Company on the block chain technology and where it can be applied. I think last quarter we commented we have two pilot programs actively engaged internally. We\u2019re participant in a couple of consortiums on blockchain technology. Interestingly we\u2019re hosting a blockchain technology day, next Monday with our own technologists and outsiders, exploring all the different opportunities that we see and others see. So, we\u2019re very actively engaged in the dialogs and the concept of where it can be applied. I think here are some real opportunities for us to be a disruptor to the existing infrastructure. I think it\u2019s going to take quite a bit of time to get there. But we are not sitting back waiting; we are actively engaged in the dialogs. Gerard Cassidy : And when you say quite a bit of time to get there, are we thinking three years out, five years out or is it just too hard to say when it becomes -- it inevitably becomes fully functional? Gerald Hassell : Yes, it\u2019s too hard to say. We are all very intrigued with it, we are very intrigued with the concept of it and how it could structurally change a lot of the processes we do. And by the structural change, i.e. reduce costs for us and our clients. And it\u2019s going to take some time to get there to become fully functional. Gerard Cassidy : And then just coming back to the sovereign wealth funds, two questions on that or two part -- one question two parts. One, the drop in the deposits in the foreign offices, was that attributed to the sovereign wealth funds pulling money out? And second, what\u2019s the total dollar amount under management in the quant funds with the sovereign wealth business? Gerald Hassell : The drop in the deposits, I don\u2019t think anything to do with the sovereign wealth funds. Todd Gibbons : The drop in deposits is consistent with what we saw what happen when rates moved and there were better alternatives than staying on our balance sheet for low yield. Gerald Hassell : We don\u2019t comment on the size of the assets under management for sovereign wealth funds specifically. But given that we\u2019re a significant player, we\u2019re seeing what the rest of the industry is seeing and that is certain sovereign wealth funds are liquidating their assets and continuing to follow their social agendas and using money within their own country. So, we\u2019re no different than the rest of the industry in that regard. Gerald Hassell : Well, thank you very much everyone for dialing in. We really appreciate it. If you have further questions, Valerie and her team look forward to hearing from you. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll run into all of you pretty soon. So, thank you very much again everyone. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the conference. Thank you for participating.",

Please note that this conference call will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie C. Haertel - Global Head- Investor Relations : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to the BNY Mellon First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as members of our executive leadership team. Our first quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation, and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only of today, April 21, 2016, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Now I would like to turn the call over the Gerald Hassell. Gerald? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Valerie, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our first quarter performance and our progress in driving our long-term growth strategy. Now in difficult market conditions, actually more so than reflected in our underlying assumptions of our Investor Day target, we begin delivered what I think would be considered healthy results in almost any environment. Year-over-year earnings per share were $0.73, up 9%. Adjusted for the roughly $0.01 of litigation and restructuring charges, we had operating earnings of $0.74 per share, up 10%. Now focusing on year-over-year comparisons on an adjusted basis, total revenue declined 1%, reflecting both the challenging revenue environment and our focus on driving profitable and disciplined revenue growth. Net interest revenue rose 5% as we benefited from the first full year impact of the December rate increase. Fee revenue was positively affected in some of our businesses as we recaptured some of the money market fee waivers. Total expenses were down 3%, driven by our business improvement process. We generated roughly 250 basis points of positive operating leverage, we increased our pre-tax operating margin by approximately 150 basis points to 31%, and our return on tangible common equity in the quarter was 21%. Now looking at our progress against our strategic priorities. Driving profitable revenue growth remains our first priority. Growing revenue has been a challenge across the industry. We have a heightened focus on profitable and disciplined revenue growth. We are not just driving gross revenue, we're expanding market share at any cost. We're leveraging our scale and expertise to create new sources of value for our clients, and we're delivering innovative strategic solutions in areas with strong potential upside, and we're investing in technology to revolutionize the client experience and create a digital enterprise. And we also have numerous long-term growth initiatives underway at different stages of maturities. Our collateral management solutions are a great example of where we are investing in capability with upside potential and where our business model gives us a competitive advantage. And we've been providing collateral services to the sell side for decades. We have leveraged these capabilities to assist the buy side. We now have a complete and mature products to help buy-side and sell-side clients solve pressing issues, and we believe offer unique value in the process. We view foreign exchange capabilities as an essential client offering, adding value to the multiple business lines across our enterprise. As you recall, we recently added a new executive to head our markets team, Michelle Neal, who is reporting directly to me to ensure that we are fully optimizing the strategic long-term growth opportunities we see in this business. And we are also investing in electronic trading infrastructure to price and trade FX for our clients on a single platform, as well as multi-dealer trading venues, all for the purpose of capturing more client-driven flows. We expect our NEXEN next-generation ecosystem to increase our technological edge and revolutionize our client experience. NEXEN will provide a consistent client experience across our businesses, enabling our clients access to all of our services through one portal offering, offering them increased flexibility and new opportunities to leverage services and data from us and third-party providers, who are integrated into our platform. Now we've begun rolling out NEXEN to our clients in asset servicing, liquidity services, global markets and corporate trust, and we are collaborating with clients to deliver an enhanced experience. Now based on early client feedback, we are convinced this will be a real game changer and solidify our position as a technology leader. And we'll share more of this important strategic initiative as we continue to expand functionality and bring more clients under the NEXEN ecosystem. We also have a number of initiatives focused on harnessing blockchain and distributed ledger technology. We see this as a potentially transformative technology and we're fully engaged. Blockchain has a broad range of possible applications for our business and we are working closely with FinTech firms actively participating in consortiums and running various pilot programs internally. An investment management under Mitchell Harris, we are focused on executing the investment management strategy we have already laid out. During the first quarter, our focus on improving investment performance drove strong benchmark in peer-relative performance in a number of our equity strategies. We have a number of initiatives in flight to align our capabilities with the largest growth pools and deliver high-value investment solutions. The key initiatives include expanding our alternative multi-asset strategies and enhancing our distribution capabilities to our core institutional client base and building out our retail strategy. On the institutional side, our focus is on extending our LDI strategies to the U.S. market, and we've launched a new U.S. multi-strategy fund that replicates the strategy that worked so well in Europe. With respect to retail initiatives, our focus on third-party intermediary advisors and expanding the Dreyfus distribution platform in the U.S. has led to solid organic growth. During the quarter, we were one of a handful of firms that saw positive flows into U.S. retail mutual funds. And the growing synergies between wealth management and Pershing have also helped drive loans and deposits to record levels. The 50% expansion of our wealth management sales force is now complete and it's generating healthy new revenues backed by a strong pipeline. And earlier this month, we closed on our acquisition of a Silicon Valley wealth manager called Atherton Lane Advisers, strengthening our footprint in one of the fastest-growing U.S. wealth markets. As these examples demonstrate, we're investing for today and tomorrow, helping our clients achieve their goals. Now, executing on our business improvement process has been a huge focus for us. We are leveraging our scale and expertise to deliver efficiency benefits to our clients and improved results for our company. We are on target to achieve the structural cost reductions we shared at Investor Day. So, let me share a few examples of our progress. We have reduced rentable square footage by 1.3 million square feet and are moving forward on significant opportunities to further rationalize our real estate footprint globally. We have built out our Global Delivery Centers for further migration. During the quarter, we relocated more than 225 positions to low-cost locations to balance our workforce globally. And we have now migrated more than 3,300 positions since the inception of our program. And we also implemented an initiative to drive more corporate action instructions through our electronic means. The STP rates are increasing, efficiencies are being realized by us and our clients, and operational risk is declining. That's a real win for all of us. Now our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. We have made significant investments to enhance our resolvability by substantially reducing risk, taking meaningful steps to prepare for multiple resolution contingencies, simplifying our legal entity structure, significantly improving our operational and financial resiliency, and increasing our financial strength. Clearly, we have more work to do on our living will, and we are committed to addressing the issues raised and meeting our regulators' expectations within the required timeframe. Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. During the first quarter, we repurchased 577 million in shares and we distributed $185 million in dividends. From a regulatory ratio standpoint, our key capital ratios again improved. This quarter, our CET1 ratio under the fully phased-in advanced approach increased by 30 basis points to 9.8%, and we increased our supplementary leverage ratio by 20 basis points to 5.1%. We also remain in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio, which became effective in 2015, with a full phased-in period that extends through 2017. We remain confident that we will be in full compliance with all of the regulatory ratio requirements at the time or ahead of the required dates. Last but not least, people are our ultimate competitive advantage. Attracting, developing and retaining top talent is also a strategic priority. Within Pershing during the quarter, we announced two appointments. Lisa Dolly, who has been with Pershing for over 25 years and was previously the Chief Operating Officer, was promoted to the CEO, demonstrating our deep leadership talent bench. Lisa's former role was filled by Lori Hardwick, a successful and highly qualified leader with lots of investments, technology and advisory expertise and an extensive track record of success in business growth, most recently with Envestnet. In addition, Piers Murray is joining us later this quarter as Chief Operating Officer of our Markets business. He comes from Deutsche Bank, and brings a proven history in a global markets products and solutions. He will work with Michelle in strengthening our Markets business. Together, these moves are evidence of our ability to attract and develop truly outstanding talent, which is something we showcased in our first-ever digital People Report posted on our website. Our People Report tells the story of how we are invested in our people and building a winning culture, and I encourage you to take a look at it. Now the bottom line is this, we are executing against each of our strategic priorities and it's coming through in our results. Our strategy is designed to produce client and shareholder value and perform well through all environments. We've shown you that we can do just that and our goal is to continue that trend. With that, let me turn it over to Todd. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document, starting with slide seven that details our non-GAAP or operating results for the quarter. First quarter EPS was $0.74, up 10% versus the year-ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue was down 1%, expenses down 3%, and we generated 250 basis points of positive operating leverage. As we've noted in prior quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to impact results, so it's negatively for revenue and positively for expense. However, the net impact of currency translation is minimal to our consolidated pre-tax income. Income before income taxes was up 4% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, and on a year-over-year basis, our pre-tax margin increased approximately 150 basis points to 31%. Return on tangible common equity was 21% for the quarter. Our results reflected the benefit of higher money market fees. Now, we previously indicated that we expected to recover roughly 70% of the fee waivers with a 50-basis-point increase in the Fed funds rate. As expected, with the first 25-basis-point increase in December, we were able to recover nearly 50% of the waivers. As you can see, the recovery is not necessarily linear. Therefore, additional rate increases are not expected to be quite as impactful as the first. Note that money market fees primarily affect clearing, investment management, issuer services and asset servicing. Slide eight shows our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were flat year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Both comparisons reflect net new business and higher securities lending revenue, offset by lower market values. The year-over-year comparison was also impacted by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Clearing services fees were up 2% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Both increases primarily reflect higher money market fees, partially offset by the impact of lost business. The sequential increase also reflects higher volume. Issuer services fees were up 5% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases primarily reflect higher money market fees in corporate trust and higher dividend fees in depositary receipts. Treasury services fees were 4% lower, both year-over-year and sequentially, and that reflects higher compensating balance credits related to clients, which shifts revenues from fees to NIR. First quarter investment management and performance fees were down 6% year-over-year, and that was 4% on a constant currency basis. The year-over-year decrease on a constant currency basis primarily reflects the headwinds of lower equity market values and net outflows in 2015, partially offset by higher money market fees. The sequential decline of 6% reflects those items in additional to seasonally lower performance fees. FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was down 24% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. FX revenue of $171 million was down 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower volumes relative to the unusually robust activity that we enjoyed last year. The 4% sequential increase primarily reflects higher volatility, and that was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency hedging activity. If you exclude the hedging, the sequential increase would have been 12%. Financing-related fees grew 35% to $54 million versus the year-ago quarter, and increased 6% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher fees related to the extension of secured intraday credit declines. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher underwriting fees. Distribution and servicing fees were $39 million, 5% lower year-over-year and sequentially, as the favorable impact of lower money market fee waivers was more than offset by certain fees paid to introducing brokers. Investment and other income of $105 million compared with $60 million in the year-ago quarter and 93 million in the fourth quarter. Both increases primarily reflect higher lease-related gains. The sequential increase was partially offset by lower other income resulting from clearing service termination fees that we recorded in the fourth quarter, and lower income from corporate bank-owned life insurance. Slide nine shows the drivers of our investment management business and help explain our underlying performance. Assets under management of $1.64 trillion were down 5% year-over-year, reflecting net outflows in 2015 and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, principally against the British pound. Sequentially, assets under management were up 1%. We had long-term net inflows of 1 billion, that was driven by $14 billion in liability-driven investment inflows, where strong client demand has attracted more than $40 billion in assets over the past 12 months. And we also saw flows into alternative investment strategies. Long-term net outflows were mainly driven by passive investment strategies totaling $11 billion, which were recognized in index investments. Active equity outflows declined to $3 million, signaling a slower decline and may indicate that the industry is starting to see equity flows stabilize following one of the worst years on record in 2015. Additionally, we had $9 billion of short-term cash outflows. Our wealth management business and U.S. intermediary expansion initiatives continue to show progress. Wealth management delivered the 20th consecutive year-over-year earnings growth and we're seeing above market share inflows in many of our intermediary channels. Investment management loans and deposits both reached record levels of 23% and 5%, respectively. Turning to our investment services metrics on slide 10. I want to point out that in the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified the results of our credit-related activities that were previously recorded in the other segment to investment services. This reclassification to investment services better reflects where the client relationships and services reside. The reclassifications did not impact the consolidated results. Also, concurrent with this reclassification, the provision for credit losses associated with the respective credit portfolio is now reflected in each business segment. All prior periods have been restated to reflect that. Assets under custody and/or administration at quarter end were $29.1 trillion, up 2% or $600 million year-over-year, reflecting net new business and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on a period end basis, principally against the euro which was partially offset by lower market values. The late quarter AUC/A was up $200 billion. We estimate total new assets under custody and/or administration business wins were $40 billion in the first quarter. In the last couple of quarters, we've seen slower than historic growth rates, reflecting our strategy of selectively adding new business versus simply growing market share. Looking at the other key investment services metrics, the market value of securities on loan at period end was up 3% year-over-year. Average loans were flat year-over-year while average deposits were down 8%. Our broker dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances was down 2%, our clearing metrics are lower, and we again recorded a net decline in sponsored DR programs as we continue to focus on exiting low-activity programs at the lower end of our client base and programs that do not meet our profitability criteria. Turning to net interest revenue on slide 11, you'll see that net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 5% versus the year ago quarter and 1% from the fourth quarter. Both increases in NIR reflect higher yields on interest earning assets, partially offset by higher rates paid on interest bearing liabilities in the impact of interest rate hedging activity, which are primarily offset in FX and other trading revenue lines. Yield on interest earning assets was up 9 basis points year-over-year and 8 basis points sequentially. Our net interest margin for the quarter was 101 basis points. That's a 4 basis point improvement from the year ago quarter, and 2 basis points higher than the prior quarter. If not for the impact of the hedging activity I previously mentioned, the net interest margin would've been 4 basis points higher for the quarter. Turning to slide 12, you will see that non-interest expense on an adjusted basis declined 3% year-over-year, and 2% sequentially as we drove expenses lower in nearly all categories. The year-over-year decrease reflects the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, lower staff and legal expenses and the benefit of our Business Improvement Process. The savings generated by the Business Improvement Process primarily reflect the benefits of our technology insourcing strategy, and the implementation of our global real estate strategy. This was partially offset by higher distribution and servicing expenses related to fee waivers. Staff expenses decreased year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower estimated 2016 incentives and a higher adjustment for the finalization of the annual incentive awards. So that was partially offset by the curtailment gain related to the U.S. pension plan that we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 and higher severance expense and ongoing support of our Business Improvement Process. The sequential decrease on non-interest expense reflects lower expenses in all categories, except other and distribution and servicing expenses. The sequential decrease in staff expense primarily reflects lower compensation and employee benefit expenses, partially offset by higher incentives primarily due to the vesting of long-term stock rewards for retirement-eligible employees. The increase in other expense primarily reflects the adjustments in the bank assessment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in distribution and servicing expense is due to higher money market fees. The sequential increase in head count reflects our campus technology recruiting effort to attract the best technologists. We expect the large recruiting class to account for anticipated turnover. In addition, the year-over-year increase also reflects the onboarding of employees to support strategic growth initiatives and risk-related activities. Our location strategy has helped us to increase our head count to support strategic initiatives, while we've been able to reduce total staff expense. Turning to capital on slide 13. Our fully phased in advanced approach common equity Tier 1 ratio increased by approximately 30 basis points to 9.80. That was primarily driven by an increase to capital generation. Our supplemental leverage ratio increased to 5.1% this quarter, primarily due to increased capital and a reduction in our balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures. A couple of other notes about the quarter. As you'll see in the release on page three, our effective tax rate was 25.9%, which is in line with our previous guidance. On page 11 you'll see some investment securities portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our unrealized pre-tax gain on our portfolio was $1.2 billion. That compared to $357 million at year end. The difference in value is primarily due to a decline in market rates. Now let me share a few thoughts to factor into your thinking about the second quarter and the rest of 2016. Money market fee waivers appear to be recovering in line with our previous guidance. We would expect investment and other income to be in the range of $60 million to $80 million going forward. Staff expense should decline sequentially in the second quarter as a result of the acceleration that took place in the first quarter. We expect to see an increase in resolution planning expenses as we work to address those issues raised regarding our living will. Given these pluses and minuses this year, we expect expenses to be flat in the second quarter versus the first quarter. We expect our effective tax rate to either be approximately 25% to 26%. And finally, we expect to continue to repurchase shares under our current authorization during the second quarter. To sum up, we delivered a solid quarter in spite of difficult market conditions as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities. With, that let me hand it back to Gerald. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Todd. And we can now open it up for questions. Operator : As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up question. Our first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So Todd, just picking up on the NII discussion, I think you answered part of that already in the prepared remarks with the hedging headwind, I guess, about 2 basis point incremental to what you reported. But just thinking through the puts and takes, where we are in the rate cycle besides the balance sheet, so how should we think about the rest of the year from an NII perspective assuming rates don't really change and again, the starting-off point on the NIM, I guess, would've been 2 basis points higher versus what you've reported, right? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. That's correct, Alex. I would expect you'd see a couple of basis points higher on the NIM, and that would be reflective and a little bit higher NIR going forward. The balance sheet is relatively stable. It acted about as we had expected it would with the rate increase that we saw at the end of the fourth quarter, so client deposits were down a bit. So it looks to be very stable. We've adjusted further the negative interest rates with the move to (28:11) ECB and the euro. And the thing that's a bit of a headwind is with the flattening of the yield curve, the reinvestment rates are a little bit less than we would have liked. But net-net, the hedging should normalize, and we would expect to see a couple of basis points of expansion if rates don't change from here. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks. And Gerald, a question for you. Along the lines of some of the new initiatives that you outlined in prepared remarks. So particularly in the investment servicing front, you highlighted collateral management, FX, NEXEN, which all seem to be in various stages of development. But taking a step back, can you help us contextualize that a little bit better, what it means for the servicing business' organic growth kind of over the next year to two years versus what we've seen over the last couple of years? Just trying to put some numbers around these initiatives. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Sure, Alex. Appreciate the question. I would say the one that has the most immediate, greatest upside is in the collateral services side. As we've talked about over the last year or so, we really designed the collateral services businesses for the sell side and for firms like yours to be able to finance their positions and to be able to segregate collateral and to try to optimize the collateral for capital purposes. We're also seeing increasing interest on the buy side and we're adjusting our algorithms to help the buy side better utilize our capabilities as they have to post collateral, and also as they invest in tri-party repo programs. So we see a pretty significant opportunity for us to do this, not only in the U.S. but around the world. And so whether it's segregation, optimization, transformation of the collateral and help reduce the capital costs for different firms, we think that's got some real upside potential. So I would say that's first and foremost at the top of the list. In our foreign exchange and markets business, we think we have greater opportunities to utilize the electronic infrastructure that we're building to capture more order flow and do more netting across our businesses and improve the margins for us and improve the execution for our clients. So those are two areas that I cited in my opening comments that we think have some real upside to it. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. All right. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Taking our next question from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Gerald, on asset management and investment management and the margin profile there, appreciate this quarter was tough macro wise, but hoping you can provide an update on how you feel the plan to drive margins higher there is going versus the goals outlined at Investor Day? I'll leave it at that. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thanks, Ashley. We've said at Investor Day, and recently at our last annual meeting last week, we think we have some more work to do in improving the operating margins with the investment management area without sacrificing the investment strategies and without sacrificing, or actually adding to the strength of our portfolio managers. We think a lot of those costs can be dealt with at the center of investment management, and also trying to better rationalize or make more efficient our distribution costs. So we think there's opportunities to apply the same discipline to the rest of our businesses, to the running of the business of investment management and improve the ability for the boutiques to continue to drive their investment performance. So it is one of our goals and we're on track and we still have some work to do there. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then, Todd, on deposit costs, I was curious how you're thinking about passing on the benefit from higher rates to clients? It looks like the deposit betas are fairly low so far, but how should we be thinking about the next 25 basis points of high (32:35) so it's sustainable? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Ashley. I would say that our deposit betas are probably a little lower than we had anticipated, so that's the good news. We would've expected that we would've recovered most of the first 25 basis points, which is the case, although there is some deposit attrition that I mentioned. And right now, as we forecast looking out, we are adjusting our betas slightly favorably. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. It's Betsy. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Betsy. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: A couple of questions. You mentioned early on in the conversation around blockchain and the question I have is, how are you in determining how to make those investments and what kind of timeframe to return on investments are you anticipating? I noticed that you remember both of R3 and also the Hyperledger Project, and I know there's dual tracks in many cases on competing asset classes. So, I'm just trying to understand how you are allocating your resources. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. No, you hit it right on. We are members of a variety of different consortiums and so we're participating in helping set the standards for the industry. I think that is one of the keys to the success of blockchain technology is standardization of the processes. We're also looking at it in our payments area and our corporate trust area and our broker dealer clearance business, particularly applied to repos. We think blockchain can be transformative. We also can see it as being an ability to increase the resiliency of our capabilities. I think it's going to take time to fully materialize, and it does require, in all cases, a trusted counterparty. And we think that's one of the roles that we can play, which is what we play today, the trusted counter party that everyone can show up on both sides of the ledger and trust that it will be executed well, and we plan to play a role in the middle of that. So we are making investments. It's already in our run rates in terms of either the expense or the investments, which aren't really that big in terms of the R3 and Hyperledger and those sorts of investments. But we're spending a lot of time and energy on it, but I think it's going to take some time to see it play out in a full, meaningful way. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. But yeah, the question I'm getting is, is it like Betamax or VHS? Does it matter? Can we have a dual track of standard? In other words, can some asset classes be on one backbone and other asset classes be on a different backbone? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that is going to be one of the questions, is it beta max, or is it VHS or what is it? And that's why you're seeing so many different initiatives occur in the marketplace and why we're participating in a variety of them. We think trying to get to a better common standard, at least for certain asset classes, will be the way to go and that's why we want to be a leader in helping drive that exercise. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Ultimately, Betsy, in order to get the network effect, you're going to have to have standardization. And also, we think that there will be a trusted counterparty because the proof of work costs are so high and there are going to be regulatory issues associated with it, so that's why we think there is a great role for us. So I think there's an opportunity for this to either reduce operating costs, but it will require significant standardization and is likely to start in smaller markets where those standards can be addressed. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, folks. Hey, maybe just, Todd, on the expense outlook. Good clarity on the second quarter and excellent expense control, of course, in the first quarter. But as we look out through the rest of the year, it looks like you'd be on track to reduce expenses at least another 2% or potentially more. I know they're seasonally high expenses you moved into the back end of the year. But maybe if you could just give us some color on what you're seeing for project spend coming into the back half of the year and whether you think you can do another 2% down on expenses this year? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think we're a little ahead of where we had expected to be, frankly, Brian. We did see \u2013 I just want to remind you, in the first quarter, we do tend to see seasonal lower legal expense, also a little bit seasonally lower business development and consulting. And the other thing we saw is revenues were down in our higher comps business lines. So as the market moves, we would expect revenues to pick up in those lines and the associated expenses with them. We do think that around both the resolution plan, we're going to have to accelerate some of the investments that we intended to make. We had committed last year to invest $140 million over the next 18 months or so in order to build resilience and improve the probability of success in our plan. We may have to accelerate that a bit. So there are some headwinds we're facing, but I think we've got some \u2013 we're basing it off of a lower base than we would've expected to be at this time, so we're probably a little ahead of the guidance that we had previously given. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And thanks for that. And then maybe either for Brian or Joe, I guess if you can talk about the dynamics in clearing, we have the previously announced client loss versus the impact of the money market fee waivers and client wins. And then maybe, Brian, if you want to comment a little bit about development of NEXEN in terms of the investment outlook for this year and how you're seeing -which stage of development you're in, in terms of bringing on new clients and that and whether you think there's a revenue generation component coming either this year or next year? Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : Sure. Happy to. It's Brian Shea. Clearing services actually is suffering a bit from the loss of those clients that we talked about and shared with you in advance, but we're benefiting from the reduction in fee waivers driven by the December rate increase. So that's offset with, really, the loss of the client business in the short term. And we've also benefited from taking on a number of clients in the third and fourth quarters as a result of J.P. Morgan's exit. And we continue to see interest from self-clearing firms who are looking to outsource and we converted another self-clearing firm in the first quarter. So overall, the clearing services picture is solid. And they're executing very strong expense discipline so we think we'll have modest year-over-year growth from clearing services. The other dynamic in clearing services is that the RIA custody business is growing and the DOL judiciary standard is likely to help accelerate that growth over time. So we feel good about our position there and the leverage of the private banking services of our wealth management group into that RIA and broker dealer market is also a very positive long-term development for clearing services. Turning to the NEXEN question, NEXEN is no longer an idea or a vision, it's really a reality. It's in production. And we now have 3,600 client users across 950 clients, exercising and using NEXEN in production every day. It cuts across now AIS clients, asset servicing clients, broker dealer services, liquidity, direct and corporate trust, as Gerald mentioned. And we expect to have more functionality, more capabilities, more APIs, more third party FIN tech applications embedded in the platform over time, and we expect to roll this out to our entire client base over time. So we're getting real momentum and take-up, and the reaction from the clients is actually quite positive. The client experience is just better. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And so the revenue expense dynamic in terms of \u2013 it sounds like you're through a lot of the investment phase and now you're closer to realizing potential revenue gains from this? Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : Yeah. I guess the way I'd say it is, as part of the business of improvement process we're actually self-funding the development of NEXEN, so we continue (41:28). As we insource technology developers and we simplify our infrastructure, we are able to shift technology investment firm redundant, lights on-type investment to strategic investments. So that's enabling us to fund NEXEN and other market-leading solutions for clients without actually increasing our technology investment or expense. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Hi, there. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : A question about \u2013 Good morning. About some of the balance sheet remixing. Some of this just happened, some of it's purposeful. But security is down 4% year-on-year, loans up 6%. I noticed the 23% growth on the investment management loans, so curious what those are and if that's what the big driver is, driving the 21, 22 basis point jump in average loan yields year-on-year? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Glenn. One of the strategies we've had is to growth the wealth management business, and so that's where the loans are booked. So those are either margin-style loans or mortgages to high net worth individuals. And we have had some meaningful success in expanding that mortgage portfolio. Most of those are jumbo mortgages arms, some of them would be floating, and that has helped drive the mix that you talked about and that's been planned. Another area of loan growth that we've enjoyed is in our secured financing transactions. I would expect the rate of that growth to flow somewhat from what we've been doing to date. And the mix now, I think, will be more stable as we look out the next 12 months or so. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. Okay. That's perfect. And then I know the jump up really happened last quarter but I'm looking at the year-on-year increase in non-performing loans and the decrease in the allowance, and I know it was stable quarter-on-quarter. So I guess the real question is just a quick comment on what you see credit-wise for your mix. Hidden within there is an energy question, but really, just overall credit. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Glenn, that was just one loan that had to do with the Sentinel reversal of a court decision, and that became a non-performing loan. We took the provision against it to market to the current value, so that's done. The rest of the portfolio is absolutely stable. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : And right coverage ratio? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : You did see us increase our provision in the first quarter to $10 million, but the credit portfolio continues to be strong. We do have some exposure to energy, which we explained on the call in the last quarter. And there will be some migration even though that is almost entirely investment grade. There is some modest migration and we would expect some provision associated with that portfolio but we don't expect it to be material. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Can you give us a little more color? You've mentioned that on the fee waiver side you got about 50% back and the next hike won't be as incremental. But Todd, maybe you can just help us understand given that there are some of the expenses that come back in, what's the current existing drag still on a per share basis that you got from fee waivers, and how many more hikes would it take to get the rest of it back? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. We had indicated that we thought there was about a $0.06 to $0.08 drag to EPS driven by fee waivers, and so we're getting about 50% of that back so, we got about $3.50 in these numbers relative to the fee waivers is our best estimate. That's probably a little bit better than we had anticipated. We did expect it not to be exactly linear. The first move is the best one, the second move will be not quite as great. But having had the experience of this, I would expect we would cover a little better than our previous guidance of 70% with a 50 basis point move. And I expect 100 point basis point move would cover all of it. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay, great. The second question just on the core (45:58) asset servicing business. After a really great run of big, big business wins, the last couple of quarters have been decent but in kind of the $50 billion-ish range, can you talk about the pipeline for just core wins and your outlook for growth in that segment of the servicing business? Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : Yeah, this is Brian Shea. The new business signed number can vary reasonably significantly quarter to quarter, and we've had a couple of soft quarters. I would say it reflects a couple of things. Our focus on profitable client relationships over sort of just pure revenue and market share, we're being extremely disciplined and selective about the new business assignments we take on. And that's actually part of the reason you're seeing improved operating margins and you're seeing our fee to expense ratio improve significantly. But in terms of the pipeline, the pipeline remains actually pretty strong. It's up significantly on a sequential basis. And we still believe that this is a strong growth driver for the company going forward. The secular trend towards asset managers wanting to outsource and refocus their energy on the investment process itself we think is continuing, and that's why we have invested in things like the real estate and private equity administration business. This, in 2016, after lifting out the Deutsche Bank team and serving Deutsche Bank will now be starting to take on third party clients. And in addition, we have a strong pipeline of middle-office services from asset managers and demand for the Eagle technology platform. So we still believe that we can drive long-term growth and we're confident in that. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. So in aggregate, expenses are down, the pre-tax margin's up from 30% to 31. So in aggregate, that's moving in the right direction, but when I look at the investment management adjusted pre-tax operating margin of 30%, I'm not sure the last time it was that low, at least going back several years. And so I'll ask the same question that I asked at last week's annual meeting and that is, under what scenario would you consider more aggressive dispositions a part of your asset management business? And along the lines of that question, I guess at the meeting you now have a new lead director, after the meeting and so what's his role, what's your interaction with him in the first week and what do you expect that role to be? Do you talk to him about things like hey, maybe the investment management business should be restructured more aggressively to help improve what's a margin way below peer? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. A lot of questions in there, Mike. But I always appreciate them. First of all, we have a lot of confidence in our investment management business. It's been a tough quarter and we saw a lot of outflows not only in our firm but across the industry last year. 2015 was probably one of the biggest outflow years in traditional active equity. And as you know, that's one of the highest fee realization products across the industry. We feel better that the active equity flows have stemmed the tide. We saw some outflows in index, but our LDI strategy, our alternative strategy continues to pick up and so we ended up with positive, net long-term flows for this quarter which I think fairs pretty well against our competitors. We do have work to do on improving the operating margin in the business, no question about it. I said it last week when you asked the question. I'll say it again, we have some work to do there. But I think some of the outsized margin performance by our peers, and really because they tend to be more active equity-oriented and they have higher fee realization to begin with. But we still have work to do there. We have a lot of confidence in the business. Mitchell Harris is here with me today, and I think Mitchell is the right person to improve the business and improve the performance overall. So we remain very confident in that and being a critical part of our company. Regarding Lead Director, yes we announced the new Lead Director. Every company goes through a change in its director makeup. He, like all of our directors, are very active. We have an ongoing dialogue with him. The Lead Director's role is to interface actively with management, which he has already begun to do and represent the directors in communicating well with management. We're off to a great start and I have no concerns about how we're interacting with our board. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : And then as a short follow up, earlier you said you might reduce distribution costs to help out investment management. Could you elaborate on that, or any other details on where you see the greatest potential? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. What I referred to was making sure we're getting the bang for our buck for our distribution expense and make sure it's targeted in the right places where we're getting good results. And so maybe, Mitchell, you want to comment on a little bit. Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer- Investment Management : Thank you. What I'd like to actually comment on is if you really look at our core business, Mike, it's actually pretty strong and moving up. The other revenue line is what's confusing things a little bit, and I think you have to keep in mind the first quarter of last year was very strong, especially on the seed capital front. And even when you look at our \u2013 and it wasn't as strong, obviously, in this quarter. You also have the issue of internal payments that we've given to investment services on fee waiver abatements that's in that line; that stays within the company. So it's not really a weakness, per se, and as Gerald did mention, investment performance has been good; flows are abating. The first two months were weak. The \u2013 March was actually much better, and we're getting it in the right category. So you only had $3 billion down in equities, which was, on average, it was $8 billion down per quarter last year. Alternatives are still improving. Our initiatives in terms of the retail \u2013 which was mentioned earlier \u2013 distribution, we had 300 million in positive flows. We were the eighth best performing retail out of 30. So I think our distribution is improving. Our performance is improving. The money market fee waivers help all of us. Flows are becoming less negative. And on the expense management side, we are looking at where there's overlaps between the boutiques, between the IM center and we will cuts those out. So I think we're going to continue to drive both expenses down. And I think there are significant revenue opportunities going into the year. Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : And we've taken a hard look at the corporate overheads and those are coming down related to investment management as well. So I think there's opportunity... Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : ...Opportunity for both scale as well as other actions we can take. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mike. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, nice tip of the cap to Hamilton in your deck, by the way, on the back of the $10 bill brouhaha. Good to see that. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Thank you. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yes. We had a lot of emotional attachment to that one, and we're very, very pleased with the Secretary of Treasury's decision there. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : No doubt. So on expenses, can you quantify \u2013 I don't think, Todd, you did in your prepared remarks, how much was severance in comp this quarter and maybe how would that compare to last year and the fourth quarter? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I think if you \u2013 there's a couple of things; one is when we finalize our actual incentive payouts, oftentimes there is either adjustment one-way or the other. That adjustment was favorable and it actually approximately offset the severance. So, on a year-over-year basis, the net of that was basically zero. I think a way to look at our expenses on a year-over-year basis and the staff expense, I'll give it to you very specifically, the acceleration was $9 million higher. And last year we had a pension curtailment when we curtailed our defined benefit plan, and that was a $30 million benefit. So we had a $39 million headwind, if you will, going into this year's first quarter from those two events. Plenty of that was offset with, effectively, the benefit of curtailing the pension last year. So it wasn't frozen. We took the gain when we announced it, but it wasn't actually frozen until the third quarter, so we got the benefit of that. So there's about a $20 million headwind on a year-over-year basis from those various categories. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for walking me through that, Todd. And then issuer services, you guys called out depository receipt business and the strength there. Given the continued rally in the EM, should we assume that that's sustainable and is that still a reasonably good indicator for that business? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Yes, DRs is \u2013 definitely tied to emerging market activity in issuance. And so a pickup in emerging market issuance will be helpful to DRs for sure. The other driver there is corporate actions tend to be helpful, so if you have a pickup in banking activity or merger activity, that tends to be a positive driver for DRs as well. On the corporate trust side of issuer, we've signaled that the fee decline we experienced for the prior few years would moderate and level off, which it has done. They're benefiting now from the restoration of some of the fee waivers, and while bond issuance was down pretty significantly industry wide in the first quarter, our market share in corporate trust is picking up. And we think that'll be one of the drivers of growth in the future for investment services. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for the color. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Beatty from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you, and good morning. Question on asset management, particularly the positive U.S. retail flows. You mentioned multi-strat and alternatives. Is that what's driving the positive flows, or are there other products that are working? Thanks. Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer- Investment Management : Well, this is Mitchell. You have LDI that you had $14 billion of positive flows, so that's contributed to it. And fixed is flat, but \u2013 meaning core fix, but it's primarily on LDI and on alternatives. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. And then maybe a broader question about the outlook for wealth management, particularly the retirement business. As the retiree population grows, are you seeing \u2013 I mean LDI has been strong on kind of the institutional side. On the retail wealth management side, are you seeing people do a similar kind of individual LDI where they're moving to fixed income and trying to immunize their savings? Or given some shortfalls in people's retirement savings, are they kind of going more towards equity and swinging for the fences in terms of building capital? Which trend is more dominant in your wealth management business? Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer- Investment Management : They're definitely not swinging for the fences. It's more of a balance. People are confused. Most people don't have enough; the wealth obviously do. But they're looking for solutions in this market. Are interest rates going up? What's going to happen to fixed income? The equity markets have been very volatile, so they're looking at a more conservative balance type of approach, quite frankly. So equities remained a significant element but probably has come down a little bit, and they're looking more at corporate credit, munis have performed well and had to balance out their fixed income portfolios. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Very helpful. Thanks, Mitch. Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer- Investment Management : Yep. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Very interested to hear you highlighting blockchain technology so much. How do you think about the possibility that all of this innovation kind of removed some of your technological modes and ultimately reduces the pool of revenues that could be available to the whole trust of custody industry? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We actually see ourselves as one of the major participants in using the technology to improve the efficiency of our operations and the resiliency of our operations. And as I said earlier, the fact that no matter what technology is used, a trusted counterparty intermediary is required, we see ourselves playing in that role. So, while certain efficiencies and certain revenues may lessen the revenues, we think we're going to pick up that in the cost side as the technology gets improved and rolled out. So, we see ourselves as being a critical player in the middle of this. As I said, we have pilot programs going on in the payments business, in corporate trust and our broker-dealer business, and particularly around repos. So, we're watching it carefully. We're participating actively. It's really hard to tell exactly how it's going to roll out, but we do see ourselves as being a major participant in it. Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : Yeah, this is Brian \u2013 sorry. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Just go ahead. Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : I would just add that we're executing a NEXEN ecosystem strategy, which includes an app store. And part of the reason for being immersed in this FinTech world is to find solutions that can really add value to clients. And clients are obviously interested in getting the value with the new applications and innovative technology, but they frankly, in many cases, do not want to integrate it, do not want to do the work of managing that. And so, our ecosystem will be enable us to embed third-party solutions in a much more easy streamlined way, which will reduce the client's under management cost. So, we think NEXEN enables us to leverage these companies and these innovative solutions, and it also enables us to actually help drive revenue growth and more value for clients. And we're \u2013 another example would be on NEXEN, we have a digital pulse big data solution in. We've invented client optimization technology, securities lending optimization technology, liquidity management optimization technology, all of which are sources of improving our clients' profitability and sources of revenue for the company in the future. So, there's real opportunity here, as well as some risk, and we're immersing ourselves to try to make sure that the opportunities outweigh the risks. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Great. And just a very quick numbers question. The expenses, what would the year-on-year change have been on a constant-currency basis? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : It's about 100 basis-point benefit. So, it would've been about 100 basis points more, rather down three, they would have been down two. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Perfect. Thank you. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks. I just had a quick question on the balance sheet. I know you gave kind of guidance as to what the margin would do if rates were flat over 2016, but if we do get another rate increase in 2016, would you expect a similar drop in deposits like you saw this quarter, or are you expecting stability kind of over the deposit base as rates increase from here? Thanks. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. No, we expect that there will be further run off with additional rate increases. We think that, that deposit runoff, that attrition is probably a little bit less than we had previously guided. So we \u2013 back in our Investor Day, we had guided that with normalization of rates, let's say that's 100 basis points or so, we would've expected to see about $40 billion to $70 billion of runoff. I think we will see something to the lower end of that. So we've seen in the first $25 billion, we've seen about $13 billion or so. So, I think we would stick with that guidance. We do think the margin expansion will more than offset any loss of deposits, which will lead to higher NIR in a rising-rate environment. And when we model that and report that in our financials, we are reflecting the runoff that comes \u2013 our estimated runoff that comes with the movement in interest rates. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Operator : And our final question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. I apologize if you addressed these questions, I had to jump on and off your call. But Gerald, can you share with us \u2013 there's a lot of disruption going on in the capital markets and many of the European and UK capital market players have downsized and are exited specific businesses in the capital markets such as FIC trading or equity trading. Are you guys seeing any opportunities to gain market share in your business lines in those markets due to the disruption that some of those companies are going through? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the companies that are going through that are in, many cases, some of our largest clients, so some of their reduced activity is part of the challenges that we're trying to overcome in terms of the market activity. That being said, we are seeing some of the shift in that activity to smaller firms who also happen to be more rapidly growing clients, and we do see ourselves being able to provide, extend our service model to some of those firms who are picking up some of the trading flack or need the collateral services that I talked about earlier. We do have what we refer to as prime custody, prime services solutions, so some of the activity we see ourselves being able to pick up on a direct basis without taking on the risks associated with normal prime brokerage activity. So, we try to do it in a conservative thoughtful way, but we do see ourselves being able to expand a little bit more in that space. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : But I would add to that, Gerard, we're not interested in becoming a large, fixed income trading operation. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, absolutely. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : So, that's not what we're looking for. We do make markets for some of our clients, for Pershing clients and so forth, but it's a relatively modest accommodation business for us and we don't expect that to change. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And then as a follow-up on CCAR, obviously this year we had the negative interest rate environment and I think most banks probably quantitatively will come out of it okay. But from a qualitative standpoint, from the systems stand point, are you guys comfortable with what you were able to submit to the regulators? I know many banks have addressed that their systems are going to be using manual overrides to handle that negative rate environment. Are you guys \u2013 is yours similar that or are you fully automated and you could do it without any manual overrides in negative rate environment here in the U.S.? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, well, I think one of the benefits is we're mostly an institutional company, and so that we've had the experience of passing on negative interest rates through our systems in Europe and in a number of jurisdictions and now in Japan as well. So, we think that is something that we could operationally manage. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you very much, everybody, for joining us this morning. Additional questions can be directed to Valerie Haertel and our Investor Relations team. And we look forward to engaging with you, and thank you very much for dialing in. Operator : And if there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie C. Haertel - Global Head- Investor Relations : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to the BNY Mellon Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as members of our executive leadership team. Our second quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results, and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July 21, 2016, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Valerie, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. This quarter demonstrated the value of having a well-diversified, lower-risk business model which provides stability to our revenue base during periods of global market uncertainty and volatility. We remain focused on the execution of our long-term strategy to drive future growth by continuing to invest in strategic initiatives to support our client's success while maintaining the safety and soundness of our enterprise. We continue to aggressively control expenses through our business improvement process, which enabled us to maintain a strong adjusted pre-tax operating margin of 33%. In a challenging revenue environment with a flattening yield curve on an adjusted basis, we delivered second quarter earnings per share of $0.76 and we achieved an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 21%. Now, I'll let Todd address some of the market-driven and seasonal revenue dynamics in this quarter as well as our continued progress on reducing expenses. But first, let me discuss our progress against our strategic priorities. Driving profitable revenue growth remains our first priority. Growing revenue remained a real challenge across our industry. And while we were down somewhat year-over-year, our diversified business model positions us to deliver consistent results regardless of the market and certainly solid risk-adjusted returns. We continue to believe our distinctive capabilities in areas such as collateral management and liquidity services, middle-office outsourcing and liability-driven investments, as well as our efforts to build a digital enterprise, will drive revenue growth in the future. We are growing synergies between wealth management and our Pershing platform. Wealth management loans are up 20% year-over-year, and our combined banking and brokerage solution has driven over half of this growth. We're also realizing increased synergies between investment services and Dreyfus. Nearly 60% of the assets under management and our Dreyfus and BNY Mellon money market funds are from our investment services clients, evidencing the benefits of our dual focus on investment management and investment services. On a technology front, last year we created a technology solutions team to accelerate our ability to deliver market-leading solutions through internal development and partnerships with third-party technology companies and content providers. So, for example, we've leveraged NEXEN to build an application to help fund managers manage their expenses more effectively. This is something we use internally in our mutual fund processing area and we are now making it available directly to our client as an application on the NEXEN platform. We've also used NEXEN APIs to help a large global fund by integrating a third-party market analytics application with our underlying portfolio holding. It's providing improved insights and analyses into their investment. In investment management, Mitchell Harris has made a number of changes to his organizational structure, designed to improve the quality of our execution and prioritize what is most important to our clients. Now, those changes include managing our global distribution organization in two parts, North America and international. In a manner, their balances are distribution-focused among wealth, institutional and intermediary clients, helping us provide targeted investment solutions for their specific challenges in any given market or region. Now, we've also made changes to strengthen our investment boutiques by further supporting them with market insights, analytics, and product information to power their investment success and continue to build out their infrastructure needs. This new structure will allow us to more quickly adjust our strategy and business priorities to the evolving client needs and market dynamics. Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process, and it's been paying nice dividends for us and our client. It's creating efficiency in quality benefits for them and reducing technology, operations and top-of-the-house costs for our company. These savings are enabling us to fund regulatory change and revenue initiatives. And we've been meeting or exceeding our business improvement process goals, or on target to achieve the transformational-related structural cost reductions that we stated on Investor Day, and are meeting or, in some quarters, exceeding our operating margin goals. Now, some live examples of actions that we've taken include : our procurement and technology teams are driving down our IT vendor expense. We've renegotiated large vendor contracts to our benefit and see more opportunities to do so as contracts come up for renewal. We've eliminated more than 200 market data terminals for $13 million in annual savings run rate. We fully implemented our Bring Your Own Device program, eliminating more than 90% of our company-paid handheld devices. We've been piloting robotics and machine learning processes to automate work and eliminate repetitive manual tasks. And while it's still in the early days, we have put robotics into production in several areas and believe there are excellent prospects to roll this out more broadly and further reduce our costs. And in our business partner groups, we are leveraging our location strategy, negotiating to reduce vendor costs and automating or eliminating low-value activity. Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. The UK's decision to exit the EU was and remains an opportunity to demonstrate our ability to navigate through real-life market stresses. Amidst the market volatility and increased transaction volume, in the wake of the referendum vote, we and our clients were able to continue to transact business without incident. We believe our UK and European legal entity structures, licenses and infrastructure, which includes a passport European bank in Belgium, creates a competitive advantage and positions us well to manage the potential impact of the new arrangements. Now, an exit from the EU is likely to take several years, and the final establishment of the terms of the UK market access between the UK and the EU could take much longer. Throughout this period, we will continue to conduct detailed business and risk assessments, and we'll work with our clients to respond to any changes in their needs and the market infrastructure. At least at this very early stage, we do not envision a significant impact to our operations and business. Now, our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. During the second quarter, we repurchased $509 million in common shares and we distributed $185 million in dividends. As we mentioned last month, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2016 capital plan as part of CCAR. Our board has approved the repurchase of up to $2.14 billion of common stock over a four-quarter period, and that compares to last year's five-quarter authorization of $2.4 billion. We will begin the buyback program this quarter and continue through the second quarter of 2017. They've also approved the additional repurchase of up to approximately $560 million of common stock during the period, contingent upon us issuing $750 million of preferred stock. And I'm pleased to report that we have increased our quarterly dividend by approximately 12%, beginning in the third quarter of this year. Now our fifth priority is attracting, developing and retaining top talent through our holistic people strategy that directly supports our business. Over the last quarter, we added several new people to our organization as we increase our bench strength. Some of these additions include Adam Vos, who joined us from Deutsche Bank, to head up foreign exchange trading. Adam is a proven industry leader and will help build out the market's management team under Michelle Neal. Bob Colby (11:11), an industry veteran in asset management, has joined us as our Global Head of Risk and Compliance for investment management, further strengthening our risk and compliance organization. Michael Santomassimo has joined us from JPMorgan as CFO of Investment Services, where one of his charges will center on improving profitability and return on risk-adjusted capital in these businesses. And we've also promoted and stretched a number of our talent leaders internally, including Hani Kablawi, who has been named Head of Investment Services for EMEA; Susan Revell, who is now General Counsel and Chief Controls Officer for EMEA; as well as a number of leaders in investment management related to the organizational changes that I referenced earlier. So in summary, we are executing against each of our strategic priorities and controlling what we can control. We are well-positioned to navigate through the uncertain market conditions, and the lower for longer interest rate environment, while producing strong results for our clients and our shareholders. Now with that, let me turn it over to Todd. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document, starting with slide 4, and that's the one that details our non-GAAP or operating results for the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.76. That's $0.01 lower versus the year-ago quarter, but up 3% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, second quarter revenues and expenses were each down 2%. The year-over-year revenue decline was largely driven by the gain on lease sales in the second quarter of last year, as well as the impact of the stronger dollar. Sequentially, revenue was up 1% and expenses were flat. While operating leverage on an adjusted basis was flat on a year-over-year basis, we have maintained a long-term trend of generating positive operating leverage, fueled by the success of our business improvement process, and we expect to continue this trend. As we have noted in prior quarters, the strength of the U.S. dollar continues to impact results negatively for revenue and positively for expenses. However, the net impact from currency translation is minimal to our consolidated net \u2013 excuse me, pre-tax income. Income before taxes was down 2% year-over-year on an adjusted basis and up 5% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our adjusted pre-tax margin remained at a healthy 33% in the second quarter. And return on tangible common equity on an adjusted basis was 21% for the quarter. Now moving ahead to slide eight, I will discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 1% year-over-year and they were up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects net new business, higher money market fees that were partially offset by lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the strong dollar. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher market values and net new business. Clearing services fees were up 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher money market fees, partially offset by the impact of lost business. Sequentially, higher average balances and the increase in the number of trading days were offset by lower volumes. Issuer service fees were unchanged year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Both comparisons reflect lower depository receipts revenue. Year-over-year, issuer service fees also reflect higher money market fees in corporate trust. Treasury service fees were down 3% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects higher compensating balance credits provided to clients. Now, what that does is shift revenues from fees to NIR. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher payment volumes due to an increase in the number of trading days. Second quarter investment management and performance fees were down 5% year-over-year, or 4% on a constant currency basis. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects outflows in 2015, the unfavorable impact of the strong dollar and lower performance fees. These were partially offset by higher money market fees and the April 2016 acquisition of the assets of Atherton Lane Advisers. The sequential increase of 2% primarily reflects higher equity market values and the impact of the Atherton acquisition partially offset by net outflows. FX and other trading on a consolidated basis was down 3% year-over-year and it was up 4% sequentially. FX revenue of $166 million was down 8% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower volumes partially offset by the positive net impact of foreign currency hedging activities. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the continuing trend of clients migrating to lower margin solutions. Other trading revenue of $16 million compared with $6 million in the year-ago quarter and $4 million in the first quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher fixed income trading. The sequential increase primarily reflects lower losses on hedging activities in the investment management business. Financing-related fees declined 2% to $57 million versus the year-ago quarter and they increased 6% sequentially. Distribution and servicing fees were $43 million, that's 10% higher year-over-year and sequentially. Distribution and servicing fees were favorably impacted by higher money market fees. The year-over-year increase was partially offset by fees paid to introducing brokers. Investment and other income of $74 million compared with $104 million in the year-ago quarter and $105 million in the first quarter. Both decreases primarily reflect lower lease-related gains that were partially offset by foreign currency remeasurement gains. In summary, our total fee revenue is a little stronger than it appears, as the lower lease-related gains, currency translation and the hedging activities impacted revenue by about 3%. Slide nine shows the drivers of our investment management business that help explain our underlying performance. Assets under management of $1.66 trillion was down 2% year-over-year, reflecting net outflows primarily in 2015 and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar principally versus the British pound. That was offset by higher market values. Sequentially, assets under management were up 2%. Total net outflows were down to $1 billion, continuing the improving trend we've experienced over the last year, which is in part a reflection of stronger investment performance in many of our boutiques. Long-term outflows were $5 billion, which included net long-term active inflows of $12 billion, mainly driven by continued strength in liability-driven investments. These were offset by $17 billion in index outflows. Active equity outflows were relatively modest and the lowest in seven quarters, once again helped by stronger investment performance from our active equity managers. Additionally, we had $4 billion of short-term cash inflows. Wealth management continued to deliver year-over-year pre-tax earnings growth, which is now a multi-year trend, and our successful banking expansion with Pershing continued to drive strong loan growth. Investment management loans and deposits were up 20% and 6%, respectively. Turning to our investment services metrics on slide 10. Assets under custody and administration at quarter end were a record $25.9 trillion, that's up 3% or $900 billion year-over-year, reflecting net new business and higher market values partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Linked-quarter AUC/A was up $400 billion. We estimate total new assets under custody or administration wins were $167 billion in the second quarter and we continue to have a solid pipeline of opportunities. Looking at the other key investment services metrics you can see that most are down year-over-year, and that reflects the impact of us proactively managing the balance sheet as well as certain client relationships with a focus on optimizing capital, liquidity and profitability as well as the previously disclosed impact of lost business in clearing. Turning to net interest revenue on slide 11, you'll see that on a fully taxable equivalent basis, NIR was down 2% versus the year-ago quarter and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the negative impact of interest rate hedging activities and higher premium amortization that was driven by the sharply lower rates we saw at quarter end. The yield on interest-earning assets was up 6 basis points year-over-year and it was down 2 basis points sequentially. Our net interest margin for the quarter was 98 basis points, 2 basis points lower than the year ago and 3 basis points lower than the prior quarter. The impact of hedging and the higher premium amortization drove the net interest margin a bit lower than our expectations. Before I cover expenses, let me provide you with an update on our resolution plan. While we are still evaluating our plan after receiving the Fed's guidance, we believe that changing to a single point of entry strategy rather than a bridge bank strategy will more likely result in a credible plan. Implementing this SPO (21:21) strategy will likely result in some additional expense and may require us to issue additional TLAC eligible debt. Now turning to slide 12, you'll see that the noninterest expense on an adjusted basis declined 2% year-over-year and was down slightly sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower expenses in nearly all categories, primarily driven by the favorable impact of a stronger dollar, lower staff and legal expenses and the benefit of the business improvement process. And that was partially offset by higher net occupancy and distribution and servicing expenses. Staff expenses decreased year-over-year, reflecting lower incentives. The increase in net occupancy expense reflects the cost to exit leases and that's consistent with our global real estate strategy. The savings generated by the business improvement process primarily reflect the benefits of our technology insourcing strategy as well as the benefit of renegotiating some large vendor contracts. The sequential decrease in non-interest expense primarily reflects lower staff expense, offset by higher sub-custodian, net occupancy, legal and business development expenses. The decrease in staff expense primarily reflects incentives. The increase in sub-custodian expenses primarily reflects higher client activity. The increase in net occupancy expense reflects that cost to exit certain leases. The increase in business development expense was driven by the timing of client conferences. We tend to do those in the second quarter. Turning to capital on slide 13, our fully phased-in advanced approach under common equity Tier 1 ratio on a non-GAAP basis decreased 30 basis points to 9.5%, as capital generation in the second quarter was more than offset by increases in operational risk-weighted assets. That measure is driven by external loss events that we incorporated into our model. Our supplemental leverage ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 5%. Now, we expect to see significant improvement on our supplemental leverage ratio in the third quarter as we execute on our balance sheet strategy, which is expected to reduce some of the less LCR-friendly deposits and shrink some of our lower-yielding repo activity. Additionally, as Gerald noted, our capital plan includes our intent to increase our Tier 1 capital, which would also be helpful to the SLR. Couple of other notes about this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 24.9%, which is roughly in line with our previous guidance. On page 11 of the release, we show some investment security portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our net unrealized pre-tax gain on our portfolio was $1.6 billion, that compared to $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter. Now, let me share a few thoughts to factor into your thinking about the third quarter and the rest of 2016. Third quarter earnings are generally impacted by a seasonal slowdown in transaction volumes and market-related revenue, particularly in foreign exchange, collateral services and securities lending, offset by the seasonally higher activity that we usually see in DRs. We expect NIR for the third quarter to be flat as we implement our balance sheet strategy that I just mentioned to cover both SLR and resolution plan compliance and as we manage through the lower long-term rates. We expect total expenses as adjusted for the full year to be flat to lower than they were in 2015. And lastly, our tax guidance for the full year remains unchanged at 25% to 26%. With that, let me hand it back to Gerald. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Todd. And, operator, we can now open it up for questions. Operator : Certainly. Thank you. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up question. [Operation Instructions] Our first question will come from Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Gerald, I was hoping you could elaborate on the potential for robotics across the organization as you look out a few years. And then also, perhaps, touch on the cost of data. I know you noted a reduction in market data terminals, but hoping you could give us a sense of how much the firm spends today and how the firm is thinking about procuring data, especially as you strive to deliver more analytical solutions to clients. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, Ashley, I think your first question was about Brexit. Is that correct? Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Oh, no. Sorry. The potential for robotics across the organization. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Robotics. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sorry. Sorry. Yeah, robotics. So right now, we have three bots \u2013 30, I'm sorry \u2013 30 bots in production right now across six different processes. We're very encouraged by the results. It's really taking some of the manual mind-numbing exercises out of the process and doing it at a lower cost. So we started with a couple of bots in one process and we since expanded it. So we're actually pretty encouraged by the upside associated with this. We think we're in the early stages of it and we see other applications across other processes. So, I'm actually encouraged by it and think it could be a real potential upside for us. On market data, as we pointed out in the opening comments, we've reduced terminals, we're reducing data feeds. If you think about our company, we have lots of market data feeds in so many different business areas. We actually have an effort underway to look across the enterprise to see if we can either reduce the number of feeds, consolidate the number of feeds or certainly negotiate the cost of those feeds a heck of a lot better than we've done on an individual business-by-business basis. So again, we think there's some further upside to reducing those costs associated with market data inputs. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks for the color there. And a question for Todd. It just seems like this typical uplift you see in securities lending was a little bit more muted this year. I was just hoping you could share any color on what's going on in that business. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think on the equity front, you're seeing less of the tax arbitrage than what you had seen in previous years. And so that was typically a second quarter event with dividends. And if you look at the increase in the spreads that we did see in the quarter, I think there were more specials in government securities, so we did benefit a little bit from that. So if you look at the total securities lent, they're down slightly on a year-over-year basis, but you can see the spreads are improving quite nicely as we, I think, manage down some of the risk-weighted asset implication to it and are a little more selective on what we're lending and generating a little bit higher yield out of what we are lending. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And our next question will come from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Thanks, guys. Good morning. A question around resolution and the expense outlook that you guys just highlighted. Todd, can you provide a little more color, I guess, how much more an elevated reg spend getting compliant will cost you guys as you go through this process and maybe the timing of that? I mean, it sounds like a lot of that is going to be kind of second half of this year and then it should probably phase down into 2017. And I guess more importantly, it seems like you're keeping your overall expense guidance in line with what you said in the past kind of flat to slightly down. So what are the areas where you're finding incremental savings to offset the more elevated regulated spend? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Alex. So the guidance we did give, so I'd say it's a little bit improved from what we had previously given, and that is on a year-over-year basis. We do expect to be flat, perhaps down a bit on total expenses. And that includes a number of headwinds. We have the higher distribution fees related to fee waivers. It's kind of a good expense. So as the fee waivers abate, we incur that expense. The government assessments are going up substantially. So, the Single Resolution Fund in Europe, the bank levies and increased FDIC expense is up substantially. And then, we've mentioned the higher regulatory cost associated with compliance with the resolution plans as well as the demands around CCAR. So those are all incorporated into the run rate that I just mentioned. All other expenses should more than offset what I just mentioned. So our staff expenses are going down for a number of reasons. Some of the automation, some of our location strategies are paying off. We've been able to manage down our legal expenses substantially. Some of that is because of the number of matters, and some of that is because of some of the actions that our legal team has taken to reduce those costs. We've been able to manage down even in front of all of that, did a lot of consulting expenses where you see a lot of the regulatory compliance come in. But despite that, we've been able to manage down some of our consulting expenses. Our real estate strategy is a paying off and we expect real estate and occupancy expenses to be down for the year. So it's really almost across the board. It's no one thing, Alex; it's a very large number of small items. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. And then a clean-up item on net interest income. Can you give us what premium amortization was in the quarter? I mean, it sounded like it was a bit of a drag sequentially last quarter. You guys had a hedging loss, which I think was expected to kind of revert back in 2Q. So as we're thinking about kind of the headwind that was created by premium amortization, can you just give us a number? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So there are two things that are going on there : one, the hedging loss. That is a net gain. And so, geographically, it's a gain in trading and a loss in NIR. We didn't expect it to happen two quarters in a row, but it did and it's related to hedging the company's debt issuance. And that \u2013 and the combination of the increased amortization, and that was just largely driven by the very sharp drop in rates that we saw right at the end of the quarter when we make that adjustment. The combination of the year-over-year basis was about $25 million, so it hit the NIM by about 4 basis points. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And now we'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The NII guide in the back half, does that \u2013 I know that you had indicated your expense outlook would be reflective of potential headwinds from living will. But does the NII guide also include the potential headwinds that you flag onto a HQLA? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : So what we guided in the third quarter, assuming that the Fed doesn't take any action in the third quarter, that we would expect NIR to be flat with the number that we just posted. There could be some additional debt issuance that we would incur in the quarter, as well as I had mentioned that we are going to reduce the balance sheet with some of the unfriendly \u2013 what we call LCR-unfriendly \u2013 the liquidity coverage ratio-unfriendly deposits as well as some of the lower-yielding repo that we have on the books. That combination should substantially improve the SLR ratio and I think put us in a good position for next year's compliance. And there's a possibility there could be additional TLAC post that. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. But it's too early to determine, I guess, exactly how that would shake out. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : It really is, Brennan, because we have not \u2013 we've simply not been able to complete the financial analysis at this time. And I probably should give you a little more color. Effectively, if we need to issue TLAC to preposition so that we could support, say, the institutional bank in the time of crisis, what we would do is we would issue debt and we'd probably invest it in a similar duration, high-quality liquid asset. Let's just say it was treasuries. That costs us about 100 basis points. So we end up doing $5 billion of that. It's going to cost us about $50 million over the course of the year. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's great. Thanks for clarifying there. And then, is it possible \u2013 could you give us in constant dollar operating leverage both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : It's possible, but I don't have it at my fingertips. It's almost not impactful. There was more noise within the currencies, so you saw a move between sterling and euro but the net impact was relatively modest, less than 100 basis points to revenue or expenses for the entire company. So net-net in operating leverage, that doesn't do much. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : So you... Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The reported... Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Sorry. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The reported operating leverage numbers will essentially be \u2013 they're pretty currency-adjusted ones. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Okay, great. So, effectively, even though you highlighted and included the currency translation in the noise impacting your fee revenue, when we think about it on a net bottom line impact, that really didn't have an operating leverage impact this quarter. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Well, think about it. It's 1%. It's approximately 1% of both. So, net-net, that's not going to do too much to operating leverage. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Yes, got it. Thank you. Operator : And now we'll move next to Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good mornings, folks. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Brian. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just to do a quickie on expenses. The lease exit costs I think, Todd, you referenced the increase sequentially to that. So, should we imply about of $10 million of lease exit costs that are sort of onetime in nature? And then also on your expense guidance on flat to possibly down for this year, do you have distribution expenses related to money market fee waivers going up, I guess, in terms of like factoring when you have the Fed raising rates? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Brian, in terms of the \u2013 it's a little less than $10 million, but somewhere approximating that... Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : ...and on the lease exit costs. And from time to time, you're going to continue to see us do this as we manage our real estate portfolio. So, it just makes sense for us to get back some space to consolidate and just improve our workspace in general. And in terms of the fee waivers, we do reflect what our projection is throughout the rest of the year and that's incorporated \u2013 excuse me, our distribution fees. That's incorporated into that number. The assumption that we made in the number is that there's no additional Fed tightening. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay, that's clear. And then maybe just switching gears on maybe either Gerald or I don't know if Brian's on the call as well, if you could just give us an update on the T. Rowe mid-office contract onboarding. I think there were some more revenues coming in later this year on that. And then just in also the $167 billion of new wins, the timing of that and the client mix there. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I'll let Brian handle that. Brian is on the call here. Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : Okay. Thanks, Gerald. So, Brian, taking the new wins first. New wins tend to be bumpy in asset servicing, so you see volatility in that number. But we had a pretty good quarter, with $167 billion in AUC new wins. About $100 billion of that was from one large insurance company client that we're excited about bringing on board. And we still see longer term secular trends in the asset management space, where asset managers really do want to focus on their core value proposition in the investment process and they're looking for lower, more variabilized capital-light solutions. So we see real opportunities in the middle office space for asset managers for hedge funds. And we obviously are now signing up our first third-party clients following the lift-out of the Deutsche Bank real estate and private equity admin business last year. We have actually signed six clients year-to-date, new clients, so that's going to start to be a source of revenue. And so overall, we feel good about the long-term prospects for asset servicing growth. And what was the first part? Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: The T. Rowe. Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : So on T. Rowe Price, we're moving along well with T. Rowe Price. Last August we actually lifted out their middle office team and we're operating their middle office and fund accounting services every day. And the service levels and the relationship are strong and we continue to work through the implementation plan to convert them to our fund accounting technology platform and our middle office services platform. So we're still moving along nicely. There always are some technical things that have to be resolved along the way, but we are moving along well with T. Rowe Price. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And is there a revenue lift as you implement that through this year? Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : I would say there's been some \u2013 we obviously are getting revenue from the middle office services since the middle of last year. I think you should think about that more like in 2017. Not any real growth in the revenue this year. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And now we'll go to Ken Usdin of Jefferies. And, Ken, your line is open. If you could please check your mute function. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks. Todd, I was wondering if you could elaborate more on the activity side of the business. The core FX was down a little bit; less seasonality in sec lending, which we know is a little bit more on the changing dynamics in Europe. And then clearing, you mentioned lower volumes. Can you just talk about kind of how the quarter progressed in terms of the activity side? And did Brexit have an impact at the end? And then how do you see the markets behaving now? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So in terms of Brexit, a little bit frustrating. It was probably a negative for us for the quarter. So what we saw was a little bit of an increase and a little flurry in FX activity at the end of the quarter, but that was effectively given back by the hedge that we have on investment management because of the very low interest rates. And then the fact that the amortization of the premium against the NIR was driven by the very low interest rates, I'd basically say it cost us about $0.01 as we look back to it. So far this quarter, I think the activity has been a little elevated in FX, so a pretty good start. Whether that's going to sustain itself or not, we'll have to see. In terms of activity across the investment service, Brian, you're probably better suited to answer that. Clearing activity I guess was a little bit softer for most of the quarter. But generally activity is not bad. Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : Yeah, I would say that. Clearing services, as we've said, has been affected by some lost clients and some client business exits, particularly from some U.S. wealth management clients. But overall, the clearing services fees were up 1% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, which is pretty strong performance considering the lost business. It's owed to the fact that we've got a pretty diverse client base and we've got very diverse fee revenue sources, so we're not as exposed to transactional revenue. And we're benefiting from the restoration of fee waivers driven by the December rate increase and we had some good retirement fee growth. And we have benefited from bringing on board the JPMorgan clearing clients in the second half of last year, which is less fee-driven, but a combination of fee and NII that's helping the clearing services line overall. And we're focused on growing, particularly in the RIA market. And we continue to see interest from self-clearing firms that are trying to lower their costs and variablize their costs to reduce their capital and regulatory change investment. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, and I also mentioned DRs tend to be a little episodic, so I think there was some softness there when you look at our sequential and as well as our year-over-year numbers. And typically the third quarter will be good for that. That pretty much directly hits the bottom line, so that's something where we saw probably a little bit softer activity. One of the areas that's looking stronger is in collateral management. And as we now look at uncleared margin requirements, we're right in the middle of benefiting from that and segregating the collateral and acting as custodian in those transactions. So, we're starting to see that activity pick up pretty much in line with the guidance that we've given you for a while. It's been slower for the regulations to actually get into place, but now that's developing as well. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Ken... Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Yeah. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Ken, I just would like to add, when you look across the markets, whether it's emerging markets' interest rates, whatever the case may be, our core underlying businesses I think are performing reasonably well. Issuance in the Corporate Trust area in DRs has actually been down, but we've had a higher-than-market share gain in those spaces. And so while it's flat, when you look at the overall market activity, us being flat is actually a positive. When you look at asset servicing and you think of some of the things that we've won here, I think the core underlying business has got some pretty decent solid momentum. In clearing services, even though we've lost business on a year-over-year basis, to fully recover that and show a little bit of increase, again, I think the core underlying business is performing well. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Fair point, Gerald. Just a follow-up on capital and the preferreds. So you got the preferred kind of aligned with the CCAR, as you said, and also I think presumably as part of your further SLR build. So can you talk about just the expected timing of when you might get the market for preferreds? And bigger picture is, should we expect that the preferred as connected with CCAR is an annual thing and now it's part of rightsizing the capital structure? Or once you get this last one and get SLR compliant, are you done? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Ken, I think that when we look at our capital stack in the nature of our risk, we probably could do some additional preferred relative to common equity, especially when you think that it's the Tier 1 that drives the SLR ratio, which is our binding \u2013 what I'll call spot capital constraint. I can't really speak to the timing of any issuance. But if you look at what was disclosed in the CCAR, we did get approval to do $750 million and buyback a substantial part of that, but not all of it. So that will generate some additional Tier 1. And with interest rates down as low as they are, it's a pretty attractive form of capital. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question will come from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hello there. Todd... Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hello. Could I get a clarification on just two things you mentioned earlier? One was curious on what external loss events got incorporated in this quarter for the ops risk RWA that would have the capital ratios fall sequentially. And the other one was within FX trading. You talked about clients migrating to lower margin products. I'm just looking for an example of what that is and if you see that as a sustainable trend. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Okay. I'll answer the question on the operating losses. Effectively, what happens is when large losses, and a lot of these are settlement types of losses, go into an external database, it helps to inform our \u2013 if you think about this, we distribute a potential \u2013 there's a potential distribution of losses. There's a probability of them occurring. That distribution is informed by those large losses, so I can't identify specifically which one it was, but they keep coming, if you will. And they don't fall out of that database for 10 years or so. So that's what's affecting it. So it keeps picking up on some of these litigations. There is some consideration to taking a look at how operational risk is computed and it's likely that this will change in the not-too-distant future. There are some big discussions within the regulatory bodies right now. We do expect that there will probably be some relief coming within the next couple of quarters on how that's computed, but I can't really confirm that at this time. So, that's what drives it and you'll see it in \u2013 I don't think it's exclusive to us, where you've seen some of that noise around operational risk losses and the addition to risk-weighted assets. Now, it's kind of interesting, Glenn, because if you look at the CCAR test, the CCAR test is not against the advanced approach. The advanced approach is the one that includes the model for operating losses. It's using the standardized approach. And so, if you look at our ratios on a standardized approach, they didn't go down into the quarter. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Right. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : And in fact, they have now a substantial \u2013 they're substantially higher than the advanced approach. So the good news is, this is not really a constraining issue for us because when we go through the CCAR, we're testing against a much higher ratio. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Makes sense. I appreciate that. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And then, Glenn, the answer on the foreign exchange, as we've commented in the earnings release, we continue to see \u2013 and it's been a relatively long-term trend \u2013 a shift in client activity from either the old standing instruction type of activity to negotiated rates and electronic platforms as the market continues to become more competitive on a price point of view, and that's been absorbed in our foreign exchange results. And we, of course, have built out additional options for our clients and they're utilizing those options, but we did want to call out the fact that there's been a shift in the activity. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Got it. Last quickie, LDI is now 34% of AUM. Maybe the best acquisition is never in asset management. But curious how that progresses when we live in this world of low rates and a flatter curve, like I thought growth was getting tapped out and waiting on higher rates, but I guess that's wrong. Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer- Investment Management : Yeah, no. This is Mitchell. It's the pipeline, the conversations we're having with our clients and prospects. We're still showing a very robust and very healthy pipeline, quite frankly, in the UK. We're looking to obviously extend that success into the U.S. That will be slow. But, no, the client behavior has not changed at all and the interest is still as high as it's ever been. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But, Glenn, if you think about it with a lower-for-longer interest rate environment and pension liability is not declining, these firms need to come up with a better solution to match the liabilities against the returns on the assets. That's exactly what our firm does, what Insight does. It really knows and tries to understand the liability structures and develop investment returns to better match it. Pension funds all over the world are struggling with this. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you all. Operator : And our next question will come from Mike Mayo of CLSA. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. On expenses, you're making progress year-over-year linked quarter, but head count is still up and if you can reconcile that. And then, separately, you're guiding now for better expense guidance flat to down, is that simply reflecting the progress you've made in the first half of the year? Because it looks like that's where you're headed, anyway. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, Mike, on head count, yes, we've added some head counts in the technology sectors. We finished insourcing the contractors and have application developed largely in-house now. We've added some folks in the asset servicing and operations areas to support the new business we've taken on and some of the strategic initiatives that we've taken on with clients. But I think I'd really point you to the fact that the staff expense has been down. So we're putting people in the right locations at the right levels to offset the increase in the head counts. So we're really trying to manage staff not just purely from a head count point of view, but from an overall cost perspective. And I think that's the more important way to look at it. And yes, we have additional people doing certain things to match the activity on the client and the initiative side. So... Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : And the regulatory side. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And the regulatory side. We've insourced and are building a more sustainable capability to deal with the regulatory items that we're being asked to deal with. So instead of using consultants and a lot of third parties, we are building sustainable teams to be able to handle whether it's CCAR, CLAR, resolution plans, whatever the case may be, and we think we're doing it in a more cost-effective way. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : And so, Mike, when we have temporary staff, they don't show up in the head count numbers, but they do show up in the salary numbers. So one of the big things we've been doing is replacing them by more cost-efficient permanent staff, as well as the insourcing of some of the developers that has continued. So the head count is not necessarily a good reflection, that's why we keep saying let's take a look at staff expense. But we've also got the initiatives that we've had to accommodate with T. Rowe and some of the other ones that we've discussed this morning, as well as significant increases in regulatory and compliance-related staff. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And the final part of your question, we do see an ability to garner additional gains out of our business improvement process to offset these cost increases, to be able to sustain a flat to decline in expenses through the course of the year. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : And then just one follow-up. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Just to be clear. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Yeah. For the business improvement process, can you just summarize like where are you in that process? Are you one-fourth done, one-half done, three-fourths done, I mean, because you're relying on this to navigate a tough environment? How much more do you have? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : My colleague, Brian Shea, is biting at the bit on this one. He wants to speak as we'll never be done. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're never done, Brian. Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : Todd and Gerald said it well. I echo that. It's a continuous \u2013 we're calling it a business improvement process on purpose. It's not a project or a program; it's a process. We're going to drive continuous improvement in our operating efficiency, our productivity, our service quality, in every aspect of the way we operate. And so we have a pipeline, Mike, of other initiatives and other process improvements that we're going to drive across the company. So more to do on location strategy, more to do on technology, more opportunity to reduce vendor costs, more opportunity to shift traditional servers to the cloud. And so, we really think we have a sustainable, continuous process improvement approach and it's really a cultural change in the way we're operating and I think it's really gaining more traction every day. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : I can't help it, what is the BYOD policy? Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : Bring your own device. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : In other words, all employees buy their own device, it's their choice. We will reimburse them for company-driven activity. But essentially, everyone chooses their own device and their own carrier, then we put our applications that are company applications up on it in a secured manner for them to use. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Oh, hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. On the initiatives around reducing some of those LCR-unfriendly deposits, I wondered if you could quantify the scale of deposits that you're looking to reduce. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : So there are two elements. One is we think we can encourage some of our clients rather than to leave the money on our balance sheet to sweep it into money market funds so that we can continue to earn some margin, maybe a little bit less than what we would have earned on balance sheet, but the capital benefits far outweigh that. And then, there are some of the, what I'll call, the hotter money that doesn't get positive LCR treatment, which we're going to \u2013 we still have some on our balance sheet which we are going to discourage off of the balance sheet. And then, we have some repo activity where occasionally, we will basically run what looks like a matched book. The scale of that, every $10 billion is about 15 basis points to the SLR. So it wouldn't \u2013 we could do $20 billion or $30 billion relatively easily and fall within the guidance that I gave you on NIRs is our current estimate. We also generate from intangible amortization and employee compensation issuance of the common stock about 5 basis points a quarter or so. So that's kind of the scale that we're talking about. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : And then just a quick follow-up. Money market fee waivers, how much of a potential upside is still left from those going away? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, we have recovered. It's a little bit different in our various businesses, but in aggregate for the company, we've probably recovered a little bit over 50% of the fee waivers with the first 25-basis-point move. There wasn't much of a change. We got it in the first quarter and we got it in the second quarter, so it's really not much of a change quarter-to-quarter. And we had indicated that a 50-basis-point move would give us about 70% and we \u2013 I'd still stick with that estimate for now. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And now we'll go to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Betsy. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I had a question on money market funds and the transition that's going on in the industry. We've got the prime, non-prime transition happening in October. Could you talk a little bit about what you've done so far? I know you've moved some of your funds to govies, but could you talk about what you've done so far? What's left to do, if any, and if there's any impact that we should be expecting on either gross margins or any other relevant metrics as we go into the third, fourth and first quarter? Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer- Investment Management : It's Mitchell, Betsy. I think that from a transition point of view, we're prepared for the move and we've made all the regulatory changes already. So I don't see any expense or any related issues there. From a yield perspective, we're all trying to continue to increase yields, but what you see happening is a couple of things in the market. First off, prime funds have already started industry-wide to decrease. There's been about a 28% shift in asset moves from prime to treasury. In addition to that, the overall market is down about 4% where we've been down about 1%. So we're doing a bit better on that front. And that prime has also decreased a little less than the industry and that only 24% of our assets have moved. We still expect about a third to a half of prime assets to move out into treasury funds over the next quarter. Exactly how much, we're not sure. But we've got the products and we are continuing to look carefully at yields in order to make sure that the shift goes into our treasuries. Alternative products such as insured deposit accounts are also possible where people will move funds, too. It's still a little bit wait-and-see and quite frankly, it's going to be this third quarter where we're really going to see how the movements play out, but I think we're very well-positioned for it. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And you're basically taking liquidity into liquidity. You're not seeing a trend of investors moving from liquidity product into maybe a bit of a barbell strategy to try to maintain yields. Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer- Investment Management : No. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer- Investment Management : No, not at all. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And I think the volatility uncertainty in the market, there's a lot more cash being held in general. Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer- Investment Management : There's a lot more cash being held and their funds are holding a lot more cash in anticipation of a shift between funds. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. And I guess what I'm surprised that is that only a third move. So you're saying two-thirds of the funds are willing to accept the higher risk associated with the prime fund structure. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think they're waiting till the last minute. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer- Investment Management : Yeah. Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : And, Betsy, it's Brian. From a servicing perspective, we've invested in the changes we need to make to our systems to support a floating NAV institutional prime money funds and we are on track to be ready to serve our clients in October seamlessly. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Because that's a flip of the switch day out, right? Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : Yeah. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO- Investment Services : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : And next we will go to Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up, but if you could help us think through more specifics around Brexit, if there's shifting you need to do in terms of client assets or people. And if we should think is there any material impact on you guys in terms of your UK presence from the declining pound? Any specifics that you can share with us? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Great question. Thank you for it. We are extremely well positioned. We already have in place and have had in place for a long period of time a Belgian Brussels bank. It is well established. It's an operating center. It has capital liquidity, governance, management, everything that a European bank is required to have. And it's already passportable across all of Europe. In addition, we have a UK bank and we have a branch of our institutional bank in the UK. We also have a bank in Luxembourg that's also fully registered and then we have operations in Ireland as well. So we think we have lots of choice for our clients as they go through this. And, particularly, the fund managers, when they have to think about the jurisdiction of their funds, if they have to move them from the UK to a European-passported location, we are very well positioned to help them get there. So we think we're in good shape operationally to help our clients deal with whatever impact Brexit offers. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: So no real incremental expense for you guys. Do you see any impact on your clients that could be adverse, or is it just really just shifting AUM around and no real net outflow? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : One, I think it's early to tell. I think our clients are all going to go through is does it make sense to make the shift. They're going to go through the process of is there marginal activity that warrants continuing to make the investment and/or shift versus shutting it down. I think we're very early in the process, but we have the expertise and the legal entities and the structures to be able to help our clients navigate those decisions. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Right. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And any impact from the pound on you guys that's material? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Not really. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : We have some pound/euro cross-exposure, but I don't think it's substantial. And when we looked at our performance for the second quarter, there was a fair amount of noise in the currencies. But when it all came netted down, it was within $1 million of impact. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Adam Beatty of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you and good morning. First for Mitchell on the distribution strategy in investment services. Obviously, it's a pretty broad topic with your different geographies and market segments. But just was wondering, maybe get some highlights on the strategic thinking behind that. Where you would expect the greatest leverage in the relatively near term and how the boutiques will play a role? Thanks. Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer- Investment Management : Thanks for that. There's several things. You have really institutional retail and wealth, so you have several different distribution points. And then you have with the institutional, we've traditionally been focused on the U.S. and I think we've broadened it because we've had opportunities out in Asia. So we're strengthening Asia where there are more immediate opportunities. And clearly pockets are growing, both specifically on the sovereign wealth, but on the institutional side. Japan has some terrific opportunities there and we've certainly been focused on those. On the retail side, when you think about the DOL and the changes taking place there, I think all we're doing is rebalancing both how we interact with the intermediary side, given the changes. The RIAs and the private banks, we haven't had enough focus, particularly on the RIA segment, which is the fastest-growing segment from a distribution perspective. And then on the wealth side, we've continued with the build-out of Atherton to focus really on where pockets of wealth in the southern part of the United States and out West have been growing. We've been more focused on the traditional, I'll call it the industrial, belt of Detroit, Chicago and those kind of \u2013 and the East Pittsburgh, New York. So it's where the pockets of wealth are. It's segmentation of what segments of wealth are growing, and that are the women, the Hispanics in particular. So we're looking both geographically and on a segmentation basis. And with respect to the boutiques, the boutiques are focused primarily on the institutional markets and the center is focused primarily on the retail markets. So I think we've clarified or cleaned up where each of our responsibilities lie. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. So the boutiques are basically going into the institutional market on a stand-alone basis somewhat. Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer- Investment Management : Yes, in their home markets. In Asia, we're representing all of them. It's much more efficient to do it that way out in the Asian markets. And the servicing that they require, particularly the Japanese, it's a very high level of service, so it's best done on a consolidated basis. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. That's great. Thank you. And then on Pershing, just wanted to step back a little bit, a lot of crosscurrents with some doing self-clearing, some competitors exiting, probably a net headwind in the recent past. But just comparing a multi-year growth trajectory and then looking out, would you expect higher growth? Lower growth? Same? And also maybe a comment on some of the RIA price cuts at Schwab. Thank you. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I would say a couple things. We've had two of our large U.S. wealth management clients owned by FIs exit and we still have one more to go. We've been obviously offsetting that fee pressure with new business from competitors in transition and pivoting more of our resources toward growth in the RIA market. We think the Department of Labor fiduciary standard is going to obviously continue to accelerate the secular trend from traditional brokerage commission-based relationships to advisory-based relationships. And Pershing is well-positioned with managed account platforms, advisory tools and an RIA custody business that's growing high-double digits to benefit from that perspective. We're also continuing to extend the prime services business in a modest, controlled way. And so there's a variety of I think longer-term trends, including those self-clearing firms that can drive reasonable growth in the clearing services business. The pressure is on the broker-dealer model overall, which is a headwind. There are 800 fewer broker-dealers in United States today than they were pre-financial crisis and there are still more pressures on their business model. So that's a headwind, but we're pivoting toward serving larger firms and the RIA market and other services, which I think will offset that. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's great. And maybe on the competitive action from Schwab. Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : We focus on professionally managing large advisors. So our targeted market in the advisory space tends to be a much larger advisory firm rather than an individual practitioner and we tend to focus also higher net-worth investors at the end of the day. So we've got some differentiating factors. For example, and this is a combination of Pershing and BNY Mellon at its best, we've integrated a bank and brokerage custody platform that enables us to deliver both of those options through a seamless front-end technology solution. Another example where we're creating distinction is through delivering private banking services to introducing broker-dealers and RIAs. We've talked about this before, but at the end of the second quarter, we've now reached $3 billion in outstanding credit facilities driven from our private banks to those RIA and broker-dealer intermediaries and over $2 billion of those facilities have been drawn and used. So that's creating a stronger competitive value proposition for those independent advisors and broker-dealers, and it's also creating sort of another virtual private banking capability for our private bank. And it's a great example of enterprise teamwork. So Schwab's obviously a market leader in what they do. We're focused on leveraging the best of BNY Mellon to distinguish ourselves in the RIA market. Operator : And our final question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, guys. I had a question regarding \u2013 there was a story in this morning's paper about direct repo loans are gaining traction as the large global banks step back. Is this an opportunity for you guys to get more business from some of your existing clients or create new clients? Or could it work against you? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's an interesting question. We always want to maintain great credit standards before jumping into something like this. We also have to be mindful of the effect to the balance sheet. And so, there is opportunity for us to be direct with certain clients. And so, on a client-by-client basis, we're looking at it carefully. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then second as a follow-up, Gerald, to your comment about the issues with the pension funds around the world with the rate environment, the way it is, and the unfounded liabilities, have you guys tried to quantify how much you could help them shrink that gap versus having to structurally change the pension fund, whether lowering the payout or raising the contributions by the municipality, the corporate or the entity that has it? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I would say in the UK, we're very, very active. We're just beginning in the U.S. and just beginning in other parts of the world. And we actually have an initiative going on here in the U.S. extending the Insight business model here. We did a small acquisition last year that's integrated into Insight to address that very issue. So, we're moving around the country and having that dialogue as we speak. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Is it fair to say that your reception is probably very good from who you're talking to? Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would say generally, yes. There's lots of accounting challenges associated with pension liabilities and pension accounting in company's balance sheet in the U.S., so it's not an easy answer. We want to help manage to the returns, the pension funds we're looking for. We don't want to assume the pension liability. Some insurance companies are actually buying the liabilities. We don't have an interest in doing that. But we are interested in working with either the companies or those who are taking on the liabilities to manage to a prescribed return. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you for the color. Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, thank you very much everyone for dialing in. Sorry, we had to cut off the questions, but we're over time. But I know Valerie Haertel and her whole team are available for additional questions and thank you very much. Operator : And once again, ladies and gentlemen, if there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at (212) 635-8529. Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call webcast. Thank you again for participating.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie Haertel : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to the BNY Mellon third quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as members of our executive leadership team. Our third quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results, and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 20, 2016, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald? Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Valerie, and thank you for joining us this morning. As you may have seen from our release, we delivered strong results for the quarter. On adjusted basis we are $0.90 per share up 22% year-over-year. Total revenues grew 4% while total noninterest expenses were down 1%. We generated more than 500 basis point of positive operating leverage resulting in an adjusted pretax operating margin of 35%. Now since we shared our three-year strategic plan with you in October 2014, we have delivered seven straight quarter of solid performance against these goals despite the relative lack of industry and market catalysts building a strong track record of success, managing what we can control through all environments. Our assets under custody and administration increased to $30.5 trillion and our assets under management increased to $1.7 trillion. Our success reflects our relentless focus on creating new solutions for our clients, reducing costs and improving our client experience. It also reflects the progress we are making in our cultural, structural and operational transformation. All of this has created a more collaborative and solutions driven approach in working with our client. Now, central to our growth strategy is investing in future revenue generating initiative, deleverage our expertise and scale as we seek to strike the right balance to deliver both near-term and long-term shareholder value. NEXEN, our digital ecosystem is one of the most transformational of our investment. NEXEN is digitizing our company and in the process enhancing our clients experience in creating efficiencies for us. Clients are just beginning to experience the ease with which they can connect with us at their desktops or on their mobile device. While it's early days we are confident in our future as we continue to invest, innovate and transform into a digital data-driven global financial services powerhouse. But let me update you on the progress against our strategic priorities. Our top priority is enhancing the client experience and driving profitable revenue growth. These goals are interconnected, one enhances the other. Some examples and investment services include building best-in-class technology and operations, to deliver middle office outsourcing solution efficiently and profitably. Our timing to expand this business could not be better. We have a solid pipeline reflecting the secular trend of asset managers, thinking lower cost solutions. We continue to focus on growing our collateral management capability with global regulatory reform reshaping and redefining the way market participant host initial and variation margin. We work with the industry to implement new initial margin requirements, there were effective on September 1 of this year. We enhanced our capabilities, met a market need and it is already positively contributing to earnings. Our margin segregation platform supports the new requirement with a high degree of automation and transparency and represents a growing new revenue stream for us. The alternatives administration business, we've had some good recent wins including significant deals across three major alternative manager segment, real estate, private equity and single manager hedge funds. We are also executing on a comprehensive technology platform transformation program. It will consolidate all alternative servicing onto a global platform. It will leverage NEXEN. This will increase our scale, deliver seamless global capabilities and improve the overall client experience. Our pipeline in alternative servicing remains strong and we expect to see continued success. BNY Mellon treasury services has just been named among the top five of all global cash managers in Euromoney's 2016 cash management survey based on a survey of treasury professional. In the payment space, we've been innovating and driving industry change. In the U.S. we\u2019re working with our clients to provide early access to the clearinghouses, real-time payment network which will also be accessed through NEXEN. In investment management we had a strong quarter with fees up 4% year-over-year and pretax income excluding intangibles up 7%. Inflows into alternatives and LDI continued their growth trend as we progress with our approach of providing the strategies most in demand by our clients to meet their investment calls. Under Mitchell Harris's leadership we\u2019ve been laser focused on enhancing our core functions, improving the investment performance in key strategy and strengthening our distribution capability. We're centralizing business functions and further leveraging the resources of BNY Mellon, and we curtailed initiative that aren\u2019t core to our strategic priorities so we can better direct our resource. So for example this quarter we closed a reverse mortgage business. Our disciplined execution against these areas of focus is helping drive near-term performance, positioning us to attract new asset flows and drive improved margin. In terms of our investment performance, over the last 12 months and at a time when few active managers are outperforming their benchmark, our top revenue generating investment strategies have performed well. Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process which is benefiting us and our clients. The savings we generate are enabling us to fund regulatory change, investment strategic revenue growth initiatives and reward shareholders more consistently. We are meeting or exceeding both our cost-saving goals and operating margin targets that we laid out on Investor Day. And we're far from being done. In this quarter alone we further optimize our real estate portfolio. We shed 9% of rentable square footage occupied year-over-year and at the end of September we close on the sale of 525 William Penn Place, which eliminated 25% over 600,000 rentable square footage of our downtown Pittsburgh campus. Our procurement and technology teams have continued to renegotiate key IT vendor contracts to reduce pricing and eliminate unnecessary spend. We continue to manage our balance sheet and align the drivers of costs with client pricing. For example, we impose new pricing that incent it clients to reduce average daily overdraft balance. At this month we opened our 7 Global Innovation Centre, this one in Central New York. This one will focus on harnessing robotics and machine learning to reduce our costs and free our staff to focus on higher value activity. We continue to add bolts to support processes in the areas of client on-boarding, global institutional accounting and corporate trust. Now there is a good-sized pipeline of other projects under review and we expect more robotics automation to be deployed in the near future. And also during the third quarter we held the sell side tour of our innovation center in Pittsburgh with an opportunity to showcase our NEXEN ecosystem, and the applications available today and what is in the pipeline to deliver to clients in the future. NEXEN provides a single gateway to deliver all of BNY Mellon solutions, as well as best-in-class third-party application. So let me give you a couple of examples of our current capability. In terms of blockchain, we're using distributed ledger technology for system resiliency in our new broker-dealer services system which is up and running today. We created a tool called BDS 360 using a distributed ledger to reconcile transactions between clearance and repo platforms. Our asset servicing businesses use our digital pulse big data analytics platform for real-time tracking of NAV production activities against client completion deadline. It's also used for predictive analytics to project completion times against historic trends. So there's many exciting developments that are going on in our technology area. Our third priority centers on being a strong phase trusted counterparty. On September 30, we submitted our resolution plan to the regulators outlining our strategy to further enhance the resolvability of our company including measures to ensure the recapitalization, liquidity support of our material entities. We strengthened our capital ratios during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio on a fully phased-in basis was up 70 basis points to 5.7% and our common equity Tier 1 ratio was up 30 basis points. We also issued $1 billion of preferred stock and one of the lowest rates ever indicating the market confidence and our financial strength. Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. During the third quarter, we repurchased 464 million in common shares and we distributed 205 million in dividends. As a reminder, our Board approved the repurchase of up to $2.7 billion of common stock over a four quarter period which includes a repurchase of approximately 560 million, contingent upon the successful issuance of the preferred which obviously we've already done. And we began our buyback program during the third quarter and it will continue through the second quarter of 2017. Our fifth priority is attracting, developing and retaining top talent. We continue to prioritize bringing great talent into our company while further developing and promoting the talent we have. We welcomed our newest independent board member, Elizabeth Robinson, a former Goldman Sachs Partner and Global Treasure. Liz will be a great asset to BNY Mellon as we continue to execute on our strategic and regulatory initiatives. Hanneke Smits joined us in August as the CEO-designate of Newton. She has long been recognized as a rising star in the investment world. Her proven expertise in growing a global firm across developed and emerging markets equip her well to lead Newton's next phase of growth. Niamh De Niese joined us to head up our EMEA Innovation Center. She has held a number of senior technology and innovation leadership positions in the financial services and consulting industry, most recently heading Visa's European Innovation Labs. Alex Batlin, respected crypto-currency expert will be joining Niamh in our EMEA Innovation Center to bolster our effort around blockchain. Dana Hostipodi will join us next month from Morgan Stanley as Chief Operating Officer of our HR area and global head of HR Solutions. Dana will help drive our efforts to reengineer our HR operating model, to provide an even greater strategic value and impact to the organization. And we're already realizing on some of the benefits of our talent related effort. We were ranked fourth in Glassdoor's 50 best places to interview in 2016 survey which suggests we\u2019re getting an candidate experience right. The Anita Borg Institute has named BNY Mellon to the 2016 top companies for women technology leadership index, reflecting our success in recruiting, retaining and advancing more women in technology roles. And very importantly we also make it a priority to develop and provide more growth opportunities for our talent within the company. And adverse global teams we built are making a realtor for our client and our shareholders. I would also like to take the opportunity to publicly thank Karen Peetz, who is retiring at the end of this year for her leadership, partnership and contribution to our firm over the last 19 year. We will miss her wise counsel and wish her and her family well as she moves to the next chapter of her life. So in summary a strong quarter in terms of our financial performance, our strategy is benefiting our clients and our shareholders through all market environment. We are executing on our key priorities and we are confident in our future. With that let me turn it over to Todd. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks Gerald and good morning everyone. My commentary will follow our financial highlights document, starting with Slide 4 which details our non-GAAP or operating results for the quarter. Our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.90 that's 22% higher than the year ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis third quarter revenue was up 4%, expenses were down 1%, and we generated 511 basis points of positive operating leverage. As we've noted in prior quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to impact results negatively for revenues and it's positive for the expense categories. However the net impact from currency translation is minimal to our consolidated pretax income. Income before taxes was up 15% year-over-year on an adjusted basis and it was up 12% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis our adjusted pretax margin was up four percentage points to 35%. Now while this reflection part of the progress we continue to make it's not a watermark we would expect to match in coming quarters as we benefited this quarter from seasonally higher DR fees. And return on intangible common equity on an adjusted basis was nearly 24% for the quarter that's up three percentage points. Moving ahead to Slide 8, I'll discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher money market fees and securities lending revenue and that was partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar and the downsizing of our U.K. transfer agency business. Clearing services fees were up 1% year-over-year and they were down slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher money market fees partially offset by the impact of the previously disclosed lost business largely driven by industry consolidation. Issuer service fees were up 8% year-over-year and 44% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher fees in corporate actions and depositary receipts and higher money market fees in corporate trust. The sequential increase primarily reflects seasonally higher fees and depositary receipts. Treasury service fees were unchanged year-over-year and 1% lower sequentially. Third quarter investment management and performance fees were up 4% year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher market values and money market fees, offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar principally driven by the weaker pound and net outflows of assets under management in prior periods. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher market values. FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. FX of revenue over 175 million was down 3% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower volumes and volatility and that was partially offset by the positive net impact of foreign currency hedging activity. The year-over-year decrease also reflects the continued trend of clients migrating to lower margin products. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher depositary receipt-related FX activity partially offset by little lower volatility. Financing related fees declined 18% versus the year ago quarter to 58 million and they were up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower underwriting fees and lower fees related to secured intraday credit that we provided to dealers in connection with their third party repo activity. As we noted the following the implementation of these facilities in the second quarter of 2015, we expected market participants to moderate their usage and rely less on our credit facilities in the following quarters and that has played out pretty much as expected. Distribution and servicing fees were 43 million, 5% higher year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher money market fees partially offset by fees paid to introducing brokers. Investment and other income of 92 million compared with 59 million in the year ago quarter and 74 million in the second quarter. Both increases primarily reflect higher asset related and seed capital gains. Moving to Slide 9 which shows the drivers of our investment management business and I think that will help to explain our underlying performance. Assets under management of 1.72 trillion was up 6% year-over-year, that's reflecting higher market values offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger dollar, sequentially assets under management were up 3%. Long-term flows of 1 billion included inflows of 3 billion into our actively managed strategies. We had 2 million of outflows from index strategies. Additionally we had $1 million of short-term cash outflows. Wealth management continued its multiyear pretax earnings growth trend year-over-year as we focused on high growth U.S. markets. Our successful program to extend banking solutions to wealth clients through Pershing continued to drive strong loan growth. Investment management loans were up 20% and deposits were up 2% year-over-year. Now turning to our investment services metrics on Slide 10. You can see that assets under custody and administration at year end were a record $30.5 trillion up 7% or $2 trillion year-over-year reflecting higher market values offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Linked quarter AUCA was up 3% or 1 trillion. We estimated new assets under custody and/or administration business wins were 150 billion in the third quarter. Now we've heard some questions around this metric and want to remind you that we only include wins in this metric if they will add to the total AUCA. For example if a client who already has custody has his assets with us, chooses to use us for fund accounting for those assets, we would not include that in this metrics since the custody business already captured the AUCA. Looking at the other key investment services metrics you will see the impact of us proactively managing the balance sheet and certain client relationships with a focus on optimizing capital liquidity and profitability, as well as the impact of lost business in clearing. Turning to net interest revenue on Slide 11 you'll see that on a fully taxable equivalent basis, NIR was up 2% versus the year ago quarter and 1% sequentially. Both increases primarily reflect the actions we have taken to reduce the levels of our lower yielding interest-earning assets, and higher yielding interest-bearing deposits, as well as the impact of higher market interest rate. The sequential increase also reflects higher average loans. The actions we took and the higher market rates drove our net interest margin for the quarter to 106 basis points, 8 basis points higher than both the year ago and prior quarter. As we previously indicated we have been evaluating the impact of a resolution planning strategy on net interest revenue. We currently believe that requires us to issue approximately $ 2 billion to $4 billion of incremental unsecured long-term debt above what would be our typical funding requirements by July of 2017, and that is to satisfy the resource needs at a time of distress. This estimate is subject to change of course as we further refine our strategy and related assumptions. This is currently expected to have only a modest negative impact to net interest revenue. Turning to Slide 12 you'll see that noninterest expense on an adjusted basis declined 1% year-over-year and increased slightly sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower expenses in almost all categories primarily driven by the favorable impact of a stronger dollar, lower other, software and equipment, legal, net occupancy and business development expenses. And that was partially offset by higher staff and distribution and servicing expenses. The increase in staff expense was primarily due to higher incentive and severance expenses and the annual employee merit increase and that was partially offset by lower temporary services expense. We continue to benefit from the savings generated by the business improvement process, including the continued impact from vendor renegotiation and the execution of additional real estate actions that allow us to optimize our physical footprint and improve how our employees work. We are running the cost to generate these savings through our operating earnings each quarter because this is a continuous process, it's not a one-time project. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher staff expense and M&I litigation and restructuring charges partially offset by lower expenses in nearly all other expense categories including business development, sub custody, net occupancy and other software and equipment expenses. Now turning to capital on Slide 13, our fully phased-in advanced approach common equity tier 1 ratio and this is computed on a non-GAAP basis increased 30 basis points to 9.8%, as we generated $286 million of capital after dividends and buybacks. Our supplemental leverage ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 5.7%, that's up 70 basis points reflecting lower deposit and balance sheet levels and the benefit of the $1 billion preferred stock issued in the quarter. Two other notes about the quarter, the effective tax rate was 24.6%, and on page 11 of the release we show some investment and securities portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our net unrealized pre-tax gain in the portfolio was 1.4 billion that compares to 1.6 billion at the end of the second quarter with a decrease primarily driven by a slight increase in market rates. Now, let me share a few thoughts to factor into your thinking about the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter earnings are typically impacted by a seasonal decline in depositary receipts, total revenue with a limited offset in expenses. We currently estimated the decline in the fourth quarter from the third quarter to be approximately a $130 million. We expect performance fees in our investment management business in the fourth quarter to be flat to slightly down versus the fourth quarter of last year. NIR for the fourth quarter is expected to be flat to up slightly. SLR may decline slightly as we increase buybacks following the preferred issuance. We expect total expenses for the full year now to be down 1% to 2%. And lastly, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. With that, let me hand it back to Gerald. Gerald Hassell : Thank you, Todd. And we can open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao : Good morning. So, you've got some great margin improvement, but it feels like Investment Management isn't where you want it to be yet. So I was curious if you could provide us an update on how you are thinking about the margin potential for the segment. At this point, is margin expansion more dependent on your various revenue growth initiatives? Or is there more work to do on the expense side of the story, too? Gerald Hassell : So why don't I take the beginning of that and then ask Mitchell to comment. We do think there is additional margin improvement within investment management. I would note that we are running through the existing expense space. The cost associated with severance and shutdown of certain businesses. So that's in the existing expense space. I also will say that we are very pleased to see some positive flows into our active management areas, which has some good fees associated with them. So the expenses are bit high at the moment as we freed up a variety of activities and we do think the revenues are starting to come on due to strong investment performance. So Mitchell, why don\u2019t you add some additional comment? Mitchell Harris : Yes. I think that on the expense side we have taken some actions. There are some severance charges and one-offs in there as we\u2019ve shutdown a number of initiatives that you\u2019ll see really flow through into 2017. So it\u2019s the noise of the expense of reducing the run rate cost that you\u2019re seeing this year you won\u2019t see next year, number one. Number two, the industry has had a lot of challenges on the asset close side but in saying that we\u2019re well diversified, people were reactive versus passive. We have 18% of our assets in passive, so we\u2019re nicely diversified on that front. Performance is looking very strong with respect to \u2013 with respect to our equity performance is been good and flows have been slowing down, negative outflows have been slowing down. You do see we\u2019ve been building more alternative strategies, our alternative inflows have been increasing modestly over the last few quarters and has been positive for at least five to six quarters. Those have high margins. The asset mix meaning that the equity outflows have slowed. You have some outflows in indexing were passive. Those are much lower margins. So the way the flow situation is looking, I think it will start to benefit us going forward. And I think we\u2019re nicely positioned given the regulatory environment with the DOL to win some of this business next year. We had some idiosyncratic issues with sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East that we\u2019ve concentrated and I think those are forfeited as well. So I guess, the long and short is I see opportunities on the revenue side and I think we have been quite aggressive on the expense side. You'll see more flow through in the beginning of next year. Ashley Serrao : Thanks for all the color there. I guess our other question was -- I was curious what the client reception has been to some of the balance sheet actions taken this quarter on the deposit side, and if you feel you can do more here. Thomas Gibbons : Sure. This is Todd, actually I\u2019ll take that. As we had indicated in the second quarter there were two things we\u2019re going to do. One is we\u2019re going to downsize the activity that was not client related that was taking place in treasury. So we did have some deposit taking and some reverse repo and repo activity in treasury that expanded the balance sheet by about $20 million or so that we took down in the quarter. Those were relatively high-yielding funding sources and the margins and that was relatively low and that's why you saw the NIM improve. That had very limited impact or zero impact on the clients. There are some adjustments to clients, but again, its just a \u2013 it\u2019s a handful of clients and we\u2019re providing them alternatives to our balance sheet. So we don't think its going to have a meaningful impact to the client relationships. We have actually see a little bit of a spike in the fourth quarter in our deposit base, primarily related to one-time events, very large escrow balances around some corporate trust activity. So we have and since seen that decline, but it will impact slightly the average deposit just for the quarter but not for the long run. So we think we can continue to bring down the balance sheet a little bit. We don\u2019t have to bring it down a whole lot more. We do need to bring it down a little bit because you can see the progress that we made in the quarter was a little ahead of what we had anticipated in 5, 7 DSO. So I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape without knowing a lot more or impacting our NIR to meet our capital targets. Ashley Serrao : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, I just want to ask about the servicing business. You mentioned you had good wins again. AUC/A was up really nicely; but it was down a couple million even ex-sec lending or just down slightly. I'm just wondering, could you talk through -- is there seasonality in asset servicing on the collateral business? Is there fee capture challenge, or did some of the business just not convert yet? Can you just walk us through your expectations for asset servicing and the trajectory there? Thanks. Brian Shea : Yes. This is Brian Shea, happy to do that. I guess, you know, the asset servicing business was \u2013 the fee revenue was flat sort of year-over-year and sequentially, driven by a little bit of improved fee waivers and improves net new business offset by some of the unfavorable impact of currency and little bit lighter activity volume in the score. So I think, the other thing that\u2019s affecting our servicing business is that we are really focused on profitable growth over pure revenue and market share. There's a \u2013 we\u2019ve been going through a portfolio review of prior services and solutions and reducing things that are not really profitable or don\u2019t add good return. The best example of that which actually is putting downward fee revenue pressure on us but improve in our profitability is the repositioning of our UK, TA business and we are committed to the global institutional TA business and growing that but the UK local retail business we\u2019ve been exiting and so we\u2019re actually pushing out revenue and clients to other providers. And what's happening is we\u2019re just reducing our revenue but our operating margins fee expense ratio and our profitability is improving. So that\u2019s really the focus of the asset servicing business. We think longer-term, there is a secular trends where asset managers are under fee pressure, particularly active asset managers, and so we think there's a longer term trend that's in our favor around middle of its outsourcing, extending our technology solutions. The need for growth for collateral services and derivatives marginally promise all the other things that we think will drive longer term growth and enhance servicing business. Ken Usdin : Great. Thanks, Brian. So second question just on the expense side. Todd, you mentioned that the year-over-year is still being helped a little bit by FX translation, but down 1% to 2% is still a great result regardless. Can you help us understand, just of the full year benefits how much of that is FX translation? And then as you look out, depending on that first part, do you think you can replicate the type of stable, if not declining, growth as you look into in 2017 and beyond, given that you still seem to have a lot of this stuff still on the come? Thomas Gibbons : Sure. So couple of questions there, Ken, but first one as to the impact, its probably about 100 basis points. And If you look at our operating leverage is probably reflecting about 100 basis points in our operating leverage. So we are getting a tailwind to the expense phase from the strength of the dollar. And specifically, but the move in sterling because we do have a fairly large expense base in sterling, more sets offsetting us and then offsetting our revenue lines and the one that Brian just walk you through asset servicing \u2013 it has to \u2013 has a significant component of non-dollar related revenues that\u2019s being impacted. That being said, the underlying trends, I mean we did make investments in this quarter to continue to manage down our costs \u2013 across a number of different line items. And I think we \u2013 I think we made some good progress that Gerald pointed out on the occupancy front as we exited another building in Pittsburgh and we got the benefit of our programs in New York kicking on a year-over-year basis as well as what we\u2019ve done in Philadelphia and Boston, so there's a little more room in occupancy and we also have continued to make investments in automation. And I think there's more to come there and we\u2019re also that we need to take some severance which gives us the opportunity to get our staff in the right locations as well. So I think we\u2019ll continue to make good progress. I think we \u2013 Brian and I and Mitchell lead the team that identify opportunities and continue to add to the list and it\u2019s \u2013 like we say it\u2019s not a program it\u2019s a process and we\u2019re not complete yet. I did give guidance for the full year on my opening remarks and we now anticipate expenses to be down 1% to 2%. Frankly that did get the benefit of the stronger dollar but its also reflecting that we\u2019ve been able to do some of the things that will lower cost that we had anticipated. Our compliance and regulatory cost continue to go up and so we\u2019re running. Right now we absorbed at a pretty hard rate. The cost associated with submitting our October 1st resolution submission and we\u2019re continuing to work hard to July of next year. Those cost will be relatively high but we\u2019re absorbing it from the \u2013 we are absorbing an instant run rate from the other things that we\u2019ve been doing. And theirs is also kind of a virtuous cycle that we get as we\u2019ve invested in the actions to reduce our cost across the Board and are drawing off that\u2019s giving us the opportunity to invest an additional actions. So preceding 2% or 3% in expenses we\u2019re putting 1% to 2% back into future benefits. So I guess the only guidance I would give right now is that we do expect to be down for the full year in the 1% to 2% range. And there\u2019s more to come. Ken Usdin : Thanks, Todd. Great color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. One quick follow-up in that whole balance sheet remixing and NIM dynamic. You gave us a lot of detail on the deposit front. Was that the bulk of the 8 basis points? Or is there -- can you tell us what you're doing on the asset side also? In terms of -- there was some commentary in the release on moving towards higher-yielding assets. Just curious for some color. Gerald Hassell : Yes, Glenn, this there was - the driver of our balance is the right end size, so the actions growing through Repo and defined reducing deposits mostly out of Treasury \u2013 of our Treasury Department is what brought the balance sheet down. And what we do have left hand side was just reduced lower yielding assets. We are seeing some \u2013 we did see over the course \u2013 of the course some growth in our loan growth which is one of the highest yielding portfolio, so the combination of those two things both increased NIR while bringing the balance sheet down. And we - so there is no real remixing if you will outside of the actions I just described. Glenn Schorr : Cool. I appreciate that. Then one other follow-up on the asset management conversation. So I guess I'm curious. You had mentioned some fee pressure for the industry. You also mentioned that you have some good performance. But as you've been trying to build out the retail distribution side, we have the fee pressures you mentioned, but also distributors are now looking for more compensation in a post-DOL world. Can you talk about some of those pressures and how it impacts you guys specifically? Gerald Hassell : Yes. Sure. A couple of things. More than fee pressure is flow pressure. It\u2019s the amount of outflows in the industry if you think about what\u2019s happen though obviously it does impact fees as well. And particularly on the DOL side, I think there is a couple of things on our retail basis we're doing several things. First off, with the DOL, the focus is really on the home office not that on t the field, so we don't need as much field coverage as we had in the past as the home office will be to a research-based model making decisions with respect to what goes on their platform. If you get the exact amount but if you look I think [indiscernible] they had about 4000 products there on their platform and they are looking to go to a thousand. So what happens is you have to have either highly active products that were good price passive products with scale with performance and the right pricing in order to be on that platform, so we need to be in a position to be on that platform by making sure the pricing is right, and that we've got the right performing products for them. And as a result of that you will get a lot more scale because with a reduction of that many products the assets will be much more concentrated into fewer products and we think we can position ourselves nicely to end up remaining on those platforms and achieving the scale that will offset some of the price pressures quite frankly. Thomas Gibbons : Glenn, just as a reminder about 80% of our assets under management are institutional and so as gearing the same fee pressure there as oppose to be performing certain thing from an enterprise perspective we have a very large distribution platform called Version [ph] and so with maybe a negative effect on one side it has a positive effect on the other. Glenn Schorr : I definitely appreciate that. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hi, guys; good morning. Hey, Todd, just a quick -- I guess another follow-up around the balance sheet and then an NIR discussion. If you look by bucket, it looked like security yield has dropped pretty meaningfully sequentially; and maybe some of that, it's just a lower rate backdrop in Europe. But curious if you guys can give us a little more color what's going on there. I don't know if there was any premium amortization that was hurting that this quarter that may or may not reverse. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. There was a little premium amortization \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a significant drop there. In fact, sequentially the securities yields were flat versus down from a year ago flat at this point. And we actually think that we will see that turnaround will \u2013 the recent improvement in the yield curve is a net positive and some of these securities are repricing at LIBOR and they are getting the benefit of higher LIBOR. So we are actually are getting back to securities\u2026 Alex Blostein : Got you. Then your comment around flat to slightly up NIR next quarter, does that assume a December hike? I guess if not, given the balance sheet moved around a little bit, all else equal, how, I guess, should we be thinking about the NIM impact from a 25 basis point hike in December? Thomas Gibbons : Well, 25 basis points in December won\u2019t do much for us because its just a short period of time. Because its only be a couple of weeks in the entire quarter. So it wouldn\u2019t hurt but it would drive the deal a whole lot. We are getting some benefits from the LIBOR rests, so the LIBOR spreads are I think is going to up on average in the quarter. So we\u2019re starting to see some of that benefit now. That\u2019s primarily \u2013 that\u2019s probably the number one driver of why we think this is going to be up in the quarter. There are kind of two good things that happened this quarter \u2013 that\u2019s happening right now is number one, we are seeing the higher short-term LIBOR rates and yield curve as deep into little business. We have some reinvestments to do in this quarter. We are picking up a little benefit from that yield curve. And that\u2019s why we felt comfortable saying that flat to up despite the smaller balance sheet that we\u2019re targeting for the quarter. Alex Blostein : Right. Sorry; I should have said just like in a run-rate steady-state benefit. So I get the fourth quarter; not a ton of benefit. But I'm just saying like from a run-rate perspective, what kind of sensitivity to the NIM should we think about from a 25 basis point hike? Gerald Hassell : Well, we've given you some color if you look at the -- if you look at the queue and sensitivity to the 100 basis points the rate move is typically in the vicinity of about $100 million to $150 million of benefit to net interest income. And that includes so the NIM is probably a little more positive, because that includes some run off size of the balance sheet, yes, it's still positive today, net interest income. Alex Blostein : Got you. Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. One, Gerald, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the new growing revenue streams that you've got in some of your new businesses; I think specifically around investor services. Maybe you could speak to that a little bit and size it for us. Gerald Hassell : Yes, what I referring to is couple of things. They are generally collateral management and the initial margining that we put in place sort of large broker dealers that they have to comply with the requirement. As of September 1st we work with all the market participants, got the documentation in place that this is up and running. And we are already seeing positive revenue flows as a result of that. Collateral management broadly across the world, you need to grow nicely. And Brian mentioned the middle-office outsourcing is a real opportunity. We've got a lot of people lined up. We want to make sure those dialogues are in such a way that they are willing to do more standardize approach to that offer servicing, so it's difficult for us them and profitable for us. I'd say those are the key areas that we see opportunities strengthening. Betsy Graseck : The collateral management side is coming through the fee line? Or is it also partly coming through the NII line? Gerald Hassell : It's mostly fees. Betsy Graseck : Yes, okay. And then the other question, Todd, for you is on the real estate activities that you're doing and the shrinkage in real estate. You highlighted -- what was it -- 600,000 square feet coming off of your books. Could you just give us a sense as to the size of that and how much it impacts your expense line? And then looking forward, how much of the real estate that you have today do you think that you could shed over the next year or so? Thomas Gibbons : Sure. So occupancy historically has been running. It was over $600 million. We brought the run rate for the full year to $100 million to $600 million and we've actually brought down, we look at the -- we call it vacancy, but we look at the space for employ and we brought that down dramatically as we have a lot of vacant space throughout the company. So we are managing that far more aggressively. I wouldn\u2019t get fixated too much on that line, because I said $600 million of expense on over $10 billion base line. But it does improve where we were the efficiency of how we work and making sure that we are getting in the locations that are most efficient for our staff. So, little more on that line that we think we can do, certainly it's nice to see it going down while revenues are actually going up. Betsy Graseck : Okay. But your run rate this quarter suggests that there should be more downward pressure there into next year as well. Right? Thomas Gibbons : It's also Betsy we are running any actions and we are taking to reduce further cost through that line, so from time to time you may see us take some action as we shut something down, if we terminate all this early something like now we might see a little bit open that and we are just eating that through that line. So I can't really say that from quarter to quarter it's going to just slightly down. You might see every now and then that we've done something to improve the future for us. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Then just trajectory on the overall efficiency ratio, I know you spoke earlier to the asset manager side of the business. But maybe you could speak to the overall expense ratio, investor services in the Company generally. How much more legs do you think it has over the next cycle here? Gerald Hassell : I'll start and I'll hand it over to Brian. So if you look at the ratio that we show you expenses grow our fees relatively to expenses and we have moved that. There is some seasonality into but if you adjust on a year-over-year basis, we move that meaningfully another 300 basis points this year versus and 300 basis points last year. So this particular quarter we are now at 103% which is the best that we've printed. So I think it's reflecting the strategies that we've got. I mean one of the things that Brian pointed out we are exciting some businesses that were not profitable, have high cost. So we've given up a little revenue, but it's really benefited us in the profitability and it's also benefiting us in this particular metric, in terms of where more actions, more work we think we can go. Brian? Brian Thomas Shea : Yes, I think that 103% is 100% for us and even adjusted through seasonality and it's still up significantly year-over-year. So it's the quarter is improving. I echoed your comments Todd and Gerald comments so I think this is improving process. It's really part of the cultural change and we are gaining momentum and we still have a pipeline of initiatives including people think of business portfolio when we have done some of that, but we are looking more now deeply at product service and solution for reduce, and again making sure that we are gaining good return on the investment and good client adoption value from the investments we are making. So I think you'll see continue tweaking of the product service and solution portfolio and review, continued progress on every element of this is improvement process, the alignment of the drivers of our costs with client pricing, Gerald mentioned the overdraft angle, we have a pipeline of other an issues there. And we are driving more value from in enterprise team work which there is many examples of that, but our ability of one is the an excellent platform it's going to be also deliver over the whole company in a way that it enables us to drive cost to the solutions more and more. And I guess you know the cost or trial for this also doing well. It's partnership between Pershing and the private bank where we now have over well over $3 billion in credit facility established from our private bank to our independent broker dealer and all right Pershing and that's a significant revenue driver for wealth management business. It's a great example of the lever will increase sort of connecting the solutions across the investment process. So all of those things are captured and tracked in the business improvement process and I think we have more to do. Gerald Hassell : That the average is bad on the structural cost side, we are still finishing up converting on the number of operating platforms, where I think we are still on the early innings of further automation through artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotic. I think we've got more work to do and more opportunity on chopping away the core structural cost. So we are actually fairly optimistic that we can keep on this pace. Betsy Graseck : Okay. The pace that you've had over the last year, fairly optimistic you can keep that going over the near term? Gerald Hassell : Yes, we can't get you infinite operating leverage or margin that 100%, we have to keep reinvesting in the businesses, but we feel good that we can keep chopping away the core structural cost of the company. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA Bank. Mike Mayo : Hi, Gerald. I just want to know the punch line from what you just said : You can keep chopping away. We heard a lot of positive initiatives with the business improvement process, from real estate to cultural change to digitization and NEXEN to -- and you're optimistic that it can stay in place. On the other hand, the guidance that you gave at the top of the call implies the profit margin, which was 35% in the third quarter, would decline in the fourth quarter. So where do you think the profit margin should be over time, and where do you think it will be? And I guess I have some follow-ups to that. But subpoint to the question where will be pretax margin be : the Investment Management slide, Slide 19, that hasn't shown the good year-over-year improvement. You have middle-market outsourcing, which in the past has caused some upfront cost; and I guess your money market fee waivers are mostly recaptured. Thomas Gibbons : Mike this is Todd. I'll take over the higher level to Gerald. In terms of I just want to remind you that the third quarter is a seasonally positive quarter to us, because we do our business and we indicated in my remarks that we would expect the revenue is associated with that business declined by $130 million in the fourth quarter and there are no real cost that basically a fixed cost business and there is no cost that come out as a result of that. So we -- and I'll also pointed out that the operating margin this is it's a -- it's high watermark for us, but not one that we would expect to see and more in new quarters, we expect to see it from the third quarter next year. So what we have done as we seasonally adjusted, we are grinding the operating margins up and we're seeing positive whatever we've done year-over-year basis, which I think is the way you have to look at this, because we did have some seasonality in our numbers. Gerald if you wanted to comment. Gerald Hassell : Broadly investment management side, I think we've said in our opening commentary and Mitchell alluded to it. We are running through the expense space, severance cost, restructuring cost, shutting down a business cost and the margin did in fact improve. We said publicly and Mitchell and I are both committed to it that we can improve those margins further. It does require a certain level of revenue mix, but we're not going to depend on that. So we think there is further opportunities to improve the core functions than leverage the scale and breadth of the rest of the trend, as well as making sure that they have - continue to have the investment process totally under the control and the investment management use. So we think there's better way to leverage the company, improve the margins and add business as well. And as I said, to Betsy's question, everything within operations and technology, investments we're making are paying off. You're seeing it in the positive operating leverage. I'm not going to change guidance from Investor Day, Mike. I know you keep asking me to do at each quarter, but I think we are fulfilling those goals and we are going talk to you this time next year about future goals for another three years. Mitchell Harris : Mike, I think you also have the question in there around fee waivers. And our view of fee waivers right now is what we have indicated before the fed move is that we saw a 50 basis point move with result in about 70% of the reduction in our fee waivers. Our fee waivers are indicator that we are running at about $0.60 a quarter. With the first 25 basis point more it look like we got about 50% of that so that is in our run rate. In the asset management business, the business has gotten a bit competitive so it has been slightly to those numbers. We would expect an additional 25 basis points or so to fulfill that 70% target that we had our estimate that we had previously given. So if its $0.07 a quarter, if we get another 25 basis point move, we would say there is probably about another 20% in there. So about $0.01 a quarter, as we will see another 25 basis points, so that\u2019s probably - may be a little bit more if we go beyond that we've got a whole lot more. Mike Mayo : And then I think I snuck in a question about middle-market outsourcing. In the past that would cause some upfront fees and you'd get the benefit down the road. Is that still the case? Gerald Hassell : That is generally that's the case, but as Brian and I both said we really want to make sure we have the right kind of client with the right kind of mindset in terms of kind of do more standardized work versus customize work. We do not want to take on business that will be long-term drag on our firm. So we go through a very, very robust analysis and we've had experience from these different mid-office outsourcing arrangements. So we are doing in a very disciplined fashion way. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great; thanks very much. Maybe just to tag along on that question and tie it into the longer-term trend post-DOL. On the mid-office, the standardized versus the customized, obviously the T. Rowe deal and large deals like that tend to be more customized. Are you willing to look at taking on those big deals, or really going back to that more standardized strategy? And then do you think asset managers will essentially adopt that standardized strategy? Then also on the clearing side, I think, Brian, you mentioned some benefits longer-term from your business on DOL in clearing; if you can elaborate on that a little more. Brian Shea : Yes. So it's Brian, I'll start at the mid-office solution. So as Gerald mentioned, we really are taking the business discipline approach to this and we're making sure we're aligned with the assent management client and what they're trying to accomplishes with. What they're really trying to accomplish is lower variable costs, lower capital investment in technology, and increasing share economies to scale. So the best way to do that is to drive on what kind of an operating model, a platform that more than one client can leverage because that's where the benefits comes for us and all the clients. And so we are only getting into these in arrangements when we have the mindset of the partner is generally to get that enables us to create those share economy to scale. But they're also driving a technology platform strategy that's going to enable us to onboard these clients faster and make it easier for them to get the customized information and data they want. So we've talked a lot about NEXEN and we showcased to do longest to a number of hours including, I mean on this call. And basically NEXEN is an API-driven system and it enables the asset managers to get data they want, on demand, the way they need it. And so it's a much more effective way of helping clients get the customized information they want without creating customized development. And so that's going to be one of the ways we're into knowing meet asset manager need effectively without creating extra cost. We're also going to feel the speedy on boarding these clients in the future. Brian Bedell : And then on the Pershing side? Brian Shea : Yes, on the clearing side, look we expect the Department of Labor Fiduciary Standard to drive more RIA activity. I mean people are going to shift from commission based to traditional brokerage business to RIA. That's set a significant trend for a long time. We expect it to accelerate. And so we expect a real growth in our RIA custody business and we are helping our brokerage-dealer clients who want to take advantage of the best interest contract and component of the Department of Labor Ruling. Pershing is developing the capabilities to help the clients comply which we think will initially help them, but we're also providing all the RIA custody and account tools and capability of any to ship their business much more toward the advisory model. And our RIA custody business is growing in double-digit in social revenue and in terms of AUC, so a pretty well position to take advantage of the shift that's going to happen in RIA market. Brian Bedell : And you think that could be fairly immediate, like next year? Brian Shea : Well, it's happening already. It's been happening but it's accelerating. Yes, in the DOL rules in fact next year. So you'll see -- I think you're see real shifts in broker-dealer business models as a result. Brian Bedell : Great. Then just a longer-term question for both Gerald and Mitchell, as we think about the active and passive trends. If they continue, how does that make you feel about consolidation or appetite for acquisitions there? I guess the question is : Do you think there will be more consolidation in the asset management industry? And do you think you can be a participant in that on the buying side? Gerald Hassell : Well, I do think there will be further consolidation. You just saw an announcement fairly recently because it's going to become a scale business like our servicing business. We continue to look at our boutiques and whether they have sufficient scale and feasibilities, virtually all of them do. And they are very strong in terms of their investment performance in the size and scale of what they can offer the marketplace. So I do think it's going to be a scale business. We're always mindful of looking at our portfolio the right way from a business and a shareholder perspective, so we'll see. Mitchell Harris : Just a little more color perhaps is that one thing I will just remind everyone is that on the passive side, let me just mention that it's about revenues and people talk about the assets on passive side. They don't make a lot of money, the margins on that. You're making 1 or 2 basis points and your operational risks are enormous. So that clearly is a scale business that you'll have a hand full of players consolidating into. On the equity side what you saw with Janus and Henderson, if you don't have good performance, you're not going to survive. So you're going to see a lot of third \u2013 fourth-quartile equity performers having to emerge or get out of the market that it's not sustainable. What I'm saying that, you know, active is going to continue to survive and thrive. We are largely in that space that we do have as I said, 18% exposure to the path inside and there are some cyclicality to it. We've been in a 7 or 8 year full market that favors indexing that when those markets start to lift and they will, active equity management, active management is going to do well again. So it's a mix story is what I'm saying. And I think we are nicely positioned for it and we'll see what opportunities come up and make sense giving where we're going with it all. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks for that color. Operator : Our next question comes from new line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I actually want to follow up on that RIA discussion briefly. We've seen increasing M&A and consolidation in the RIA channel. So when you think about going forward, one of the potential outcomes from DOL may be being a shift and a need for scale, a greater need for scale certainly amongst the RIAs, do you think or are you already seeing some of that consolidation leading to more negotiating power for some of your counterparties in that business, and then maybe either current or the potential for some pressure on those revenue yields and margins? Mitchell Harris : I think there will be consolidation in the retail advise business so one broker dealers need to shift towards an advisory model pretty rapidly. We\u2019re providing them the tools to do that successfully and I think many of them will really made that pivot and succeed and they are deeply already on that trail. Some will struggle and I think there\u2019ll be more consolidation in the broker dealer market as a result and to your point there may also be consolidation in the advisory market. Our model in the RIA market is more focused on larger registered investor advisory business so they\u2019re not individual practitioners. We serve registered investor advisory companies and they tend to have groups of advisors and they tend to be larger advisors. So to the extent that there is consolidation in that space we think we\u2019ll be a beneficiary because we tend to observe our average advisor in bigger and more likely to be an acquirer than not but although we\u2019re not immune from the market forces that are out there. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that. Thomas Gibbons : On the margins side I think they should be pretty steady. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have fee compression in terms of competitive pressure. I think overall there is a broader base sort of change underway in advisor fees generally driven by a variety of factors including DOL, including the rise of digital advise and things like that which could put some downward pressure but if you look at the growth of assets and the growth of the wealth market overall I think that fundamental growth should offset some of the pressure on margins. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. Thanks for that. Then for my second question, the spread improvement in sec lending, apologies if you hit this before, but I don't remember hearing it. Could you maybe break down how much of that was rate versus hard to borrow? Thomas Gibbons : I think we benefit in the securities lending and the agency book on both of accounts. I don\u2019t have an exact splint between the two but we did benefit from the higher LIBOR rates and some of the resets that come along with that and there were quite a few specials in the quarter where we did benefit so I would say it was a combination of the two, the specials probably being the greatest. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for the color. Valerie Haertel : I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Out final question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. Just one question on the asset management and the flows in the LDI business. They were little bit lower than what they have been in recent quarters. But could you also remind us : How do those flows react when rates rise? Would that put less pressure on clients to use the LDI strategy? Thomas Gibbons : A couple of things. First off let me just touch on the flow. The average flows per quarter last year were about 11 billion. This year I am sorry that this year they\u2019re actually averaging 11 billion even though they were only 4 billion in the third quarter. They averaged 9 billion last year per quarter so from a average perspective we\u2019re still seeing strong flow into LDIs and the pipeline is showing quite consistently, we see a pretty strong and consistent pipeline for the LDI business, number one. Number two, what you saw in the third quarter a little bit is the impact because so much of it is related to Sterling the 15% drop in Sterling has had a FX impact on what you\u2019re seeing from the flows. With respect to the interest rate rise and its impact from a UK perspective we don\u2019t foresee any interest rate rises and since the core of the business is where we really don\u2019t see a significant impact there. The amount of business we have or we\u2019ll start to have in the U.S. is fairly nascent so we don\u2019t believe it will have a material impact on us as we start to enter new markets and grow quite frankly where there hasn\u2019t been a lot of growth in the past. So we see it as still a significant opportunity for us irrespective of what happen to interest rates. With respect to interest rates we don\u2019t see them moving that much. Gerald Hassell : The interest rates are a long, long way away from where they\u2019re on a normalized basis than in pension funds all around the planet can\u2019t get the returns they\u2019re looking for to satisfy liabilities so I think this business still has a lot of legs to it. Gerald Hassell : With that I want to before closing the call first of all, thank you all for dialing in and your interest in us and of course you can have some followup questions with Valerie Haertel but I also want to encourage you to watch the premier the documentary Hamilton's America which is this Friday night on Public Broadcasting Systems Great Performance Series. It\u2019s a biography of our founder Alexander Hamilton as seen through the lens of Lin-Manuel Miranda and he obviously created the hit shows Hamilton over a six-year period of time. I saw it the other night, it\u2019s fascinating, it\u2019s part of American history. I think you\u2019ll be enthralled with it particularly if you are a history buff and interested in how the financial markets started and evolved so it\u2019s a great documentary and I encourage you to watch it and of course we have sponsored it and we also believe that Alexander Hamilton\u2019s inventiveness and vision is still part of the DNA of our company and we\u2019re going to continue that legacy forward. So again thank you for dialing in today and I look forward to catching up you soon. Thanks everybody. Operator : If there are any addition questions or comments you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference call webcast.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie Haertel : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome everyone to the BNY Mellon fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as members of our executive leadership team. Our fourth quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results, and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 19, 2017 and we will not update forward-looking statements. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald? Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Valerie, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 performance. Our fourth quarter results cap off another solid year. Our financial performance reflects our focus on executing on our strategic priorities, the benefits of our well-diversified low-risk business model, and our ability to create value through all environments.  Importantly, we continue to prioritize improving the client experience, delivering value today while investing in our people, capabilities and technology to deliver even more in the future.  For the full year on an adjusted basis, earnings per share was up 11%. Total revenue was up slightly, while total expense was down 3% resulting in nearly 300 basis points of positive operating leverage. Net interest revenue was up 4%. We improved our pre-tax operating margin to 33% and our return on tangible common equity was 21%. So we remain on track to achieve or exceed the three year goals we set forth in late 2014.  Turning to the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, we earned $0.77 per share, up 13% year-over-year. For the quarter, total revenue was up 2%. Total expense was down 2% and we generated approximately 350 basis points of positive operating leverage, mainly driven by higher investment services fees and the successful execution of our business improvement process and our return on tangible common equity was 21%. Now let me update you on our progress against some of our key strategic priorities during 2016. Our top priority is enhancing the client experience and driving profitable revenue growth. During 2016, we made progress on a number of fronts. We continued to enhance and introduce distinctive new capabilities where we see long-term growth opportunities.  In investment services, we are investing in collateral optimization technology, derivatives margin solutions, liquidity services, middle-office outsourcing for asset managers and institutional asset owners, and servicing for real estate and private equity fund managers. We are also investing in ETF servicing to capitalize on the trend of retail investors, increasing allocations to passive investment strategies.  We believe it is a trend that will likely increase post the implementation on the DOL fiduciary rule. We are also increasing investment in our Pershing Advisory Solutions platform for RIAs delivering an integrated bank and brokerage custody service, as well as private banking capabilities to RIAs, a segment which we also expect to grow more rapidly. Our next-generation ecosystem NEXEN is proving to be a value-added marketplace differentiator. NEXEN will make it easier for clients to access a broad range of solutions from BNY Mellon through a single gateway, delivering a better client experience and driving future growth. While our investment management\u2019s results were a bit soft in the quarter primarily due to our exposure to the fixed income markets and the strength of the US dollar, we are encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made on a number of fronts. In 2016, investment management continue to make progress against its strategic priority of repositioning its business, to focus on key products, performance and operational and technology efficiencies to deliver profitable revenue. We are concentrating on our high-value active strategies. Part of this effort involves increasing our alternative solutions to meet the demands from clients and flows remains positive in this growing asset class. The number of businesses are attracting new flows including Alcentra's success in expanding its private debt offering and Insights continued momentum in growing their absolute return capability. In each of our areas of focus, we\u2019ve established competitive advantages that position us to capitalize on industry trends. In some cases, we are already seeing a positive impact on our earnings from our focused investments. In terms of investment performance, on a peer-relative basis, and against benchmarks, we continue to deliver strong, medium, and long-term performance in our top strategies. Our effort to increase our exposure to individual investors is also paying off. Wealth management has sustained a multi-year trend of full year revenue and pre-tax earnings growth, the result of focusing on the high growth US markets, and on the ultra-high net worth segment. Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process.  During 2016, we further reduced our real estate portfolio eliminating 400,000 rentable square footage in the fourth quarter and 700,000 rentable square feet for the full year.  We drove down vendor expense and eliminated unnecessary demand and spending in areas such as market data and internal travel. We increased the deployment of robotics with more than 150 bots now in production. We reduced by 10 the number of locations where our client service delivery teams operate. We advanced our global location strategy which has improved our reliability and resiliency for reducing cost and risk.  We reduced manual corporate actions processes by 14 percentage points to 16 percent at a total volume in 2016, thus improving straight-through processing rates, quality and the client experience now reducing operational allowances. We closed several non-strategic low-performing businesses and we advanced our technology efforts on many fronts including substantially completing the move to one custody platform in the US and harnessing robotics and machine learning to reduce costs and free up staffs to focus on higher value activities.  And during the fourth quarter, we completed 100% of the client conversions of our new broker/dealer clearing platform. This new state-of-the-art government\u2019s clearing platform will enable us to serve the market well and grow responsibly. And we have a full pipeline of initiatives to drive continuous process improvement forward enabling us to offset regulatory change costs, invest in growth and delivering value to shareholders. We are encouraged by our progress and we continue to find opportunities for further improvement across all of our activities.  Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. During 2016, we invested in and focused on compliance, risk management and control functions, made significant investments in our resolution recovery plan, which included submitting an updated resolution plan that adequately address the deficiencies of the federal reserve and FDIC had previously identified in our 2015 submission.  We further rationalized our credit exposure to certain financial institutions and sovereigns, strengthened our risk identifications in operational risk control processes, delivered key new capabilities in cyber security and enhanced our capital adequacy process. Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and follow with a strong capital and liquidity position while returning value to our shareholders.  From a regulatory ratio standpoint, our supplemental leverage ratio now exceeds the fully phased in requirement. During the quarter, we repurchased $848 million in shares and we distributed $203 million in dividend. For the full year, we have repurchased approximately $2.4 billion in shares and distributed nearly $780 million in common dividends. And for the year, on a gross basis, we\u2019ve repurchased more than 5% of our shares outstanding and have repurchased more than 19% of our shares over the last five years. Our fifth priority is attracting, developing and retaining top talent. People are our ultimate competitive advantage. During 2016, we continued to strengthen our team by adding key leaders with valuable experience and outside perspectives while focusing on providing more growth opportunities for diverse talent within our company.  In December, we welcomed two new independent board members, Linda Cook, Managing Director of EIG Energy Partners and a Former Senior Executive of Royal Dutch Shell. And Jennifer Morgan who is President of SAP North America. Linda\u2019s distinguished international career as a senior executive in the energy industry and Jennifer\u2019s leadership in client experience in the technology sector will provide valuable insights to our global businesses.  Half of our directors have joined in the last three years evidence of our focus on bringing in outside perspectives to supplement the expertise of our existing Board Members. We have also made two significant leadership hires, Jeff McCarthy has joined us in the newly created role of CEO for Exchange Traded Funds.  Jeff came from NASDAQ where he was Head of Exchange Traded Product Listing and Trading. We are bullish on the ETF Administration business and think the DOL standards will only accelerate its growth. Jeff\u2019s experience strengthens our very capable management team that is highly focused on executing for our clients and accelerating our growth.  Geoff Massam has joined as Chief Administrative Officer for Client Technology Solutions, our technology group. Geoff has a long career in financial technology, having been a Chief Information Officer for Capital Markets at Deutsche Bank and CIO of Fixed Income IT at Merrill Lynch, as well as a tech industry start-up entrepreneur. So we see him playing a key role in advancing our digital strategy. So in summary, another strong quarter of financial performance as we continue to further develop our high-performance client-centric culture. By executing on our priorities, we are showing a pretty consistent ability to manage what we can control through all environments. Now this is a New Year. So once again we look forward to continuing to demonstrate our ability to deliver for our valued clients, and our shareholders.  With that, let me turn it over to Todd. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Gerald and good morning everybody. Our results demonstrate that we are continuing to execute our strategy and it\u2019s working. When you look at our results for the quarter there are few things that I think stand out. First of all, we experienced growth in all investment service business lines with fees up 4% in aggregate.  Secondly, NIR grew nicely, third, performance fees and investment management were little softer than expected and that\u2019s reflecting our conservative positioning into the US election and finally, we generated significant year-over-year positive operating leverage of approximately 350 basis points. As we noted in prior quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to impact results, it\u2019s negatively to revenue and it\u2019s positive for expenses. However the net impact from currency translation continues to be minimal to our consolidated pretax line.  Turning to the financial highlights document, and I\u2019ll continue my commentary on slide 4 which gives an overview of our non-GAAP for the operating results for the quarter. Our fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.77 that\u2019s 13% higher than the year ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our fourth quarter revenue was up 2%, expenses were down 2% and we generated 350 basis points of operating leverage. Income before taxes was up 9% year-over-year, also on a year-over-year basis, our adjusted pretax margin was up two percentage points to 32% and return on tangible common equity on an adjusted basis was nearly 21% for the quarter and that compares to 19% a year ago.  Moving ahead to Slide 11, I\u2019ll discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher money market fees, net new business from higher equity market values, that was partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar, as well as the downsizing of our UK retail transfer agency business.  Clearing services fees were up 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher money market fees. Issuer service fees were up 6% year-over-year, that\u2019s primarily reflecting higher fees in depository receipts and higher money market fees in corporate trust. The sequential decrease of 37% reflects the typical fourth quarter seasonality we experienced in some depository receipts.  Treasury services fees were up 2% year-over-year and sequentially and that\u2019s primarily due to higher payment volumes. That\u2019s a decent quarter for this business. As a reminder, as rates increase, some of our fee income shifts to net interest revenue.  Fourth quarter investment management performance fees were down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of the strong US dollar and that was principally driven by the weaker British pound, as well as lower performance fees and that was partially offset by higher market values and higher money market fees.  The sequential decrease primarily reflects asset outflows, lower fixed income market values and money market fees that were partially offset by higher performance fees. The lower than expected performance fees resulted mainly from the positioning of our portfolios prior to the US elections. We were underweight sectors that rallied post-election, which led us to narrowly miss the high watermarks. The good news is we are currently close to the high watermarks now and as a result, we are positioned well to generate future performance fees. Importantly, we were able to keep our margin relatively stable as we continue to execute our strategy focusing on investment performance, aligning our products and solutions, working to optimize our distribution infrastructure and centralizing our business functions to reduce costs. Now turning to foreign exchange and other revenue, FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was down 7% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. FX revenue of $175 million was up 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher volatility as well as higher sales and trading volumes.  Other trading losses of $14 million compared with revenue of $8 million in both year ago and prior quarters. Both decreases primarily reflect the impact of interest rate hedging activities and those \u2013 the impact of those substantially offset in our net interest income.  Financing-related fees of $50 million were down 2% versus the year ago quarter and 14% sequentially. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower underwriting fees. Distribution and servicing fees were $41 million that\u2019s flat year-over-year and it\u2019s down 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects higher money market fees, while partially offset by fees paid to introducing brokers.  Investment and other income of $70 million compared with $93 million in the year ago quarter and that\u2019s $92 million in the third quarter. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower other income related to termination fees that we received in our clearing business in the year ago quarter. This was partially offset by higher income from Corporate/bank-owned life insurance. The year-over-year and sequential decreases in other income also reflect the impact of increased investments in renewable energy. Those investments generate losses in the other revenue category as those losses are more than offset by benefits recorded on the tax line.  Slide 13 shows the drivers of our investment management business that have explained the underlying performance. Assets under management of $1.65 trillion was up 1% year-over-year, that\u2019s reflecting higher market values offset by the impact of the strong US dollar.  Overall, active outflows reversed the recent five quarter inflow trend than the quarter down $10 billion. This was driven in part by one significant LDI mandate that was taken in-house by the client. Long-term outflows of $11 billion included outflows and liability-driven investments as I just mentioned, equity and fixed income strategies partially offset by inflows into our actively managed alternative investments.  Outflows from index strategies were $1 billion, the lowest level in 2016 and we had $3 billion of short-term cash outflows. Excluding the loan loss provision, wealth management continued its multi-year trend of full year revenue and pre-tax earnings growth as we focused on high growth US markets.  Additionally, our program to extend banking solutions to wealth clients through the Pershing channel continued to drive strong loan growth, up 17%. Turning to our investment services metrics on Slide 14. Assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $29.9 trillion, that\u2019s up 3% year-over-year. That reflects higher market values offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. Linked quarter AUCA was down 2% and that\u2019s mainly driven by the dollar impact.  We estimate total new assets under custody and administration wins were $141 billion in the third quarter. Looking at the other key investment services metrics, you will see deposits declined 3% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, and that reflects the impact of us proactively managing our balance sheet in the second half of the year. Lastly, tri-party repo balances grew a healthy 7%.  Turning to net interest revenue on Slide 15, you will see that on a fully tax equivalent basis, NIR was up 9% versus the year ago quarter and 7% sequentially. The year-over-year NIR increase was largely driven by an increase in interest rates, partially offset by lower interest earning assets.  Additionally, both increases reflect the positive impact of interest rate hedging activities, which positively impacted the quarter by approximately $25 million, substantially all this impact is offsetting foreign exchange and other trading revenue. NIR also benefited by approximately $15 million due to an amortization adjustment related to premiums for certain mortgage-backed securities.  Effective October 1, we\u2019ve changed our accounting for the amortization of premiums on these mortgage-backed securities from the pre-payment method to the contractual method, which has become an industry standard and we believe is better aligned with our asset and liability management practices.  Net interest margin for the quarter was 117 basis points, that\u2019s 18 basis points better than the year ago quarter, and 11 better than the third quarter. The NIM was positively impacted by the five basis points related to the interest rate hedging activity and the premium amortization adjustment.  Turning to Slide 16, you will see the non-interest expense on an adjusted basis declined 2% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower staff expense and M&I litigation and restructuring charges that were partially offset by higher other and software and equipment expenses.  The decrease in staff expense year-over-year is primarily due to the favorable dollar, as well as lower employee benefits and severance expenses. The increase in other expense primarily reflects the adjustments to bank assessment charges that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.  The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower staff expense and M&I litigation and restructuring charges and that was partially offset by higher professional, legal and other purchased services that\u2019s driven by the CCAR resolution planning, as well as higher software and equipment and business development expenses. The decrease in staff expense was primarily due to lower incentives and lower severance expenses. As a reminder, we run the cost associated with our business improvement process through our operating P&L on a quarterly basis, this quarter was no different. We absorbed the cost of additional actions in the fourth quarter which should continue to benefit us going forward. Turning to page \u2013 to capture on Slide 17, the standardized ratios and those are the ones that are used for the CCAR exam were flat to up slightly and are fully phased in supplemental leverage ratio fell 10 basis points to 5.60 as reductions in capital due to the increased buybacks, valuation decreases in our securities portfolio and the impact of the foreign currency were partially offset by lower average assets. We also remain in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio.  Two other notes about the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 24.3% and on page 11 of the release, we show some investment securities portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our net unrealized pretax loss on our portfolio was $221 million, that compared to a gain of $1.4 billion at the end of Q3, which was a change primarily driven by the sharp increase in market interest rates.  Now let me share with you a few thoughts on themes that have been top of mind with investors, interest rates, industry regulation and taxes. As we look forward, we do expect some impact from the expected rise in interest rates. The net impact of which would be reduction in the size of our balance sheet, which should be more than offset by a higher NIM. These changes are expected to be modestly positive to NIR for the first quarter and that will be adjusting the fourth quarter for amortization and hedging gains. In terms of fee waivers, as we\u2019ve indicated in the past, we saw it was a 50 basis point increase in the fed fund rates, we would recover about 70% of our fee waivers and that\u2019s above what we\u2019ve actually seen. With an additional move from here, we would we would expect to capture nearly all of it.  Our regulatory compliance cost continue to be elevated reflecting the high cost associated with the CCAR process, as well as the investment in our resolution and planning process. With respect to our capital distribution plans, we are working through our CCAR cap model now assuming that we get regulatory approval, but we expect to continue our capital wealth management program consistent with our past dividend and common share repurchase goals with a total payout ratio that we would expect to be in the range of 90% to 100%. As a reminder, we will be paying for the first dividend for the $1 billion August preferred share issuance and it had a yield of $4.625, that\u2019s going to be paid in the first quarter. So it\u2019s important that you include that sub-payment in your models.  Regarding taxes, we expect our 2017 effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26% as we have previously disclosed. It\u2019s also important please note that tax advantage investments in renewable energy actually generate losses recorded in our investment and other income line, although they made up for the tax line.  Therefore, in 2017, we do not expect our investment and other income line to be as strong as it was in 2016, but it should be in the range of $60 million to $80 million each quarter as we have previously guided. There are a couple of more factors to include in the modeling of 2017. As a reminder, staff expense will be impacted by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense through retirement eligible employees that typically takes place in the first quarter. The impact that we expect in the first quarter of this year is similar to what we saw last year.  And finally, we expect to once again generate positive operating leverage in 2017. So, with that, let me turn it back to Gerald. Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Todd, and we can now open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hi, good morning. Gerald Hassell : Good morning. Thomas Gibson : Good morning, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. One quick one here on the tax advantaged investments and the headwind to the other, Todd, that you referenced. Which geography are those investments in? And what kind of duration are we talking about for those investments here? Thomas Gibson : So, Brennan, they show up in the asset investment and other income line and they can be longer-term investments up to ten years and so they are not \u2013 we are not quite fully invested, but we will be through the course of this year. So we would expect them to generate a negative revenue in the asset investment and other income and more than offset by the impact to \u2013 on the tax line. So they have an attractive return to us on an after-tax basis. But that\u2019s why we wanted to out on the call, my comments that it will be a little bit of a drag on asset investment and other income, but it\u2019s also the reason that we \u2013 part of the reason while we\u2019ve been able to accomplish a lower than expected effective tax rate. Brennan Hawken : Yes. I am sorry, by geography, I didn\u2019t mean P&L geography, if you meant like map of \u2013 this great geography, I guess, no which country. Thomas Gibson : Hopefully, where the wind blows, Brennan, but it\u2019s primarily in the United States. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Just, the only reason I ask that it\u2019s just because of the \u2013 can you help us understand about investing in something with the long duration right in front of some uncertainty around corporate tax fund? Thomas Gibson : Well, we would structure these things, if there was a relation to the tax, we\u2019d have protection on that. Brennan Hawken : Okay. All right, great. That\u2019s really helpful. And then, my follow-up on asset management and the outflows, with LDI, it\u2019s just sort of surprising to see continued outflow there with those strategies and interestingly, a rather large asset manager reported last week that they had strong indexed bond flows this quarter with liability-driven investing driving some of those tailwinds. So, is there some concern about maybe losing some share? Do you bump up against Blackrock in any bake-offs? How should we think about the market and how you guys are positioned there? Mitchell Evan Harris : Brennan, this is Mitchell. A couple things. The outflow, as Todd mentioned, it was really one client. If you could look underneath that the annualized revenues quarter-to-quarter continue to be positive. The pipeline is as strong as it\u2019s ever been and it did have $26 billion in inflows over the whole year. I don\u2019t see Blackrock coming up in a lot of bake-offs. Most of our biz that says you might know is not in the US on LDI. It\u2019s outside the US. It\u2019s UK, it\u2019s Europe, it\u2019s common law areas, Australia and alike. We are just starting to move into the US and I think we\u2019ll have some momentum there. So a lot of the momentum you are seeing is really non-US LDI business. I think it will continue to build in Europe as interest rates are moving up a little bit and I think with our move into the US, we probably will see Blackrock more in a bake-off spot. The strategies are quite different and I think we\u2019ll do very well. So, performance is good. The outlook for LDI is strong. I am as buoyant as I\u2019ve ever been about the LDI business and our ability to continue to compete with it. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Great. Hi, guys. Good morning. Thomas Gibson : Hi, Alex. Alex Blostein : First wanted \u2013 hi, so, first wanted to touch on NIR and just help us understand kind of the right jumping off point given the \u2013 there are couple of moving pieces here. So, as you look out, is a jumping off point kind of 806, so like including the gain from your NIM because it\u2019s more consistent or it is closer to 791, which obviously excludes kind of both gains is so just a clear up question there. And then just bigger picture, as you guys think about into 2017, given how the balance sheet is positioned today and what should we think about as a sensitivity from incremental increases and in rate and also the size of the balance sheet? Gerald Hassell : Sure Alex. Good morning, so, I think the \u2013 when you look at the fourth quarter NIR, I think the jumping off point is, I would tap it for the $40 million. So the $25 million of that or so was on the hedging activity. The hedging activity is just a geographic issue for us. So we had that \u2013 there was a offsetting \u2013 perfectly offsetting loss in the other trading income. So that has net impact to total earnings, but it does have an impact directly to NIR. And then the $15 million was an adjustment because of the change in the accounting methodology. So I think that is the right point. So, if you adjust for those two things, the NIM would have been more like 112 versus 117, still up a pretty healthy 6 or 7 basis points from where were in the third quarter. And that\u2019s had a tailwind of the benefit of higher rates as we have repriced a fair number of assets. And we do have deposit base acting about as we had expected. So we are adjusting a modest portion of our deposit base upward as well. As we look into next year, I mean, where interest rates are go is, anybody\u2019s guess, but we - and that\u2019s why the guidance I really gave was only for the first quarter. So knowing what we know, we would expect the balance sheet to come down a little bit, which it already has and we would expect NIM to more than offset the balance sheet move. So we would expect to continue to see some of the improvement that we saw in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Not a huge run up, but a little bit. Sorry about that, we had some noise over the phone. But, does that answer your question? Alex Blostein : No, that makes sense. And then just, hello? Gerald Hassell : We are still here. Alex Blostein : No, sorry. And then just, as far as just the level of exited deposits, I know the balance sheet shrunken quarter-over-quarter. So, I think last time we talked about $20 billion, $25 billion was still on the balance sheet shrunk. So is it still kind of in the $10 billion to $20 billion range right now? Gerald Hassell : Yes, that would be about where we are and so we are following it very carefully. We are not seeing any significant change, but it\u2019s probably declined slightly from year end. Alex Blostein : Got it. Great. Thanks so much. Gerald Hassell : Thanks Alex. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, thanks. Hello, thanks. Can you hear me okay? Gerald Hassell : Yes. Ken Usdin : Okay, great. Good morning. Hey guys, excellent job on the full year on the cost side and clearly with some help from the FX side. It\u2019s a busy morning. So I am sorry if I missed it in the release. But can you guys help us understand what the magnitude of input was from - to revenue growth, to fees and to expenses on the FX translation as we try to just think about how the core business is acting underneath? Gerald Hassell : Sure. The \u2013 for the quarter, this isn\u2019t for the full year, but for the quarter, we saw operating revenue growth of about 2%. I think the impact of currency and it was most significantly in our investment management business was about 200 basis points negatively. So, we would have seen operating revenue growth of about 4%. And on the expense side, it was also good for about 200 \u2013 little over 200 basis points. So we saw a negative, it would have been probably flat to slightly up on expenses and so we had recorded on an operating basis, 350 basis points or so of positive operating leverage. It probably would have been about 100 basis points less. So around 250. As we look at the full year, the numbers are not quite so impactful, so still about 2% on revenue, close to zero on expenses and our 280 basis points of positive operating leverage probably would have looked more like 220 to 225. Ken Usdin : Yes, so still a good result, and my second question is then just, as you put forward your - the rest of your plans and your execution on the cost side, how would you help to think about just expense outlook looking ahead given that benefit that was in the expense side to a modest extent, and also, I know you are driving for operating leverage, so with better revenues, I know you might not necessarily try to get expenses down again, but can you just help us think about what your just planning thoughts are around expenses? Gerald Hassell : Sure, and I\u2019ll probably start at a high level and hand it to Brian to go through some of the key things that we are working on. But we do \u2013 when I had indicated that we do expect positive operating leverage in the full year for 2017 once again, that does assume some modest revenue growth and when you look at down at the underlying expenses, comp expenses is our biggest driver. It\u2019s more than half of our total expense. We would expect that to be up slightly looking at the number of programs that we are working on. Our legal and professional expense probably will be up slightly reflecting the ongoing requirements around compliance. Basically, the rest of the expenses should be relatively flat, probably a little higher software amortization as we put together a number of \u2013 as we implement a number of the applications that we have invested in. But everything else looking pretty flat. Brian, do you want to get into some of the detail on the business improvement process maybe? Brian Thomas Shea : Yes, I would say that the business improvement process continues to yield the results we want, which is helping offset the global regulatory change cost enabling us to invest in long-term strategic growth areas and create operating margin improvement. So, a long list of accomplishments this year, but still a robust pipeline of activity, because we are driving this like a process, not a project. So we expect this to drive continuous value. Some of the areas to focus on in 2017 are continuing to work around the business portfolio, but also the product service solution portfolio and eliminating and reducing sub-scale or non-profitable activities, those things that don\u2019t hit our margin expectations. We continue to have a pipeline of client pricing initiatives that could align our interest with our clients in terms of driving efficiency and productivity end-to-end for both the client and for us. We have a number of initiatives to automate and drive straight through processing through traditional workflow and better technology and also through robotics process automation which was our first year, last year, but we are scaling that and getting more \u2013 we expect to get more benefits from that process over time. We are making progress on our technology strategy and exposing more APIs which not only make it easier for us to work with clients but they improve develop for productivity and we are sharing common technology services which also gives us a higher yield on our technology investment and we continue to do more around the global location strategy, the global real estate portfolio and reducing the number of locations we serve clients from all of which are shifting away at helping us drive continuous improvement in this area. Gerald Hassell : Ken, one other thing I would add to that, Ken, is, is we are making investments to improve our efficiencies and we are absorbing that in our runrate and I noted in this particular quarter we made some \u2013 we absorbed into this earnings some additional investments to position us well for next year. So the whole point Brian has made that we had a list of items that we can \u2013 we think we can still execute and we are absorbing the cost to executing those through our regular runrate. Ken Usdin : Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Mike Mayo : Hi, this is Mike Mayo. Gerald Hassell : Sorry, Mike. Go ahead. Mike Mayo : So, look, you are controlling what you can control with expenses and buybacks and it sounds like you have more of that, on the other hand revenue growth was flat for the year and I just want to know what about, you said modest revenue growth this year, but just a little bit more color, I\u2019d say in three areas; number one, the custody business has not seen much growth for you or for the industry, are you seeing an impact because you have more fixed income related assets than peer, it's been a tougher fixed income market from a valuation standpoint?  Number two, as it relates to investment services, are you seeing risk-on or risk-off, our thought was when there is more risk-on and higher risk custody assets would generate more fees and then number three, as it relates to investment management, you said that ETFs are in their infancy, you have outflows in actively managed funds, are you able to turn the tide there? Gerald Hassell : Mike, there is about a hundred questions in there. But I\u2019ll start and try to give an overview and then perhaps ask my colleagues to jump in here as well. I think you saw in the fourth quarter, every single one of our investment services businesses actually showed positive revenue growth. And that\u2019s even after taking in a consideration that about 30% or so of our asset servicing revenues are tied to fixed income market. So, 30%, 40%. So, we are still seeing growth in asset servicing and clearing services, treasury services issuer across the board. Would we all like to grow faster? Yes, and we are very focused as I said in my opening comments, about profitable revenue growth and really making sure we are constantly improving that client experience to give them a good reason to do more business with us. So, we think the pipelines in the investment services and asset servicing areas are strong and good and so we are encouraged by our growth rates there. The strength of the dollar also did have a dampening effect on our revenues overall both in investment services and in asset servicing and when you factor all those things in, I think it\u2019s above that 2% that you just cited. In investment management, we are repositioning some of the portfolio and strengthening some of the strategies. We are close to the high watermark which would have allowed for higher performance fees. Didn\u2019t occur in the fourth quarter but we are encouraged by our performance relative to our peers and relative to our benchmarks. And some of the strategies that we have invested in are gaining traction. So, clearly revenue growth is one of our key priorities and we would like to try to accelerate it. But it\u2019s 2016 was tough revenue environment. But we are encouraged by our performance in the fourth quarter. Mike Mayo : And your guidance for positive operating leverage in 2017, how many rate hikes are you assuming? Gerald Hassell : Right now, what we typically do Mike, is we look at the forward yield curve and we factor that into our plan and when we struck it on December 31, there were two rate - two assumed hikes in those numbers. So, one in June and one in September. Mike Mayo : Okay, and then lastly, the risk-on or risk-off, are you seeing animal spirits filter through into your business or is that still more hope? Gerald Hassell : Well, I think any time there is more optimism and more confidence in the market. There is more trading activity. More trading activity and higher levels of volatility help our business model. We are seeing early signs of it now. Thomas Gibbons : And Mike just to give a little more clarity around what asset servicing revenues look like, remember that we are exiting our UK TA business. So those are revenues that are declining and the dollar impact was quite substantial in this particular quarter. So if you actually adjust for the fact that we are exiting a business that was not profitable, and giving up the revenues on as part of what\u2019s helping our margin expansion and the dollar impact, asset servicing revenues would have been up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Gerald Hassell : Glenn, are you there? Glenn Schorr : Hello. Gerald Hassell : Hello, Glenn. Now we can hear you. Glenn Schorr : Sorry about that. Gerald Hassell : That\u2019s all right. Glenn Schorr : This might be oversimplified, but I am watching your asset yields go up every quarter as rates went up and you still have a slight negative rate on your interest-bearing deposits and that\u2019s an issue of geography, which is great for you guys. So I\u2019m curious, what exactly are you hedging when you are hedging and I am assuming the accounting for it is, just that\u2019s what the accounting rules are it would be nice if it was just inside the net interest income line and a clean hedge. But the question is what exactly are you hedging when you are hedging? Gerald Hassell : Okay, Mike, so there is something called \u2013 I mean, Glenn, sorry about that. Glenn, there is something called the overnight OIS which is an overnight rate when you secure interest rate swap. So what we do is, we would take our debt and we would swap it to floating to LIBOR. But that is not a perfectly hedged swap. So we actually need to hedge based on the overnight collateral rate effectively. That basis swaps where we are now adding another swap hedging the LIBOR rate into an overnight rate, that does not get hedge accounting treatment. So it gets mark-to-market through the trading account whereas the offset to that is in the net interest account. It\u2019s a perfect offset. So effectively, what we are doing is we are converting some of our debt into an overnight rate and then managing it accordingly. But the move from three month LIBOR to overnight does not get hedge accounting treatment and that\u2019s what\u2019s creating that, it\u2019s on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Glenn Schorr : No problem. This is not a new line item, but just piqued my curiosity this quarter. In the securities portfolio, you have like $16 billion of sovereign debt, 20% of it is BBB. What BBB sovereign debt paper are you sitting on in the securities portfolio? I appreciate that market value is over its cost, but it\u2019s just a curious question. Gerald Hassell : Yes, Glenn, I don\u2019t have that off the top of my head, but most of that \u2013 most of the sovereign debt that would be and there would be very high grade. So I\u2019ll have to take a look at that and get back to you. Glenn Schorr : Okay. No problem. Sorry for the phone troubles. Thanks. Gerald Hassell : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi, can you guys hear me? Gerald Hassell : Yes, we can hear you fine. Thanks. Brian Bedell : Great, great. Good morning. Just, maybe back on expenses, Todd, that was great color as you went through the lines. Maybe if you could just clarify a little bit you were talking about 75% of the cost base being sort of up slightly if you go through the buckets. Would - should we interpret that as maybe the total expense base on the plan being up, say 1% or 2% based on your sort of up slightly comment and then maybe if you can talk about your flexibility on that in different type of revenue environments, whether you are able to trim that obviously if revenue is more challenging and whether you would actually look to accelerate some spending on growth initiatives if revenue is more favorable? Thomas Gibbons : Yes, I think, I\u2019ll let you judge what I mean by up slightly, but I do mean positive operating leverage. And in terms of our ability to adjust, I think the fourth quarter was a reflection of that. So, based on the revenue mix, we can make some adjustments. But we can only do so much on the \u2013 in the short-term. The key is that we continue to progress with our sustainable cost reductions that Brian just laid out, we just need to keep executing on the opportunities that we see. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thanks, and then, maybe for Brian. Two initiatives that Gerald mentioned in his opening remarks, maybe if you can shed little bit more color and then the ETF servicing initiative obviously the trends are very positive for ETFs. What are you exactly doing there to grow that business and attract ETF issuers?  And then also on the RIA side of the business, encouraging, looking at some of the bigger competitors like Fidelity, Schwab and Ameritrade in terms of servicing RIAs. Do you expect - I guess what are you doing to try to compete more aggressively with those players? Or is that not quite the goal? Brian Thomas Shea : Sure, okay. So, ETFs first, really Gerald mentioned it. We are just trying to figure there until the shift from active to passive and we expect continued growth in the ETF space. We are a significant ETF service provider today and we have relationships, strategic relationships with many of the big financial institutions that are the growers in that space and so we are hopeful that we can extend those relationships and do servicing overtime. We are investing in the technology to make it more scalable and to deliver better client experience and we are obviously investing in the talent as well to make sure that we have really the top team and the top solution in the industry. So, that\u2019s really what we are doing in the ETF space and we have a serious effort on the relationship team side to cover those opportunities more assertively. On the pershing front or the RIA side, again, just like ETFs will be advantaged by the DOL fiduciary standard, we think the RIA business model will definitely be advantaged by the DOL fiduciary standard as well it\u2019s been a long-term secular trend shifting from brokerage to advisory model in the industry. Pershing Advisory Solutions has had double-digit revenue growth and as you see growth for the last few years, and we expect to continue to drive significant growth. We focus on larger sort of more professionally managed RIA firms, so groups of RIAs not individual practitioners. So we tend to have less new clients than the others that our clients tend to be bigger more substantial, more managed companies in the advisory space and so, we like the profile of the clients we serve. Our value proposition is I think getting stronger in that space. Gerald has mentioned the integration of bank broker\u2019s custody. That\u2019s really important. Many advisors want to have a bank custodian and we are really the only provider in the marketplace that can deliver integrated bank and brokerage custody experience. We also talked about the private banking services. RIAs compete with major financial institutions that have a banking capability or a private bank capability. We are doing, leveraging our partnership with the wealth management team is delivering private banking services to the customers of the RIAs we serve and that\u2019s actually been a usually successful process. We have now $4.5 billion in credit facilities outstanding \u2013 credit facilities in place with our broker/dealer and RIA clients and about $2.8 billion of those credit facilities have been drawn and used by the investors of RIAs initiatives and broker/dealers. So, we are investing in managed account solutions, digital advice solutions and other technology solutions to continue to grow our share in the RIA space. Brian Bedell : And the initiatives that you\u2019ve done in terms of consolidating that on to one platform, do you expect that to really improve the results coming into 1Q in Pershing given that you\u2019ve done this quarter? Brian Thomas Shea : Well, I think it\u2019s \u2013 unlike large broker/dealers when you convert large broker/dealers, you convert thousands of advisors at a time in the RIA space, it\u2019s - while we are doing larger firms, it\u2019s a slower process, but we have a strong pipeline of firms coming on and we spent most of 2016 getting the platform integrated and converting the existing clients we have between our bank custody and brokerage custody teams. But now, we are actually beginning to take on new clients on to the platform and we took our first new \u2013 absolutely, new client on in the fourth quarter, so I expect that momentum to continue throughout 2017 and beyond. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks very much for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Good morning. Gerald Hassell : Hi, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi. I had a quick question on the investment management. If you could clarify what you were saying about the positioning going into the US election? I got that you were positioned one way ahead of the election, but how does that change in positioning post-election? What does that mean for both AUM growth rates, as well as the fee rates, is that going to offset - and are you going to see a snap back in the fee rates as a result of this? It was more of a timing issue or could you just clarify that please? Mitchell Evan Harris : Hi, this is Mitchell. I think that, what we were saying is, short-term performance was negatively impacted by the US election as the equities rallied and sectors like financials took off. We were positioned in the first three quarters really more for slower growth which we significantly benefited by. We are not changing our overall position. We don\u2019t react to specific events, but we do see that overall performance is good. It was a one quarter related issue overall performance is actually still very strong. As just an example on a one year basis, six of our ten top strategies by revenues are still in the top two quartiles and even stronger on a three year basis. So performance on a long-term basis is strong. But some of our strategies were quote out as the change in market sentiment given the election. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to impact overall momentum given our one, three, and five year performance is actually very strong and I think we are positioned fine for the New Year. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then just a quick question following on the kind of branching out into the \u2013 more into the ETF space. I mean, does that give you - do you reconsider the multi-boutique model? And whether or not, I know you like the model, but I mean, is there additional efficiencies you think you could pull out of that model? Mitchell Evan Harris : There are always efficiencies that we are looking at from the model. Anything we could do at leverage and scale were continuing to push through anything we can do with the company more broadly, Brian's group on ops and tech where we are looking to do when we think there is more particularly on the ops and tech side. And there is always tweaks as the markets change where we can continue to leverage the organization and we\u2019ll continue to do so. Gerald Hassell : Broadly, asset management like other businesses, scale is going to matter and we do want to use the scale benefits of the entire company for the benefit of our asset management boutiques help lower their structural costs and still have them focus on their investment performance and their distribution strategies. So we think there is opportunities to apply scale benefits to our asset management boutiques and still keep it in the boutique structure. Mitchell Evan Harris : Brian has mentioned in the past that asset managers in general, be it a multi-boutique or any model need to focus more on their core competency which is asset management and other things that are not directly related to the investment process. We want to give to third-party providers. In our case, third-party provider is in-house and we will continue to do that. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. Gerald Hassell : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning guys. Gerald Hassell : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Recently, there was a story, Gerald, about the baby boom generation is going to be entering this year for the first time, the forced disbursements from defined contribution plans and that\u2019s obviously going to accelerate as more baby boomers hit this 70.5 year-old age. What are some of the challenges? Have you guys started to look at that? And how it might affect your business? And what are some of the challenges and opportunities that might present itself for both the custody side of the business, but also wealth \u2013 excuse me wealth management? Gerald Hassell : It\u2019s a great question. We look at it in a variety of different angles. One, starting with supporting the advisors on the Pershing platform, because they are in the midst of it on a direct basis every single day of the week, so, giving them the toolsets and utilizing our platforms and technology to help the advisors capture that wealth transfer is one of the most \u2013 one of the important elements. Our own wealth management area spends a lot of time thinking about this and making sure that multi-generational shift is one that they continue to service and service well. And on the asset management side, making sure we have strategies in place on third-party distribution platforms to help capture that as such shift inflows is also one of the areas of opportunity. So, it is a big shift. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we like our platform businesses and our wealth businesses as much as we do, because it is going to be a very significant transfer of wealth and assets into new hands and we have to be all over it. So we do think about it a lot. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And then, maybe a quick question for Todd. On the negative rates that you guys are still experiencing in the foreign deposits, how has that moved since the election? I know the negative rate went down by 1 basis point, but are you seeing any acceleration where it may turn positive later this year in that category of deposits? Thomas Gibbons : Yes, I mean, if you look at the total rate paid on deposits, on average it was slightly negative. About 15% to 20% of our deposit base is in non-dollar, a smaller percentage of that is in euro which is mostly what\u2019s driving that. So, in some instances, there is some pretty substantial negative rates. The US deposits are slightly positive and we do have deposit base and what that means is as interest rates go up, we will pass on some of the benefit of those rising rates to our clients. So the initial moves are probably a bit compressed and then our clients will start to get more of the benefits. So that\u2019s kind of how the betas work. So one would expect to see that crossover into a positive \u2013 a positive rate in the next quarter or two. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Appreciate it. Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Gerard. Great. Thank you very much and everyone thank you for dialing in this morning. And if you have additional questions, please give Valerie Haertel a call and we look forward to engaging with you and thanks for your participation today. Operator : If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference call webcast.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie Haertel : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome everyone to the BNY Mellon first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as members of our executive leadership team. Our first quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results, and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. You will note that we updated our assets under management reporting in our press release to improve transparency and to align our investment strategies with similar fee rates. I'd also like to take this opportunity to let you know that we will hold our Investor Day this year on Thursday, November 16 in New York City. We will provide further details as we move closer to the meeting but please mark the date on your calendars. We hope that you will be able to attend. Before Gerald and Todd discuss our results, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on the website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call today speak only as of today, April 20, 2017, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald? Gerald Hassell : Thanks, Valerie and thank you for joining us this morning. As you may have seen from our release, we again delivered double-digit earnings per share growth for the quarter. We earned $0.83 per share, up 14% year-over-year, which includes a $0.03 per share tax benefit related to new accounting guidance for stock awards. And looking at our results on an adjusted basis total revenue grew by 2%, driven by 4% growth in Investment Services fees and 4% growth in Investment Management and performance fees and 3% growth in net interest revenue. Total non-interest expense was up 1%, resulting in nearly 130 basis points of positive operating leverage. Our pretax operating margin increased to 33% and we are continuing to deliver high returns on tangible common equity this quarter achieving a very healthy return of 22%. And since we shared our three-year strategic plan with you on October of 2014, we have delivered nine straight quarters of solid performance against the EPS calls that we laid out for ourselves. The relative consistency of our results reflects how well our dynamic, well-diversified, low-risk business model is positioned to create increased value for clients and shareholders through all environments. So now let me update you on our progress against our strategic priorities during the quarter. Our top priority is enhancing the client experience and driving profitable revenue growth. In Investment Services, we've been investing in cutting-edge collateral optimization and management solutions that we delivered to both the buy-side and the sell-side. During the quarter, collateral balances continued to show robust growth, which speaks to the strong level of client uptake that we have experienced. Another area of investment has involved building best-in-class technology and middle-office services that enable asset managers to leverage our scale and expertise. Now you may recall that back at our Investor Day, we discussed the market opportunity to service alternatives, including real estate assets. Yesterday, we announced that PGIM Real Estate, the real estate business of Prudential Financial, one of the Top 10 real estate investment managers in the U.S. selected us to provide fund administrative services for $33 billion in U.S. real estate assets. And these assets are not included in our assets under custody and assets in our administration win for the first quarter, but they will be included in the second quarter. This mandate is a clear endorsement that our investment in the alternatives space are paying off. We were also recently selected by AIA Group, the largest independent publicly listed Pan-Asian Life Insurance Group to provide investment book of records software and to consolidate all of our Investment Management data on to a single platform. And we're seeing a demand for investment books of records solutions as global investment returns firms seek to replace legacy platforms to manage investment risk, improve decision-making, and ensure consistency in reporting. Our best-in-class Eagle data management platform is well positioned to meet that demand and given its flexibility and our ability and to scale to support growth. Now for the quarter, we had $109 billion in estimated new AUC assets under administration and business wins, which I'll remind you excludes the impact of the Prudential transaction. So we're off to a good start in 2017. And we remain encouraged by the strength of our new business pipeline. In Investment Management, we had a good quarter with revenue up 8% and pretax income, excluding intangibles, up 24%. Our adjusted pretax operating margins rose to 34% helped by increased revenues and various expense actions. Overall, asset management flows improved to their highest level in several years. Of note, our cash business - above [ph] the industry trend of outflows and in the quarter, we added $13 billion in assets inflows. Now looking at our investment performance over the longer term, we continue to see strong performance with two-thirds of our actively managed mutual fund assets ranked ahead of their peer median on a three and a five-year basis. Within the business, we are continuing to revitalize our investment product portfolio to meet evolving client demand. So for example, some of the greatest growth opportunities in active management lie in multi-asset class, alternative and specialist active equity strategies. As a result, we are working to increase our product offering in these areas. And we've also been investing to develop additional capabilities in credit, real return, equity income and liability-driven investment. Across all of our businesses, we continue to focus on enhancing the client experience, which we have no doubt will drive future revenue growth. We have a high tech and a high touch approach to servicing our clients, investing in the digital experience and adopting a common discipline and approach that further improves how we interact with our clients. Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process to create efficiency and quality benefits for our clients and reduce technology and operations and structural costs for ourselves. Now during the quarter, we continue to increase our use of robotic and cognitive technologies to drive efficiencies and productivity. We have increased the number of bots in production from about 150 bots at year-end to over 220 at the end of the first quarter. And this speaks to the success of our early efforts on this front. Those bots are automating certain task which is improving accuracy and decreasing processing time by as much as 50% to 80% depending upon the function. And we further downsized our real estate portfolio during the quarter exiting three locations for a reduction of 83,000 rentable square feet. Now in a year-over-year basis, we have exited 10 locations and 776,000 rentable square feet. And you can see the impact of these actions in our lower net occupancy costs. Now we also continue to align client pricing when increasing regulatory and service costs. For example, we imposed new fees to compensate for cost related to the investor tax reporting that we provide to European offshore funding counting clients. When we formalized our business improvement process a few years ago, many wanted to know how long it could continue to generate savings. We still have a solid pipeline of opportunities to expand automation, further rationalize our real estate footprint and reduce vendor cost, which will help us to further reduce costs and improve our operating margin. Now our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. During the quarter, we upgraded and streamlined risk reporting and making the enterprise much more resilient. And we continue to expand the global footprint of our risk and compliance organization to gain access to top qualitative and quantitative talent capabilities outside of the U.S. Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, including strong capital and liquidity positions while returning significant value to our shareholders. From a regulatory ratio standpoint, our fully phased-in SLR is now at 5.9%, which is a healthy buffer to the regulatory minimum, especially considering our low credit risk business model. During the quarter, we returned nearly $1.1 billion in value to our shareholders, repurchasing 879 million in shares and distributing $201 million in dividends. Our fifth priority is attracting, developing and retaining top talent. To win the competition for talent, we are investing in our people and our culture, creating workplaces that support a diverse flexible and adaptive workforce and holding everyone accountable for results. Our Workforce Excellence Program, which we are expanding in 2017 is transforming our workplaces into efficient and collaborative spaces that leverage the full capabilities of our technology. The program is strengthening the company's resiliency, making us more agile and reducing our operating costs. And we recently released our second Annual People Report, which illustrates how our people lead, innovate and collaborate to positively impact our company and our clients. It's posted on our website and I encourage you to go check it out. So in summary, we are continuing to execute on our strategic priorities, transform our company and increase the value we deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Our performance is only beginning to reflect the progress that we have made in digitizing our business and harnessing emerging technologies, which should result in an increasingly distinctive client experience and new sources of value for our clients. We see ourselves as being a great platform company that integrates the best of what we do and what others have to offer for the benefit of our clients and the marketplace. While it is still early, we are confident in our future as we continue to invest, innovate and transform into a more digital data-driven global financial services powerhouse. It's exciting to envision the potential opportunities for our clients and our shareholders. So with that, let me turn it over to Todd. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we performed well as our strategy is strengthening our franchise, benefiting our clients and improving our financial performance. When you look at the results for the year-over-year quarter, I think a few things stand out. First, we experienced solid revenue growth in Investment Services fees and Investment Management and performance fees, both were up 4%. Second, while our net interest revenue and our net interest margin benefited from the rate increases, both results were a little lighter than we anticipated due to the slightly smaller balance sheet. Now the dynamics of that I'll discuss later in a little more detail. I will also provide with you some additional color on how additional rate increases are expected to benefit both NIR and the NIM. And finally, we generated positive operating leverage and increased our operating margins from both higher revenue and continued expense control despite the significant pressures that we felt on regulatory costs. Turning to our financial highlights document, I'll continue my commentary starting on Slide 4 and that gives you an overview of our operating results for the quarter. Our first quarter EPS was $0.83, that's 12% higher than the year-ago quarter on an adjusted basis. Year-over-year looking at our performance on an adjusted basis, first quarter revenue was up 2%, expenses were up 1%, and we generated approximately 130 basis points of operating leverage. As we've noted in prior quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to impact our results, it's negative for revenues and positive for expenses. However, the net impact from currency translation was once again minimal to our consolidated pretax income. Income before income taxes was up 6%. Our adjusted pretax operating margin was up two percentage points to 33%. And return on tangible common equity on an adjusted basis was 22% for the quarter compared to about 21% in the year-ago quarter. Now moving ahead to Slide 8, I will discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue. Total Investment Services fees were up 4%. Asset servicing fees were up 2% year-over-year and they were flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects net new business and that includes the growth of our collateral optimization solutions, as well as higher equity values and it's partially offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar as well as the negative impact of downsizing of the U.K. retail transfer agency business. Year-over-year, the impact of these latter two items was approximately minus 2% to our revenue growth rate. Clearing services fees increased 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, primarily driven by higher money market and mutual fund fees. Issuer [ph] service fees were up 3% year-over-year reflecting higher depository receipt fees and that was partially offset by lower fees in Corporate Trust. Treasury services fees increased to 6% year-over-year reflecting higher payment volumes, partially offset by higher compensating balance credits provided to clients; and that reduced fee revenue, although it did increase net interest revenue a bit. First quarter Investment Management and performance fees increased 4% year-over-year; that's primarily acting higher market values and is partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar principally against the British pound, as well as the impact of last year's asset outflows. On a constant-currency basis, Investment Management and performance fees actually increased 8%. We've been focused on delivering profitable revenue growth within Investment Management through our business improvement process which reduces expenses and drives future growth. In line with our objectives, adjusted net operating margins improved to 34% for the quarter driven by higher revenues and expense improvement actions taken over the course over the last year. Turning to foreign exchange and other revenue; FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was 6% lower year-over-year and it was up 2% sequentially. FX revenue of $154 million was 10% lower year-over-year and 12% lower sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower market volatility. The migration to lower-margin products also impacted the year-over-year comparison but not so much the sequential comparison. Investment and other income of $77 million compared with $105 million in the year ago quarter and $70 million in the fourth quarter. Both comparisons primarily reflect the net gain related to an equity investment and decreases in other income from our increased investments and renewable energy. The year-over-year decrease also reflects lower lease-related gains. The sequential increase was partially offset by lower income from corporate bank-owned life insurance. Now Slide 9 shows the drivers of our Investment Management business that help explain our underlying performance. Assets under management of $1.73 trillion was up 5% year-over-year reflecting higher market values offset by the impact of the dollar, primarily versus the British pound. With regards to flows, with net inflows of $27 billion, we had the best quarter in years. While active equity strategies continue to experience outflows, the revenue impact was more than offset by inflows of $18 billion into other active strategies. This includes $14 billion into liability-driven investments and $2 billion into multi-asset and alternative investments as we maintain our focus on improving the revenue mix toward long-term high-value active solutions. With regard to short-term flows, as Gerald noted, we added $13 billion in cash and we did that by focusing both on the performance as well as increasing distribution through our liquidity portals. This was in contrast to the cash industry which experienced overall outflows. Now turning to our investment services metrics on Slide 10; assets under custody and administration at quarter end were a record $30.6 trillion, that's up 5% year-over-year and reflects higher market values offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger dollar. Linked-quarter, AUC/A was up 2%, mainly driven by improved market values and a slightly weaker dollar. We estimate total new assets under custody and our administration business wins were $109 billion in the first quarter. Looking at the other key Investment Services metrics, you'll see average deposits declined 8% year-over-year and 7% sequentially reflecting both the impact of the rate increase as well as our efforts to proactively manage our balance sheet to meet the liquidity and capital requirements. Lastly, tri-party repo balances grew a healthy 13%. Turning to net interest revenue on Slide 11; you'll see that on a fully tax-equivalent basis, NIR was up 3% to $804 million versus the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase in NIR primarily reflects higher rates and the impact of interest rate hedging activities and those actually negatively impacted the first quarter of '17 less than the first quarter of '16. And that was partially offset by lower average earning assets as well as higher average long-term debt. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the impact of interest rate hedging activities in the fourth quarter of 2016 premium amortization adjustment, which combined reduced net interest revenue by approximately $43 million sequentially, and that's about 6 basis points impact to the net interest margin. Substantially, all of the interest-rate hedging activities and for fourth quarter were offset in foreign exchange and other trading revenue. Now NIR benefited from higher rates, which was partially offset by a reduced balance sheet and we've discussed that previously how we intended to do that. As well as some adjustment to the asset and liability mix to build a cushion for the fully phased-in liquidity coverage ratio that went into effect in the first quarter. As we look forward to the second quarter and the full year, using the forward yield curve to estimate, we would expect to see NIR rise 2.4% in the second quarter - excuse me, 2% to 4% in the second quarter and 4% to 6% for the full year as the balance sheet stays flat or contract slightly. Turning to Slide 12, you'll see that our adjusted non-interest expense on a year-over-year and sequential basis increased 1%. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher consulting and staff expenses, partially offset by lower other expense. The increase in consulting expense primarily reflects higher regulatory and compliance cost related to resolution planning and CCAR. After we submit the resolution plan on July 1, the quarterly run rate for these expenses should come down by approximately $10 million. The increase in staff expense primarily reflects higher incentive expense that was partially offset by the favorable impact of a stronger dollar. As you will see, we added a separate line item for our bank assessment charges to provide additional transparencies [indiscernible] and are expected to remain a significant cost item. The sequential increase in non-interest expense primarily reflects higher staff expense and that was offset by lower business development, net occupancy, software and equipment, as well as professional, legal and other purchase services. The increase in staff expense reflects divesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees, partially offset by lower severance expense in the first quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the first quarter reflects the benefit of improved efficiencies as well as savings from our location strategy which is designed to optimize our footprint, as well as from our vendor renegotiations that continue to reduce our cost. Savings from efforts like these are enabling us to fund important growth initiatives, including NEXEN, as well as to absorb increased cost related to the regulatory requirements. Turning to capital on Slide 13; all of our fully phased-in ratios increased during the quarter. Our fully phased-in supplemental leverage ratio increased to 5.9% as we both generated capital and reduced average assets. One of the benefits of our decreased balance sheet as we now have a reasonably - reasonable buffer above the SLR minimum that will provide additional flexibility in managing our capital going forward. We also remain in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio. A few additional notes about the quarter; our effective tax rate of 22.3% was reduced by approximately 3% or $0.03 per common share from the application of the new accounting guidance related to the annual vesting of stock awards. This results in a benefit this quarter due to our stock appreciation above the awards original grant price. Now Page 9 of our press release, we show investment security portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our net unrealized pretax loss from the portfolio was $23 million, and that compares with $221 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. And that improvement was primarily driven by a reduction in market interest rates. Now let me share a few thoughts on our outlook on topics that have been top of mind with investors since the change in the new administration. We believe that many of the post crisis regulations have made us and the banking industry stronger, although some modest adjustments could be helpful to our business model it is really too early to predict outcomes. So at this point, we're maintaining our current regulatory compliance initiatives and the significant corresponding spend associated with them. However, during federal reserve governors departing speech, he suggested adjusting the enhanced SLR requirement for risk and that should provide some relief for the custody banks. Now let me provide you with some color on how we're thinking about the next quarter and the full year to assist you with our modeling. As we look forward in the event of future rate increases, we expect flat to modest contraction of our balance sheet which we also expect to be more than offset by a higher net interest margin. We expect net interest revenue to increase approximately 2% to 4% sequentially and approximately 4% to 6% for the full year. We also expect our net interest margin to expand to 100 - somewhere between 120 and 130 basis points by the end of the year, which should continue to expand in coming years as we reinvest maturing securities on our portfolio. Regarding fee waivers, we have recovered nearly all of the pretax income related to the interest rate sensitive fee waivers. We also expect our regulatory and compliance cost to continue to be elevated in the second quarter reflecting the increased expenses associated primarily with the resolution of recovery plan but with CCAR as well. As mentioned earlier, we expect these expenses to decrease over the second half of the year by approximately $10 million per quarter. Despite the increased regulatory cost, we expect our total expenses to remain close to flat to last year's level in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect our total adjusted expenses to be up no more than 1%. Regarding taxes, we expect our 2017 effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26% as we have previously guided. And finally, we expect to generate positive operating leverage once again in 2017. With that, let me hand it over to Gerald. Gerald Hassell : Before we open the line for our questions, let me offer a couple of more thoughts. As a reminder, this is our ninth consecutive quarter of solid performance against our EPS goals. I also want to remind you that we have a well-diversified, lower risk business model that is largely fee-based with recurring fees representing nearly 80% of our revenues. Now that positions us to consistently deliver solid quarterly results and higher risk-adjusted returns versus other financial institutions. And we're executing our strategic priorities to deliver even greater value for our clients and our shareholders. With that, operator, we can now open it up for some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks a lot guys, good morning. Todd, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the balance sheet and specifically your point about reinvesting cash flows off the securities book in terms of where the curve has moved to? And then just separately, how do we just think about given that you're not a traditional bank, how do we think about the deposit data and how you expect your balance sheet to act differently, if at all, from more of traditional to regional? Thomas Gibbons : Sure, Ken. Good morning. I think as we've guided in the past, we do see some sensitivities to interest rates to the balance sheet. In fact, it moved pretty much - the deposit base has moved pretty much along the lines that we had anticipated. So we saw in the quarter, on average, deposits down about $15 billion. That has - since actually gone up a little bit, but it feels like it should be fairly steady there. The betas themselves are pretty low; so if you - as you see from our disclosures in the quarter, our interest rate paid on deposits moved from a negative 1 to 3 basis points positive. So about 4 basis points with the 25 basis point move. Remember not all of this is dollar denominated but 75% of it is. So far that move, you could kind of look at the beta somewhere between the 20% and 25% range. We would expect those betas to creep up as interest rates continue to go up. So what we would expect to see is a little bit of contraction in the balance sheet and a little bit of expansion in the net interest margin, and that's why we think we can continue to see the growth that we're talking about in NIR. So not a whole lot further contraction in the balance sheet is what we currently expect. Kenneth Usdin : All right. And as my follow-up, I'll just ask the first part, just keep it that. Just again your reinvestments - you know, in terms of the long end has come in quite sharply. Are you able to find new securities to replace that roll-off still at higher levels? Just - can you talk through on front book, back book and just kind of reinvestment yields? Thomas Gibbons : Yes, that is obviously a little bit disappointing that the yield curve has remained so flat. It was not when you do modeling, you typically do it assuming a parallel curve. Although when we're doing our forecasting, we are forecasting and off of a forward rate curve. So the assumptions that we're making here is that the market will follow the forward rate curve and obviously, the forward rate curve for longer term rates has come down with the rally in the markets over the past months or so. So the answer to the question is we would expect off of that forward rate curve to see; first of all, a substantial amount of those securities portfolio are floating, so clearly they are going to reset with the LIBOR resets and the remainder is repricing a substantial amount as repricing each year. And we would - given those two factors, we would expect to grind the yield up in that securities portfolio overtime in the rate environment. Kenneth Usdin : Got it, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Thanks guys. Just the first question in the - around the servicing business. It definitely feels like the competitive dynamics have gotten a little tougher. JP Morgan announced that you've gone a little bit more aggressive in that business in the last couple of quarters. So maybe you could talk about your relative position in the space there today. I guess, how do you defend your position and perhaps the areas where you feel most - the biggest opportunity for yourself to grow, both from a revenue perspective but also from a profitability perspective? Brian Shea : So, this is Brian Shea, I'm happy to take that. We feel pretty good about the outlook for the investment services businesses. You're seeing the investment services fee revenue growth up 4%, which is actually improved over what has been a year-over-year more recently. And we think the asset servicing business which is going to benefit from secular trends which are putting pressure on asset managers to transform their operating models and to outsource more of their solutions. So that's why we see growth opportunities in the middle office space, we see growth opportunities from technology solutions; Eagle, that Gerald mentioned is a great example of that. And we see growth in the alternative space, the announcement of the PJM real estate outsourcing opportunity is a great example because most of the market is still in-sources their real estate to fund administration and this is a big growth opportunity for us. So we see - and we see growth opportunities in the EPS administration space and we're investing in all those areas; so we feel good about the long-term prospects in the asset servicing business. The Clearing business is also performing pretty well and we're benefiting from the fact that self-clearing firms are reconsidering whether they want to clear for themselves and pershing has a solid pipeline. As a result of that we're getting good growth in the RA custody business which is benefiting from the Department of Labor Fiduciary Standard. We're getting some mutual fund consolidation drive into the platform again driven by the DOL change where people are moving mutual funds to platform so they can put them under an advisory framework. And so we - and we still see some - and we're getting real leverage between pershing and the private bank. We have record levels now of both - credit facilities established between the wealth management bank and pershing clients and record levels of outstanding credit now over $3 billion in loans provided to those introducing broker-dealers and RIAs. The issue of service business is solid, we have solid share in the markets we're in. Obviously, we benefit from a higher - their issuance environment, Corporate Trust is in the first quarter, the year-over-year comparison is the issuance of global debt is down, something like 15%. But our share of the market is pretty steady, and we're positioned to grow as the issuance market picks up and we're getting good traction in the corporate and insurance space in particular. And of course, we're a leader in the broker-dealer clearing space, U.S. government securities and tri-party repo market; and we've invested heavily in resiliency resolvability, scalability of that business so that we can serve the market well and responsibly, and we expect that business - that will start to grow in the second half of this year and throughout the course of '18. So overall, there are competitive pressures but honestly, we're really focused on what the clients need in this market and what the clients solutions we can use to differentiate ourselves, so we feel pretty good about the prospects. Alexander Blostein : Thanks. And I guess a follow-up along similar lines which is on collateral management specifically. Gerald, you highlighted that in the release and your prepared remarks that that's been a pretty exciting area of growth for you guys. Is it possible at all to kind of break out what the revenue contribution is overall for the firm now from a collateral management and maybe just give us a sense on what the growth in that area has been? Gerald Hassell : Well, we break out a lot of detail already, Alex. Breaking out a particular individual line item is just too complicated. Considering it's both for the buy-side as well as the sell-side, it goes across asset servicing and our markets business, and so to segregate it and to call it out individually would be pretty tough. That being said, it is an increasingly and in demand set of solutions. And so it was initially around collateral management, and then it became segregation issues around the new regulatory environments down the world. Now we're shifting into collateral optimization and building the engines for that on a global basis. So we still feel very positive about its growth trajectory on a global basis for both the buy-side and the sell side. Alexander Blostein : Got it. All right, taking a try. All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello. A question on the whole SLR and Central Bank deposits, including the leverage ratio. Not asking you to speculate of what will happen; I think it should happen, it's happened in the U.K. My question is, if it were to happen, what would you do to the money [ph]? It's a decent size chunk of your balance sheet. How does that get reallocated? What kind of benefit could that be, if it happen? Thomas Gibbons : Glen, it's Todd. I'll take this. I think there are actually two; if any release comes on the SLR, I think there's two approaches to it. One is that they would change the denominator a bit just as you described, maybe they would exclude from that riskless securities such as treasuries or Central Bank deposits. The alternative is to adjust the enhanced SLR to the additional 200 basis points; similarly, the way they do to the G-SIB [ph] buffers that are required on the risk-weighted ratios. And that is what Governor Trilo [ph] recommended specifically in his departing speech. And we would assume that perhaps given where we are on a G-SIB [ph] buffer, relative to others, that might be about half. So that just kind of paints the picture for possible future rule changes. All that being said, we still have - I don't think you would see a dramatic change necessarily in how we have to manage capital because the CCAR would still be constrained by the leverage ratio, the traditional leverage ratio itself. So we would need to take that into consideration. It would make it easier for us to meet our spot ratios, we're one of the few institutions that tends to more constrained by spot but that's really no longer the case with where our capital is today. So now we're in a pretty good position. It would probably put us in a position to take on certain types of low-risk activities that we wouldn't have otherwise taken. I mean, it would increase the deposits activities, there are certain lending types of activities that might be a little more attractive to us than they would have been. So I think number one, it is a possibility that we could expand into certain activities and manage our capital a little bit tighter. The other potential outcome is if there is a reduction, for example, around treasures and Central Bank deposits; we would expect that to promote more activity in the repo markets in other markets that we serve, so that - that could potentially be a positive to the fee generation of the company. Gerald Hassell : Glenn, if I could just add - you know, on the supplemental leverage or enhanced supplemental leverage, it's actually very nice to see Governor Trilo [ph] in his final speech specifically call it out related to the custody banks. If we see some movement, I'm a little bit optimistic, we will. It will allow us to have a more flexibility with their balance sheet. As you know, over the course of the last year, we pushed deposits out which is counter-intuitive to what a bank is supposed to do. And so I think by some relaxation of that that will give us more flexibility on the balance sheet and whether it's repos or repo financing or accepting customer deposits and putting those deposits to work which can create more income and it could just give us more flexibility in the future. Glenn Schorr : I think I appreciate all those comments. But quickly follow-up on that regulatory theme is, you were kind of clear in terms of what we should expect, cost-wise. I just want to revisit, how come regulatory costs are higher right now, there is this overall feeling like they've plateaued and trending better in general, what specifically is taking up some of the dollars being used right now? Thomas Gibbons : So for us, Glenn, it's really the resolution plan. So we - as you know, we've got feedback on the resolution plan. Last year we responded to the deficiencies in October, we got positive feedback on the deficiencies but there were other options that we needed to deliver by July 1. We have a significant number of people, I mean, a very significant number of people focused on delivering this resolution plan; that comes with quite a few investments. We had said in the past that the investments associated with that probably had between the capital and other spend of over $140 million. We are in the highest burn rate point right now, up to the delivery of it on July 1. And then we would expect to see a little bit of relief thereafter. Of course, we'll then be waiting for feedback, and I'm sure we'll continue to evolve and improve the plan over the next few years. But I think we've made great progress and it has come in at a significant cost. Glenn Schorr : Got it. Thank you for your answers. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next line comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks very much. Maybe just Todd, if we could just go back to the net interest revenue, and if you could talk a little bit about the hedging activities in the first quarter and sort of the thought for coming into the next quarter. I think there was less of an offset in fees this quarter, if you could talk about that dynamic moving into the second quarter and whether you think that will push us through the year [ph]? Thomas Gibbons : Sure, Brian. So there are basically two types of hedging that goes on. So if you look at our long-term debt, most of that debt, we have to swapped to floating. And if the hedge on that from time to time based on interest rate movement but there will be a component of that that is deemed to be ineffective. That ineffectiveness is run through net interest income. Overtime, it will work itself out to zero but they are long-term hedges. So one quarter, it might be up a little bit; one quarter, it might be down. It was unusually positive in the fourth quarter of 2016. So when you look on our schedule on the earnings release on Page 7 and you look at the yield on long-term debt, that's where the noise is coming from. That long-term debt is basically just floating. But you might have noticed in the quarter that we saw - in the fourth quarter we saw a 136 yield down substantially from the third quarter. That was because of gains on that - from the ineffectiveness otherwise, it would have been about 163. Moving to the first quarter, you saw it pop up to 185, well, if you adjusted for the - if you take into consideration the impact, it would have been down about 6 basis points from that. So it's moving up as you would expect it to move up on average with the movement in LIBOR since that has been primarily swapped. So I think it's not a whole lot more complicated than that. There is one other element and so that doesn't impact other trading at all. We also hedge the spread between the overnight rate and LIBOR, and that does not get hedge accounting treatment on those swaps. So a gain or loss on those runs through directly through trading and that creates some noise as well. And again, that's just averages itself out; sometimes it's a positive, sometimes it's a negative. So the impact to this quarter has effectively overstated the fourth quarter NIM and overstated the fourth quarter's earnings by about $40 million and understated a little bit by this quarter, and that was ultimately had about a 6 basis point sequential negative impact to the NIM. So when we look out forward, we just assume that's going to average itself out, it's very difficult for us to predict, and that's why we do call it out. Brian Bedell : And so that averaging out is included in your 4% to 6% guidance for the... Thomas Gibbons : Yes, yes, it is. I'm not suggesting we've got a recovery from anything that we've done now. Just going forward, we assume it's zero. Brian Bedell : Okay. So locked in for 1Q and then zero for the next three quarters? Thomas Gibbons : Right. Brian Bedell : And then how many Fed hikes are you - additional Fed hikes after the March quarter you were including in the fourth\u2026 Thomas Gibbons : Yes, it looks - it depends on the day that you do the calculation but as we prepared for this we had two additional Fed hikes in that forward curve. Brian Bedell : Okay. And then just my follow-up would just be on the - I'll try maybe to talk a little bit more about the clearing business; it's been actually very strong considering the client run-off, maybe if you can just talk about the tempo this year and that if there is any more attrition from the clients that have departed. And then you mentioned a lot of elements of cross-selling within your own franchise and the benefits from the fiduciary rule coming through, is that going to create stronger tailwinds coming into the second half of this year so that rules here gets implemented? Brian Shea : Yes, good question, Brian. It's Brian Shea. I would say, this clearing business has been remarkably resilient and despite the fact that we've had some large client losses over the last year or two, mostly driven by global wealth firms exiting the U.S. marketplace which we're big Pershing clients. Despite that, the core underlying business has been performing pretty well and the metrics are starting to improve. We're seeing a pretty solid pipeline of large firms, including self-clearing firms, reconsidering whether or not they're going to outsource their clearing. Those tend to be choppy but we're encouraged by the trend and we think we have the right platform to help to be the solution to that. We're also - have invested in an integrated bank and brokerage custody platform that's very appealing to wealth management firms and to registered investment advisory custody firms. And our registered - our RIA custody business is experiencing double-digit growth and one of the things that's differentiating us is this private banking partnership with the wealth management group. So just to give you an idea, we're up to about $4.8 billion in credit facilities established and over $3 billion in loans outstanding; and that's the private Bank of BNY Mellon making loans available to the high net worth investors of our RIA custody clients and introducing broker-dealers clearing clients, so that's good. From a DOL perspective, it's driving more traditional brokers to the advisory model which is part of the resiliency of that advisory growth and - but we're also seeing now a trend toward mutual fund consolidation, meaning that assets are moving to brokerage platforms or to the Pershing platform as advisors want to actually include mutual funds into an asset allocation or advisory receipt relationship; so that's a positive trend for Pershing. So overall, we have a pretty good outlook and the revenue diversification of Pershing is pretty strong, so it's been resilient. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks for that color. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Good morning. I had a couple of follow-up questions; one on the SLR discussion that you had earlier, Todd. Just wondering, would you consider any changes to your press strategies in the event that there was an SLR change? Thomas Gibbons : Potentially. I mean, we've - as you know, we've issued quite a bit of preferred over the past couple of years and we've kind of changed our capital stack. So I think we're pretty comfortable with that capital. In fact, we probably have a little more space that we could go if we wanted to. So if the SLR demand - and it's largely to drive the Tier 1 capital which is the numerator for the SLR. So if SLR changes took place, we would have to rethink that; so I think the answer to that is yes, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : And is there any flexibility there? I'm just wondering if there's kind of a non-call provision that you're dealing with for a number of years or not? Thomas Gibbons : Yes, no, we're - there are some non-calls on those but we're quite comfortable with the capital and the cost of the capital. I mean, some of those seems to be below 5%; so it's certainly less costly than Tier 1. So my expectation is that we would keep it in place. It's just a question of how much future issuance that we would do. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. And on the regulatory expenses, you - I think you indicated that currently you're running at high watermark $140 million. I assume that's an annual number or is that a quarterly number? Thomas Gibbons : Yes, the $140 million guidance is something that we provided a while ago which is what we thought is the number of projects that we're going to require to invest and would ultimately cost us between capital and expense. The capital will obviously ultimately become an expense. We've not given additional information against that, but as we responded to last year's letter, we have increased the run rate spend, just the monthly run rate spend, on a number of different components of the resolution plan requirements. That is what we expect to see to wind down a little bit in the second half of this year. Betsy Graseck : In the second half, it's $10 million in 3Q and $10 million in 4Q for a total of $20 million decline. Is that\u2026 Thomas Gibbons : Yes, that's the guidance. Betsy Graseck : Right, I just want to make sure it was $20 million in total, not just $10 million. Okay. And then just last question, NEXEN take up, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and also what incremental your clients are asking for that you're focusing on delivering, incremental functionality perhaps that you might be working on? Gerald Hassell : Why don't I give you a couple of headline numbers, and then Brian you may want to give some color commentary on the natural initiatives with individual clients. But today, we have about 60,000 users on our NEXEN Gateway. 11 different businesses within the company are consuming it or putting applications up on it. We have about 17 different clients who are accessing our API store, we have about 140-or-so APIs in our store. There is about another 100 APIs that are queued up to go into the store. And so we're seeing a pretty significant take-up. And then the data that's coming out of our digital pulse has been captured and consumed mostly internally to improve our operations and find pockets of ways to automate and reduce our own structural cost. So generally, the take-up has been quite positive and the businesses are using it, and we're seeing real applications up and running on it. Brian Shea : Yes, I agree with that. And I would just say, in addition, let's see we're starting to build out the app store and actually, the first third-party vendor will be live in the App Store in the second quarter. We have a pipeline of five or six that have committed that we'll be putting on over the next couple of quarters. And then you know, there is an even more robust pipeline of firms in discussion with us as we sort of execute this vision of delivering the digital investment platform that our clients need to reduce their vendor management integration, discontinuity cost and help - and we're going to enable that through NEXEN. So again, every two weeks, we add more functionality, more capabilities and we're getting more traction with the clients and of course, as a result, the clients are starting to see more value, incrementally every two weeks. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And anything in particular people are asking you to do that you're putting on the to-do list or... Thomas Gibbons : I wouldn't say anything specific that would be - or shattering. Just continuing to deliver all the capabilities of the company through a single gateway and also enabling them through APIs to integrate with us the way they want to work. Those are the two big drivers. And frankly, longer term as we execute this more fully, we're going to be easier to do business with and to Gerald's earlier point about improving the client experience, it's going to improve the client technology experience significantly, and it's going to make it easier for them to do more business across the company. So not only - so we see this really creating long-term value for the company. Gerald Hassell : Yes, Betsy, the live situations with a number of clients tend to be around data aggregation and them being able to pull data out of the system in a much more easily consumed way versus us pushing mounts of reports that take days to produce. And we've been able to shorten that reporting cycle down to minutes and in some cases for different fund companies and hedge funds. So that's the initial set of applications. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. On backs of the SLR and the potential changes there. How much flexibility do you think you've got on the level of capital you run with, so that the numerator - part of the question, just given that that CET-1 is 10%; I think you talk about running with a minimum of 100 basis points buffer over the regulatory minimums of kind of 9.5%. I mean does that kind of limit the amount of flexibility you've got if we're just focusing on the numerator side, so the option is more around the denominator and how you can run the balance sheet differently? Thomas Gibbons : Sure, Geoffrey. It's Todd, I'll take this. So first of all, our minimum for the common equity Tier 1 is 8.5%, so we're at 150 basis points over that on a full - for the fully phased-in. So we feel like that feels like a pretty decent buffer, certainly it's adequate we would think for most of stress test at least as we've seen them in the past. I think the - in terms of the SLR, I think that had been the binding constraint in the past but now that it's up at 5.90% or close to 6%, and at 6.60% in the institutional bank where it needs to be at 6%, it too feels like it has a pretty good buffer to withstand two things that could potentially move that. You're not going to see a lot of noise, we wouldn't expect in the risk-weighted assets, so for the common equity Tier 1 ratio but what you could see under the SLR is an expansion of the balance sheet if there were big deposit flows. So we think that gives us an adequate buffer and for that, certainly in this new interest rate environment. And secondly, there are fluctuations and other compressive income that really comes out of the securities portfolio. So we've structured the securities portfolio in such a way that if less rate sensitivity than it had been in the past, and we think it could accommodate some fairly substantial increases in long-term rates which we'd actually kind of like to see at this level of a buffer, so we feel it's pretty well-balanced right now. Geoffrey Elliott : Thanks. And then on the CET-1 again, the advance ratio is a lot lower than the standardized ratio. Is there anything that you've heard recently that gives you confidence that the advance ratio could be relaxed a bit, may be operational risk ought to be calculation changing or something like that? Thomas Gibbons : Yes, there is what's become known as Basel IV has been batted about quite a bit. At this point, I would say, it's too hard to determine or it's impossible to determine whether there is ultimately going to be adapted. Within that, one of the considerations would be to change the treatment for operational risk, which we would encourage, I think would make some sense. That would probably provide some relief to BNY Mellon. And I think there are some other considerations that may very well offset that around market and other types of less other types. So we don't - A) We don't know whether it's going to be adapted; B) It's not the test that used in the CCAR, it's the standardized test which almost has to be very difficult to run if off the advanced approach and get consistency. So we don't know whether it will be adopted. We're not really sure ultimately what the impact would be to us. It's probably net positive on operational risk and slightly negative on the other items. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of follow-ups at this point. So helpful on the $10 million a quarter in consulting headwind here in the near-term. But taking a step back, and I think you guys up made some comments about it, previously, if we end up in a lesser burdensome compliance and regulatory environment, how should we think about how that might provide an additional lever for you to pull on the expense side? And then if we think about how may be Brexit might offset some of that, they need to invest, might offset some of that given how controlled you guys have been on the expense front for several years. Like when we put all that to mix over the next few years, assuming we have regulatory relief, how should we think about what could happen to operating expenses? Gerald Hassell : Well, let me take a high level stab at it and then Todd, you can weigh in some. I think the way we contemplated, to the extent that we have some sort of change in tone on the regulatory side that we can actually direct some more of our resources and frankly, some of the higher intellectual capital that company is can be consumed by regulatory requirements, if we can redirect it to new products and solutions and that is our goal as opposed to taking it dollar-for-dollar reduction in whatever expenses we may have from regulatory relief. We'd like to invest more in some of the businesses and some of the solutions. We like to invest more in further automating the company which will drive better operating efficiencies for the long-term. And so we would like to see some of it continue to go to shareholders, but a lot of it reinvested in the company for future growth and for future improvements in our strategy and technology and automation. Thomas Gibbons : And I would add just a couple of things here. If you think about the U.S. regime, there has been an awful lot of new rule-making that's gone on and actually the implementation cost to comply with that. And I probably said once or twice before that we think that the run rate has probably peaked and I was wrong. But if you think about things like CCAR, even the advanced approaches to calculating the risk-weighted assets, CCAR is continuously developed. The resolution plan, which comes with some new requirements for example, around liquidity and capital management, the liquidity coverage ratio and the - which is a demanding regulatory reporting exercise since we're providing significant amounts of daily information. So we're getting all of that implementation in place and there will certainly be, I'm sure, no matter what the change in the regime, ongoing requirements to improve that. But we'd like to think that we don't see a lot of new rule-making out there because I think we're getting all the way through really the Dodd-Frank requirements. So in the U.S, there probably would be some relief regardless of what comes from - what the regime actually does. I think globally, one of the things that we broke out on our reports, expense report is bank assessment charges. And so the FDIC charges have gone up substantially as have what we see both on the European Resolution Fund, as well as just bank levies in certain parts of Europe. There is the potential for some relief on that but probably even that's a year away. And the other thing I might add, why we want to still be cautious here is that in Europe as we implement method and other additional regulations, the compliance cost there are quite high as well; so we're going to get - I think, some short-term relief; whether that actually rolls into long-term relief or not, it's too early to call. Brennan Hawken : That's all really, really fair and very helpful, thanks. And certainly Todd, I think you've got some company in trying to call a top on the regulatory burden and worse. Can you - one follow-up on the SLR buffer, I think you guys said that you would expect it to have from 200 bps to 100. When I had looked at, I guess, maybe I compared it to the enhanced buffer that it come up with and I thought maybe it might even be a bit lower for you. What makes you think that it would only be halves for you rather than maybe even a potentially better outcome? Gerald Hassell : That's highly speculative on my part. I'm just seeing it - if you were to correlate. You might be right, Brennan, if you were to correlate the 200 to the buffer - in the G-SIB [ph] buffer and you use the same regime to calculate it, something like half I think would be a reasonable estimate. But you're right, it could be a little bit more than that. Brennan Hawken : Fair enough, great. Okay, thanks. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Gerald; good morning, Todd. A question Todd, and I know there has been a lot of talk about the balance sheet and I think you gave us guidance in your prepared remarks about basically a flattish balance sheet from here until the end of the year. If you guys look longer out from your customer's standpoint, and we get into a 3% Fed funds rate environment let's say going into 2019, are there still lazy deposits, if you will, sitting on your balance sheet that would move into higher-yielding alternatives? Or do you see with your current customer base that the deposits they have are truly what they're probably going to keep with you even in a higher rising interest rate environment? Thomas Gibbons : Okay. So I'd like not to call them lazy because this is - a lot of this is related to activity that goes on, Corporate Trust activity, Asset Servicing activity, settlements, and so forth. And we do think the betas will increase, so there'll be - and in many instances, we actually have contractual rates that we apply to client deposits. So I think the way to look out at the future is there'll be - just as we saw the spike up in deposits with the Fed easing, I think we'll see that kind of market share gain, if you will, to total deposits come out which it practically has. And then we will start - the business will grow, the deposit size of the business will grow with activity as it has historically. That's our expectation. Gerard Cassidy : Yes, no, that's good. And then I know this is a hypothetical and maybe will never come through. The industry, including you guys, have suffered from the LCR ratio being as high as it is. If there wasn't that requirement to have the LCR ratio as high as it is, what do you think a more reasonable LCR ratio should be for you guys, or are you comfortable with what it is now? Thomas Gibbons : Well, and I'll be happy to comment on that one. And the LCR may very well get some conversation. But I think there's another thing that you should be aware off. In the resolution plan, there's something called the R-Lap which is the liquidity that you need in place in order to go in and manage a resolution plan. That's going to be - it's pretty highly correlated to the LCR, so it could be another - it's another constraint to that. I think that you should be aware off, and we're working through that as we deliver it to the regulators this summer. That being said, the LCR is a constraint. It does limit the types of things that you could do. There is no question that it has an impact on lending. And if you took into consideration that there are probably substantial amount of liquid assets on the balance sheet that don't fall into the denominator, it's probably more constraining than it really need to be. I think conceptually, it's a very good tool. It's how - it's an approach to managing liquidity that makes a heck of a lot of sense. I think perhaps it could be tweaked a little bit; if it were, it would give more - it's another one of these things that will provide more flexibility, probably generate a little bit more NIR. Gerard Cassidy : I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Gerald Hassell : Thank you very much, everyone, for dialing in today and your interest in us. And I'm sure you'll have some follow-up questions with Valerie and the rest of our IR team. So thank you, everyone. Operator : If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call and webcast.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie Haertel : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome everyone to the BNY Mellon second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman; Charlie Scharf, our CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO and members of our executive leadership team. Our second quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results, and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Gerald and Todd discuss our results, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on the website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call today speak only as of today, July 20, 2017, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald? Gerald Hassell : Thank you, Valerie and thanks everyone for joining us to discuss our second quarter performance. As Valerie mentioned, Charlie is here with us today along with Todd and members of our leadership team. Now, I'll be taking you through the highlights for the quarter for one final time and then invite Charlie to make some remarks after we've given you some color for the quarter. Next quarter, you'll be in Charlie's very capable hands. Now turning to our release, as you may have seen, we again delivered double digit EPS growth for the quarter. Hence we achieved healthy revenue growth in both our Investment Management and Investment Services businesses. And we benefited from a more favorable rate environment. We earned $0.88 per share up 17% year-over-year. Total revenue grew 5%, driven by 6% growth in Investment Management and performance fees, 4% growth in Investment Services fees and 8% growth in net interest revenue. Total noninterest expense was up 1% and we generated more than 340 basis points of positive operating leverage. Our pretax margin increased to 33% and 35% on an adjusted basis. And we're continuing to deliver high returns on tangible common equity, this quarter achieving a strong adjusted return of 22%. So this is now our tenth straight quarter of solid performance against the EPS goals we shared at October 2014 Investor Day, reinforcing how well our diversified lower risk business model is positioned to deliver consistent results in all our market environments. So now let me update you on some progress against our strategic priorities. As you know our top priority is driving profitable revenue growth. Investment Services revenue reflected nice growth across virtually all business lines. Notable items include, strong performance in our clearing business, net new business including collateral management solutions and of course higher equity market values. For the quarter, we had 152 billion and estimated new AUC/A business win and that includes the 33 billion prudential fund administration win that we disclosed in early April. And we continue to remain encouraged by the strength of our new business pipeline. We're benefitting from investments in cutting edge collateral management and US government securities clearance capabilities and market leading technology to meet client and market demand in these areas. Tri-party balances grew, reinforcing our multi quarter growth trend and reflecting a high level of client update. And this year we've on boarded a number of new repo and collateral management clients and the demand for our solutions remains high. Now, while the initial revenue impact is relatively small, we would expect these programs to build overtime. Now, we've also began on boarding clients affected by JP Morgan's decision to exit the US government securities Clearance business. The revenue impact in 2017 will be modest as many of the largest revenue producing relationships will not be coming on board until 2018. We expect to see the full revenue impact in 2019. Now, our other clearing business remains strong as well, benefiting from the restoration of money market fee waivers and another quarter of strong growth in the mutual fund balances. The mutual fund consolidations driven by the DOL fiduciary standard rule is contributing to increase clearing activity. We had 11% increase in the long-term mutual fund assets and solid growth in our subaccounting services and asset servicing. During the quarter we became one of the first banks to go live as an intermediary for US dollar payments with the first phase of the SWIFT global payments innovation or GPI. And that's a service that improves the speed and predictability of cross boarder business-to-business payments. BNY Mellon clients will benefit from quicker and faster use of funds, greater transparency of fees and payments tracking. And turning to Investment Management, it also had a strong quarter with revenue up 5% year-over-year and pretax income excluding intangibles up 20%. Pretax operating margins rose to 34%, up 4% year-over-year have been the benefits from the increased revenue and the margin expansion efforts that we've taken over the last year to focus on strengthening our core business performance. We achieved a record high of assets under management of $1.77 trillion. Now, that's supported by $14 billion in increased flows with long-term active flows of $16 billion, which includes LDI and flows from our cash business of $11 billion and that was partially offset by index outflows of $13 billion. In terms of investment performance against a backdrop of relatively strong quarter for global markets, our long-term active strategies performed well with 72% and 84% of the assets above their three and five-year benchmarks respectively. Our investments in other initiatives are continuing to gain traction as well. So, for example, we're seeing strong interest in our newest boutique and capital [ph] where we've been strengthening our alternatives offering that is part of our public and private real estate investment strategies. Our wealth management business also had a strong quarter delivering record levels of revenue to pretax income as a result of positive flows and higher net new business. The organic investment in expanding our wealth management sales teams has now turned profitable. Now, in summary, the diversity of our investment management business mix combined with a strategy of meeting the growing client demand for high value active solutions and ongoing expense control continued to drive improved financial performance in this sector. Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process to create efficiency and quality benefits for our clients and reduce technology operations and structural costs for us. But during the quarter we expanded our cognitive technology functionality to deploy optical intelligent character recognition to processing functions. We believe our use of cognitive technologies is leading edge. During the quarter we were recognized at the Blue Prism World Awards for best use of robotics process automation to deliver overall business value. During the quarter, we also signed additional client to our collateralized optimization technology application. It helps our broker-dealer services clients achieve the optimal use of their assets and maximize capital efficiencies. It's one example of how our business improvement process is contributing to revenue growth. Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. The results of the 2017 CCAR stress test demonstrate the high quality of our balance sheet. Of the US T cent [ph] we had the lowest drawdown of our CET1 ratios to the supervisory severely adverse scenario. The stress scenario, we benefit from our fee-based recurring revenue stream, which delivers consistent earnings and strong capital generation. In addition, we have a very high quality credit and investment portfolio and a low risk business model. But from a regulatory ratio standpoint, our fully phased in SLR is now 6%. We established a separate legal entity for our operational aspects of our U.S. Government Security Clearance and U.S Tri-Party Repo business to make us more resilient, transparent, and resolvable. We also simplified our legal entity structure in Europe and across the globe, eliminating a number of entities and all of the regulatory requirements that go with them. Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. And you saw that during the quarter we returned more than $700 million in value to shift to our shareholders, repurchasing $506 million in shares and distributing $199 million in dividends. As we announced last month, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2017 capital plan as part of CCAR. Our board has approved the repurchase of up to $3.1 billion of common stock including the repurchase of $500 million of common stock contingent on a preferred stock issuance. Now, this is over the next four quarters. I'm pleased that we've been able to increase our quarterly dividend by approximately 26% beginning in the third quarter of this year. Now our fifth priority is attracting, developing, and retaining top talent. The executive appointments we have made during the quarter demonstrate our ongoing focus on tapping into great talent and fresh perspectives in the marketplace, while also providing growth opportunities for our top contributors from within our ranks. Now, you know all about Charlie and the strong leadership experience he brings to our team. We spoke to many of you about that on Monday. And if you heard, I'm thrilled with his selection and he is absolutely the right person to lead the company into the next phase of growth. In addition, last month we welcomed Bridget Engle, a proven high impact IT executive with more than 30 years of experience spanning AT&T, Lehman Brothers, Barclays, and most recently Bank of America. She is focused on advancing our technology strategy. We promoted Michelle Neal, the CEO of our markets business to our executive committee, which speaks to our confidence in her ability to evolve and grow our markets business and to leverage the broad expanse of our trading, financing, and liquidity capabilities across our entire client base. Frank La Salla was named CEO of corporate trust after a highly successful run leading our alternative investment services business. Now, Frank is working to further build out our corporate trust platform and sales and leadership team to deliver superior solutions for clients and extend our position in this important business. Chandresh Iyer succeeded Frank as CEO of Alternative Investment Services. Chandresh who helped drive significant improvement to our asset manager, asset owner, and hedge fund middle office solutions business will continue to build the company's real estate administration and EPS services by extending middle office solutions to our hedge fund administration clients. Joining Chandresh' team is Peter Salvage, our new Global Head of Hedge Fund Services. Peter is a veteran leader of the hedge fund middle office back-office services, innovation and technology space. Peter and his team are focused on expanding our client base of hedge, credits and hybrid private equity funds. And finally we named Rohan Singh, Asia Pacific Head of Assets Servicing. He has nearly three decades of leadership in client phasing experience in the business. His hire demonstrates our continued investment in delivering our full capabilities in APAC. So, as you can see, we continue to develop, promote, and invest in the best talent in the world. So, in summary, we delivered strong EPS growth, nice revenue growth and significant positive operating leverage. We and our clients are just beginning to capitalize on the benefits of our strategy and our investments and growth. We have a proven ability to execute and we have distinctive capabilities in areas of growing demand where we can help alleviate environmental and regulatory pressures on our clients and make it easier for them to access the insights and information they need to succeed. And we believe our early commitment to an open source digital platform sets us up nicely to continue to differentiate ourselves in the global marketplace. With that, let me turn it over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Gerald and good morning everyone. It was a good quarter as we continue to execute our strategy and build a foundation for future growth. When you look at the results for the earlier quarter, a few things stand out. First, we experienced solid revenue growth in both segments with investment management and performance fees of 6% and investment services fees of 4%. Second, we grew total revenue by 5% and that's at a time when FX is under a bit of pressure due to low volatility and I think that demonstrates our well diversified lower risk model is positioned to create increased value through the most environments that we face. Third, our net interest revenue and our net interest margin benefited from the rate increases. And finally expenses were a little higher. Yet we still generated excellent positive operating leverage and increased our operating margins. Now, if you turn to our financial highlights document. I'll continue my commentary starting on Slide 5, which gives an overview of our results for the quarter. Our second quarter EPS was $0.88 at 17% higher than a year ago. And if you look at the underlying performance on a year-over-year basis, the second quarter fee revenue was up 5%. Expenses were up 1% and we generated more than 340 basis points of positive operating leverage. Our adjusted pretax operating margin was up 2 percentage points to 35%. Net interest revenue also increased a strong 8% and that was driven by higher interest rates. As we've noted in prior quarters, the strength of the U.S. dollar continues to impact the results negatively for revenue and positively for expense. On a consolidated basis, however, the net impact from currency translation was essentially neutral once again. Income before taxes was up 12% and our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 22% for the quarter and that compares to 20% in the year ago quarter. Moving ahead to Slide 7, I'll discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue primarily on a year-over-year basis. Total investment services fees were up 4%. Asset servicing was up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Both increases reflect net new business including the continued growth of our collateral management solutions and businesses, as well as higher equity market values. The year-over-year increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger dollar and the impact of downsizing the retail U.K. transfer agency business. Clearing services fees increased 13% year-over-year and they were up 5% sequentially. They were driven primarily by higher money market fees, as well as growth in our long-term mutual fund assets on the platform. Issuer service fees were up 3% year-over-year and that reflects higher depository receipt fees. On a sequential basis, issuer service fees were down 4% and that's primarily due to seasonality in depositary receipt revenue. Treasury services fees increased 1% year-over-year and sequentially and that reflects higher payment volumes, while that's partially offset by higher compensating balance credits. If you adjust for the compensating balance credits, treasury service fee revenue would have been an additional 4% higher. Investment management and performance fees increased 6% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. That reflects higher market values, money market fees, and performance fees. The year-over-year increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and that's principally driven by the British pound. On a constant-currency basis, investment management and performance fees increased 9% year-over-year. Investment management's focused approach delivering profitable revenue growth that centers on expanding our product offering to meet the evolving client demand and high value active strategies coupled with ongoing improvements to business processes, as well as increased efficiencies. As a result of the actions that we've taken over the last year, the adjusted pretax operating margin for the quarter increased 397 basis points to 34% year-over-year. Foreign exchange and other trading revenue on a consolidated base was down 9% year-over-year and it was up1% sequentially. FX revenue of $151 million was 9% lower and 2% lower sequentially reflecting the lower volatility that we saw in both periods. The year-over-year decrease was partially offset by increases in volumes. Investment and other income of $122 million compared with $74 million in the year ago quarter and $77 million in the prior quarter, both of those comparisons primarily lease-related gains in the second quarter. Slide 8 shows the driver of our investment management business and I think it will help explain some of the underlying performance. We achieved record asset under management of 1.77 trillion that's up 6% year-over-year that benefited from higher market values, net inflows that will offset a little bit by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar once again against the British pound for the most part. Long-term active flows were $16 billion that was driven by the second consecutive quarter of positive LDI inflows with $15 billion in Q2 and continue momentum in fixed income flows where we saw $2 billion of inflows. While we experienced outflows of $2 billion in active equities, outflows this quarter were among the lowest we've seen over the past few years. We had index outflows of $13 billion. Those were primarily due to portfolio rebalancing from several large international clients and similar to last quarter and in contrast to the industry trend, we experienced cash inflows of 11 billion and that's benefiting from our strong performance from core money market funds. Off note client assets and wealth management reached record levels this quarter that's up 10% year-on-year. And turning to our investment services metrics on Slide 9, we achieved record assets under custody and/or administration of $31.1 trillion, up 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, mostly driven by higher market values. We estimate total new assets under custody and/or administration business wins were $152 billion in the second quarter, once again a pretty good result. Looking at the other key investment metrics, you'll see average deposits declined 10% year-over-year that reflects the impact of the rate increase, as well as our efforts to proactively manage our balance sheet to meet the current liquidity and capital requirements. Given the strength that we've been seeing in our capital ratios, we were able to accommodate some additional client deposit for this quarter and our average deposit balance has actually increased 1% sequentially and that contributes a little to our net interest income. Tri-party balances grew a strong 19% year-over-year and they were up 5% sequentially and volume increased with the additional businesses we are on boarding. Turning to net interest revenue that's on Slide 10, you will see that on a fully taxable equivalent bases, NIR was at $838 million that's up 7% versus the year ago quarter and 4% sequentially. Both increases primarily reflect the benefit of higher interest rates. Year-over-year increase also reflects lower premium amortization that's partially offset by lower interest earning assets and higher average long-term debt. The sequential increase also reflects an additional interest earning day, as well as a modest increase in interest earning assets. Turning to Slide 11 you will see that adjusted non-interest expense increased 1% year-over-year and was up slightly sequentially. Expenses were a little higher in the second quarter than we had guided in our first quarter earnings call. About half of that increase was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. Although it's up on a year-over-year basis, it was actually weaker in the quarter. The other half was due to higher incentive expense and that was both due to performance of the businesses, as well as the impact of a higher share price and the mark-to-market impact on the variable compensation component of incentives. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher professional, legal, and other purchase services that were partially offset by the stronger U.S. dollar, as well as lower net occupancy expense. The increase in professional, legal, and other purchase services is primarily related to regulatory and compliance cost, especially the 2017 resolution plan. Earlier this month we delivered that plan, which we believe makes us more resilient and resolvable. We incurred significant cost due to the construction of the plan itself, which has made us more resolvable and we continue to expect some of these expenses to be phased out over the coming quarters. Net occupancy expense decreased as we continue to benefit from the savings we generated from the execution of the business improvement process and sequentially lower staff expense was offset by higher other business development and software and equipment expenses. The decrease in staff expense was driven by the impact of investing of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees that we recorded in the first quarter as we've done in previous years. Turning to capital on Slide 12, our fully phased-in supplemental leverage ratio increased to 6% and that makes the upcoming 2018 regulatory requirements, plus it has what we now believe is a very reasonable buffer. We also remain in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio. A few additional notes about the quarter, our effective cash rate of 25.4% is in line with guidance. On Page 9 of our press release, we show investment securities portfolio highlights. At quarter end our net unrealized pretax gain on our portfolio was $151 million that compared with a pretax loss of $23 million in the last quarter with the improvement primarily driven by the decrease in market interest rates for the period, in summary a strong quarter performance as we continue to execute well against our three-year goals. Now, let me provide you with some color on how we are thinking about the next quarter and the full year to assist you with your modeling. Third quarter earnings are typically impacted by a seasonal slowdown in transaction volumes and market-related revenue, particularly things like foreign exchange, collateral services, and securities lending. That all is often offset by the seasonally higher activity that we see in depositary receipts. However, for this coming quarter we would expect the seasonal bump in the yards to be about half of what it was last year and that's around $50 million, reflecting a somewhat less favorable market environment. During our first quarter call, we indicated that our net interest revenue should be up in the range of 2% to 4% for the second quarter. As you can see, we came in at the high end of that range. We had also indicated at that time that we expected to be in the 4% to 6% range for the full year. NIR would be up in that range. Given the performance that we've seen in the second quarter, as well as our outlook now for NIR, it has improved and we think we should be at the high end of that 4% to 6% range. Another item back in January, I told you that investment in other income should be in the range of $60 million to $80 million each quarter. In this quarter it was elevated quite a bit because of the lease-related gains that I mentioned earlier. As you have seen over many quarters, this line does tend to be a little bit bumpy, but for the full year we still expect the average to high end of the $60 million $80 million range per quarter. On expenses, as we noted last quarter, we expect to see $10 million decline and each of the last two quarters were about $20 million in total, mainly from reduced consulting fees related to the resolution plan. For the full year we expect our total adjusted expenses to be up around 1%, although the improved revenue performance and the recent decline of the dollar may make this a bit more challenging. Regarding taxes, we expect our 2017 effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26% along the lines of what we've previously guided and finally we expect to generate positive operating leverage for the entire year of 2017. With that, let me turn it over to Charlie to say a few words. Charles Scharf : Thanks, Todd. It's great to see that Gerald and the team were able to deliver more solid results in Gerald's last quarter as CEO and that he and the team have been able to create momentum. I know I said a few days ago that I have tremendous amount of respect for what Gerald has accomplished during his 44-year career and six-year tenure as CEO here at BNY Mellon. We're working very well together and look forward to his continuing advice and counsel. We'll continue to build on all that he and the team have accomplished and the focus on both efficiency and growth. But we understand that short-term results give us the credibility and resources to invest for the long-term. We will sustain a strong trusted and well respected company with real long-term sustainable growth. Gerald and Todd are in the best position to comment on the quarter. So, I'll hand it back to them and I look forward to speaking with you more after I'm settled. Gerald? Gerald Hassell : Charlie, thank you very much for those kind remarks. And operator, we're now able to open it up for questions. Operator, can we open it up for questions. Yes, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Gerald, congratulations also on a great career at BK and Charlie, best of luck. If I could just ask on NII, Todd, to your point on the good progression, just as far as your outlook, I was wondering the securities book yields were flat sequentially and I'm wondering if you can just help us understand just the on and off, what's coming on, what's coming off, and any changes that you're seeing in terms of just the environment and how you're able to invest there. It seems like the benefits you got were more in the cash deposits and in the loan book and the securities yields were flat. So, just wondering if you can help us understand the movements there and how that looks forward. Todd Gibbons : Sure, Ken. Good morning. So, the securities book, it does have about 30% of it that is floating, so that reprices regularly and it is a little bit of lag to that, but we see that reflected in the numbers over the past couple of quarters. The other 70% is being reinvested in similar duration securities and there's a flat yield curve. So, those rates really haven't gone up much. So, it's not really benefiting from a change in the rate environment. As we look forward, we would expect to see those yields continue to grind up if they follow the forward yield curve. You probably could see the entire securities portfolio continue to grind up maybe in the range of six or seven basis points a quarter. Ken Usdin : Got it, great. Thank you for that. And secondly just on the - if you can provide a little color on that issue or services commentary, is this an environmental point about the seasonality being different? Or are you seeing some structural changes to either the usage of DRs or the way that market is moving around nowadays? Todd Gibbons : Okay. The comment I made was we typically see in the second quarter a fairly substantial bump. We expect to see that in this quarter, but not as large as what we've seen in the past. I think Brian you can kind of point out what the factors that are driving that. Brian Shea : Yeah. Sure, Todd. I think the reason the growth in the third quarter wouldn't be as high as last year are really driven by three different factors. One is just market and economic conditions have driven the decline in DR's outstanding in a couple of large emerging markets. Second, there were some non-recurring M&A activity and privatization activity last year in the second quarter that won't repeat itself this year, so that's going to create a year-over-year difference. And then we are seeing pretty aggressive competitive pricing in the marketplace and we've been sticking to our discipline around profitable growth. And as a result we've lost a couple of clients in the DR space, which is another factor. So, those are the three factors. But honestly we think our profitable growth strategy is the right one long-term for the shareholder and in terms of our market share of new issuance, our market share still remains market leading and solid. Todd Gibbons : And corporate actions in the space tend to be episodic anyway. So, you are going to get some swings there from period to period. Ken Usdin : Understood. All right. Thanks guys. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hey, guys. Good morning everybody. So, you continue to become fixated on the whole rebook clearing collateral management issues. So, maybe taking another step at this, anyway you guys can help advice how much this contributes to the revenues today and I guess more importantly the opportunity you see from JP Morgan exiting this business I guess a couple of years ago, I heard you talking about on boarding some clients, but any way you can help us and I think that will be helpful. And I guess just more importantly taking a step back to the treasury's suggestion on the SLR relief, if that does come into fruition, it should be pretty positive for the repo markets broadly. Again maybe taking a step back, you can help us think through how this could impact BNY Mellon's revenue as a whole. Gerald Hassell : Okay. Alex, you're layering a lot of questions for us. But let's see how we can handle them. Alex Blostein : One topic. Gerald Hassell : I'll start with the clearance topic and ask Brian to pitch in. So, when we look at collateral management, it's another form of custody. So, we're acting as a custodian as do many of our competitors and that falls to the asset servicing line. It's a relatively small component of the total asset servicing line, but it is the fastest growing component. And we're starting to see it actually move the needle a little bit. So, we look at the growth from the - in the quarter and we look at the underlying growth rate. Probably about half of that was contributed by improvements in collateral management. Now, Brian, do you have anything to add to that with the new clearance clients coming on? Brian Shea : Yeah. I mean JP Morgan, as you said, announced the raise for the government clearing business last year, but we're only now beginning to transition them after putting in place enhanced governance model and the enhanced resolvability model that Gerald talked about. So, we actually converted our first small JP Morgan client in the second quarter and we'll be converting now over the course of the rest of this year and the course of '18, the rest of the - those clients, as well as some other clients and new market entrants into this space. So, we think that U.S. government clearing and tri-party and global collateral services will be an increasing driver of growth over the next 18 months and we're all aligned to drive that growth responsibly. Gerald Hassell : And I think, Alex, the related question you had is how about the impact of the treasury paper on regulatory change. A component of that was to exclude things like treasuries and central bank cash and perhaps new treasury repo out of the denominator of the leverage ratio and the SLR. As you look out to the binding constraints for the big broker dealer, big entities and broker dealers that is their binding constraint. So, I would assume that they've got some relief. The matched books that they had run in the past could probably grow and we would benefit from more activity. So, we would be very welcoming of seeing that. We think it would be healthy for the treasury market itself, because I think it would add greater liquidity to the market, tighten up spreads, and we also think there would be more transaction volume flowing through us if that would be the case. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then the second question around the NIR dynamic and just deposit beta you guys have seen in the quarter. Any meaningful change from the last hike given client behavior, you guys observed I guess post the June hike and then specifically with respect to noninterest bearing deposit, it seems like that's been fairly stable for you guys, but any sign you are seeing that customers in that bucket are starting to look around for places of a little more yield. Todd Gibbons : Yeah. I want to talk to - talk about a couple of points here. If you look at Page 8 of our earnings release, we disclosed what the cost of our interest bearing deposits and the change in the quarter and you can see in this quarter went from three basis points to nine basis points. So, we had about a 29 basis point increase on average in the interest on excess reserves. So, if you take into consideration that about 75% of our deposits are US dollar denominated that equates to the core of somewhere between 25% and 30% data. We do think that data with future rate increases will increase, but it will continue to add positively to our NIM. So, we do anticipate base moving up above the 50% range with the next few movements. In terms of deposit behaviors, they've probably have performed our expectations a little bit in the second quarter. In terms of the total deposits they are up a little bit. US deposits are just about dead flat on a sequential basis both in the noninterest bearing and in the interest bearing. And we do believe depending on how the Fed dose it's tapering that we might continue to see some modest runoff in noninterest bearing deposits. I think what goes on in the interest bearings is going to be just related to data's. So, there is no reason that we'd have to see that kind of a runoff. But the net impact is still a positive one with our NIM increasing more than the impact of the runoff. That's what we are currently modeling. Gerald Hassell : Yeah, maybe I can add a loaf something Alex and that is we have a very, very good process internally by business segment around seeing the deposit flows, I mean that's why the benefits of enhanced data by business line, by segment, they can work with our treasury area making sure we are pricing the deposits the right way for the best outcome for the firm and for the clients. And that process is working very smoothly. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thanks guys, very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. A question on asset servicing, we try to get at this once in a while and there's a lot of moving parts, but the markets are up a lot, your assets are up a lot, assets servicing up just 1%, I wonder if you could pass out what's mix shift, what's price break, what's currency, what's the U.K. TA business impact. It just came up lighter and I think there's just a bunch moving parts in there. Todd Gibbons : Sure. How about if I start and Brian? So, one of the things that I want to make clear is, if you look at the asset servicing line for the enterprise, that does include some fee revenue that's generated in the investment management and some fee revenue that's generated and most of it obviously is generated in the Investment Services business. So, on the Investment Management side, we have seen in our boutiques a little lower securities lending and - in that kind of the custody related business and wealth management, it's been relatively flat. The remainder of it is running through - through investment services and Brian you can speak to that. Brian Shea : Yeah. From an investment services perspective, I mean the revenue growth up 2% year-over-year. If you adjusted that for the impact of currency and the impact of our repositioning of the U.K. retail TA business, the growth rate is more like, I would say approximately 3.5%. So it's reasonably solid growth rate. We still think that this business is positioned well for growth on long-term, asset manager's face with secular trends that are putting pressure on their cost base and we really are part of that solution in terms of extending variable cost shared economies scale solution. So, we see significant growth opportunity ahead in the middle office space and the real estate private and equity funded administration space. We are strengthening our team in the ETF services space and we sort of have a life cycle approach to ETF services, not just the core servicing, but we're authorized participants and we have a platform for us to gathering - and now a new no transaction fee, EFT asset gathering platform approaching. So, I think the - we are continuing to do the foundational things we need to enhance the growth of this business and as Todd and Gerald already mentioned collateral management which is core it, is one of those drivers going forward. Todd Gibbons : I think just as a reminder to - our business mix is a little bit different, so we are much more fixed income oriented as you know with - fixed incomes are actually down a little bit year-over-year, but we are benefitting from the expertise that we have in the collateral management side of that. So, I think that's - so we do get a market bump. There is no question about it, but it's probably not as high as you might see as somebody that was more oriented toward equities. Glenn Schorr : Fair and all guys I appreciate that. Just one little follow-up and not sure if I missed it. You mentioned what you thought the - what you won in the quarter. Do you have a number for what is won but not yet funded pipeline? Todd Gibbons : We don't have that number handy, but it's not a huge number though at this point. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi, good morning folks. Maybe just back on the balance sheet, Todd if you can comment on how you would potentially envision the balance sheet size, if some of the recommendations by treasury do come to provision in terms of releasing cash and traded securities from the SLR denominator. How that might - I know it's very early of course, but how you might think about that shaping your balance sheet size strategy over the next couple of years. And then just also just quickly on the other securities portfolio line that you just put down, I was just wondering if there is any premium amortization increase in that in 2Q? Todd Gibbons : Todd, I'll have to ask a follow up question of your question on the second question, but as to the balance size Brian, if we do get really from the treasury recommendations, we are going to have to think through what to do that would relieve a fair amount of our capital requirements. And so we have been pretty disciplined in the past and I expect that we will be in the future and so if putting that - if growing the balance sheet makes sense, we will do that. If not, we will buy back our shares. And so we will have to compare with the alternatives or with that incremental cash. We would love to see it because we think it would propel behavior and we would love the optionality that it would provide, but again that activity would have to be contingent in our making a decent return because ultimately it's freed up capital. So, we got to do something with capital and so that's how we are thinking about. I didn't completely understand your second question, Brian. Brian Bedell : That was just on the other securities portion on the average balance sheet, I think yield went down, I mean it's a small thing, but its 28 billion balance the yield went down, but 10 basis points from that taken 125 to 115 in the quarter just to know if there was anything to that in terms of mix or was premium amortization effect? Todd Gibbons : Yeah. I don't know of the top of my head. The reason to a lot of premium amortization impact so, I don't think that's going to be driving it, but I don't. If you recall back in the fourth quarter, we adopted what we call the prepayment method for amortization - the premium amortization and under that method I think we have reduced quite a bit of the volatility out of the numbers. So, we are going to have to look into that. I don't have that detail Brian. Brian Bedell : Okay. Thanks. And just a follow for Brian on the client adoption of NEXEN and I know he has been talking a lot about client usage of a number of different services in the beginning to see a little bit of an incremental revenue impact. You did that impact asset servicing positively this quarter and are you seeing that as a potential revenue impact in the second half. And then just maybe - I know Charlie is going to comment a lot more next quarter, but in terms of the technology initiatives that you have been putting in place in the business improvement process. Should we be thinking of any type of strategic change to the priority with Charlie in the CEO seat? Brian Shea : Yeah. So let me start with - its Brian Shea, let me start with an excellent comment. We can say as continue to increasing adoption of the NEXEN platform and we continue to build our capabilities and add more capabilities to enhance the client experience and their ability to operate effectively. We have now crossed the threshold over a hundred thousand client and internal users on the NEXEN platform which is good. In terms of revenue generation, there is going to be some fee revenue growths from core services like API, access and processing and then obviously our premium services. It is not the yet a meaningful contributor to the revenue base, but expect that revenue and at this point we don't want to provide specific guidance on that and want to just continue to build the platform out and see [indiscernible] adoption. I would say that the client impact is growing and positively more and more case studies and examples were getting the access to the real time data through APIs is making a meaningful difference in our clients business and enabling them - for example in one case, a major financial institution getting collateral and liquidity information multiple times and today enabling them to manage their collateral and liquidity more effectively and saving our clients millions of dollars. So, really getting value more and more and there is more proof points in case studies and that's going to continue to grow. In terms of the business improvement process, I will comment on and if Charlie wants to add something to it and I'm sure he will. Look the business improvement process is going to continue. It's critical to our performance to environment and the market environment requires us to continuously optimize and our existing investments in order to fund strategic growth investments in reward shareholders. So, I don't - I see this as a process, not a project and something that we would continuously do as part of the continuous improvement culture. And so, we have a pipeline of the issues already underway and already being analyzed that would continue to drive momentum in that space. And I would hope and expect Charlie would agree to that and he is going to have a chance to decide right now. Go ahead Charlie. Charles Scharf : It looks like mother and apple pie. I agree completely what Brian said and I just look forward to getting into detail and understanding the specifics a little bit more. Brian Bedell : Great, great. Thanks very much for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of with Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on the deposit growth trends, we saw the foreign office deposit growth pick up and I think you referenced that US deposits stable. So, it seems like all that deposit growth came from foreign offices. At the same time we saw the cost of those switch from negative to positive. So number one, I guess what drove that cost and was there any particular region on driving that or was there a mixed shift there in that line item. Brian Shea : Okay. So yeah, we're kind of mixing apples and oranges here. Where the deposits are booked does not necessarily a reflection of the underlying currency. So, what we did see - and a fair amount of our deposits are booked at foreign branches. With that the actual mix of US dollar and non-US dollar deposits change just slightly because we saw our US dollar deposits flat and our non-US dollar deposits increase slightly. So, as we go through the pickup for the period on our interest earning deposits, the cost move from - moves up from 3 to 9 basis points. And all of that was attributed to the dollar impact. So when we walk through and I had mentioned this earlier on the call when we do the arithmetic, that equates to somewhere between 25% and 30 % data on your dollar denominated interest earning deposits. Brennan Hawken : Okay, got it. So, regardless of domicile currency driver was all USD and no real change in the non-US dollar based deposit. Brian Shea : That's correct. It was flat from period to period on average. Brennan Hawken : Got it, okay great, thanks. That's very helpful. And then when we think about revenue growth incurring services, I want to say that that drove - that was a pretty strong component that we saw here this quarter and we think about durability, I know you had some decent growth in the cash products as far as flows go. Is this just a catch up there and therefore we should think about this as the right jumping off point for that line item. It's tough because we kind see the exact AUM in the disclosures yet in those products and just not completely sure how much that is. Todd Gibbons : So one at it, I take the stab at this and the bridges both of our major sectors. First of all on the clearing side the further consolidation of mutual fund assets under our platforms is increasing and it's very gratifying to see that our platforms are being used more extensively as that consolidation process occurs and we are winning business from brokers and accelerating at pace and more importantly advisors as we shift to an advisory model utilizing our platform to capture assets and that's one of the reasons why you are seeing the clearing business pick up as nicely as it did as well as the fee waiver impact. Second part of your question is, we are seeing and capturing more cash through our various portals and platforms. So whether its purging platform or liquidity services platform, we are capturing and internalizing more of that flow and that's why I think we are outperforming capturing cash in our money market business and that flows into the Investment Management area. And I think our performance in the management of the money market funds has also improved. So we are now very, very competitive on the returns in the money market fund. So the combination of the increased performance on the funds and the capture of the cash is allowing us to outperform. Brennan Hawken : Perfect. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. I had technical difficulties on the call on Monday, so my first question goes \u2013congratulation Gerald for your great career and welcome Charlie. Charlie, can you share with us - I know you got the tactical background from Visa and how that will help probably in the Investment Services area, but when you look at Slide 3 of today's handout, you see that the Investment Management revenues have been pretty much flat for now in two and half years. What's your view about the Investment Management business when you look forward? Charles Scharf : Well, if I think generically its - the underlying business dynamics are something that fits very well into what we do. I obviously have a lot to learn about our boutique model. What drives the performance, what drives how we have done and honestly I have spent just a little bit of time with Mitchell, but we're going to spend a bunch of more time going through what the plans are. And when there is more to talk about we will certainly do which I would say by the end of the quarter and at Investor Day. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Gerald Hassell : Yeah, Gerard one slight correction to your commentary, the revenue growth in Investment Management was up very nicely and the pretax income was up even more. So I - we just want to then correct it a little bit to the performance to the Investment Management area was actually been quite robust this year. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And then Todd can you give us an update, in 2014 on the Investor Day you talked about the balance sheet shrinking maybe 40 billion to 70 billion overtime, where are you on that number when you cash all your big [ph] deposits to where they are today. How much are you down? Todd Gibbons : If you look at it on average, interest bearing deposits on a year-over-year basis are down about 25 billion, so we are pretty far along the way. Most of that is in dollars. Now when we gave that indication, we assumed a parallel shift in all currencies. We haven't seen that so, we are not seeing any decline in the non-dollar deposits at this point Gerard. So I think we pretty much tract along our expectations and we could see a modest additional decline. Now that all being said, the markets are growing and so with the growth the natural underlying growth may offset some of what the interest impact and the Fed tapering impact would otherwise have. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Gerald Hassell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Thanks guys. First question just on Investment Management, anything - most of the trends you guys mentioned on performance in the flows, revenues and margin everything was pretty good. Just two items I had a quick question on, one is, the other line, it looks like there was a loss there. I think that's usually seed, but markets are pretty strong, so I don't know if there was something. It's a little unusual and then I think you guys mentioned on the high network side deposit balances declining for net interest income. I think we are seeing that across the industry, but is there any color on how much that tax related versus client being more engaged in the market versus setting on cash? Todd Gibbons : Yeah, I'll make a brief comment and Mitchell can jump out. We're seeing a little bit of a decline in the wealth deposits and I don't know if I can comment on that. A - Mitchell Harris Just on the wealth deposits, you have a couple of things, I think going on. You have seasonality that happens in the second quarter with tax payments and with interest rates moving up, at least private clients are moving into other products right now. So they're shifting out. With respect to the other revenue and it's really primarily an abatement of the cash waivers that we pay out to Investment Services, so it's more of an internal transfer from us over to Investment Services. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks. Todd Gibbons : And Michael were you refereeing to the segment line or the enterprise line for other investment, other income. Michael Carrier : It was the segment. Todd Gibbons : Okay, alright. Thank you. Michael Carrier : And then just a quick follow up just on the investment gain, you just mentioned in terms of the full year that 60 to 80, I just want to make sure we're thinking about that right, meaning 60 to 80 for the remaining two quarters or do we take the elevated level like this quarter and the rest of the year would be lower. Todd Gibbons : Yeah, you would adjust - take the number on average we should - on average for the aggregate for the year it should be on the high end of that 60 to 80, so four times 80 is 320, so that - Gerald Hassell : There's your number. Todd Gibbons : That's what I was pointing towards. Michael Carrier : Alright guys, thanks a lot. Gerald Hassell : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Geoff Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoff Elliott : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Back to the deposits, firstly, can you remind us why your clients leave noninterest bearing deposit with you? You've got over 70 billion of them, it's a very sophisticated client base, I'm sure they do not earn interest if they could. So why do clients leave those noninterest bearing deposits at BNY Mellon? Todd Gibbons : Well, there's a substantial amount of those that are non-dollar and so right now on the non-dollar category interest rates are extraordinarily low or negative in some instances. In US dollars it tends to be frictional cash, I mean most of us leave a little money in our checking accounts and it looks a lot like a retail business when you have many thousands upon thousands of accounts and people - and our clients are trying to make sure that they don't incur over drafts in those accounts. So they leave a little bit of a cushion for that frictional activity. And then the final point, in some of our payments businesses we actually give an earnings credit, so we don't pay interest on the account, but we credit fees for the account. So that's still denominated as a noninterest bearing account, but it effectively offsets fees for the services provided. This quarter alone, we saw pretty healthy payments business, it was only up - the fees were only up 1%, but if we reflected what the credits that they got from noninterest bearing balances, that would have added another 4%, so the actual underlying activity was up a pretty healthy number. Geoff Elliott : And then just to follow up on that, noninterest bearing is obviously a much higher percentage of liabilities or earning assets or however you want to look at it than it was before the crisis. Is there anything structural that's changed that means that it should be higher other than the interest rates environments? Todd Gibbons : I wouldn't say that that there is obviously the value of managing that tighter and tighter would go up as interest rates go up and that's why we would expect in our models and we've reflected that that is probably going to be the case. If you kind or look back at us prior to the crisis we're running those numbers somewhere around 16% of the balance sheet. It's probably a little bit higher than that now, but I believe the non-dollar component of it has contributed a fair amount of that as well. Geoff Elliott : Great, thank you very much. Todd Gibbons : Okay, thank you Geoffrey. Gerald Hassell : Thank you very much Geoffrey and thanks everyone for dialing in. We really appreciate it. Then I'm sure you'll follow up with Valerie and our team on further questions. Operator : If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Miss. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you ladies and gentlemen and this concludes today's conference call and webcast. Thank you for participating.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie Haertel : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the BNY Mellon third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, our CEO; and Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as members of our executive leadership team. Our third quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results, and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Charlie and Todd discuss our results, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC available on the website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 19, 2017. We will not update forward-looking statements. Now I would like to turn the call over to Charlie. Charles Scharf : Thank you so much, and good morning and thank you all for joining us. I would like to cover a series of items before I turn it over to Todd, and then we will open it up for questions. I'm going to be making some brief remarks about the quarter. I'm going to talk about the transition, share some views on our businesses, our challenges and our opportunities. Let me start with the third quarter performance versus the prior year. Revenue grew 2%. Expenses were flat year-over-year and were flat from last quarter. EPS grew 4%. Looking at revenue in more detail, fees grew 1%, but DRs decreased by $54 million, which reduced growth by 2%. FX and other trading revenues were down $10 million. The remainder of investment services grew 5% and investment management fees grew 5%. Todd will discuss this in more detail but we saw some reasonable growth in some areas that are core to our franchise. This includes asset servicing, clearing fees, asset management and performance fees and treasury services fees.  Net interest grew 8%. On a segment basis, investment services grew revenue 2%. Again DRs reduced this growth rate by about 2% and FX and other trading revenues reduced this by 1%. Investment management grew revenue at 4%. When we look at pre-tax, investment services pre-tax grew 4% and investment management pre-tax grew 17%. We also continued to strengthen our capital position which Todd will cover, and I will discuss my thoughts in more detail, but while the quarter showed consistent performance and some of our core businesses showed reasonable growth, we believe we can continue to build our franchise and ultimately increase our rate of revenue and EPS growth. Now a few comments about the transition. First I want to take a few minutes and thank Gerald. He has been a terrific partner through the transition and I am grateful to have access to his advice and counsel. I also want to recognize the progress he has made and the foundation he has created during his tenure as CEO. When I talk about the opportunities that we have for the future we all know they are possible because of what he has accomplished here. Also a few words about the [indiscernible] of our employees here at The Bank of New York Mellon. While Gerald provided the necessary leadership, the results have been driven by a large group of employees here. The effort has been tremendous; changing the profit profile of the company at the same time as dealing with all of the post-crisis requirements is an extraordinary achievement. We are a much stronger company today and our future is bright because of what you have all accomplished. So thank you. Having said that we are at the beginning of a new journey. We are proud of our progress, but we are not necessarily satisfied with our performance. We want to continue to build stronger underlying margins, which we might or might not use to reinvest in the business and we seek higher levels of growth, and we will continue to be focused on keeping a strong capital base and high returns. For me personally it has been a busy three months. I have spent most of my time listening and learning. I have seen 42 of our top 50 clients around the world. I have met with many of our regulators globally, and I have had extensive internal discussions focusing on both our business and our people. Todd and I have conducted systematic business reviews to review our business strategies, performance, competitive environment, strengths and opportunities. I have also done my best to meet with as many people as possible in both small and larger groups. People have been generous with their time and patience, and I have found my discussions invaluable thus far. Now let me make some observations about our company. There are many things which excite me about this company, which I have seen. First, there are so many pieces of our culture which anyone would envy. We love working for this company. We love serving our clients. We take a long-term view of those relationships. We are extremely objective about our own performance, and the genuinely enjoy working as a team. In addition to these strong elements of our culture we play an important role in the global financial system. We have got deep relationships with our clients, which have been built over decades. We talk about their needs before our needs. So many people here have great subject matter expertise as well, and we understand the importance of technology to our future. But I also see meaningful opportunities for us to improve our business going forward. With all the progress that we have made in generating strong results, I still believe we can improve our performance by changing how we manage the company. We are not demanding enough of each other and this can stand in the way of disciplined management, which can drive us to stronger results. We do strive to be a high-performing company, and that requires crisper processes, streamlined decision-making, a clear sense of responsibility and most importantly we are beginning to drive a meaningfully different sense of urgency and clear accountability. Ultimately I firmly believe this will drive better execution, better decision-making and ultimately better results. As we think about our future there is nothing more important than ensuring we have got the best operating environment and core technology platform to build from. It is important that everyone understands that this is a multi-year effort that has been in place. We have made significant improvements in improving our core platforms, but this is a journey and significant continued investment is necessary. With Bridget Engle joining us, we now have a new set of eyes to look at the priorities and we have a clear agenda here. We spend over $2 billion today a year on technology, and we will continue to devote an outsized amount of our resources here. We have eliminated redundant platforms over the past several years, but still have more work to do. The continued platform integration is critical. Our operating environment is still too complex. As we continue to invest, we will ultimately become more efficient but more importantly we will have a better platform to serve our clients, and our investments in technology go beyond core platform improvement. You have heard us talk about NEXEN. NEXEN is not one system or one platform, but a discrete set of activities, which are important for our ability to deliver our company as a platform. It includes the following. We are simplifying the ways clients access our technology by providing a common integrated portal rather than siloed solutions. Our APIs will allow clients a simplified and more streamlined way to access our capabilities. Our efforts to more holistically manage our data across the enterprise will continue to create meaningful ways for us to provide differentiated insights and capabilities for our clients. And this year we launched our third generation container-based private cloud. Our private cloud platform hosts a growing portion of our non-mainframe applications and has significantly improved software delivery times from months to hours. Here too we are committed to this journey and as we sharpen our focus on our priorities and our implementation. And while we made great progress reducing our expense base we are not done. We need to continue to drive efficiency throughout the company. This includes developing a multiyear plan to automate much of the manual work that exists today. I have talked about the strong client orientation that exists inside the company, but here I think we do have substantial opportunity to take the strong piece of our culture a step forward. Our client focus by itself doesn't ensure that we consistently deliver great solutions to our clients. We become too product centric in some cases and at times have not worked as well across our organization. Simply said, we see a significant opportunity to do a better job delivering all of BNY Mellon to our clients in a clear and coordinated way. We are now engaged in sessions where we develop detailed client plans looking across the company at our current business relationships, their wallet, our competitive position, our solutions, where they are taking their company and put these all together to develop a coordinated plan to serve each client. These sessions will drive management strategies for our clients, but also will drive us to create new solutions based on a deeper understanding of where we can help our clients grow. These tools then form the basis for a process to manage our business with clients truly at the center of our thoughts and activities. Now let me make a few specific comments about our businesses. First of all we like the businesses that we are in. Like most businesses, some have more challenges and some have more opportunities. Let me start by talking about our investment services businesses and I will start specifically with our asset servicing and clearing businesses. Our positions are strong. These are core services for our clients, where we have true global scale. We have high quality businesses, which are real competitive differentiators for us. The business environment is competitive for sure. And our growth has been impacted in some of these businesses by conversions and related issues over the past few years, but our asset servicing revenues grew 4% this quarter and our clearing revenues grew 10%. We believe that we still have an opportunity to improve our performance. Pershing is a great brand; has created a great place for itself in the market and it is very well run. Our government clearance business is also one of our great strengths and should continue to be an asset for us going forward. And we are in a unique position in that we connect the buy-side and the sell-side here. Our technology has been a differentiator and we continue to have opportunities to do even more with both the technology and the data we have. And remember these businesses are very often the anchors in our client relationship and we see opportunities to create even more leverage going forward. Our corporate trust business is a meaningful part of the company. Our results have been disappointing over the last few years as we have not committed the required resources, but we did see mid-single-digit revenue growth this quarter. We now have a new leadership team in place and are focused on regaining our position as the high quality growing trustee. In our treasury services businesses, we are a top tier US dollar clearer, US treasury management solutions provider and the payment services provider to the rest of the BNY Mellon enterprise. We see steady growth here, low double double-digit revenue growth this quarter and it is driven by service quality and GDP growth. It also produces healthy margins and high quality LCR friendly deposit balances. In our DR business, we have significant share and are winning our fair share of new programs. Pricing has become more competitive but we remain disciplined on that, and also on structure and terms. Growth here is dependent upon emerging market equity issuances and episodic corporate actions and other issuance and cancellation activity. Let me make some comments about our markets business. Our markets business is a very important part of our offering. Our goal here is to capture flows generated from the strong relationships elsewhere in the company. We have always been highly focused on core FX and other low-risk products and will continue to do so. We have some of the best securities lending and collateral management capabilities in the world, important differentiators where we believe we can provide more liquidity, lower funding cost and lower capital requirements for our clients. This business benefits hugely from our scale, but also from our use of data and technology.  Now let me move on to our investment management business. As you know, we have multiple brands and investment strategies and their pluses and minuses to the structure. There can be different points of view on the value of multiple brands, but some of our brands are clear differentiators for us. But the way we run the core of our business is actually not different from many other active managers out there. We have highly focused investment teams. They have their own clear and unique investment processes, and they have got the drive, the focus and the incentive system based on their own performance to deliver the strongest results that they can. Where we have fallen short historically is that we have not achieved the benefits of common platforms. Mitchell is very focused on doing this where it makes sense, and you are seeing it in our results with significant margin expansion and profit growth. And I do believe that there are real benefits to asset management, investment services and markets all being part of Bank of New York Mellon. Distributors of asset management products are some of our biggest clients. And as I visited many of our boutique CEOs, they have told me of the value they are beginning to see as we create access they would not be able to achieve on their own. Again we have deep global relationships. Our Pershing platform is another important partner of the business. And lastly asset management is an important component of one of our best and least well-understood assets, which is our [precision] servicing and managing cash. Along with markets and investment services we have a fairly unique set of capabilities, which give us a unique set of offerings for both broker-dealers and asset owners. Having said this, our asset management and asset servicing flows today are clearly suffering from not having scale in ETFs. This is a topic for another day. For now our focus is creating value by continuing to improve the profit profile of our business by leveraging BNY Mellon and common platforms. These are just a few thoughts based on what I have seen and learnt over the past three months. We are currently deep into our planning process and we are using the process to dig deep into our businesses and develop a clear plan, which is both operational, financial but also strategic for the next several years. We plan on providing a detailed review of our findings and plans at an investor day, which we are now planning to hold on March 8. With that, let me turn it over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Charlie and good morning everyone. I will review the details of our third-quarter financial results on a year-over-year basis, unless I note otherwise.  In the quarter, global equity [markets] resulted in record AUCA and AUM for us. The revenue increased 2%, investment management fees were up 5%, investment services 1%. As Charlie noted, our investment services revenue performance was impacted by a 34% decline in DR revenue and that also impacted our FX trading revenue on a year-over-year basis. We experienced a little bit lower volatility in our FX results on a year-over-year basis. As you can see in the report it is down about 20% volatility, and that is where the market averages were, and somewhat offset by higher average trading volume. And IR increased as we recognized a full quarter benefit from the June rate increase, and did experience a modest decline in deposits and lower loan volume as we reduced some of our lower yielding loans. Finally, from a currency translation perspective the fluctuations had an essentially neutral impact on revenues as well as on our expenses and the net income for the company on a total company basis. But it did have a slightly higher impact on revenues and expenses sequentially. Charlie walked you through the highlights of the quarter. So I will move ahead to Slide 8 to discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year change reflects higher equity market values and net new business, including growth in collateral management and that was partially offset by the impact of downsizing the UK transfer agency business. The sequential increase was driven by currency and higher equity market values. Clearing service fees increased 10% year-over-year and that is primarily reflecting higher money market fees and growth in our long-term mutual fund assets. On a sequential basis, clearing fees declined and that is driven by lower volumes that we saw in the third quarter. Issuer service fees declined 15% year-over-year and that is reflecting the lower depositary receipt fees and we experienced fewer corporate actions, some lost business due to pricing and structure and also had lower program shares outstanding. In net aggregate, those items reduced the fees relative to last year by over $50 million. On a sequential basis, issuer service fees were up 20% and that is primarily due to seasonality in DRs as well as higher corporate trust revenue. Treasury service fees increased 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially and that is reflecting the higher payment volumes that was partially offset by compensating balance credits that we provide to clients. So if you adjust for those credits, the fee revenue growth would have been an additional 3% higher or 6% in total. On a sequential basis revenue would have been an additional 1% to 2% greater. Investment management and performance fees increased 5% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Unlike most quarters, the net impact from higher currency translation on investment management and performance fees was less than 1% this quarter. This quarter as part of our ongoing portfolio rationalization we announced the sale of our real estate focused investment boutique called CenterSquare. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter or perhaps early next year, and that sale will have no material impact on our overall financial results. Also as a result of the improvements made over the last year to the cost structure of the business, our adjusted pretax operating margin for investment management continued to improve to 35%. This is an increase of 265 basis points year-over-year. Foreign exchange and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis decreased 5% year-over-year and increased 5% sequentially. FX revenue was 158 million. That is 10% lower year-over-year and it is 5% higher sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower volatility as well as lower DR related FX activity. And that is partially offset by higher volumes. The sequential increase reflects those higher volumes as well. Investment and other income declined to $63 million from $92 million in the year ago quarter and $122 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower other income driven by the impact of our investments in renewable energy as well as low received capital gains. The sequential decline reflects lease-related gains recorded in the second quarter, which did not recur in the third quarter as well as lower income as well as lower income from corporate bank owned life insurance. Slide nine shows the drivers of our investment management business which explain underlying performance. We achieved record assets under management of 1.8 trillion. It's up 6% year-over-year and it reflects higher market values as well as net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar and that's principally against the pound. In terms of investment performance against the backdrop of a relatively strong quarter for global markets our active strategies performed pretty well with 75% and 74% of assets above the three and five year benchmarks. We also experienced net inflows interactively managed strategies. We had long-term active inflows of 3 billion that was driven by continued demand for our fixed income, multi-asset and alternative strategies. These inflows were offset by outflows in active equities and LDI strategy which actually totaled $4 million. We saw inflows of 4 billion to fixed income, inflows of 3 billion to multi-asset and alternative investment strategies and those are key areas that we are looking to grow that have benefited from strong demand. This quarter active equity outflows of 2 billion was about the lowest we have seen over the last few years and it was held in part by a strong equity market as well as improved investment performance and pricing. LDI outflows of 2 billion up were driven by one significant LDI client that shows to take the business in-house. Additionally we had $3 billion amount in outflows from low fee index products and that's again driven by a few large clients. Similar to last quarter weeks we experienced cash inflows of 10 billion this quarter. U.S. money market funds the largest segment of our cash business have not grown 19% year-to-date and that compares favorably to the industry trend of 1% organic growth this year. Our ability to maintain good performance in core money market funds and grow our customer base through synergies with investment services has been key to out-performance year. This is a business where we have scale. We have got a strong reputation and we demonstrated good performance and where we continue to see growth opportunity as the sector solidifies around firms that are sharing these trends. Our wealth management business continued positive trends with wealth management fees up 4% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Higher net new business from U.S. expansion initiative and continued loan growth which was 9% higher year-over-year helped to drive performance. That was offset by reduction in deposit that was primarily driven by a single client. Turning to our investment services metrics on slide 10, we achieved record AUC/A of 32.2 trillion this quarter that's up 6% year-over-year and 4% sequentially reflecting the stronger market values. We estimate total new assets under custody and administration business winds were about 166 billion in the third quarter looking at other key investment services metrics you will see average deposit declined 10% year-over-year and 1% sequentially and that reflects the impact of the June rate increase. Average loan balances declined 14% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Lastly average tri-party people balances grew 15% year-over-year and 1% sequentially as volume increased with the additional business we are on boarding. Turning to net interest revenue on slide 11, you will see that on fully tax equivalent basis NIR of 851 million was up 8% versus year ago quarter and up 2% versus the second quarter; both increases primarily reflect higher interest rates and is partially offset by lower average deposit and loans. The sequential increase also reflects an additional interest earning day in the quarter. We experienced some moderate deposit runoff and interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. Average non-interest-bearing deposits declined 14% year-over-year and 5% sequentially and interest bearing declined 8% year-over-year but were flat sequentially. This was about in line with expectations following the June rate increase and deposits toward the end of the quarter were above the quarterly average. Turning to slide 12, you'll see that the adjusted non-interesting expense was up slightly year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflect higher software and professionally and legal and other purchase services and that was partially offset by lower litigation expense and bank assessment charges. Sequentially higher staff expense was offset by lower other professional legal and other purchase services and lower business develop expenses as well as lower bank assessment charges. The increase in staff expenses was driven by higher incentives and that's just reflecting the strong performance as well as by the annual employee merit increase that comes takes place in July. The decrease in professional and legal and other purchase services was driven by lower consulting fees related to our resolution planning which we submitted at the end of the second quarter. Turning to capital on slide 13, our fully phased-in supplemental leverage ratio increased to 6.1% and that now meets the upcoming 2018 regulatory requirements plus a reasonable buffer. We also remain in full compliance with U.S. liquidity coverage ratio requirements our LCR was 119% in the third quarter. All of our ratios are at or above our internal targets reflecting our continued capital generation and given for prospects for the relief of the SLR we no longer see a need to issue preferred equity. And now that we are at our targets it positions us well to increase buybacks in future years. A few additional notes about the quarter on page 9 of our press release we share our investments securities portfolio highlights at the quarter end our unrealized pretax gain or portfolio was 257 million that compares to 151 in the last quarter and that's primarily driven by a slight decrease in long-term interest rates. And our effective tax rate was 25.4%. Turning now to tax reform we currently support comprehensive tax reform as an important step both to achieve economic growth targets as well as to improve the competitiveness of U.S. businesses. We\u2019re encouraged by recent progress of the big six to define key parameters of tax reform. But because of the details reformer still remain unknown and uncertain it is difficult to estimate our effective tax rate post reform however, based on the available information that we have as we currently understand it, we would expect our effective tax rate to approximate the U.S. statutory tax rate post reform. Otherwise we expect that our effective tax rate may rise approximately 100 basis points in 2018 given our expected revenue growth as well as the mix of earnings we project for next year. Before turning to Q&A, I would like to provide you with some color on how you\u2019re thinking about the next quarter and the full year to assist you with our modeling. First earnings are typically impacted by our seasonal decline in DL revenue with a limited offset and expenses, we estimate that the decline from the third quarter to be approximately $80 million. We expect performance fees and our investment management business in the fourth quarter to be similar to that as the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year NIR is still expected to be at the high end of the 6% range that we had given you previously. Investment and other income for the fourth quarter and beyond is expected to be in the $40 million to $60 million range reflecting a lower leasing gains as well as the impact of our investments and renewable energy. We expect total adjusted expenses for the full year to be in-line with our prior guidance by approximately 1% higher than last year, as I know last quarter there is \u2013 it could be impacted by improved revenue performance, higher stock price as well as the continuing weakness in the U.S. dollar. Our 2017 effective tax rate is still expected to be in the range of 25% to 26% and finally we expect to generate positive operating leverage for the full year. With that let me hand over to the operator to take your questions. Q - Brennan Hawken : Hi good morning. Just a quick question for you on the funding cost side, you walked through some of the specifics on deposits which was really, really helpful. I guess the question would be, you seem like you said that non-interest bearing deposits ticked down this quarter which is what you said, was in-line with expectations. So if we see December hike that mean we should count on a bit more run-off on the non-interest bearing side and maybe even on the interest bearing side as well? Todd Gibbons : Brennan, it\u2019s Todd, good morning. Couple of comments there, number one just as a reminder on a year-over-year basis, last year is when we took the proactive actions around the deposits and we took them down about $20 billion to $25 billion of net fee, interest bearing as well as the non-interest bearing. As far as the quarter itself we saw a little dip in the non-interest bearing most of that took place in the month when there is relatively slow behavior and some of that recovered towards the end of the quarter. Our expectations is that we would continue to see moderate run-off in non-interest bearing especially if we see further rate increases and just to give you a sense of it, we went back and we looked historically. Non-interest bearing have averaged historically and much higher tax and much higher interest rate environments around 30% in our total deposits and are around 33 now. So if it retraces historical behaviors that seem to make sense to us. We could expect modest further decline. Brennan Hawken : That\u2019s great, and that\u2019s very helpful historical context thanks for that Todd. And then, on the interest bearing side it looks like beta has increased probably about what most would have expected. What do you see in the marketplace, what are your expectations for betas if we do end up getting another rate hike, how is the competition for deposits out there in the market? Thanks a lot? Todd Gibbons : Well, the betas did tick up a little bit and we had pretty much forecasted that on the interest bearing side as well and we would expect with each future rate increase that you will see an increase in the betas. I don\u2019t think competition has really changed too much but our expectation and what we forecasted as we gave you guidance around the net interest income for the full year is that we will see if there is another move, we will see more or higher beta with that move. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. Thanks for all the color. Todd Gibbons : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Great. Hi, good morning everybody. So Charlie, maybe I\u2019ll try this one and thanks for all the color and initial thoughts around the business. But BK is obviously a bit different and unique versus your peers just given kind of the diversity of the business. So taking a step as you look across everything that the firm does, what businesses do you think and deliver the most needle moving kind of organic growth going forward relative to exertion time in the past and understand it\u2019s too early, but given your name a lot of things \u2013 get a sense of kind of where they come out, anything? Charles Scharf : I don\u2019t think I\u2019m just saying much more at this point then I said in the prepared remarks, I think if there were things that we were doing which we were particularly concerned about or didn't think had same kind of profile that we would want going forward at this point I think we would have said something about it. And so, as I said in the remarks we are spending a fair amount of time going to our planning process. The assumption is that we should \u2013 that we are in a position to grow the businesses that we have today. What those look like relatively to each other honestly I think that's something which we will look forward to sharing more about when we get together for our Investor Day. Alex Blostein : Got it. Fair enough. And just the follow-up for Todd there has been some consolidation in the book at your space some firms going self-clearing recently maybe there will be more but help us understand I guess kind of how that impacts the clearing revenues for you guys and kind of any more explicit guidance would be helpful there. Todd Gibbons : Sure. I think that's probably better for Brian Shea to take. Brian Shea : Sure. Happy to take it. I think the headwind in the broker-dealer market in general is that there has been consolidation in the broker dealer market and pressure on the broker dealer revenue and business model as a result of the DOL fiduciary standard. We actually there maybe some firms going self-clearing but we actually see the opposite. We see more firms actually considering lowering the structural cost, lowering the capital investor and actually outsourcing their clearing. We actually converted a pretty meaningful side self-clearing firm, platform in the third quarter and we have a pipeline of few others that we are in discussions with which I can't tell for sure how it will turn out but it shows a higher level of interest in self-clearing actually lowering and verbalizing their cost. So the market overall is convincing. But we are actually holding our own and gaining share and growing into a little bit smaller market. The other big dynamic which is accelerated by DOL but it's a long term secular trend is that there has been a shift from the traditional brokerage model to an advisory model and we are growing our RIA custody business pretty significantly as it had double-digit growth and continues to have double-digit growth on a consistent basis. So we are seeing more of the growth in adviser model that's offsetting some of the pressure in the broker-dealer model. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thank you both. Charles Scharf : Thanks Alex. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Question on issuer services. So down 15% you mentioned three things in the text of pure corporate actions, loss to business and the ERP, so the part we totally get the corporate actions we get. I wonder if you could explain a little bit on the loss business and just maybe bigger picture think about the linkage or should there be a linkage to big banks who had head great debt underwriting quarters and years past that would be great for banking yard as a service, Scharf us you can help us package there? Charles Scharf : So Glenn just for clarity the issuer service line actually contains two of our businesses; one is the depository receipt business and the other is the corporate trust business. So as we noted DR was down 34% that's the entire in fact it's more than the entire decline in that line. The corporate trust business actual saw an uptake in revenues. And I will let Brian get some of the \u2013 if there is any detail he want to add to that Brian. Brian Shea : No I think you have most of it. I think the single biggest driver of the decline in DR was fewer corporate actions which are episodic and spiky and they always have been. The loss clients were probably the second largest factor and they were really two large clients one really pricing and the other pricing is sort of a model driven and we have been trying really hard to maintain our pricing discipline deliver a solid margins in that business so that's reality so that\u2019s going to be in our run rate for little while longer but and the other stuff was really more lower shares outstanding and slightly lower transaction volumes which is more secular we think than secular but you know it all depends on the market forces. But in terms of new business in DRs the issuance market is a little bit better than it was last year and although it's not softy and we are still gaining and wining more than our fair share while maintaining our pricing discipline so we are still the market leader I signing the new clients opportunities when they come to the market. And we are encouraged as Todd said by the corporate trust fee turnaround we had fee growth and corporate trust sequentially end year-over-year and so that's a good sign in terms of the longer term picture for issuer services. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that one. Little quick follow-up in investment management, apologizes if I missed it but average deposit is down call it 20% quarter-on-quarter \u201cyear-on-year\u201d? Todd Gibbons : Yes Glenn there is one large client attributed to almost all of that move in the quarter. It was not unexpected for us, it was the repatriated funds for their own reasons. So we don't necessarily see that as a trend, I mean there is a trend that it's declining a little bit but not to that extent. Glenn Schorr : Got it, okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Thanks very much. Good morning folks. Charlie also thanks very much for the run through of the businesses that was really helpful. Maybe just your view on you mentioned little bit, maybe your view on that platform obviously back in your \u2013 sort of needed differentiated move in that effort versus some peers and obviously, we all have been moving towards digitized platform but maybe just your perspective on how you see that differentiated versus peers whether do you think that was the sort of the right architecture or you want to change anything in that architecture in a major way or just more like leveraging the power of that platform to grow revenues? Charles Scharf : Yes, I guess first time you start just by broadening the topic a little bit which is just because I have spent a bunch of time going to the historical context not just of NEXEN but our entire technology investment. And I just think it's, I have mentioned this in my remarks we spend over $2 billion on technology. If you look at the resources that Bank of New York Mellon has dedicated to technology both core infrastructure as well as the different technologies that we are looking at towards the future that's been aided by the in-sourcing of a tremendous numbers of people meeting thousands of people over the past three or four years. Our net resources are up in the technology space and those resources are in multiple locations across the world with different sets of talents focusing on a whole range of things. So the focus on technology has been it's been deep and it's been broad at the company. So I hope what you took away from my remarks is that the focus that we all continue to have is to focus on both pieces and to continue to dedicate this outside the demand of our resources to the technology space. Specifically for the things that we described as NEXEN again in my prepared remarks I did go through the specific pieces, because I obviously just struggled talking very generically about NEXEN in its entirety. It\u2019s important is when you look at the individual pieces absolutely those are things that we are doing which will help us do a better job not just providing service for clients but it will enable us to move much more quickly in the marketplace, allow them to access additional capabilities that we are developing or third parties are developing in a way which it looks across the company at a common architectural solution. So it's kind of hard to look at that and say that that's anything other than something that makes sense. The work that we are continuing to do is the work that's been ongoing which is to consistently to build [indiscernible] and ask the question are we putting all the resources in the right place, are we prioritizing things and that's ongoing work that we will do. So again I put this in the category of directionally absolutely supportive of everything that's been done, absolutely we believe that technology has to be a differentiator as time goes forward and we will talk more about it again when we get together in March. Brian Bedell : Great. That's great color and then maybe just on your comments on improving operating performance. Banking has already been in the last three years scenario, the best achiever in terms of improving that performance from legacy banking [indiscernible] peers it's certainly an expense reduction. I guess I always have thought about how much there to go and I know Todd you have been fairly bullish on continued opportunity given that we had a lot of low hang fruit already so maybe you can talk about Charlie, you mentioned some more platform consolidation maybe you can talk about which platform and then continue the automation maybe just a little bit more color on your comments about investing you may or may not invest in more growth opportunities? Todd Gibbons : No I didn't question whether we are going to invest in growth opportunities. What my remarks meant to say is as we find more efficiencies in the company the question is whether we will take those additional efficiencies and invest them or not. So we are investing a tremendous amount in the business today. That's going to continue. What I was trying to point out there was as we figure out how to become more efficient overtime that creates additional capacity for us. So that just want to make sure we are clear about that. Listen I think when you look at the results that we have delivered over how much you have, I look back I guess going back to 2013 I don't know if it goes to back prior to that but the expense control that's taken place within the company is extraordinary in an environment where we are spending substantially more in technology, substantially more on regulatory requirements and kind of reasoning up the investments that have to take place to build the business. And so that's a lot of money that gets spent on those things and so yeah there has been a tremendous effort to reduce the things that don't make as much sense to free up capacity to spend money on those things. Having said that I think that I put it to maybe two different categories, number one is there is always more efficiencies that we had in any company even the most efficient companies lock in the next day and say okay how are we going to get more efficient at what we do separately from volumes growing and additional money to invest. So I think that's just even if were the best in class at everything that we did we would say that's what we would come in and strive as we go through our planning process and forecasting process to push ourselves. I did go through some specifics in my remarks which would suggest that I do think that there are still a series of things that will allow us to create more efficiencies that will then create decision point for us about whether to invest in additional things or to do some other things with that and it relates to just basic locking and tackling of reducing some of the process and bureaucracy and the layers that exist within companies like these and the more you do the more exposure you get to the next level of things. So I think it's a very natural progression from what's been done but you also mentioned something which really should be much more substantial which will take which is a multi-year project which is to figure out how we take \u2013 I want to say we have a tremendous amount of manual processes around the company. We have 52 or some odd thousands people I think we all believe that given the tools that are available today we can create more automation which will not just reduce the expense base that we can then figure out what to do with it but it will also improves the quality of our results. So part of the effort that we have got going on and we are going deep on is what does that multi-year effort look like what does it take for us to get from here to there over what period of time. It's not a one quarter one year exercise but it's something that we want to build into the long term plans and we know the opportunities are there, we just don't know the specifics yet. Brian Bedell : Very good. That's fantastic. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So I wanted to just dig in on two things, one Charlie you came from Visa global payments consumer but also have some corporate elements to it. You are here at BNY Mellon which has a part of the business is global payments, institutional investor, corporate governance. What are some of the similarities there that may have interested you in this and what are some of the opportunities on the payment side that you can speak to? Charles Scharf : Sure. So let's just start with the basics first which is when you look at our client base across the globe, huge part of the client base are common clients that someone like these would have so just as I walk in the door in terms of understanding who your client base is how they think about things, what the priorities are and just who the individuals are there is a high degree of commonality there. When we look at the opportunities that we have here we see a tremendous amount of flows both on the security side as well as on the cash side. Figuring out how you can do that as efficiently as you can and then continue to add value added services around it with both additional capabilities but also capabilities focused on data and analytics it's exactly the way these are things about its business. These honestly has a leg up because there is step ahead in terms of automation because that's just the way the business was originally built so we have got a lot of work to do here to put us in the position to be able to not just get those efficiencies but to create everything on a common platform in a way where it\u2019s digital where you can do something with it. So the things that we can do with that are very, very interesting and in here too there is a lot that we are starting to do with it whether it's in our collateral management business where we are using the information that we have to do a better job for clients they get elsewhere because of the things that we see in the marketplace and the work that we can do to help them reduce their funding cost and reduce their capital requirements but just the opportunities to think more broadly about it is pretty extensive. And payments honestly, I have actually spent less time on our payment franchise here than I have on our asset servicing businesses or corporate trust businesses, the market business etc. etc. So not, I just, I choose to defer that a little bit until the next quarter that's okay. Betsy Graseck : I get that. And just the follow-up is on how you think about the competition that you face from new entrants perspective in particular I am sure, the block chain to be -- alive and well and lots proof of concepts but no golden ticket yet. That said there is several POCs that are getting a lot of attention like the ASX platform done in Australia so wondered what your thoughts are on block chain as a threat versus block chain as a solution for that you could leverage? Charles Scharf : Yes, I think my point of view is the same as the company here has had which is block chain is very real. But like any new technology it has to solve a problem in order for it to make a meaningful difference. When I was at Visa people used to talk about all of those things that are going to do something to change the payment experience at the point of sale and there is all this talk about mobile and all these other things and everyone sits and wonders why mobile phones haven't dominated the payment space in the developed part of the world and the reality is because what exist today works. Same thing relative to the network infrastructure versus the block chain structure, it's effectively real time. There is real global inter-connectivity with the high degree of transparency where it's required so not that it won't have impact overtime but that's not where those solutions should initially go. There are other places where your processes they are highly inefficient or and there is very little lack of transparency or there is resiliency issues that these things can solve. So as we think about our business we do have a fair amount of work going on inside the company that focus on block chain specifically we actually have a solution built, which I am sure Brian and Todd talk about in more detail in our government security clearance business where we are really using it as we have built it as a treasury back up so that we would both understand the technology but also potentially be in the position to expose it to the fed as well as our clients at a point in time that we are comfortable with it but the idea is that distributor ledger would be available with all the relevant information for the relevant counter parties if we had issues elsewhere. So I think just on something like that though in order for us to actually move it from treasury into some kind of production environment forget about all the testing and all the things that you need to do to be comfortable to platform just have to believe that it's a better solution than what you have today and not just better for us but better for client. So as we look across the business that's the way we are thinking about it and our view is as I said it's real but all these solutions as you do as you know do need trusted counter parties that is what we do for living in addition to providing the technology that we provide and the only thing I would emphasis is that when you think about what we do in all of our businesses each little service we provide is not something that standalone which is very easily disaggregated. When we provide core custody with clients that gives us the opportunity to do a series of things which we call part of assets servicing but there are series of other services that we provide there. When you have the securities it puts you in a position to talk about collateral and cash and all those things and so the ability to show up as a firm with the reputation and the relationships like us and provide those solutions not that we have heading the sand, but those are \u2013 those integrated relationships mean a lot and again what we do is generally \u2013 it is mission critical for our clients. So it's not a light thing for them not just to switch between material providers but to think about going to something by a much smaller third-party who they don't really know stand behind us. Betsy Graseck : Okay now that's helpful color. Just last quick question on the expense ratio side. You are indicating lots of opportunity to improve efficiencies. Do you feel like the current pace that BK has been able to generate sustainable or you need to invest a little bit up front to get a much larger expense reduction in the future. What's your sense and cadence there? Charles Scharf : Again, I think we will stay away from any kind of forecasting and stuff like that until we finish going through the detailed plans and that's obviously something we will talk about. Betsy Graseck : Alright great. Hey thanks so much Charlie. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks good morning. Can I ask about the asset servicing business, it's nice to see the year-over-year growth rate up to 4% obviously helped by the newest 6% growth in the AAC and A but I am just wondering can you break up the components a little bit and just talk about how core servicing is growing versus collateral versus the broker-dealer and help us understand kind of those how three parts are trajecting underneath? Brian Shea : Yes it's Brian, happy to take it. I mean I think it's a combination of all those factors, we are getting some growth from the collateral management for sure. We are getting some core underline growth, we are getting some lists from the market and all those things are contributing to few revenue growth and we are also still pruning some businesses which is pushing revenue out where we don't think it's appropriate for example we are working through the final stages of the UK retail TA re-positioning which is otherwise lowering the few revenue growth but improving the operating margins and profitability. Charles Scharf : This is Charlie, the other thing I want to add is in my remarks I did talk \u2013 I did break out that our asset servicing revenues meaning our assets servicing revenue in the business grew 4% X clear which is 10%. Ken Usdin : I am talking about specifically the investor services. So when we go forward then to your point Brian about the bar \u2013 as the UK transfer agency is that that effect now past and can you also remind us when the J.P. Morgan brokerage revenue start \u2013 clearing revenue start to come in to that line. Brian Shea : Yes. So, the UK retail transfer is the process it is almost completed by the end of the year. It's actually completed and then the revenue run rate will stabilize and of course we are still committed to the institutional and global TA business in UK and Europe and so that a growing opportunity for us and we are actually getting new clients in that sense. From a broker-dealer clearing perspective we are \u2013 we have invested heavily in the tripartite report reform and technology and again we've re-platform our entire client base to a new state-of-the-art broker-dealer clearing platform and that positioned us well to bring on new clients. So we have begun the transitions of the former J.P. Morgan government clearing and tripartite reform clients. We have started with the smaller clients but we have already converted about seven of those clients so far this year and we have more to review this year and we will be completing those conversions throughout the course of 2018. In addition we've on-boarded some new entrance from the marketplace and we continue to add new clients. So we see the broker-dealer clearing and domestic and global collateral services business as a core growth driver over the next couple of years. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then just one quick one Todd you mentioned no need to do the preferred given the potential for SLR reform just wondering does that also mean that you won't do the contingent share repurchase at least in this C-cars you did mention obviously the ability to go do more in future C-cars but can you just kind of level set some what you are thinking about that and the potential for the reform? Todd Gibbons : Yes Ken I can \u2013 that is exactly the point. So that authorization was contingent on additional issuance. We didn't think it would make sense for us to issue and then actually not need that form of tier 1 capital a year from now. And just put us in a better position to do just pure buybacks next year and beyond. So that's our thinking there. Ken Usdin : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Thanks guys. Hey Todd just one on the balance sheet and capital, bit of growth on this quarter, heading on the non-interest-bearing side deposits were relatively steady. So just wanted to get a sense you guys are active on a buyback side capital ratios are fine. Just in terms of the balance sheet when you are seeing client demand it seems on the deposit side we could continue to see that roll off. But any demand out there that we could actually see the balance sheet grow or should we expect it to be in this range? Todd Gibbons : Yes I think it's kind of into -- it's all into, about a normalized range and we would see it grow as we see the businesses grow but probably in line and maybe a little less than in line with fee revenue growth, just for the balance sheet side itself. And one of the other things that we did is we did reduce some of our loan outstanding, some of those loans that were a little less productive than we wanted to and we actually will use that portion of the balance sheet to try to generate some more productive loan. So we do have a little bit of a \u2013 we certainly have room for growth and if the growth doesn't come we are going to have excess capital. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks and then a quick follow-up on [indiscernible] just wanted to get a sense on again the impact from asset management but then I guess probably more importantly just given that a lot of your clients are going to through that process are you seeing one much push back from like pricing and concessions has their businesses under more pressure I mean and then two, any services that you guys can offer to either help you manage some of these regulatory changes for the clients? Todd Gibbons : So Mike you are asking from a servicing perspective, so I think Brian would probably be best to handle it. Brian Shea : Sure. We have a whole cross enterprise team including investment services, investment management working on not only helping ourselves comply, but helping our clients comply with it too. I think depending on the asset manager there is no question that -- puts pressure not only the cost to compliance but some pressure on the business model in terms of the elimination of soft dollar commission-based research. So with that depending on the fund company that has more or less impact on their margins. I think, so that does put some pressure on the core fees and core cost structure for asset managers. I wouldn't say that we - there is always some pressure on the core and what we are trying to do is extend the solutions of creating the source of new revenue. A great example would be we have a growing pipeline of middle office solution clients and that's because asset managers is increasing lower their structural cost whereby is a cost structure and focus more of the time in energy and the investment process and to Charlie's point about NEXEN, the ability to have a platform that can easily integrate third-party solutions which help asset managers and other clients reduce the amount of time and energy investment they make on vendor management, data integration, vendor integration is also helpful in terms of helping them lower their structural cost and in connection with [MISIT] and other pressures that are secular trends in the asset manager model, that's what I would say and if [indiscernible] wants to add. Unidentified Company Speaker : Yes, for just our own asset management perspective well we clearly have to absorb research costs and that's a headwind we actually see it as an opportunity since we all are under the largest global financial institutions both from an asset management and servicing perspective it gives us an opportunity to do more proprietary research rather than rely on the street. So I see it actually as positive. It's the transaction side that I think, Brian is also referring to which is an issues. We have to have more transparency and I think that's an opportunity on the servicing side. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, I thoroughly heard your comments saying that you would like to have the company accelerate revenue growth and I guess it's a lot tougher than these are, maybe, the revenue opportunities overall more specifically any thoughts on change in the mix from the servicing fixed income assets since BNY Mellon has higher percentage of fixed income firstly. Second would be acquisition in on US? Todd Gibbons : Let me do the value, piece of the question. So on the first piece I mean the profile of the Visa businesses is it's versus what we do is it's different right I mean VISA is business where there is this continued secular movement from physical cash to electronic payments so you come in the morning and you got that to give you a tailwind as well as changes in GDP and many of you have got the question of what you doing to take your fair share not just from the other big competitors but all -- from all the other payment mechanisms that exist out here. In our business you know we don't have that material secular shift. We do partake in the change in GDP and change in market level across most of our businesses but ultimately you know the real differentiator has to be are you going to be continue to provide increasing value to your clients and so that's the focus here, that was the focus there just come in and sit in which is kind of watch the cash register ring it's coming everyday and ask the question of how can you do more that's better, and you know the differences are in terms of growth rates just are what they are. You know I did say in my remarks I think you know there is a -- let me start with we do have areas that have in I am not sure the right word is I use the word reasonable you can call it good, we don't call it great but it's not bad just in terms the revenue growth that we are seeing. Part of it's the market, part of it's the things that we are doing. I don't think I've been, put DR's aside for second because again I think that is there are material changes and things that drive that business better somewhere out of our control as you see into this quarter. Know the other businesses we believe there are things that we can continue to do to increase the rate of revenue growth but you know as well as I that you know not just this is a big company and it takes time to move a big company but the things that we do generally have longer lead times on it. They are longer at discussions. They can be RFPs. They can be things that you work on for a year or two or three or more. So again I think when we spend more time together in March I think it's time for layout where we see those opportunities and how they can look somewhat different than they've looked in the past but again I want to emphasize that we are not exactly starting from scratch here. We are starting from a fair amount of momentum. M&A I think first of all our, we come in every day and ask the question how do we grow this business and invest in what we do and so to the extent that there are things that add value to the core of the franchise those are things that we've always looked at, we will always continue to look at and right now that's the focus that we continue to have. And US, non-US the majority of the businesses US have spent a little time in Europe, I\u2019m going back, she is going back tonight and then through the Middle East and you know we have - I think we continue to have as big as an opportunity there as we have in any part of the world. We have got core global capabilities that are as good as anyone. We are very focused on using our structure that we are lucky enough to have were we have a meaningful presence in the UK and a meaningful presence on the continent to do the best job that we can and feeling as local as we possibly can and so as we look forward hopefully that will be something which we will talk more about. Did I answer everything Mike? Mike Mayo : Yes. That was good. Operator : And next question comes from the line of Geoff Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoff Elliott : Hello good morning. Thank you for taking the question. You touched on ETF as a shortcoming and I guess you said how you address that as a topic for another day but could you elaborate a little bit on how the -- from lack of a big ETF platform is kind of holding you back, where has that been a disadvantage for the business, which businesses in particular? Charles Scharf : Yes. So I guess let me just start and then Mitchell and Brian and Todd can pipe in. I mean I think at the point of the comment that I made was, just the fact of life which is we do not have a sizable ETF business. My comment was specifically around the flows that people see not around the proper profile of our business necessarily or anything else like that. So just when you look at our flows versus others you're not going to see the same kind of low growth that we see elsewhere and we do have the same issue in the asset servicing side where you know our competitor has a much more sizable business themselves but some other business that they have out there as well. So that is a fact of life that we have to deal with on the asset management side it's frankly I think it's more complex issue than it is on the asset servicing side because on the asset servicing side it's not as if we are not in the business. It's not as if we don't have to continue to build capabilities over period of time and that's kind of on us to do it. The asset management question is much more broader strategic question which is -- but so what. It's okay we are where we are we do remind everyone I think [indiscernible] in general not ETS but in passes but the question is what does that ultimately mean for your business, what's the future of the actives versus passives and we have a point of you on here that we had on that, that's also something I think we should talk in more detail about in March. Anything you guys want to - Todd Gibbons : No I think you covered it really well. The Vanguard Blackrock own that business so it's not like anybody else is getting into it in reality but we do service ETF's both on even from an asset management we supply some of the intellectual content to some of the ETF providers and in addition to that we are in smart beta, we are in indexing, we are in the other elements of assets that are also growing and that's what we will continue to do. Charles Scharf : And I will just add that while the ETF market is concentrated in a few top providers which drive most of the flow there are more providers coming in. They are not massive yet but we are focused on servicing them and we're trying to deliver enterprise solutions so it combines ETS servicing, the authorized participant services which we provide from markets. We have the purging no transaction fee ETF platform that's a differentiator in terms of asset guys. So we have a more sort of holistic solution strategy that we hope will create some momentum in the marketplace and then lastly I would say that will the ETF business in the U.S. is pretty well developed, in Europe and in Asia there's really good development opportunities over time and I think we are positioning ourselves to capture more of that going forward. Mike Mayo : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Todd you touched on the SLR issue not issuing the [indiscernible] because the changes that could be coming in and the benefits that Bank of New York would seek aside from better positioning you for maybe stock repurchase if the SLR calculations are changed are there any other strategies you would use to lower the SLR ratio whether that's a re-levering and the balance sheet whether the types of assets or something else? Todd Gibbons : Yes. If you look at our capital ratios and what our internal targets are and why they are internal targets are established to make sure they're adequate both for BAU and also through stress testing. They are pretty well-balanced. So anything that we would grow would have to - we would be happy to grow it if it will achieve our targeted returns on capital. Otherwise the best use of that capital if we can't achieve the targeted returns is to do buybacks or paid it out it in the form of dividends. So that's the discipline that we've applied and right my point here is that we are pretty balanced. There is no one ratio I mean the SLR would give us a little bit of relief in kind of BAU but there is no one real ratio that is becoming a major constraint, I kind of like how balanced we are across the capital stack. Gerard Cassidy : Very good and then a follow-up question on the [indiscernible] issue that will be coming to head here in January maybe this is for Mitchell, you talked about how you could build out your internal research proprietary research and reduce the cost of the research that you pay for from the street. I know technically the SEC rules don't allow us in the U.S. to sell research like it was going to be the case in Europe. Can you clear with us Mitchell any strategies you can implement out to get the leverage to lower your research costs from the US-based providers of US research? Brian Shea : Well, I think there is a couple I mean we are multi-boutique model but the more we coordinate some of our trading activities we could clearly drive down our costs of research. Secondly it's kind of an intriguing one to me because we are kind of lazy we take a lot of research from a lot of brokers sometimes up to 50 different ones and do we really need it where we are talking soft dollars because they were free. It's creating a just a much stronger discipline and as such a large asset manager with so much data available to us we really should be doing around. So in many respects I don't see it being a significant cost, but I genuinely believe it's an opportunity that data we have in this organization is unbelievable and we don't leverage it where we use the street instead. So I think it inverts things in actually a positive way for large asset managers. I think it's and that's the other thing smaller asset managers are going to pay the price. The large ones, the big ones have an opportunity here. So it again I think is going to concentrate opportunity in the top few asset managers. Gerard Cassidy : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instruction] We will take our final question from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, good morning. First question was on investment management you called out there outflows in the LDR businesses quarter but I think it was also in the fourth quarter that there was LDR outflows and there was a laid out so it's in-housing of the LDR is that an ongoing risk is it an increasing risk as rates are increasing? Brian Shea : No, we don't see it as a \u2013 it's Mitchell, we don't see it as risk. When you look at the average of outflows in the LDI business we do have one or two or maybe three extremely large LDI clients that actually naturally should take it in-house. They are just incredibly dominated. You are talking over 5 billion in assets. So it's not a trend that you're seeing it at all. If you look at our average w are averaging about 9 billion a quarter in positive flows that slightly better than 2016. It's better than 15 and then it\u2019s better than 14. So the trend has been actually quite consistent at 7-8-9 billion for the last few three years. We don't see that trend changing. We see \u2013 we still see significant opportunity. Todd Gibbons : And I should just point out that the kind of state the obvious which is the types of accounts that Michelle's referring to, whether big enough to take it in-house. The fee profile is very different than \u2013 Brian Shea : It's extremely low. Todd Gibbons : It's extremely low. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Great and then the second one is on the margin I mean this quarter, you had liability sensitive and you had three rating increases since the end of 16, we get the margins relatively flat I mean do you have \u2013 get that the margin expanding again from here either or on the liability side? Brian Shea : Yes. I am talking about the net interest margin. It has expanded a few basis points so over the course of the year we would expect it to continue to improve modestly. So the answer is yes. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. Valerie Haertel : I think that ends the session for today. If you have any questions please feel free to call me. (212) 635-8529. Thanks very much. Operator : And if there are any additional questions or comments you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at (212) 635-8529. Thank you.

Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie Haertel : Good morning, and welcome to the BNY Mellon Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, our CEO; Mike Santomassimo, our CFO; and members of our executive leadership team. Our fourth quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Charlie and Mike discuss our results, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC available on our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 18, 2018. We will not update forward-looking statements. Now I would like to turn the call over to Charlie. Charles Scharf : Thank you, Valerie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me cover a few items before turning it over to Mike, and then we will open it up for questions. As you can see, the quarter was impacted by two significant events, first, the new U.S. tax legislation added $0.41 per share this quarter; and second, a series of actions we took reduced earnings by $0.24 in the quarter. I'll talk more about this in a second. If you look beyond those items, our underlying results benefited from the strong equity markets, and we continued to show modest underlying growth in revenues and reasonable profit growth across the firm. I'll let Mike walk you through the detailed financial impact of the tax legislation and our other actions when he takes you through the financials, but I do want to make a few comments, first, regarding the new tax legislation. In addition to the favorable impact this quarter, we expect to see our effective tax rate go from approximately 25% to approximately 21% in 2018. We expect to reinvest the vast majority of the tax benefit in to our employees and our businesses in 2018. I will discuss this more later. In addition, we're hopeful that the increased competitiveness of corporations due to the lower effective tax rates and related investments those companies are making will result in a continued strong business environment both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., which should prove beneficial to us. I've already mentioned the $246 million or $0.24 in significant items impacting our net income. The biggest piece of this was severance, which is part of a broad-based effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness across the company. This includes the 2 significant actions we took since we last spoke, the senior management leadership changes and the changes in our U.S. asset management business. The leadership changes and organizational realignment are going very well. We've reduced layers, aligned more closely around our clients, created more business representation on our executive committee. I'm confident that these actions will enable us to serve our clients more effectively and holistically but this is a work in progress. We also consolidated our 3 largest asset management firms in the U.S., Mellon Capital Management, Standish Mellon Asset Management and The Boston Company, and announced the launch of a specialist multi-asset investment management firm with $560 billion of assets under management, which combines the best of these companies. This combined business will improve our positioning in the marketplace with our clients and the consulting community. Secondarily, the combination will enable us to drive efficiencies by consolidating non-investment functions such as trading and operations to continue the improvement in our margin over time. Aside from the tax impact and these significant items, our underlying business performance in 2017 reflected continued consistent and steady improvement, and most importantly, our client franchises continue to grow. On a segment basis, we have strong performance. Investment Management revenues grew 9%. This includes 12% in investment management fees and strong performance fees for the quarter. We were clearly beneficiaries from the strong equity markets, but we also saw some benefit from flows this quarter with net positive flows of $12 billion, including strong performance from our LDI strategy. On a full year basis, flows were up $64 billion compared to last year's outflows of $23 billion, marking a significant turnaround for this business. Our performance continues to improve across our active strategies with 87% of active assets under management above their 3-year benchmarks and 77% above their 5-year benchmarks for the fourth quarter. We ended the year with record assets under management of $1.9 trillion. Our full year adjusted pretax operating margin continue to improve, adjusting for the significant items. In order to maintain momentum, we will continue to develop client solutions in alternative and passive strategies to meet our clients' needs. Our wealth management business also performed well and also benefited from the strong markets and investments we made to grow our client-facing teams. To further our progress in wealth management, we will continue to grow our client-facing teams and continue to improve our technology platform to provide a better client interface and analytics, including mobile capabilities. Let me now move on to talk about Investment Services. The segment grew revenues 8%. This includes 5% growth in investment services fees. Asset servicing results were helped by the strong markets and new business, particularly in collateral management. As I've interacted with our clients, I continue to believe we have more opportunity to partner with our clients across the many services we offer. We had strong estimated new business wins this quarter of $575 billion in assets under custody administration. Clearing services got the benefit of rising interest rates through additional money market funds and, at the same time, grew long-term mutual fund balances by 16%, some of which was market-driven. Although we lost a couple of clients recently, the pipeline is strong. While our Depositary Receipts revenue was lower due to volumes and the timing of corporate actions, our offer remains competitive and we're continuing to win our fair share of new issues coming to the market. Consistent with last quarter, total revenues in our Corporate Trust business were up mid-single digits. We're continuing to invest in the business to regain our share and are seeing some green shoots to progress. Lastly, in treasury services, the fees are just part of the story. We're seeing steady, consistent growth in total revenues in the business, which includes both fees and net interest revenue, up low double digits this quarter. All in all, while it takes some work to parse through the quarter, we feel good about our underlying business results and remain very focused on driving longer-term franchise growth. As I've said on the third quarter call, we've undertaken a review of the company timed around the annual planning process with the goal of prioritizing opportunities to strengthen the firm. Some of the charges in our significant items this quarter are a result of that work but we expect there will be more in 2018. We are at the tail end of our review, and we'll provide an update at our March 8 Investor Day. We would expect to be in a position to provide more commentary around our growth opportunities then as well. As you've seen, we've had consistent revenue growth but aspire to increase the rate of growth over time while maintaining a consistent risk profile. When we meet in March, we intend to review how the parts of our company work together to provide a unique value to our clients, how we will use technology to drive our business forward, what we intend to do to continue our drive for efficiency as well as actions we will take to strengthen and streamline our infrastructure. I do want to remind you there are no silver bullets here when it comes to revenue growth, meaning any improvement in increasing the growth rate will take place over multiple years. We're focused on building our client franchise, supported by strong and innovative products, and our business is categorized by long sales cycles with relationships that last multiples longer. And I do want to reiterate an important comment I made last quarter, we like the businesses that we're in. Now over to Mike. Michael Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my prepared remarks, I would like to congratulate Todd Gibbons on his new role as CEO of Clearing, Markets and Client Management and thank him for all his hard work and accomplishments as CFO. I can attest that Todd is an aspiring leader, and I think all of us here at BNY Mellon agree the Clearing, Markets and Global Client Management business is in very capable hands. Turning to the quarter. It was a busy quarter on many fronts. In mid-December, we were pleased to receive a positive response to our Title I resolution plan submission from the FDIC and the Fed. The regulators acknowledged the important steps we have taken to enhance the firm's resolvability and facilitate our orderly resolution in bankruptcy. The agencies found no deficiencies or shortcomings in BNY Mellon's 2017 plan, which validates the enormous efforts we have made to enhance our resolvability. As we move forward, we will continue to maintain our focus on resolvability and resiliency. During the quarter, the macro environment continued to improve, and as expected, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 25 basis points, which slightly improved our fourth quarter net interest revenue. Additionally, the strong global equity market performance helped to drive a record quarter for AUC/A and AUM. Also, as you are aware, the tax legislation was passed in late December. The bill is complex and will take some time to fully implement. The amounts reflected in the earnings release represent our best estimates of the impact from the legislation to date. With that, let me run through the details of our fourth quarter results. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I note otherwise. Consistent with previous quarters, the impact from foreign currency translation had an essentially neutral impact on net income on a total company basis. Beginning on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per common share of $1.08. There were 2 significant items recorded in the quarter that impacted the results. First, we recorded a $427 million after-tax or $0.41 per common share gain related to the new U.S. tax legislation. And second, we also recorded a $246 million after-tax or $0.24 per share negative impact related to severance, litigation and asset impairment and the sale of certain securities in our investment portfolio, the majority of which will better position us for the future, as Charlie noted. Revenue of $3.7 billion was down 2%. This included a $320 million negative impact from the U.S. tax legislation and other charges, which decreased total revenue by 8%. In addition, each of our segments saw growth in revenue with investment management and performance fees increasing 13% and investment services fees up 5%. Expenses of $3 billion were up 14%. This included a $282 million pretax impact for severance, litigation and other charges, which increased expense by 11%. For full year 2017, we reported earnings of $3.9 billion or $3.72 per common share, up 18%. The results included revenues of $15.5 billion, which were up 2% and noninterest expenses of $11 billion, up 4%. The significant items in the quarter decreased revenue by 2% and increased expenses by 3% full year and earning -- and increased earnings per share by 5%. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we returned $900 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividend payments and $3.6 billion in full year 2017. Moving to Slide 5. We will discuss the impact of the new tax legislation. The table summarizes the financial impact. I'll start there. There was a $1.2 billion tax benefit to net income associated with the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at a lower statutory corporate tax rate of 21%. The net deferred tax liabilities were primarily associated with goodwill and intangible assets. The estimated repatriation tax on foreign earnings amounted to $723 million. The impact on our renewable energy investments was de minimis to net income as the pretax accounting resulted in a reduction of $279 million recorded in investment and other income, which was offset by the tax benefit from remeasurement of associated tax-deferred liabilities. The new tax legislation also reduced our regulatory capital by $551 million, driven by the repatriation tax offset by the tax benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities. Turning to how this will impact us going forward. As Charlie mentioned, we are hopeful that the new legislation will help stimulate economic activity, which had proved to be beneficial to us and our clients over time. Our effective tax rate for 2018 is expected to be approximately 21%. We do not expect the BEAT or the Base Erosion Anti-abuse Tax to have an impact in 2018. The impact beyond 2018 is uncertain, but based on what we know today, we expect it to be immaterial. We expect to repatriate a limited amount of cash from our non-U.S. entities due to the capital and liquidity requirements of those entities. And lastly, our capital distributions in the first half of 2018 will not be impacted. The remainder of the year's buybacks will be subject to the CCAR process. Turning to Slide 7. The consolidated fee and other revenue was $2.9 billion, down 3% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. The U.S. tax legislation and the losses related to the sale of certain investment securities reduced fee and other revenue by 11% year-over-year. Asset servicing fees increased 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher equity market values; net new business, including growth in collateral management; and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The sequential increase was primarily driven by net new business, securities lending, equity market values and money market fees. Clearing services fees increased 13% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primary reflects higher money market fees and growth in long-term mutual fund assets. Both periods also reflect the impact of termination fees due to lost business recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Issuer services fees decreased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower volumes, fewer corporate actions, lower fees due to reduction in shares outstanding in certain Depositary Receipt programs, primarily offset by higher Corporate Trust revenue. The 32% sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonality in Depositary Receipts revenue. Treasury services fees decreased 2% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher compensating balance credits provided to clients that reduce fee revenue and increase net interest revenue partially offset by higher payment volumes. Investment management and performance fees increased 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher equity market values, money market fees and performance fees. The year-over-year increase also reflects the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar principally against the British pound. On a constant-currency basis, investment management and performance fees increased 11% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Foreign exchange and other trading revenue increased 3% year-over-year and decreased 4% sequentially. FX revenue of $175 million was unchanged year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. Year-over-year, higher volumes were offset by lower volatility. The sequential increase was driven by higher volumes. Investment and other income decreased $278 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of U.S. tax legislation on our investments in renewable energy. As I mentioned, the net impact of U.S. tax legislation on our renewable energy investments was offset in the tax line. Now on Slide 8, Investment Management achieved record assets under management of $1.9 trillion, up 15% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher equity market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net inflows. We experienced total long-term active inflows of $17 billion, driven by $23 billion of flows into our liability-driven investment strategies due to high demand from clients and $2 billion of inflows into multi-asset and alternative investments. These inflows were offset by outflows of $6 billion from active equities and $2 billion from fixed income strategies. Additionally, we had $1 billion in outflows from index products. We experienced cash outflows of $4 billion in the quarter. If you recall, we had cash inflows in the first three quarters. And our U.S. money market funds, the largest segment of our cash business, have grown 22% for the full year 2017. Our wealth management business continued its positive trend with fees up 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Higher net new business, continued loan growth, which was 7% higher year-over-year, helped to drive performance this quarter. Investment Management's adjusted pretax operating margin was 31%. The significant items in the quarter impacted the margin by just over 300 basis points. Now turning to Slide 9. Investment Services achieved record assets under custody and/or administration of $33.3 trillion this quarter, up 11% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, reflecting higher market values. We estimate total new assets under custody and/or administration business wins were $575 billion in the fourth quarter. Average loan balances declined 15% year-over-year, driven by higher interest rates and increased 2% sequentially. Average deposits declined 4% year-over-year, mainly the result of actively managing our deposits lower to meet regulatory ratio requirements, and increased 3% sequentially. Lastly, average tri-party repo balances grew 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, mainly the result of organic growth from existing clients and the onboarding of new clients. Turning to net interest revenue on Slide 10. You will see that on a fully taxable equivalent basis, net interest revenue of 100 -- of $862 million was up 2% from the year-ago period and up 1% from the third quarter. This resulted in a NIM of 116 basis points. This quarter included $15 million negative impact of lease-related adjustments, including $4 million related to the new tax legislation. These items reduced the NIM by 2 basis points. As a reminder the fourth quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by $25 million of interest hedging activities and a $15 million premium amortization adjustment. The impact of these items in both quarters negatively impacted the growth in NIR by 7% or the NIR would have been up 9% if you adjusted for those items discussed. We experienced moderate noninterest-bearing deposit runoff in line with our expectations following the rate increase. Interest-bearing deposits increased sequentially. Turning to Slide 11, you will see that noninterest expense increased 14% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. This includes $282 million pretax for severance, litigation and other charges, which increased total expense by 11%. Let me highlight a few of the year-over-year changes in the table. The sequential increase in staff expense was primarily related to higher severance expense. The year-over-year change was also impacted by higher incentive compensation expenses, driven by stronger underlying performance. The increase in software and equipment and professional, legal and other purchase service expenses was primarily the result of an asset impairment in the quarter. Lastly, turning to our capital and liquidity ratios on Slide 12. Our capital ratios were modestly lower due to the impact of the new tax legislation. The fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio was 5.9%, which meets the 2018 regulatory requirement of 5% with a reasonable buffer. We also remained in full compliance with the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio requirements. Our LCR was 118% in the fourth quarter. Before turning to Q&A, in addition to Charlie's comments, there are a few things to factor in your models for 2018. We expect net interest revenue and the NIM to continue to benefit from higher rates and the small securities portfolio repositioning and that the benefit may be offset slightly by lower balances if noninterest-bearing deposits contract as expected. Net-net, NIR should continue to grow. The quarterly investment and other income line is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $60 million for 2018. In the first quarter, we expect to be at the higher end of the range due to the gain on the sale of our investment boutique, CenterSquare. Also, in the first quarter, I would like to remind you that staff expense will be impacted by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees that typically takes place, the impact of which should be similar to last year. And as I mentioned, we expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%. With that, Charlie wants to make a few more comments about 2018. Charles Scharf : Thanks, Mike. As we look forward to 2018, we think about our performance in 3 distinct pieces, first, any additional charges resulting from the review underway that I've spoken about; second, the impact of tax reform and the effect of investments we will make in our employees and businesses a result of the tax reform; and third, the core underlying franchise performance excluding these 2 items. While we aren't giving forecast or guidance, I thought it would be helpful to put some specificity around our thoughts for 2018 by talking about these items individually. First, regarding additional charges, as we finish our review of the businesses, we would expect to have additional charges during 2018. These can include severance, real estate, the impact of programs to bring more automation to our activities and other items. As of today, our expectation is that it would be something similar to the charges we reported in the fourth quarter, but this, of course, could change. Second, regarding the impact of tax reform, we are anticipating that the impact of the lower tax rate would be almost entirely offset by the actions we will take to reinvest this benefit in our employees and our businesses. I believe we've been prudent in how we've thought about our excess capital generation. We believe that the first call should be on building the appropriate capital base for the company; second should be on organically investing inside the company when those investments meet the appropriate hurdles; thirdly, acquisitions if they meet the same criteria; and lastly, return to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We think we have done this and have returned in excess of $9.8 billion to our shareholders over the last 3 years. We still intend to return substantial capital to our shareholders this year, subject to approval through the CCAR process, but we've thought how best to use this additional ongoing benefit from the change in tax law. We believe that we've got a responsibility to our employees to share the benefit as well as to invest as much as we intelligently can to build the company for the future so we can serve all of our clients, communities and shareholders for the long term. We believe these investments are the right thing to do and good for all. This includes increasing minimum wages for all employees to $15 per hour in the U.S. and other actions we're currently contemplating. In addition, we intend to meaningfully increase the amount we spend on technology. We know we're a bank and are proud of it, but we're different from other banks. 75% of our company is a technology-based processing business and 25% is investment management, where technology will continue to become a more important tool for success. Our technology will define our future, and we need to ensure we're investing to create the highest quality infrastructure and a platform which allows us to both drive significant efficiencies in the future as well as be agile enough to allow us to move quickly as we expand our product offerings. We are well into this journey and seek to accelerate the effort. The third item is how we think about our performance excluding these items and also excluding the significant items in 2017. As an illustration, if you were to use the revenue growth included in your models, which is roughly between 3.5% to 4%, and our expectation that all other non-technology expenses would grow at a very low rate, this would result in EPS growth of low to mid-double digits, which is consistent with our actual performance over the last few years. Now I know this is high level but we thought it would be helpful to give you some context. As I've said several times, we hope to answer all your questions on March 8, and we'll do the best job we can. But for now, we'd love to answer whatever questions you have, especially about this quarter. Valerie Haertel : Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Just a quick one here on comments initially on the tax benefit. I believe you said that your intention is to spend the 2018 benefit on investments and sharing with employees. So just wanted to tease out, does that mean that, once we get through the next 12 months, that there will be less pressure on investment and, therefore, more benefit from taxes? And then on top of that, maybe the payout rate begins to kick in from those investments and we should see improved returns. Is that the right way to think about this? Or am I reading too much into your comments, Charlie? Charles Scharf : Thanks, Brennan, for the question. I guess the way I would say it is the way we're thinking about it is -- I mean, this is -- it's clearly a step up in the level of technology spend that we have going on at the company. So when we get to 2019, we certainly wouldn't expect to see anything like this. We would expect to see just however we would normally manage our expenses, which hopefully would be very prudently, but nothing like this. I think relative to the benefits that we would get, I think, listen, there are obviously a couple of different reasons why we spend money in the world of technology. We do want to make sure that we've got the right kind of infrastructure, right risk resiliency, but, certainly, to build products and to create an environment here where we can continue to gain more efficiencies. So we'll try and spend more time on this on March 8 when we have more time together. But certainly, we do hope that post 2018, we would be able to start seeing some kind of benefits, whether it's on the revenue side or the expense side, because of the amount of money that we're investing. But at this point, hard to put a number on it. Brennan Hawken : Sure. That's fair. And not trying to front run your big day here in March, just was curious about that, whether or not that distinction was an important one, which sounds like it was. And then my follow-up, can you expand on the kind of competition for talent that you're seeing, which is compelling you to share the benefit with employees? And when you use that term sharing the benefit with employees, maybe can you expand on that a little bit? Are we talking about increases in bonus and incentive comp? Are we talking about base salary increases, which prove more durable? Just if you could frame that a little bit, that would be really helpful. Charles Scharf : Sure. Listen, I would put a lot less -- I mean, relative to the amount of money that we're spending and the emphasis on this comment, I'd put a lot less on that, quite frankly, than on the technology piece. We do think that we should look at what's fair and right amongst our employees given the changes that were made and, certainly, what some of the goals of it are. Moving minimum wage to $15, I mean, I'd love to sit here and tell you that we're leading this country to some place where it isn't but that's not the case. It's just others have done it. We're -- we'll do what it feels like the right thing to do. And so it feels like sharing that portion with our employees is the right thing to do relative to the tax law change. Again, in the big scheme of things relative to the impact of this, it's a small number, and there are other things that we're thinking of. But I would also put them in the context of thinking of other things relative to all of our compensation plan and all of our benefits that we have here. And so I wouldn't expect anything else that we would do from your standpoint to be material. But it might -- hopefully, if we do things, it'll be things that our employees here appreciate. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Just a little follow-up on the spending commentary and without running the risk of front running March 8. Could you talk at a high level of the money that you have earmarked? Is it technology and investments for expanding and improving your current mix of businesses? You mentioned things like alternatives and passive strategies earlier in asset management, but what I'm trying to get at is how much is current line of businesses. And is there anything in there for what we would just call white space businesses that BK is not in today? Charles Scharf : I want to say almost all of it, if not all of it, is for the existing businesses that we have here as opposed to businesses that we're not in. But I would think about it in several different categories. I think about it in terms of infrastructure, I think about in terms of cyber and I think about in terms of just technology development work to expand the product set that we have here or to electronify things that are done manually, and that can be both in operations functions or in businesses where we create electronic products. The focus that we have is on continuing to build the quality of the businesses that we have and build adjacencies where we have, and that's where the money is intended to go. Glenn Schorr : I think we've seen a lot of operating leverage and operating efficiency improvement over time. And a lot of these investments that companies in the industry have made, I think the big challenge has been getting discrete pricing on something new. It's a business where clients just take, take, take, and thank you very much. Within these investments, are there things that you think in the future you'll be able to price explicitly for? Charles Scharf : Well, you said a couple of different things in there, and so I'll make just a couple of comments, which is, first of all, as we look at our performance in terms of where we're going in 2018 -- I want to make sure that at least there's some degree of clarity on this comment, which is we still expect to see operating leverage improvements next year even with this additional technology spend. Now obviously, it will be less than it otherwise would have been because it's a meaningful number. But when we think about the dynamics of our business and what we're shooting for, that's not something that we're just putting on hold and saying we'll revisit that in 2019. That is very much still part of our core thinking. And quite frankly, as we see the revenue environment pan out through 2018, we still have levers to pull. So when we talk about the way we're thinking about spending, you and I both know that you don't make these commitments on, what is today, January 18 and put yourself in a position not to be able to do something about it. So that's something which is still very much part of the psyche of the way we think about the company. And I know you've asked something else beyond that but... Glenn Schorr : No, no, I definitely hear you loud and clear. Revenue should outgrow expenses, and that'll be good for margins. The tagalong question was, of the things that you're investing in, do you believe some of them will get explicit pricing as opposed to the bundled relationship that you have with these complex clients? Charles Scharf : Yes. I'll deal with 30,000 feet. And then maybe -- Mike and Todd are here and may want to chime in a little bit. I think -- listen, I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, I think, when we think about expanding the product set that we have, whether it's improving or building adjacencies, sometimes the things that you do support the price you have in the marketplace and make you competitive when you're sitting in front of a client. Other times, they insert you into a market that you're not necessarily in. And still, there are third times when there are things that you can charge for because clients directly see the benefit of something and are willing to pay for it, and we've got examples of each. And Mike and Todd, you guys might want to talk about it a little bit. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Glenn, it's Mike. And while it's still pretty small in the scheme of the overall revenue base, we are seeing examples in some of the products, like collateral management, where we have been investing in more sort of innovative adjacent products to help clients optimize their collateral across the globe, and we have been able to expressly charge for that product. So I think, as Charlie said, I think it would be a mix where part of it is making sure we stay competitive to keep growing and service the clients we've got and then part of it will be things that we can expressly charge for. And we're seeing some real examples of that now. Anything to add, Todd? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. I'd add a couple of things. I think it's actually pretty exciting, some of the opportunities we're seeing. Mike alluded to one in collateral management. We're also building out in our tri-party operations an automated rules engine so that the buy side or the sell side for that matter could more easily change margins on collateral, and therefore, we think that will enable them to do more with us. So I think it'll help the growth and not necessarily change the pricing. We're also looking into making things smoother and connecting our multiple -- our domestic and our global collaterals so clients can easily and seamlessly move collateral around the globe. That would be a unique capability that we can offer, and we think that should build greater adoption. We're investing in things like enhanced FX trading platforms. We should -- we're already seeing some benefits of improved volumes there. We're investing in real-time payments. There's quite a few choices that we have. I think the challenge is we got to pick the right ones. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Just another follow-up around the spending and kind of, Charlie, to your commentary around low to mid-single-digit EPS growth. And I guess the 2 questions are, a, in terms of expense flexibility, if the environment gets a little bit tougher -- obviously, we've enjoyed really nice equity market backdrop last year and continuing this year, but if things were to get a little bit tougher, how should we think about the ability to scale back on some of the initiatives or cut back on kind of the core expense base to still deliver positive operating leverage next year? That's part one. And then part two, I guess, with EPS growth commentary, this is more clarification, should we be thinking about 2017 really kind of as the core number ex all the charges, as the base to layer on sort of the low to mid-single digit -- sorry, low to mid -- double-digit EPS growth? Charles Scharf : So a couple of things. So on the first piece, as I said a little bit earlier, I mean, there is -- we don't, as I -- we don't make budget decisions, planning decisions and then tell everyone just, \"You're done and go off and do it, and we'll see you next December when we're planning 2019.\" We have a high degree of flexibility with a significant portion, certainly, of our technology spend. I personally would like to do as much as we possibly can. If we didn't want to do it, we wouldn't be doing it, meaning we're not just sitting here saying, \"Okay, there's this big tax benefit coming through so let's go figure out how we can go spend it.\" In some respects, they're related; in some respects, they're totally independent, right, which is we've been -- you all know we've been going through this review thinking very much about what we think we need to do for the future, and we came to the determination that we think we can intelligently spend this amount of money. But as I said, there are -- it's not one big spend. There are hundreds of discrete things that are embedded in there that we could decide to delay or go forward with in the time frame that we're planning for. So -- and then relative to the rest of the expense base, as I said in the comments, I think we're going to continue to be very, very prudent about watching everything else that we spend. And if pushed, there's probably more that we could do there as well, but that's something that we really need to think through. So as I said earlier, I think this business, run properly, creates operating leverage. That's something that we continue to believe is important. It's important for you all, but it's important for us to be able to remain relevant in terms of how we price and how we deliver our products and services. So as we look through 2018, it's very much like you're sitting in the cockpit of an airplane and we're ready to pull different levers. The way I described how 2018 could pan out is what we would like to do based upon what we know now, but we're very much willing to rethink it if circumstances warrant it. But again, it's what we think is prudent right now. And the second part of the question about how to think about the base, I think you captured it right, which is it's 2017 adjusted for tax and adjusted for the significant items that we spoke about. And I just want to mention one other thing real quick just as we think about 2018 because, again, we haven't thought about these things in a vacuum. One of the things that's -- I mean, which I just feel very good about the operating model that we have is, even if you exclude the tax benefit that we have for next year and when we think about, again, the -- 2018 the way it was laid out, our ability to spend this additional amount of money in technology. And if you work through the math, the effect on -- the effect of tax is something like 4 points or so on the EPS growth rate. So the ability to still get close to a double-digit EPS growth with this kind of step up in the technology spend says an awful lot about the model and the company. And then beyond that, as I said before, our anticipation is we go back to a more normalized increase year-over-year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just to circle back on the expense growth just to make sure I understand this. So just looking at sort of the tax benefit, I guess it would imply, when you do the math here, a little over $250 million of additional reinvestment spend. And if we think about how that -- so I guess, first of all, is that around what you're thinking? And then would that imply more like mid-single-digit expense growth from your core 2017 base? Or are the efficiency gains that you've achieved through your 4Q '17 actions of reducing the layers of management, improving the asset management with the consolidation and other things, creating more like a low single-digit type of core expense growth in 2018 like you've been sort of -- you've been running at? Charles Scharf : Yes. So a little bit definitional here. I mean, meaning year-over-year, we might have had some technology increase anyway. But the way we think about it is, again, you can think -- the minimum wage increase is not a big number in the context of this. Your calculation on going from 25% to 21% is a little less than $250 million or so. And so that's a good way to think about it in terms of range, the way we're thinking about the increase in technology spend. And away from that, we would assume that there is very, very little other expense growth as of now. Brian Bedell : Okay, that's helpful. And just to clarify, the additional spend is -- does not include severance that you talked about for 2018, and you framed that well. The additional tech spend is outside of that -- or of the additional spend, reinvestment is outside of the severance charges for 2018. Is that correct? Charles Scharf : Yes. Brian Bedell : Yes, okay. Great. And then just, I guess, longer -- maybe bigger picture, as you invest in the business -- and I know we'll get a lot more clarity on Investor Day, but how are you thinking about this in terms of positioning versus your trust bank peers? Obviously, they're going through spend programs. Do you think this will sort of ignite additional spending at your peers so that you will sort of be in line? Or do you see yourself actually improving your capabilities versus peers and potentially grabbing market share over time? Charles Scharf : Yes. Listen, I have no way of knowing what peers will do and what they're currently doing other than what we all read about. I would say and I think this is a -- as we've been thinking about Investor Day, one of the things that we hope to spend a fair amount of time on is to talk about the uniqueness of the Bank of New York Mellon franchise. And the -- meaning, we're not just -- I mean the word trust bank, it's like the word boutique. It's just they're kind of funny words given the size and the scope and the breadth of what we do. We do some things that some of our competitors do, and we do it well and they do it well. But we also have some things that are very unique to what we are and to the kind of conversation that we can have when we sit across the table from clients. And so one of the things which is high in our list to talk through in detail on March 8 is exactly how we think we're differentiated versus the other people that you often think of as our competitors. So more to come on that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : It makes a ton of sense to reinvest in technology, so I applaud what you're doing on that. Question on the capital return piece of this. I'm wondering if you're thinking about keeping the dividend payout ratio in line with what your earnings trajectory is likely to be. Or would you be keeping -- would you be looking to keep more to the divi where it is today and reinvest that as well? Michael Santomassimo : Betsy, it's Mike. Obviously, as you know, we need to work through the whole CCAR process to sort of get that all approved and worked through. I think the only thing I would say is there's no need to sort of stay within sort of 100% payout as we look forward that we're aware of. And so I think we're sort of thinking through that now as we go through the CCAR process. Charles Scharf : So let me just make sure -- I've tried to cover this in my remarks a little bit, which is we've given a tremendous amount back through dividends and buybacks. And so as we think about what the future looks like, that hasn't changed. And so relative to the core incremental capital generation here, we would assume that through dividends and buybacks, you would continue to see the same types of trends that you've seen in the past, subject to CCAR. So that hopefully does mean increasing dividends and whatever the difference is in terms of buybacks. So when we talk about the increment -- the capital needed for the incremental spend, the way we're thinking about it now, this is it. Betsy Graseck : Okay. You're talking about the tax, the benefit of the tax, using that. That's what you need for the incremental spend. You don't have to touch the capital return piece. Charles Scharf : Correct, correct. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : Just some clarifications. What is your annual technology budget? Michael Santomassimo : I think, Mike, this is Mike. What we said last quarter was we spend a little over $2 billion a year on technology. So that's the disclosure we've given. Michael Mayo : And so you'll be spending an extra $250 million this year in terms of reinvesting the tax benefits. So should we think of that as 10% of... Michael Santomassimo : Fairly close, I guess. Yes. Michael Mayo : Okay. I guess the $250 million would be more of the investment spend. Or how should we think of that? Michael Santomassimo : Sorry, say it again, Mike. Michael Mayo : How should we think of the $250 million extra technology investment relative to that $2 billion base? Because it might not be apples to apples in that comparison. Michael Santomassimo : Well, I think, I mean, I think, of the $2 billion, that includes all the centralized spend plus our estimate of all kind of decentralized spend that takes place in -- within the company. And so I mean, I would expect -- the way we'd think about is that it's a little less than $250 million, but that would be additions to the infrastructure spend, the cyber spend and the core development spend that we have at the company. So I'm not sure if I'm answering your question, so tell me if I'm not. Michael Mayo : No, it sounds like you're investing in a wide range of areas, as you said. You said 100 discrete projects. So that's helpful. Mike, main question is just the combination of the three largest asset managers. I think you said Mellon Capital, Standish and Boston Company. So I'm not sure we've heard much about that. What will be the name of the new combined entity? And what's the structure of the new entity? Anything else you can elaborate on? Charles Scharf : So Mitchell's here. Why don't... Mitchell Harris : Mike, in terms of the name, we'll make that decision toward the end of the year after the consolidation is completed. In terms of what we're doing, I mean, we're clearly consolidating the trading activities, the back office and -- all the various back-office activities. So that's operational, technology, support functions in compliance and HR and finance. All of those activities are being combined into one. The firm has some great products across its platform. Mellon Cap is distinguished through a lot of its passive activities. You have The Boston Company in equities. And they complement each other. The thing we are probably under-invested in has been in the multi-asset where clients are going. This gives us a much easier platform to develop more multi-asset and solution type products. So the end game would be that we would keep the best of breed in equity fixed income and passive and develop the multi-asset capabilities along with that. Charles Scharf : And the only thing that I would add, Mike, is just a couple of things, which is, first of all, on brand. You might sit here and say, \"Well, why haven't you chosen a brand?\" We've got -- if you look across the company here, we've got lots of things going on with brands, and so the work to consolidate these 3 entities does take quite a bit of time. And so what we've said is let's try and be really smart, do some real work to try and figure out what makes the most sense for the long term for the brand as opposed to just pick something which feels good in the moment. And my own comment just on this, because Mitchell was obviously well underway with this before I got here, is it just -- I mean this makes all the sense in the world. We have 3 entities that are relatively subscale who we think we can drive significant benefits by creating more scale both internally in terms of the things that we spoke about, the efficiencies in the back office and the trading operations and things like that, but also how we present ourselves to clients in the consulting community. So we do have a year of consolidation work to do, which is never easy in these businesses. But for the long term, just -- to me, it makes all the sense in the world. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Just a couple of more clarifications. On this tech spend that you all talked about, somewhere in the $200 million to $250 million extra in 2018, is that the amount that will be the annual amortization of the tech spend so that will continue at that rate? Or is it just all being expensed in '18 and we are done with that? Can you give a little more clarity on how to think about it? Because your software and equipment line jumped up quite a bit this quarter, and Mike, is that the new run rate? Charles Scharf : Go ahead, Mike. Michael Santomassimo : I'll start with the last piece, Vivek. The software and equipment line jumped up as a result of the charges we took, with an asset impairment there. So don't think of the fourth quarter number as the new run rate for that line. Charles Scharf : But on the technology... Vivek Juneja : So how much was it -- go ahead, Charlie, sorry. Charles Scharf : No, go ahead. Michael Santomassimo : How much -- I'm sorry, what... Vivek Juneja : Mike, my question was, of that $297 million, how much is asset impairment just so we can think about more correctly looking forward? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I mean, we haven't disclosed the exact number, Vivek. But it'll be a little bit higher -- as we go into Q1, it should be -- it'll be a little bit higher than what we saw in Q3. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Sorry, Charlie. Charles Scharf : And on the first part of your question, again, we would -- the $250 million, that is -- assume that's P&L and assume that's, at this point, a way to think of ongoing P&L as well. Vivek Juneja : Okay, very helpful. Shifting gears slightly. Issuer services, that line was down $90 million this quarter, linked quarter, a little bit more than is expected. Even the uptick in Q3 was less than -- are you continuing to lose share? Any more color on that business? What's your plan for that business, Charlie, as you're looking at all of this? Michael Santomassimo : Vivek, I'll start. It's Mike. I think the linked -- the primary driver of the linked-quarter decline, as you probably know, is the seasonality that we see in the third quarter. I think the volumes that we saw in sort of the core issuance, cancellation, cross-border settlement area was a little bit lower than we expected, and that really drove the further decline. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And so given that, what's your thinking on the business just given that you're losing share? Is that just price competition still continuing? Or maybe, Charlie, from your perspective, as you're relooking at all of this, what's your thinking at the moment? Charles Scharf : Yes. Again, so issuer services is two different businesses. Vivek Juneja : Yes. And I guess I should clarify, DR really. Charles Scharf : Yes. Listen, these guys know it better than I. We're spending -- I'm spending more time on it. When we were sitting here last quarter, there were some very, very large specific transactions that we did not win that we were all very knowledgeable about and, quite frankly, we're fine not winning, either because of price or because of terms. As we sit and look at the business levels this quarter, it doesn't look like we've lost anything significant. It looks like we maintained share in the business. It was a question of business activity. Hopefully that helps. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Charlie, you talked a little bit about CCAR and how you guys are planning on still returning a lot and that 100% shouldn't be limitation. But in your prepared remarks, you categorized acquisitions ahead of returning dividends and share -- and buybacks, and I just want to make sure that you -- how you're talking about that. Is that in an increment perspective or just in terms of the prioritization of M&A versus incremental buybacks? Just how you're thinking about the push and pull there. Charles Scharf : Listen, that's a great question, and I probably wasn't as clear as I could have or should have been. When we think about how we invest inside the company and how we invest outside of the company and just -- I've been critical of things here and I've been supportive of things. I would say we have a very strong analytical framework for how we think about how and where we're investing. And when -- so when I talked about -- I forgot a word I used. I used the word -- when we look at the different criteria that we look at for these things and I talked about hurdles, I mean, we're clearly making a decision whether we're investing inside the company, whether investing on acquisition or we're buying our stock back. Those are all investment decisions, and we look at what all of those things return on behalf of the shareholder over the long term. And so the way I laid it out, we would -- we're here to build the company for the future. We think there's tremendous opportunity so we would love to spend -- to build if it has the right returns, but those returns have to be better than returning it to you and what you could do with that. So returning to shareholders is part of the criteria that we will continue to use to evaluate that option versus doing other things with the capital. Kenneth Usdin : Okay, got it. And if I could ask then a second question on just organic wins and losses. And kind of I'll just put it in one question but there's two pieces. One is just can you characterize the $575 billion of core asset servicing wins and where they're coming from? And then in clearing, can you talk about that termination fee and either -- help us size it and what the go-forward effect is of losing that client or clients? Thomas Gibbons : Sure, Ken. This is Todd. I'll take that. We had 3 very significant wins in the quarter, some of the big players. So we do feel some -- now it's particularly in asset servicing. So we see some pretty good momentum there and some continued pipeline, but I think it was a little bit episodic. And your second question was around the termination fees in the clearing business, and that did have a positive impact. Probably it was about 4% of the year-over-year growth. And we've probably called this out in the past. But I looked over the last 10 years. Over the last 10 years, we only have -- of our 10 largest customers, only 2 of them are with us 10 years ago. So there's constant change in here, as you would expect, with consolidations and other things. And during the quarter, we also won some very nice business in the clearing business, so I'm still feeling pretty good about it. Charles Scharf : The sizable wins, they are episodic in nature. And so as we look at what was won in the asset servicing business, these are things that people are working on here for a long time, hopefully get implemented within 2018 and we can do the work on the things that go beyond that. In clearing, I think we've talked about this. We have -- we've won and lost from some of the consolidation that's taken place in the industry over the past bunch of years. There were couple that we have lost. But we feel very good about what, I would say, as we get towards the end of 2018, 2019 looks like based upon other wins that we've had and how long it takes to implement some of these things. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : I just want to do -- get some clarification around your positive operating leverage comments for 2018. I mean, you said that was post -- or includes the tech investment spend, but are you including all targets in that? Because I mean the way we're looking at it, expense base could be going up by 5%, if you include those additional charges, including the reinvestment of the taxes. So are you saying that expenses may be going up by 5% and you're still expecting positive operating leverage? Charles Scharf : I'm excluding the significant charges that we had in 2017 and whatever we could have in 2018 when I say that. Brian Kleinhanzl : And that excludes the reinvestment or just the additional charges? Charles Scharf : That includes the full incremental technology spend and what we expect the growth to be in the rest of our expense base. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then you said you want to increase the market share in the Corporate Trust business. Can you just give us a sense of how you're viewing or what -- how you look at where the market share is today? Where was it previously? And where do you think it can go to? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I mean, Brian, as you can imagine, like getting exact numbers on market share -- this is Mike, by the way. Getting exact numbers on market share and some of the subcomponents on -- in Corporate Trust is pretty difficult. But when you look at the structured product market like CLOs, we saw a big decline in market share over the last 3, 4, maybe 5 years, probably down 30% or 40% over that time period. And so we're very focused on making the investments we need to sort of regain some of that share in some of those particular products. Having said that, there are parts of the Corporate Trust business where our market share has been stable or growing over that time period as well. So this is really a focused effort on some particular product sets in that business. Charles Scharf : So just on that for a second -- and Todd's sitting here. Todd has been very, very direct about what we've done and not done in Corporate Trust in our conversations over the past bunch of years. And I think we have a -- Corporate Trust is an important and a strong part of our business. We went through a process here several years ago where we thought about whether it belonged here or not. We -- after going through a process and thinking it through, the conclusion was made that it does belong here, it's an important part of the future, and we suffered from that. We suffered from that in the marketplace. And even internally -- again, this is -- Todd, I'm echoing what you've said, is, we moved very, very quickly to reestablish ourselves in the business and we lost salespeople. We didn't necessarily invest in all the places we should have, and that's what resulted in the decrease in share. When we sit here today, when we think about some of the things that we've got to do, we've got new leadership in there, Frank La Salla, who is laser-focused on doing the things that are necessary, which include hiring back salespeople, building out the appropriate product structure and ensuring that we do everything we can to our -- with our Corporate Trust business to leverage all the relationships that we have with those people that make the decisions on who the trustee is going to be. So it's very much part of the investments that we're making and what we've talked to you about, and it's very much part of the talk track we have with Todd's GCM organization. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Sean Kelman [ph] on for Mike. How should we think about the impact of the renewable energy credits going forward now that tax reform is completed? Charles Scharf : Todd, you want to handle that? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. So right now, we will still get the benefit of those renewable credits. So if you think through our tax rate, we effectively expect to be at the statutory rate of 21%. But remember, we're paying still the state and local taxes as well, so it would have been higher if it wasn't for the benefit of things like the renewables. We do invest in the bank on life insurance, and we also have some tax exempts on -- in there as well. So the combination is what's holding it down. So there was a little bit of restructuring in the value of those, which run through the asset investment and other income, and so the negative drag on investment and other income is going to be slightly less than it otherwise would have been. But the net benefit is still there's still credits, and we still are going to get the benefit of those credits. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : When you're thinking about these tech investments, what sort of back is acceptable? How far out are you willing to look? Charles Scharf : What sort of what, I'm sorry? Michael Santomassimo : Payback. Geoffrey Elliott : So you make an investment upfront, and then it generates revenues in future years. I'm just trying to understand, do you expect to get a positive earn-back over a certain number of years on these? Charles Scharf : Yes. Listen, I mean, there's no easy answer to the question. It depends on the type of investment that we're making. I mean, we are increasing our cyber spend in these numbers by over 50%. Honestly, we don't spend a lot of time talking about the payback in those terms. We talk about what we can do to strengthen the walls around the company and the monitoring and protection process inside the company. We're spending a tremendous amount more on infrastructure, a great deal of which provides us with a platform to create more efficiencies and to create a different kind of product set than we have today. And so when it comes to an infrastructure spend, very, very hard to put specifics around that. When it comes to product development spend, there are 2. I think it becomes -- it's very different in terms of what we're willing to accept in terms of payback relative to the strategic nature of what the investment is. Maybe we'll think a little bit about whether we could put a little bit more clarity around that when we get to March 8 for you. Geoffrey Elliott : And then just a quick follow-up to clarify. On the low to mid-double-digit EPS growth, is -- you're talking about the base for that being the $3.72 GAAP full year 2017 EPS? Or is it something else? I'm just getting a bit confused on all the discussions about charges and what's in and what's out. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. We said before, think about it as the GAAP number adjusted for the fourth quarter impact of tax and the other significant items that we disclosed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Steven Duong : This is Steven Duong in for Gerard. Just two questions. First, on the regulatory front. With regulation continuing to loosen up, what regulation are you guys most focused on for regulators to review? And then on the second question, just more on the HR front. How competitive is it in attracting tech talent? And is there a region or area that you guys are focused on in attracting those talents? Charles Scharf : Sure. Listen, I think, on the first, I think if you went around and asked people in this room, you might get nuanced answers. My point of view is really focused on CCAR. CCAR is a -- it's a huge effort inside the company. I'm sure you've heard this. It is not particularly transparent. And there is -- and it's obviously just extraordinarily important relative to its outcomes for how we run the business and what we do with capital, which is, obviously, a hugely important responsibility you have as a management team. So I think as we think about what could get done, I think there has just been very positive commentary about taking -- keeping the good pieces of CCAR and continuing to focus on how it can be made into a better tool both for regulators, for the beneficiaries, ultimately who's -- our customers and their customers and for us as well. The second question was? Michael Santomassimo : Tech talent. Steven Duong : Technology... Charles Scharf : Yes. Listen, I think, one of the things that we -- one of the benefits I think that we have when it comes to technology is we're not dedicated in any one specific part of the country or part of the world. We have technology resources in Pittsburgh, in New York, in India, in different parts of Europe. And I think the -- I had to say this. It's -- I don't feel like the war on talent in technology is something, at this point, which is holding us back. I think it's there. I think it's real. But I think the more interesting things that we do as a company and the more people in that space understand how what they're doing impacts what we can do as a company, we become an even more important place to work. When you look at our turnover, not excessively high in any way, shape or form, so I feel okay about where we are there. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Just one other clarification. I guess, if you could just talk very briefly about your market assumptions for your low to mid-double-digit EPS growth in 2018 just in general, if it's improving -- continued rise in equity markets and the amount of Fed hikes that are factored into, say, the future's curve, and then whether -- on a GAAP basis, so from that $3.72 basis, including the charges that you talked about for 2018, which sounds like about $0.25, whether you'd still have GAAP EPS growth in 2018. Charles Scharf : Yes. So on the first point, just a point of clarification. We're not assuming is using your estimates for revenue growth, when you look at the analyst estimates for revenue growth. We haven't told you what we think revenue growth will exactly be or what our embedded assumptions are within that. But I would say just, if you were to characterize it, it's a continuing relatively strong business environment for the places where we operate, not worse, not substantially better from today, but looking very much like where we are. That's the way we're just internally thinking about it. The second... Brian Bedell : And then just on the GAAP EPS for 2018. Michael Santomassimo : Sorry, Brian, you were breaking up there. What was the second part of your question? Brian Bedell : Just on a GAAP basis, yes. The second part was with $3.72 of GAAP EPS in 2017, it sounds like there'll be another $0.25 of charges based on how you outlined the charges for 2018. So would we still have -- on a GAAP basis, do we still have positive EPS growth in 2018? Just to tie that with the adjusted EPS growth. Michael Santomassimo : Brian, the way I would look at that is -- what Charlie explained is it's not $3.72 because that includes both the tax benefit as well as the significant charges that we called out. So if you take that combination, that's, I believe, about $0.17. That's what you have to start with for those numbers to play themselves out. You'll be able to work through all that information. We don't need to triangulate it with more. Valerie Haertel : Okay. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate you joining the call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to call Investor Relations. Thank you so much. Operator : If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529.

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie Haertel : Good morning, and welcome to the BNY Mellon first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, BNY Mellon's Chairman and CEO; and Mike Santomassimo, BNY Mellon's CFO. The earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our first quarter results and can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Please not our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in our earnings release, the financial highlights presentation and our documents filed with the SEC which are available on our website bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 19, 2018. And we will not update forward-looking statements. Before I turn the call over to Charlie and Mike, I would like to highlight a few changes to our earnings materials. Beginning this quarter, we are presenting total revenue for each of our primary lines of business within our two business segments. The change in presentation table on page 13 of the earnings release summarizes the primary product and services and types of revenue generated in each line of business. Within in investment services the lines of business include Asset Servicing, Pershing, Issuer Services, Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management. Within investment management the lines of business includes Asset Management and Wealth Management. In addition the reporting of the following expenses has been changed. First, the M&I litigation and restructuring charges are no longer separately disclosed on the income statement. Expenses previously reported in this line have been reclassified to existing expense categories, primarily other expense. Second, clearing expense previously included in other expense has been reclassified to sub-custodian expense and renamed sub-custodian and clearing expense. Additionally the adjusted pre-tax operating margin non-GAAP measure for the Investment Management business no longer excludes amortization of intangible assets and provision to the credit losses. Please note that the prior periods to the expense reporting changes and the Investment Management pre-tax operating margin calculations have been reclassified to be on a comparable basis. These changes, our previous reporting views and financial trends can be found in our financial supplement. We believe that the updated presentation provides a more complete picture of our financial performance and will enable you to view revenue on the basis consistent with management. All of our earnings documents are complementary and we recommend be viewed together. With that, I will now turn the call over to Charles. Charles Scharf : Thank you, Valerie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I've got a few comments I'll make, I'll try and keep in brief since we covered a great deal of ground at our Investor Day recently. I'll then turn it over to Mike, who we'll take about the changes we've made to our reporting to provide more inside into our business performance, run through our first quarter financials and then we'll open it for questions. First of all, we reported earnings per share of $1.10, up 33% from last year's first quarter. Revenue grew 9%, helped 2 points by a weaker dollar and expenses grew 4%, 3 points of which were due to the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Pre-tax income increased 20% and after tax income increased 29%. Strong equity markets, higher interest rates and lower tax rate all helped drive our strong results for this quarter. The major global equity market indices were up significantly versus the first quarter of 2017, helping drive higher AUCA and AUMs. The return of volumes and volatility was also positive for us this quarter and we saw benefits in Pershing and FX, in fact Pershing matched their highest U.S. daily trade volume ever on February 6. As our results show this quarter, benefiting from the market is an important part of our business model, but we also discussed at our Investor day that we look beyond the markets and focused on driving our underlying franchise growth. And while it's early, we do see it progress. Specifically, we saw growth in parts of the franchise including deposit balances, FX trading, tri-party repo activity, collateral management activity, increased securities lending activity and stronger demand for liquidity services. In asset servicing, we onboarded new business from a key global investment manager and expanded our relationships with several sovereign wealth clients, which have added significantly to our assets under custody in the Asia-Pacific region during the quarter. And as we discussed at Investor Day, we continue to invest in our markets capabilities in the form of people, technology and ultimately additional capabilities. While early days, we see signs that our investments are just beginning to pay-off. I mentioned that we saw increased activity in FX, and we believe that the investments we have been making are allowing us to see increased volume from existing clients and are beginning to attract new clients. Within the collateral management space, we continue to expand capabilities. In the first quarter, we were the first to market to support offshore Chinese assets as collateral. This offering enables us to allow clients to mobilize new asset classes and asset types to collateralize trade exposures in our tri-party program. We were also the first to launch a new API that helps dealers improve funding efficiency, what this means is that the assets can be costed [ph] anywhere, so optimization can occur irrespective of the location of assets. Given the scarcity of high quality liquid assets clients wanted a way to optimally allocate collateral, which in high volume trade environment can be done by hand, a sophisticated algorithm was needed and we delivered it. In Pershing, we continue to see large complex financial services firms choosing Pershing to either outsource functions to achieve greater scalability, to support growth, or determined that clearing and custody, while critical are not core to their unique value preposition. One example is a mandate we received this quarter from a large regional bank to outsource the support for their private wealth and capital markets businesses, which we will be onboarding over the next 12 to 18 months. As we discussed at Investor Day, Pershing has been accelerating its investments in global advisory solutions to further differentiate its capabilities, such as bank custody where we have a unique advantage in the marketplace. As a result, Pershing signed four relationships seeking bank and brokerage custody in the first quarter and expects to sign a total of seven over the course of 2018. This is a good example of how we are working across the firm to bring our diverse capabilities to the advantage of our clients. Turn to Corporate Trust for a second, as we have discussed, we continue to invest in improving the client experience and our capabilities in targeted areas. And while it's early we're just beginning to see improved results. This quarter we saw organic fee growth for the first time in a while, following a change to the leadership strategy and investments we're making in technology. While early, we see improved execution and we will look to build upon the success in the coming quarters. In treasury services, we continue to see growth in our payment volumes from existing clients driving higher banking transaction services fees. Our private label outsourcing business continues to be in demand and this quarter we had some new business wins. As previously announced, we have been expanding our payment transformation efforts in partnership with real-time payments in Zelle providing links to other banks and financial institutions, who don't want to invest in direct connections. This is an important part of our strategy to provide value added services to our clients and the growth area for us. The pipeline remains strong reflecting significant opportunities. Now, let me talk for a second about clearance and collateral management. We're benefiting from monitory policy easing and the increase in U.S. government debt issuances. U.S. treasury issuances for the first quarter were strong resulting in higher domestic clearance volumes. Based on current trends and expectations for further quantitative easing, we expect to see continued strength in our clearing volumes. Additionally, the migration of the JPMorgan clients to our platforms continues to progress well. We've completed many client conversions, but the largest conversions are expected to begin in the second quarter and be completed by the end of the year. In investment management, we've been focused on our performance and we've been consolidating funds as well as launching new ones to meet the marketplace demands for the non-traditional investments, which as we talked about at Investor Day are core to our strategy. This quarter, our investment performance continued to be positive for us, with 89% and 88% of AUMs above benchmark over three and five years respectively. This contributed to a strong performance fee quarter relative to recent first quarters with broad based fees from LDI, fixed income, equity and alternative strategies. Additionally, we saw improved active equity flows, which benefited from new targeted products, particularly in the mobility innovation fund, which raised about $3 billion during the quarter. Our fixed income flows were strong especially in European and Global Credit as well as secured finance. Finally, the consolidation of our North America businesses we announced last November is going well and both client and consultant reaction has been positive. We're also investing in new talent to help grow the business including key hires during the quarter to oversee investment strategy, consultant relations and trading. And now before I turn it over to Mike, I don't want to be repetitive with comments I made at Investor Day, but I do want to mention a few things again. We are focused on building our franchise for the long-term, because we are confident in our future. We will continue to focus on delivering strong results in the short-term, and we believe we have a very financially attractive business model with unique collection of assets, which work together to give us competitive advantage. We're focused on increasing our rate of revenue growth and while this will happen overtime, we continue to believe we can do this without sacrificing operating margin. And we will do this while investing in technology, operations and in our people both in infrastructure new solutions particularly focused on those that are data driven and digital. In fact, we said we believe that we will still generate positive operating leverage, and you saw this quarter our continued discipline in controlling the total expense base for the quarter. We're lucky enough to have great and unique franchises, great assets and we're operating from position of strength. Over to Mike. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks, Charlie, good morning, everyone. Before I walk you through the results for the first quarter, I'd like to touch upon the reporting changes Valerie noted earlier, which are intended to give you a better picture of our business performance. We're now reporting our revenue in a way that is consistent with how we think about evaluating our business performance. It should complement the previous format, which can be still found in our financial supplement, this should be additive to our disclosures. You can find the details of the changes on page 13 of both the first quarter earnings press release and the financial highlights presentation. Turning to the first quarter results, as Charlie mentioned, growth in earnings for the quarter was largely due to the increase in interest rates in equity markets versus the first quarter of 2017. Although, the U.S. dollar has significantly weakened over the past year against key currencies in which we conduct business. The impact was essentially neutral on net income on a total company basis consistent with previous quarters. With that, let me run through the details of the first quarter results. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I note otherwise. Beginning on page three of the financial highlights presentation, total revenue increased 9%, primarily driven by a 10% increase in fee revenue due to stronger markets and a 16% increase in net interest revenue due to higher interest rates and to a lesser degree higher deposit balances. Also contributing to the growth in fee revenue was higher foreign exchange revenue and growth in collateral management. A weaker U.S. dollar favorably impacted the revenue growth rate by approximately 2 percentage points. Our expenses grew 4% primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar, which unfavorably impacted the expense growth rate by approximately 3%; higher staff expense partially offset by lower consulting expenses. When factoring in the significance of the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar on our expense growth, you can see that while we are making important investments for the future, we continue to remain discipline in controlling our expenses. We generated significant positive operating leverage and increased our pre-tax operating margin to 35%, up from 31% in the prior period. In the first quarter, the company repurchased 11 million common shares for $644 million and paid $246 million in dividends to common shareholders. All of this resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of 20% and an increase in net income applicable to common shareholders of 29%, which benefited from a lower U.S. tax rate. This coupled with a reduction in share count increased earnings per share by 33% to $1.10. Our risk adjusted returns continue to be strong, our CET1 ratio increased to 10.7% and the return on tangible common equity improved to 26%. Page five highlights our Investment Service business results. Total investment services revenue increased 11% on a year-over-year basis and 5% on a sequential basis. Within the business asset servicing revenue increased 13% on a year-over-year basis and 4% sequentially. Both increases primarily reflect higher interest rates and deposit balances, which drove the growth in net interest revenue. These also increased due to higher volumes, market values and foreign exchange volumes. We also benefited from the favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Pershing continued to perform well, up 11% with performance driven mainly by an increase in net interest revenue as a result of higher interest rates as well as fees growth in long-term mutual fund balances and higher clearance volumes. Issuer services revenue, which includes our Corporate Trust and Depositary Receipt businesses increased 6%, primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue in Corporate Trust as well as the favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. On a sequential basis the increase primarily reflects seasonally higher depositary receipts revenue. Treasury Services revenue increased 6% primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue, driven by higher interest rates and payment volumes. Clearance and Collateral Management, which includes U.S. government clearing, U.S. tri-party activity and global collateral management was up 13%, primarily reflecting growth in collateral management, higher clearance volumes and net interest revenue. Additionally average tri-party balances were up 14%. Non-interest expense within investment services increased 5% year-over-year and decreased 7% sequentially. Both periods also reflects higher technology cost consistent with what we discussed during our Investor Day with unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher volume related to sub-custodian and clearing expenses. The year-over-year increase was partially offset by lower consulting expense. The sequential decrease was primarily due to severance litigation and an asset impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Now a few additional comments on the Investment Services business. Foreign exchange revenue increased 10% due to higher volumes across most of our FX products. Securities lending revenue increased 20%, primarily driven by increased demand for U.S. government securities and equities. Average loans were 8% year-over-year however on a sequential basis they were up slightly. Assets under custody and administration grew to $33.5 trillion, reflecting higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new business. Pershing's average long-term mutual fund assets are up due to higher equity markets and from clients consolidating assets on our platform. Turning to page six for the Investment Management business highlights, total investment management revenue increased 13% year-over-year, on a sequential basis revenue increased 4%. Asset management revenue increased 16%, reflecting higher equity market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar principally versus the British pound and higher performance fees. The quarter also benefited from a gain on the sale of CenterSquare. Performance fees increased from $12 million to $48 million primarily due to strong investment performance in our LDI and alternative strategies. And as Charlie mentioned our long-term active investment strategies performed well with 89% and 88% of our assets above their three and five year benchmarks respectively. Wealth Management revenue increased 5% reflecting higher equity market values and net new business, partially offset by lower net interest revenue from lower deposit balances. Sequentially deposits were up 15% in Wealth Management. Assets under management increased 8% year-over-year, but declined 1% sequentially to $1.9 trillion. Turning to the flows, we experienced another quarter of net inflows into our long-term actively managed strategies with $17 billion of inflows during the quarter. The LDI strategy had strong inflows of $13 billion and fixed income net flows of $7 billion, which were partially offset by outflows in our multi-asset and alternatives strategies of $3 billion. Additionally active equity flows were flat following a multi-quarter trend of outflows. As we continue to look for ways to differentiate our equity strategies and as a result benefited from the new fund launches that Charlie mentioned in the quarter. The inflows into long-term active strategies were partially offset with $13 billion of index outflows resulting in $4 billion of total long-term inflows. Index outflows primarily resulted from clients rebalancing at a funds tracking, underperforming international equity indices in both Europe and Japan. We experienced short-term cash outflows of $14 billion mainly drawn from government money market funds, which were in net outflows across the industry during the first quarter. Further increases in interest rates as well as competitive yields from select peers also contributed to our net outflows in these funds over the quarter. Together total long and short net flows were $10 billion in the quarter. Lastly, the impact of the sale of CenterSquare and other changes are included in the divestiture and other line in the flows table. So turning to the other segment on page seven briefly. Fee revenue increased sequentially primarily reflecting the impact in the fourth quarter of 2017 of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Legislation. Additionally, we recorded a $49 million of net securities losses related to the sale of approximately $1 billion of debt securities, which represents less than 1% of our portfolio. Additionally, non-interest expense declined year-over-year, reflecting lower professional yield and other purchase services partially offset by higher incentives. Now turning to page eight on capital and liquidity, the capital and liquidity ratios as of March 31, 2018 remained above the regulatory minimums with the appropriate buffers. And most of them increased since December 31, 2017 on a fully phased in basis. Common equity tier 1 capital totaled $18.3 billion, an increase of $496 million compared with the fully phased in basis at December 31st. The increase primarily reflects capital generated through earnings and additional training capital resulting from stock awards, partially offset by capital deployed through common stock repurchases and dividends paid. The fully phased in supplementary leverage ratio remains stable at 5.9%, which exceeds the 2018 regulatory requirement of 5% with the reasonable buffer. We also remain in full compliance with the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio requirements. Our average LCR was 116% in the first quarter. Now on page nine, net interest revenue increased 16% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, primarily reflecting both higher interest rates and deposit balances, partially offset by higher average long-term debt. Year-over-year, our average interest bearing deposits increased 11%, while our average non-interest bearing deposits declined 3%. Year-over-year, our net interest margin increased 9 basis points to 1.22%. On page 10 on expenses. I'd like to note, we also made a few expense reporting changes this quarter to simplify our reporting and give you better insight into our expense categories. Merger and integration, litigation and restructuring charges are no longer separately disclosed in the income statement, we've had very little M&I and restructuring expense in recent years. And these expenses previously reported in this line have been reclassified primarily to other expenses in prior periods have been restated. Clearing expense, which is previously included in other expenses been reclassified to sub-custodian expense and renamed sub-custodian and clearing. This should help you better understand our market and volume based expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses increased 4%, primarily reflecting the weaker U.S. dollar which unfavorably impacted expense growth rate by approximately 3% and higher staff expense partially offset by lower consulting expenses. The sequential decline reflects lower expenses in nearly all categories. Looking ahead to the second quarter, there are a few things to factor in your modeling. While it's still too early to predict how the quarter will play out, we expect on an average, rates will be higher in the second quarter than in the first. And as of today, our deposit balances lower than the average deposits in the first quarter. Additionally, the yield curve has flattened in recent weeks, which negatively impacts our reinvestment opportunities. The quarterly investment and other income line is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $60 million per quarter for the remainder of 2018. Additionally performance fee should be in line with the second quarter average over the last couple of years. We expect total expense growth in the quarter to be similar to what we saw in the first quarter versus a year ago. And we still expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%. Now before turning to Q&A, I'd like to make just a few comments on the recent regulatory developments regarding capital requirements. So earlier this month, we completed the CCAR process for 2018, while we can't discuss the details, the supervisory severely adverse scenario was noticeably more stringent than in prior years. This variability in these scenarios year-to-year may cause fluctuations in the payout ratios. With regard to the SLR, we welcome any attempts to revise the leverage based standards and based on the draft it would appear that the requirement to decline and that would be positive for us. With respect to CCAR, it's way too early to know the impact of the stress capital buffer framework, given that it may change year-to-year based on the thorough reserves, severely adverse scenarios and supervisory models. The proposal indicates that a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio plus a prescribed stress capital buffer must be maintained at all times. This is consistent with the way we manage our capital already. Given the high quality of our balance sheet, it's possible that the impact of this rule change would be positive, but it will depend on the outcome of the final rule, and it's too early to draw any conclusions by either way. Additionally the new frameworks increased emphasis on stress capital buffers, which are based on the Fed severely adverse scenario and supervisory models raises the potential for more volatility and unpredictability year-to-year. We are hopeful that the potential volatility and unpredictability year-to-year will be mitigated by the Fed providing more visibility into the stress scenarios and supervisory models and refinement of this methodology during the common period. We look forward to engaging with the Fed in this common period as they finalize the rules. Now with that Charlie and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. So, I noticed in the prepared remarks and disclosure you noted net interest revenue growth in every single business obviously rates were up, but it's also balance growth. So, we noted high deposit betas, I am assuming that's kind of stay given your mix of clients and business. So the question I have is, how much balance sheet growth is possible as you continue to have like really good capital return. Because that's what - that's going to help continue to drive net interest revenue, right? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, hey Glenn its Mike, let me just give you a couple thoughts there and then hopefully I'll answer the question. But, as you sort of think about the first quarter and we said this at Investor Day as well, sort of that we saw deposit balances a little higher than we expected in the beginning part of our first quarter and those have come back down to kind of where we expected them to be. And as we sort of think about the second quarter, all things considered, we still expect NIM to increase and we would expect that even with the lower deposit balances, the rate of growth of NIR will be a little lower than the first quarter. But we still expect it to be pretty healthy versus the second quarter of 2017. So we still expect to see both of that happening. And I think as we build - as we continue to build the franchise and bring on new clients, we would hope that our - any of the decline we see in our balances as a result of rates rising would be more than offset to or offset partially at least by new business coming in. And we have the room on the balance sheet to continue to do that. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate that. You mentioned the business wins, obvious in tri-party and collateral management are climbing as the balances grow. Business wins and losses in asset servicing are we not going to get that anymore? Michael Santomassimo : Well\u2026 Glenn Schorr : I just didn't... Michael Santomassimo : Yes, we took that stat out because and this came up a little bit at the Investor Day, and we agreed with the view that it just really wasn't a particularly worthwhile statistic it's a gross number not a net number. Our belief the way different people talk about it across the industry is very different relative to timing, relative to is it custody, is it fund accounting, middle office how you count it. And so our view so just wasn't a whole lot of value in it which we agreed with. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate, thanks. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks, Glenn. Next question, operator? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow-up on the discussion really to the capital and the NPRs put up by the Fed. So, in terms of I guess the excess capital dynamic obviously too early to really tell, but I was wondering if you guys think though the impact that you could have on the business particularly the repo markets, which I guess partially been somewhat constraint by the leverage requirement of the banks. A, I guess do you think some of that could come back, to what extent do you think that could help your tri-party repo business. And if possible to I guess breakout, how much of revenues you guys generated in tri-party repo to help us kind of calibrate what the upside could be? Michael Santomassimo : Hey, Alex, this is Mike. I think the impact on - you'll get a better sense from the other banks in terms of exactly what the impact they think it will have, but you would think that given the constraints they are all under now that you would see that have a positive impact on the repo market, which would then come back to us from a servicing perspective. To what extent, it's hard to know right now. Alexander Blostein : Any sense how much you guys generated in tri-party repo revenues currently? Michael Santomassimo : That's not something we disclose, but it's included in the clearance and collateral management line that you see in the disclosure. Alexander Blostein : Got you. And then just my follow-up secondly, just kind of going back to the Investor Day, you guys outlined longer-term NIM guidance of 1.25% to 1.40%, you're at 1.23% now so seems like you're kind of there. Any additional clarity you guys can provide on the assumptions I guess underpinning the 1.25% to 1.40% in terms of the rates back drop, the size of the balance sheet, the timeframe of how you guys think you'll get to those levels? Michael Santomassimo : As you noted, we're pretty much on the bottom of that range as we speak and so if rates continue the way - to increase the way the market expects, we would be getting into that range as we go out through the rest of the year. And as you know, there is a lot of dynamics that sort of play into exactly what the NIM will be in terms of deposit mix the level and rates as you mentioned, but we would expect to begin to get into that range as we go up through the rest of the year. Alexander Blostein : Got it. I mean I guess like is there a scenario where it will be above 1.40%, I guess, just given there still seems to some runway on the rate side? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, I mean it's possible there is always a scenario, who knows. Alexander Blostein : Got it, all right. Thanks guys. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning folks. Maybe if we can just go back into asset serving, looking at it sort of the old way on the fee line of asset servicing, still very strong 10% growth year-over-year, maybe if you can just bifurcate that a little bit specific to your point of clearing and collateral out of that separately on the clearing of the treasury business. And if you can talk about maybe sort of qualitatively about the pipeline in asset servicing, I think you mentioned you onboarding a new business from a large customer, that's - can you give a little more clarity on that and the timing of that? Charles Scharf : Yes, so as you sort of look at the asset servicing line back in the supplement, it's up 10% year-over-year as you sort of noted Brian. So, again as you sort of think about the drivers of that, very consistent with what we talk about in general about what's happening. So the market levels and currency sort of helped aid that as well as growth in our collateral businesses and then organic sort of flows into our existing client portfolios. So - and then there is a little bit of seasonality that you see in the first quarter, as you look at the sequential results from a few items, but for the most part you're seeing the same drivers that we talk about in general across the firm. Michael Santomassimo : And just keep in mind with the business there are different things that go into the revenue flow, the core custody, core fee based business, obviously is impacted by the level of the markets. Wins and losses, it's a slow steady set of changes that happen based on what the trends on wins and losses. So you are not going to see dramatic shifts there. And so one client coming on doesn't materially change the number in a quarter, but it just gives you a point of view of what we're seeing in terms of wins and losses. Charles Scharf : And I think as you think about the new business wins. We feel if we were to report a number, it would be pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last number of quarters. I mean it was a little outsized at the end of last year, but otherwise if you looked at the average across the previous quarters, it's pretty similar. And the pipeline still feels good. Brian Bedell : And we have more conversion from the zero [ph] priced deals. So yet to come and I think you mentioned the JPMorgan Treasury business is still the majority of that yet is still to be transitioned, is that correct? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, good number of the clients from JPMorgan have been converted already. But it's a few of the bigger ones are coming in between now and the end of the year. Brian Bedell : And just on the expense control very solid obviously in the quarter, so better than expectations. As we think about Charlie, your comments on investing in the business in the rest of the quarters this year. Do you think this type of expense level is sustainable for the rest of the year given that you still have some improvements in the costs base to make as well? Charles Scharf : Yes, I'm not going to give you a forecast on expenses beyond what we said at Investor Day, but what you saw this quarter was very consistent with our points of view on what we think we can produce. And so this quarter includes a fair amount of the additional technology investments not all of it we will be growing throughout the year. But we're very, very focused on continuing to build and increasing the operating margin, which means we should continue to see a tight control on expense. What that means for the actual number, again away from the effect of currency, we're focused on it. And so I think everything I said there will continue to play out throughout the year. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks very much. Charles Scharf : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Charles Scharf : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Hey, Charlie, at Investor Day we talked a lot about organic fee growth rates. And I think you mentioned or was it organic revenue growth rates. I think you mentioned it is old days of 1% going to 1.5%. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how much of the revenue growth this quarter was organic? Charles Scharf : Yes, I'm not going to talk about that that's not something we're going to talk about at every single quarter. We did that, investors to just give you a sense of the way we look at it internally. And what we are focused on driving. I think, but when you look at some of the results that we see whether it's security lending loans, what we saw on FX, what you see the levels of AUCA. And just our comments on growing the underlying client base and franchise. I think directionally what you see across the businesses is headed in the right direction. And I guess, the last thing that I would say is when we went through Investor Day was just was very interesting experience quite frankly to watch people's reactions to us being very open and honest in disclosing things that I don't think that anyone else has disclosed in the business. So that again you have the lens into how we're thinking about it, which from our perspective is a positive because we're focused on the things that we wanted to do better at and think we can do better. So overall, you'll see it in the actual operating metrics over a period of times. So directionally in the businesses which have more quicker paybacks, a series of the markets related businesses, liquidity and security lending, you saw franchise growth. And we're focused on delivering it in the other businesses, which have longer lead times as well. Betsy Graseck : Got it, okay. Just obviously revenue growth was very strong this quarter. It seems like you outperformed the 1.5% long-term average that you were talking to at Investor Day I don't know if that's a fair conclusion from your perspective? Charles Scharf : Yes, I think directionally it's fair to say that there was higher organic revenue growth than we've seen in the past. We're not pounding our chests that we've declared victory here. I mean this is the very beginning. And as I said, most - the important parts of our business Corporate Trust, asset servicing, continuing to build stronger flows in our asset management business, client assets in the wealth management those take time to build. And you are not going to see big movements several months into a process here, but directionally we do feel very good about it. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just separately, during the quarter obviously a lot of solidity in the markets that you could speak to outlook if volatility pulls back a little bit. And then separately on LIBOR there is a lot of discussion on how you are positioned for the LIBOR move that happened in the quarter and maybe you could speak to the impacts that had this quarter. So going forward is either the one and three months be revert to the basis risk that it had before or continue to widen out from here we can get a sense of the impact on you guys? Thanks. Michael Santomassimo : Hey, Betsy, its Mike. So on the first part on the volatility question. So, in the first quarter some of the volatility did impact and helped some of the volumes that we saw particularly in Pershing as Charlie sort of noted in terms of having one of our peak days in that business. So, in some ways volatility will be helpful right, but there could be negative effects of that as well depending on how that impacts the overall market. So we'll see. I think on the second part of your question, in terms of how we're positioned vis-\u00e0-vis LIBOR, we are weighted more towards - we have more LIBOR based assets - short-term LIBOR based assets than we do liabilities. So as LIBOR starts to move up, whether it's one or three month it is sort of helpful for us relative to how we are positioned. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just lastly, you mentioned Zelle and some of the things that you're doing to help connect people to that without having to directly invest in the Zelle backbone, I think that's what I heard, but maybe you could give us some color as to not only what you're doing, but what you think the market is for that? Charles Scharf : Yes, I think obviously - I presume everyone understands what Zelle is, which is the group that is owned by a series of the banks that are building out the capabilities to leverage real-time payments network. In order to participate in those capabilities, the institutions have to do a fair amount of work to integrate their technologies with those platforms. Not every bank wants to do that, and not every bank actually controls their own capabilities because some of its outsourced. Many of those banks are clients of ours in our Treasury Services business. So we have the ability to step in and provide a series of those services to help them get access to those networks. The real question over a period of time relative to what those capabilities mean is, will banks and others build out solutions that access the capabilities of these real-time networks, so that product offerings become more attractive versus using ACH and other methods of payment today, that's something we and other financial institutions are very focused on that will take - that's not weeks or months that will evolve over the next couple of years. But those capabilities are better than what exist in the marketplace and we're - let's think of us as a facilitator for the financial institutions that don't have the infrastructure or can't spend on it to do their own direct integrations. Betsy Graseck : Super, thanks. That's helpful. Charles Scharf : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Hey, thanks. First question I'd like to ask you about it seems like the issuer services business seems to be flattening out, can you just talk about the two different pieces of that? And whether or not you are seeing either better activity or just better new business start to come through, is that a turn in that? Michael Santomassimo : Hey, Ken, its Mike, thanks for the question. In the Corporate Trust business Charlie sort of highlighted a little bit in his remarks, but we have seen some green shoots of organic growth there in the quarter. And so as Charlie mentioned that's a good positive trend that we're sort of hoping to build upon. I think on the DR space, we'll see sort of how it goes, I think there's a lots of seasonality in those numbers and a lots of timing around when certain corporate actions and other activities are happening in that business. We're hopeful that we'll continue to have - manage it as best we can and we still have a very strong market share in that business and continue to sort of win our fair share things that come to the market. But it can move around quite a bit quarter-to-quarter. Charles Scharf : And there's no doubt, I mean, we talked last year about not winning several large deals, which I described and I think what we described that we're very conscious on our part. So you wind up with the lapping effects of those. And I think I'll just go back and stay on Corporate Trust for a second again we talked about this at Investor Day, when we say we're starting to see some these green shoots of growth just to be clear this is - we've - there is a very focused effort in Corporate Trust for us to - which we went through with new management place to understand why we weren't being as successful in the business as we think we could have been. And so we've made a series of changes there, I'd say we're extremely focused on the business and we see a very heightened focused on our coverage, on our sales efforts with our - some of our most important partners across the globe that actually help generate that business and we're working on and continuing to build our technology. So again it will hopefully, if we're as successful as we think we can be it will build overtime. But it's a very conscious effort, it's not just us watching what's going on in the marketplace and feeling good in good times and bad in bad times. Kenneth Usdin : Understood. And if I can ask a second one just mix of deposits that are denominated in non-U.S. dollars can you update us on like the size of that and I know we're in a U.S. rate cycle, but would the balance sheet still also be positively rate sensitive should we start to see non-U.S. central bank start to raise rates? Thanks guys. Charles Scharf : Yes, on the later part of the question first, euro is becoming non-negative I think would be helpful so that would be a positive impact. I think there is a high probability that the Bank of England raises rates shortly and so that will be sort of marginally positive. But the overall mix of the balance sheet hasn't changed much with still around 70% of it still in U.S. dollars with the remainder being outside of the U.S. Kenneth Usdin : Got it thanks a lot. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question with Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on that the 70% deposits in U.S. dollar and the increase that we saw here this quarter at least that came through on the average balance sheet. What sort of deposit beta would you say we saw here with the last Fed hike and do you have any expectations for where that's going to continue to go from here? Michael Santomassimo : Hey, Brennan, its Mike, as we said a number of times over the last year or so we would expect that betas continue to increase as rates increase right and sort of that's what you see happening. It's largely happening as we expected across the different businesses. And again you saw - you got the full impact of a rate rise in December in those numbers and you got a little piece of one in March as well. And so I think you can kind of read into the numbers and see what you think sort of the average beta is there and you're probably not that far off. Brennan Hawken : Okay. The second part of the question, I guess, implied with your lead in that could continue to see some lift from that imputed beta as well? Michael Santomassimo : Sorry say it again somewhat, sorry? Brennan Hawken : I am saying that it seems like what you said from the lead in from your preface that you think that betas probably could continue to see some upward pressure that's I was just clarifying that. Michael Santomassimo : Yes, as rates rise we would expect betas to continue to increase. Brennan Hawken : Excellent, okay thanks. And then from my follow-up here, it looks like some really nice trends in consulting expenses it's my recollection, but I'm not 100% sure here that maybe some CCAR and regulatory expenses were flowing through that line. Are we finally reaching the point where we're getting some relief on regulatory expense front? Does that mean that - that would mean and imply to me at least that that's sustainable or should be given where everything that you guys have built up from a capabilities perspective plus be in the environment that we're in, is that really do you think that that's a fair conclusion to come to? Thanks. Charles Scharf : Let me take a stab Mike, and you tell me whether you agree, how is that? I think the answer is predominantly yes, but I'd just make a couple of comments on that. I think the very significant amounts that we spent on consulting for those specific things you talked about, for the most part we'll not continue at the levels that you've seen and you see the benefits of that running through our results. I will say and I've got just think like the newcomer, relative newcomer and I'm sure you all appreciate this, there is a hugely significant amount of regulatory expense embedded in the other lines that's just the reality of what the regulatory environment is today versus what it was years ago. So, we spend a tremendous amount on regulatory, it's just not specifically in the consulting line and that's not going to go down for what we see at this point and time. And we continue to spend a significant amount of money outside the U.S., specifically for GDPR and MiFID II inside Europe. So just think about it as it's a little bit of a reallocation from consulting to us doing a bunch of the work whether it's the headcount expense, technology expense and things like that. Michael Santomassimo : Okay. And I'll just add one thing, so as we said a number of times too that the decline you see in consulting, we had at this time last year where we are still working on sort of the resolution plan. And so a big chunk of that decline was related to that activity that we're working on last year. But Charlie is right, there is a - there maybe a little bit of a pause in the short run, but in the U.S. where there is plenty of efforts that's going into a number of initiatives across the globe\u2026 Charles Scharf : That we are currently spending on. Michael Santomassimo : That's currently in the numbers. Brennan Hawken : Yes, no for sure just we got to take our victories where we can on the regulatory spend front. Thanks a lot guys. Charles Scharf : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Thanks, guys. One question on Investment Management. I don't know if you had the gain on the sale of that entity. And then also on the performance fees stronger than expect you guys mentioned some of the drivers, just wanted to get a sense, is there anything changed in terms of the recognition by quarter that we should expect things to be different than what we've seen historically? Charles Scharf : No, I mean, there is nothing that would change sort of the normal seasonality that you see in lines like performance fees. The gain, we haven't disclosed the number, but the gain on CenterSquare is embedded in the numbers, it's not a material game changer or remover for the overall results. But it is in the number. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then follow-up on the Investment Services business, if I just look at I guess quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year just the revenue growth versus the asset growth that came in stronger and typically we're not seeing that, but it seems like under the new disclosure that can be either activity with volatility or rates with net interest income, so just wanted to get a sense. And then in terms of predicting that line, you guys give a lot of metrics, I know you're not giving that the win metrics, but is there anything else that we should be thinking about to try to think about either forecasting into that line item going forward? Charles Scharf : I think in the Asset Servicing business when you look at it in the earnings release, just keep in mind what's also in there is net interest revenue. And so, net interest revenue was as we mentioned a significant driver sort of the overall business results and I think that's true in asset servicing as well. You also have the impact of the market in FX and so forth. So just keep that in mind as you sort of look at that overall number. In terms of metrics to look at in terms of forecasting, I don't think there is anything necessarily new to sort of add to that conversation. Michael Santomassimo : The only thing I would add is again it was a very good quarter relatively to asset values or the impacts in volatility on us and rates. And so we were clearly beneficiaries of that. It was an important driver as we've said in our comments of the results. We also had significant balance growth that we saw. So as we look forward to the next quarter, sitting here today it's not as strong as it was, but on a year-over-year basis still should look - I would say we still good about what we're going to say. Michael Carrier : Got it, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It looks like the first quarter expenses came in a bit lower than you've been pointing to. Even given if anything the currency was moving in the wrong direction. So could you talk about what changed there as you went through the quarter, where you're able to take out those expense saves, maybe didn't have budgeted in initially. Charles Scharf : I don't know why do you say that? Michael Santomassimo : I mean, Geoffrey, I think, let me clarify. So at Investor Day, we said the expenses would be up 4% to 5% in the quarter and they're up 4%. So they're about right where we expected them to be. Geoffrey Elliott : So I go to more like up 3.6% and you said 2% of growth driven by foreign currency translation and then the actual foreign currency translation was 3%. So it kind of feels like you did a little bit better than you were pointing to back then. Just trying to understand where the extra saves or extra benefits on the expense side came from? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, there is no single like big things that's driving in. As Charlie mentioned a couple of times this morning, we are very focused on looking at like the whole place and making sure that we're being as efficient and effective in sort of spending as we can. And so little singles and doubles sort of add up overtime. And so we're focused on all of it, but there is no single thing to point to. Charles Scharf : And we don't obsess about a half a point or a point in any given quarter. Geoffrey Elliott : Sure. Understood. And I guess thinking about the full year, us there anything that kind of gives you more confident that you can do better on the expense side given what you've seen in the first quarter? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, we're not going to give you a number for the full year, but as we said, a bunch of different ways. We're coming in every day focused on making sure that we're doing the best we can to keep the expense base where it needs to be, while making the investments we need to make. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just had a quick question one on your comments around the deposits, but it was little early in the quarter to be calling out the run off that we're seeing. Can you just I don't if whether that was going to interest bearing, non-interest bearing or I mean was that a significant magnitude of deposit outflow that you saw? Michael Santomassimo : Well, I think what we're kind of calling out is what we mentioned in March as well, at Investor Day is that we saw higher balanced in Jan and Feb, January and February than we thought we would see. So now balances are sort of back down about where we thought they would be. And there is no single driver of that it sort of normalized to where we expect it. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Michael Santomassimo : Yes, you saw both non-interest bearing and interesting bearing come down. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then you did have some security sales in the quarter. Was that just slightly repositioned the book or is this something that you're seeing with rising rates you are looking to get more shorter duration overall? Michael Santomassimo : It was a very minor repositioning that we're able to do due to the adoption of a new accounting standard that allowed us to reclassify some of our HTM bonds. So very minor in the scheme of the portfolio. Brian Kleinhanzl : And just onetime in. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. Michael Santomassimo : Thank you. Operator : So our final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you and good morning. You guys have talked about it at Investor Day and today about the emphasis on technology investing and spending. When you look at it from a line of business standpoint, is there one or two lines that have a greater focus of the spending? Michael Santomassimo : So you mean, which businesses. Charles Scharf : Asset services and investment management. Gerard Cassidy : Correct, exactly is there an area that you guys think that you need to put more effort and money versus another area within the organization? Charles Scharf : It's probably skewed somewhat towards investment services versus investment management. But that's not to say that there are significantly amount of opportunities for us that we're focused on to use technology in the Investment Management business, whether it's wealth management or in the asset management side. When it comes to the core we talked about the investments that we're making in infrastructure, I would say the majority of those comments relate to the Investment Services business and the work that we're doing there. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, I know there is a lot of moving parts with the capital notice of proposed rulemaking that have come out recently from the Fed, hopefully it will settle down. But when you guys look longer term it was - it looks like a lift in the dividend payout ratio that used to be a soft line at 30%. When you guys look out longer term, do you have a sense of where you think the dividend payout ratio will go relative to stock buybacks and stuff that you use for return of capital? Charles Scharf : No, I think sitting here today I don't think anything is different than - I don't think we're thinking about it any differently than what we said at Investor Day relative to dividend. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, thank you. Charles Scharf : All right, well thank you all very much for the time, take care. Operator : If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call and webcast.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. Valerie Haertel : Good morning and welcome to the BNY Mellon second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, our Chairman and CEO; and Mike Santomassimo, our CFO. The earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in our discussion of second quarter results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, bnymellon.com. Please note that our remarks today maybe forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July 19, 2018 and we will not update forward-looking statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Thanks, Valerie. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I will begin with a few comments on our business performance before turning it over to Mike who will then run through our second quarter financials and outlook before we open the call for questions. We reported earnings per share of $1.03, up 17% from last year\u2019s second quarter. Year-over-year revenue grew 5%, expenses grew 3% and as we did last year, we benefited from a reduction in our tax rate. I will talk more specifically about revenue growth in a second, but just a reminder, we are focused on increasing the rate of revenue growth given the nature of our business it takes time and therefore it\u2019s very hard to draw any conclusions in an individual quarter good or bad. Having said that, we again saw some underlying franchise growth in some parts of the company this quarter and we continued to benefit from the positive impact of higher interest rates and stronger equity markets, albeit at a more modest pace than last quarter. Regarding expenses, we remain disciplined and focused on deploying our resources. Currency translation and real estate costs impacted expense growth by 2% and despite an increase in our investment in technology all other expenses were only up modestly. Let me say a few words about our asset servicing business first. We saw steady performance in our core custody, middle office and fund accounting revenues and we did see good growth in several areas, including securities lending, where we saw increased demand for U.S. government securities in equities and we had good growth in foreign exchange revenue driven by higher volumes for market activity, but also new business wins predominantly from asset servicing clients. We continue to enhance our capabilities and recently launched new foreign exchange products to better service our clients, including FX prime brokerage and FX options. We also enhanced our existing capabilities in emerging markets. As we look forward, our pipeline and demand for services is solid in our asset servicing business overall. Our strength in our end-to-end fund administration solutions business, which includes our institutional transfer agency services, is a differentiator and we continue to experience growth in our real estate and private equity servicing, a trend that we have seen for well over a year. Regarding new business, we had a healthy number of new wins in mandates, especially in the U.S. and Canada. In purging, our business continues to be strong, but this quarter was impacted by two lost clients. These have been known to us for quite some time and while these losses will impact us on a year-over-year basis for the next few quarters, we are also in the process of on-boarding several large clients, which will positively impact our results starting predominantly in the second half of next year. In Issuer Services, we continued to see improved results in our core corporate trust business resulting from repositioning of our front office sales and relationship management teams and investments to improve our technology capabilities. While the market remains competitive, we continue to see a strong pipeline particularly for collateralized loan obligations in corporate debt and through the first half of 2018 our market share improved a bit. In Treasury Services, we continued to see growth in our payment volumes from existing and new clients and our pipeline remained strong both in the U.S. and Europe. In clearance and collateral management, our business here continues to be strong. We saw double digit revenue growth in clearing and collateral management services from growth in collateral management activity, the on-boarding of new broker-dealer clients from JPMorgan\u2019s exit of the government clearing business and higher clearance volumes related to monetary policy easing from the increase in U.S. government debt and treasury issuances as I noted last quarter. In investment management we are continuing to focus on investment performance, drive scale on our business portfolio, invest in product development and distribution capabilities and strengthen our wealth management franchise. We did see outflows in our long-term strategies and cash this quarter, Mike will provide more color here in a few minutes. Importantly investment performance remained in line with the first quarter with 89% of our AUMs ahead of benchmark over 3 years and 5 years. And importantly we are continuing to focus on retaining and attracting great talent. This quarter we added two senior people to the executive team. In Wealth Management, Catherine Keating joined us as CEO on July 9 reporting to Mitchell. The business has done well, but we can do even better. Catherine is a seasoned CEO with a strong track record in wealth and asset management. She knows the business, the markets, appreciates the advantage of the business being part of BNY Mellon and I am confident she will do a great job for us. We also announced a new CEO of Treasury Services, Paul Camp who will be reporting to Todd and will be joining us in August. Paul has a great reputation and has extensive global experience in this space and I am thrilled that we were able to attract someone of his caliber. Here too we are doing well, but we have the opportunity to do it in better. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I need to say a few more things all of which should sound familiar to you. We are focused on delivering strong financial results including driving stronger organic revenue growth and as I have said this will take some time. Our technology investments will continue to grow and we will be vigilant about controlling other discretionary expenses. We believe that we have a financially attractive business model with unique collection of assets which work together to give us competitive advantage. We see some evidence of early progress, we still have much more to do and we have confidence that we will be successful and that we will drive more value for you and our clients. Now let me turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie and good morning everyone. I will first run through the details of the second quarter results and then provide some thoughts for the third quarter. Charlie and I will then open up the call for questions. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I note otherwise. Beginning on Page 3, I have the financial highlights presentation. Total revenue increased 5% to $4.1 billion in the second quarter. Fee revenue increased 3% to $3.2 billion due to higher equity market values with favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, the change in FX translation rates which positively impacted fee growth by approximately 1% and growth in volumes across our foreign exchange and our collateral management business. The year-over-year growth rate was negatively impacted by lease related gains recorded in the second quarter of 2017 which impacted fee growth by approximately 1.5%. Net interest revenue increased 11% to $916 million from higher interest rates. Our expenses grew 3% to $2.7 billion. The impact of the weaker U.S. dollar and costs related to our real estate consolidation activities negatively impacted expenses by approximately 2%. Including in the real estate cost is $12 million related to moving our headquarters in New York City from lease space to our own building. We have begun the physical move of now and expect the cost associated with the relocation to be approximately $75 million, down from approximately $100 million that we communicated at Investor Day in March, with the remainder expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of this year. This will enable us to reduce our real estate footprint by approximately 300,000 square feet in 2019. In addition to that, there were also some expenses in the second quarter related to rationalizing other locations. Our continued investments we are making in technology were partially offset by declines in other expenses. The majority of the incremental technology investment this year is going towards improvements relating to our operating platforms and technology infrastructure. Having said that, we are also still investing approximately $1.5 billion in developing new capabilities for clients. This year, as we have said in the past, technology is one of our key investment priorities as well as continuing to be focused in driving more efficiency into everything we do. In the second quarter, we repurchased 12 million common shares for $651 million and paid $244 million in dividends to common shareholders. Additionally, the board has authorized the repurchase of up to 2.4 billion of common shares beginning in the third quarter through the second quarter of 2019 and an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.28 per share payable beginning in the third quarter of this year. All of this resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of 7% to $1.4 billion and an increase in net income applicable to common shareholders of 14% to $1.1 billion, which benefited from a lower U.S. tax rate of 20.5%. We generated positive operating leverage and a pre-tax operating margin of 34% up from the prior year period. This coupled with a reduction in our share count increased earnings per share by 17% to $1.3. Our risk-adjusted returns continue to be strong. Our CET1 ratio increased 11% and our return on tangible common equity was approximately 23%. Page 5 highlights our investment services business. Investment services revenue increased 8% to $3.1 billion. Net interest revenue increased in most businesses, primarily due to higher interest rates. Within the business, asset servicing revenue increased 10% to $1.5 billion primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue mostly driven by higher rates, foreign exchange and securities lending volumes, equity market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Pershing revenue increased 2% to $558 million as a result of higher net interest revenue and fees from growth in long-term mutual fund balances partially offset by the impact of lost business. We are continuing to see our clients consolidate assets on to the Pershing platform, which enhances visibility into their client\u2019s portfolios. The lost business is primarily driven by a couple of clients one was the result of industry consolidation and one move to another provider. As Charlie mentioned, the pipeline is good, but it takes time to onboard. Sequentially, Pershing\u2019s revenue decreased 4% primarily reflecting lower clearance revenue, of which approximately half was from normal changes in volumes and half from the lost clients. Issuer Services revenue, which includes corporate trust and depository receipts increased 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $431 million. Both comparisons primarily reflect higher net interest revenue and corporate trust and higher depository receipts revenue. Treasury Services revenue increased 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $329 million, primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue due to the higher interest rates and higher payment volumes, which were up approximately 4%. Clearance and Collateral Management revenue, which includes our U.S. government clearing U.S. tri-party activity and global collateral management increased 11% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $269 million. Both increases primarily reflect growth in Collateral Management, increased clearance volumes and net interest revenue. We are continuing to onboard the U.S. government clearing clients that are transferring from JPMorgan and those migrations are going well. We saw some modest impacts from the activity in the second quarter and expect to have most of the migrations completed by the end of the third quarter. Additionally, average collateral management balances were up 12%. Non-interest expense within investment services increased 2% to $2 billion driven primarily by higher technology investments and the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Also, our foreign exchange revenue increased 19% from higher volumes across many of our products. Securities lending revenue increased 31% primarily driven by higher demand for U.S. government securities and higher demand for equities. Our assets under custody and/or administration grew 8% to $33.6 trillion reflecting higher market values and business growth. Turning to Page 6 for the investment management business, investment management revenue increased 3% to $1 billion. On a sequential basis, total revenue decreased 6% driven by the performance fees being higher in the first quarter and the gain on sale from the CenterSquare divestiture also in the first quarter. Asset management revenue increased 3% to $702 million. The results were helped by the increase in equity markets, the favorable impact of a weakness U.S. dollar principally versus the pound, which was partially offset by the impact of lost revenue associated with the sale of CenterSquare and the impact of outflows in some of our actively managed strategies, particularly equities. Wealth Management revenue increased 4% to $316 million primarily a result of increase in the equity markets partially offset by lower net interest revenue due to a 4% decline in deposits. Assets under management increased 2% year-over-year, but declined 3% sequentially to $1.8 trillion. The sequential decline was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar principally versus the pound, which drove an approximately 3% decline in net outflows partially offset by market appreciation. Turning to the flows, our actively managed strategies experienced $8 billion in net outflows, with $4 billion in outflows from fixed income and $3 billion each from equity in multi-asset and alternatives partially offset by LDI inflows of $2 billion. Index strategies had $7 billion of outflows. Cash outflows of $11 billion were primarily driven by some recent outflows due to client M&A activity. Now, turning to the other segment on Page 7. Fee revenue declined year-over-year primarily reflecting the impact of lease related gains recorded in the second quarter of 2017 and lower corporate bank-owned life insurance. Fee revenue also declined sequentially primarily reflecting lower asset related gains. Net interest expense increased year-over-year and sequentially primarily resulting from corporate treasury activity. Additionally, non-interest expense increased year-over-year primarily reflecting higher technology spend and expenses related with our real estate consolidation. Now, turning to capital and liquidity on Page 8. Our capital and liquidity ratios at the end of the quarter increased since the first quarter. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.4 billion as of June 30, 2018 and our CET1 ratio was 11% under the advanced approach. The supplementary ratio was 6.2%. Our average LCR was 118% in the second quarter. Turning to Page 9, net interest revenue increased 11% to $916 million primarily driven by the impact of higher interest rates. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue decreased slightly as expected due to lower deposits partially offset by higher interest rates. The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased 10 basis points to 1.26%. Sequentially, the NIM was up 3 basis points. Year-over-year, our average interest-bearing deposits increased 7%, while our average non interest-bearing deposits declined 12%. Now, Page 10 has details of our expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $2.7 billion increased 3% primarily reflecting higher investments in technology, which impacted the staff professional legal and other purchase services and the software and equipment expense lines. Additionally, the year-over-year comparison reflects the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and the expenses related to our real estate consolidation. Sequentially, non-interest expense increased primarily reflecting higher investments in technology and expenses associated with the consolidation of our real estate. These expenses were partially offset by lower staff expense due to the impact of vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement eligible employees that was recorded in the first quarter and the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Now, looking ahead to the third quarter, there are few things to factor into your modeling. As it relates to net interest revenue, we expect reinvestment rates to be up significantly versus the third quarter of 2017, but up only modestly versus the second quarter. Deposit betas are behaving as we expected and currently deposit balances are down slightly versus the second quarter average, but it\u2019s still early. We expect this to result in net interest revenue growth in the mid to high single-digit percent range versus the third quarter of 2017 and we still expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%. Before we open the call up for questions, we would like to make some comments on the outcomes of the CCAR process that were released in late June. I wanted to provide a brief reminder on how the process works. There is first a quantitative test and all firms have to satisfy both their internal model driven results and the Fed\u2019s models. And just as a reminder, we don\u2019t have transparency into the how the Fed models work. And as you look at the results, we have been constrained by our own model for the last couple of years. When there is a qualitative assessment, historically this is focused on governance over the process, your capital management policies and how you apply governance to your model output. Now when you look at the results, we believe that our models are conservative. You can see the results of the test over the last couple of years and see the conservatism relative to the Federal Reserve\u2019s estimates and model outputs. So we weren\u2019t surprised by the results. Additionally, our constraining ratio is Tier 1 leverage which is sized based and not risk based. Our models project an increase in client deposits that we assume are pleased at central banks which does not create any incremental risk, but still causes our Tier 1 leverage ratio to decline and constrain our activities. We continue to believe that the Tier 1 leverage ratio should not be constrained on capital actions. This all coupled with the scenario that was more severe and very unlikely to actually occur resulted in capital actions that were lower than some of you expected. I do want to point out that the lower distributions will not have a significant impact on earnings in 2018 or in the CCAR approval period. With a more reasonable scenario, we would expect to be in a position, return to 100% over time whether or not we will change our models. So what does this mean as we look forward, you can assume that we are reviewing our models with urgency. The fed proposals to provide more transparency to the CCAR scenario is in models as well as introduction of the stress capital buffer should all be constructive too. And now, this concludes our remarks and Charlie and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. So I appreciate the forward-looking guidance, I am just curious on the deposit migration that you are seeing, the interest bearing down 12 inches, interest bearing up 7, non-interest bearing down 12, is that, do we look for more of the same in the next several quarters that a function of the rate environment and in other words if we go on the path, that is in the forward curve, is it going to just be chipping away or do you see an end to that client behavior, it just has obviously a big impact on the modeling? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Hey, Glenn, it\u2019s Mike. I will take that. So I think when you look at the non-interest bearing as a percentage of the total, it\u2019s about where we expected it to be and what we have been saying now for a very long, very long time actually and so just it\u2019s just about 30% of the total. And so as we have said a number of times over the last couple of years, we would expect that that percentage to trend down a little bit below 30 over a period of time. And so it\u2019s behaving sort of where we thought it would \u2013 it is right about where we thought it would be. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And then\u2026 Charlie Scharf : And Glenn this is Charlie. It\u2019s just and that\u2019s the way we thought about where it looks like going forward that that continues. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And as I will finish off this and I combo then, does the same apply for the modest decline on the loan side and the incremental deposit betas of what were 60% this quarter? Charlie Scharf : Look, I think on the loans side that will bounce around from any given quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t read into a decline in loans as a go forward trend that\u2019s going to continue to decline. On the deposit betas, you recall that there was a rise in March that\u2019s fully baked into the second quarter and there was a little stub of another rise in June. And so it\u2019s probably a decent indication of where betas are trending right now. Glenn Schorr : Okay, awesome. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Thanks guys. Good morning. Just first question around expenses, can you provide us an update on the kind of $300 million investment initiative you outlined at the Investor Day, I guess a), is it still $300 million, how much of the $300 million already in the run-rate and how we should think about just maybe absolute dollars of expenses as we progressed through the year? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, hey, Alex, this is Mike. Thanks for the question. So as we mentioned last quarter that $300 million investment sort of ramps up throughout the year and so it\u2019s not exactly a linear sort of progression throughout the year, but we are sort of midway through the year and we are sort of approximately sort of where we expected to be in that sort of ramp up and $300 million sort of plus or minus is still sort of the range that we have been looking at. Charlie Scharf : The only thing I would add to it is that what we have talked about relative to where we had hoped the total expense outcome to be for the company. I wouldn\u2019t say there is no meaningful difference there. So to the extent that we decide to spend more money on technology, we will actively seek to manage the overall expense base and that\u2019s still what we are trying to accomplish. Alex Blostein : Yes, got it. That makes sense. And my second just quick cleanup question around Issuer Services, it seems like there is kind of a different dynamic there you guys clearly making progress in the Corporate Trust and DR business has been a lot more muted. As we think about seasonality, I think historically Q3 was a strong quarter for Issuer Services, any kind of drops off in Q4, how should we think about I guess given the changes in business the way you guys have been reporting in here? Charlie Scharf : Yes, I think as you saw last year in the third quarter, Alex, there was that historical sort of pop that you get from the DR business sort of got muted last year. And so while we would expect the number to be a little higher than you saw in the second quarter, you can\u2019t go back a couple of years, you got to sort of look at the new trend there in terms of what you think that the pop might be. Alex Blostein : Got it. Great, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Charlie Scharf : Hey, Mike, if you are talking, we can\u2019t hear you. Operator : Mr. Carrier we are unable to hear you. Please check your mute function. Charlie Scharf : Operator, why don\u2019t we go to the next one? Operator : Okay. Mr. Carrier, did you want to ask your question? Okay, hearing no response, we will move on to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks very much. Just maybe focusing back on the balance sheet, on the asset side, I appreciate your comments Mike about being not moving up as much, but if you can talk about some of the drivers in the second quarter on the Fed Funds and securities repo one, it looks like it was especially large increase and then it looked like there was also a corresponding increase in the liability side there, what was the driver in that and how should we think about that trend going forward? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I think you sort of need to and you\u2019ll probably notice there is, I assume, you are looking at the supplement, Brian, so there is a footnote on the page as well that I would sort of just pointed to, but what happens, we have got a cleared repo product that gets some positive balance sheet treatment that where we will do repos, reverse repos with clients that gets novated over to FICC. And so there is very little that ends up on the balance sheet, so that sort of makes the both the revenue and the rate sort of pop year-on-year and you can get a sense based on the footnote on the bottom of the impact to that. So that\u2019s what you are seeing sort of drive that number or a good chunk of the driver of that number is that program really kicking in and we have seen some good growth there. Brian Bedell : And would you expect that to stay pretty lively I guess with Fed hikes or does it look more sort of abnormal for just this quarter? Mike Santomassimo : No, I think we have seen that. We have seen the demand for that product ramp up over last year. And so while in any given day or week, it sort of moved \u2013 the volume moves around. We have seen that demand stay pretty consistent now over the last number of months. Brian Bedell : Okay. And then just on the follow-up maybe just as we look into 3Q and 4Q, if you can talk a little bit more about the impact to the clearing services run-rate from the JPM transitions, I think you mentioned at the end of the third quarter, just trying to look for sort of a clean number there as we look into the fourth quarter and then also similarly from the two clients lost, appreciate that you are going to be on-boarding folks in the second half of next year, but is there more revenue run-off in the third quarter versus the second quarter given those two clients running off? Mike Santomassimo : So I will start with the second one first. So I think the impact of the lost clients is in the run-rate now for the second quarter, so there is not another drop-off in the Pershing business. So, I think that\u2019s a pretty easy one. I think on the clearance and collateral, we haven\u2019t given you a specific number. But as we sort of think about those migrations, we started with the smaller ones first and then you move to the bigger ones over time. And so \u2013 and by the end of the third quarter, we will have pretty much everything in there. So I think once you get to a third quarter number, you will have \u2013 it will be pretty much fully in our run-rate. So you are seeing a small piece this quarter and you will see a little bit more next quarter and then it will be in our run-rate. Brian Bedell : Okay, thank you. Charlie Scharf : Yes, sorry, the only thing I will add to your question though is when you sort of think about the clearing collateral business, we are also seeing very good growth outside the U.S. So although we focused a lot on sort of the JPMorgan migrations here in the U.S., we have also got a very strong business outside the U.S. and up very strong double-digit growth outside the U.S. in terms of the demand for that product that we have got. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Moving on to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had a follow-up on the deposit beta point, looking at the 15 or so basis points increase in interest-bearing this quarter, but also then thinking about the fact that I think you have said that U.S. dollar deposits are about 70%, was there an increase in non-U.S. dollar deposit costs or should we apply that 15 basis points just to the U.S. dollar which would suggest a beta higher. I am just trying to square that component of the math like if you could help out on that? That will be great. Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. As you know, U.S. rates, our non-U.S. rates have not really moved around that much in the quarter. Now, there is some expectation that, that\u2019s going to start to happen in the third quarter, particularly in the UK at least, but that hasn\u2019t been a big driver so far. So \u2013 and remember as we have said, the betas that are going to continue to sort of increase as rates increase and so on, it sort of implies about a 60% beta for the quarter, we would expect that to keep increasing as rates go up. Brennan Hawken : Yes, it was probably 60% beta, but if we think about the U.S. dollar deposits, wouldn\u2019t it imply a higher beta in the U.S. on the U.S. side since that\u2019s the only thing we saw? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, it would be a little higher. Brennan Hawken : Okay, good. Thanks. Just wanted to clarify that. And then it sounds like non-interest bearing shift you guys think is probably sustainable and in line with what you had expected, do you think that we are going to be continuing to trend lower here in the foreseeable future or is there any sort of visibility that you have into that line as well and the sort of remixing that we would think is natural as rates go higher? That would be great. Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, Brennan, I mean, what we said a little earlier, right is that the percentage of \u2013 the non-interest bearing as a percentage of the total is a little less than 30 rounds, I think the 30% this quarter. That percentage we would expect to sort of grind down as rates rise. And so that may bounce around in any given quarter a little bit, but we would expect that to continue to grind down. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for the color. Operator : We will take our next question from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello. Thank you for taking the question. In terms of capital, you mentioned reviewing your models with some urgency, once you have completed that, would you be thinking about putting in a kind of mid-cycle resubmission that some of the other banks have done in the past to get the payout ratio backup without having to wait for next year\u2019s process? Charlie Scharf : Yes. This is Charlie. I would say, I don\u2019t think we \u2013 I think it\u2019s unclear I think our first \u2013 the first thing we have got to do is do the work on the modeling and that is it\u2019s got to be done properly, it\u2019s detailed, it\u2019s got to be reviewed, it\u2019s got to be signed off. And so we don\u2019t have a date at which that will be done, but the point is we are actively doing it and then depending on when it\u2019s done in our conversations with the Fed that will figure out where we go from there. So, the short answer is we don\u2019t know. Geoffrey Elliott : Thanks. And then the real estate consolidation costs coming down from $100 million to $75 million, is that because you are able to do the same things at a lower cost than you originally expected or is it because you are doing a bit less, you are doing it over a longer timeframe? Charlie Scharf : No, it really relates to one building and we actually sublet it, we know the actual numbers now. Geoffrey Elliott : Terrific. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. I noticed that on the period end balance sheet deposits were down $10 billion, but the balance sheet was down $20 billion, is there a deliberate effort to de-lever a little bit or is there something else going on in terms of the mismatch between the deposit shrinking in the balance sheet? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, there is no effort to de-leverage per se, Jim, as you would suggest. But as you start to look at treasury activity, some of the trades you had put on just make less sense now and so we know we are just looking at how to best optimize sort of some of that. So I wouldn\u2019t read into that. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And then maybe just with the rollback bill that passed that gave you guys a carve out for the SLR, does that help at all or is it just the DFAST remains the constraint and it doesn\u2019t really matter in how you run your business? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, I think \u2013 well, I think that the bills that are out, the bill that got passed plus the some of the Fed proposals still have to get implemented and so that will take some time to sort of play into it. So in a BAU environment, the SLR is still something we are focused on to make sure that we stay where we need to be. But as we sort of think about the future as constructed the Tier 1 leverage ratio in CCAR is the place we are most focused on where our constraint is. Charlie Scharf : Yes, I guess the only editorializing I would do around it is I would describe it certainly helpful, because whenever you have something which you think makes less sense and you wind up with something which you think directionally makes more sense, that\u2019s a positive change in terms of recognition of the way the business should be run. But as Mike mentioned, our current constraint is the Tier 1 leverage ratio in CCAR which quite frankly we struggle with in terms of a concept of constraint is the reason Mike spoke about, but we will see where that one goes as well. Jim Mitchell : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our final question comes as a follow-up question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Alright, great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just wanted to actually circle back more strategically on the balance sheet growth strategy as rates go up you guys have always got deposits would sort of runoff to some extent, but is there, I mean, I guess going forward how do you view this from the client side of the business in terms of what you view as, let\u2019s say, the level of excess deposits that are subject to that potential runoff versus how you want to use deposits as an important product within your toolkit? And then if deposits do runoff, would you be willing to using borrower funds to keep the balance sheet from shrinking significantly? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. So, there is a bunch in there, Brian. So, I will try to get at it, but the \u2013 so, on the last piece we are always looking for opportunities to deploy the balance sheet where it makes sense and where the return make sense. So, that\u2019s something we are looking at now and have always looked at. And so that will sort of continue as we sort of think about that. And where we are focused on deposits is really growing the underlying franchise. So, as Charlie sort of talked about a number of times now like where our focus is, is driving organic growth. And as you sort of do that across most of our products, particularly in investment services, that will bring deposits with it. And so as we sort of think about, there maybe some decline in some of the excess deposits a lot of that sort of run-off already and you have got \u2013 and as you sort of grow the franchise you will bring in new deposits as we do that and can we frame what the level of excess deposits is right now roughly so we can get a sense there? Charlie Scharf : We have not disclosed that. We think that answers\u2026 Brian Bedell : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And it looks like we do actually have another question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Charlie Scharf : Hi Ken. Ken Usdin : Thanks guys. Good morning. Thank you. If I can ask a question on core asset servicing, so at securities lending that line was down 1%, AUC/A were flattish, can you just talk us through some of the dynamics of pluses and minuses in the asset servicing on a sequential basis? Mike Santomassimo : A lot of that Ken is just some seasonal like activity that happens in the first quarter. We get some fess for things like tax reporting and then there are some particularly some other items that sort of hit \u2013 only hit in the first quarter, so I wouldn\u2019t read into that as a run rate decline. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then can you give us just some idea of your \u2013 I know you have stopped giving us the new wins, but can you just give us an idea of the pipeline and how you are expecting that to kind of just project that over time as far as your new wins in servicing? Charlie Scharf : Yes. I would say \u2013 this is Charlie, I think we feel very good about what the wins were both on a gross basis and a net basis in the quarter. And I guess the only other thing I would say is because with lots of people you are right about the way the quarter pans up and whatnot, but you all know this and we talked a little bit about this over the prior quarters. Wins take a period of time, these are generally conversations that happen over multiple quarters leading up to a process generally if you are not going to renew with the incumbent. And so I think where we are today relative to where we hope we would be we are on target and success for us in asset servicing will continue to be a slow steady build which quite frankly it\u2019s hard to look at quarter-by-quarter, you need to look at that over a longer period of time. And I think at this point we still feel on track relative to that commentary. Ken Usdin : Great point, Charlie and if I might just two more cleanups, just related to the numbers, Mike did you say what the benefit on the revenue side was from FX translation on a year-over-year basis put into context with the 2% hurt on the cost side? Mike Santomassimo : We did, it was in my commentary, roughly \u2013 it was roughly about 1%, yes, it\u2019s like roughly 1 point, but there too, remember we mentioned, we also had some leasing gains in [indiscernible] in the prior year. So my own take at this net-net is the overall number is a pretty good, I mean the reported number is a pretty good proxy for what real growth was in the quarter. Well, on the expense side, we did have the effective currency and the real estate. Ken Usdin : And as we roll forward that was my other question on the currency, the way to growth on expenses, if we continue to have this burden on the cost side, is this kind the 3% zone, the right way to think about go forward as well? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I would go back to sort of the guidance we gave at Investor Day on expenses Ken and I think we are sort of tracking there. Ken Usdin : Right, okay. Thanks guys. Operator : And we have a question from Mike Carrier with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Mike Carrier : Hi. Thanks guys. Sorry about that earlier. Just one question on the investment management side, just in terms of the long-term flows in the quarter, I don\u2019t know if you mentioned anything that was more unusual or maybe lumpy, just given the level of outflow this quarter versus what we have been seeing? Mike Santomassimo : So I will take that and Charlie can add color to on, so just to remind you Mike we are very much an institutional money manager, very little retail in there. So you guys think about as you sort of look at some of these line items. I just reiterate the performance has been consistent, Charlie mentioned sort of the 89% over the 3-year and 5-year benchmark, so we feel okay there. And as you sort of look at the some of the equity \u2013 actively managed equity portfolios that\u2019s sort of inline with what you are seeing across the industry. In depth, I would sort of think of some of those outflows is very idiosyncratic clients, changes in allocation for our clients. And then on the cash side, as I mentioned in my commentary, there was some concentration related to some big client M&A activity that brought some balances in on a temporary basis. So, you sort of see that dynamic going through there. Mike Carrier : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I know you guys hit on Pershing just the year-over-year some of the lost business, but I guess just when I think about that business and some of the industry trends that we are seeing, generally it\u2019s fairly favorable, but I just wanted to figure out like how much of that was just very specifically that versus maybe the core of the underlying trends of the business? Charlie Scharf : Yes, let me take a shot at this. I think these are so \u2013 just as I talked about on the asset servicing side where there are long gestation periods when people decide to leave us, it\u2019s the same thing. So, these are things that we have known about for a long time. It\u2019s factored into our thinking about what we think overall trends in revenue can look like. And again these are relatively idiosyncratic relative to when they show up. There continues to be a significant interest in clients of all sizes to talk about their desire to figure out how what we can do at scale relative to not just cost, but building additional capabilities, how they can benefit from that. There is a \u2013 I would describe it, it\u2019s just an extremely open mind in the asset servicing world, where we deal with big asset managers and small asset managers across the world, but also the broker dealer community both bigger and smaller. So I think relative to the way we think about the opportunity in the business, those trends continue to make us feel very good about the business that we have and that\u2019s not even talking about the opportunities within Pershing that we think we continue to have in the RIA space, which we highlighted at Investor Day. Mike Carrier : Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : And there are no further questions in the queue. Valerie Haertel : Thanks everyone for joining us. Feel free to call Investor Relations if you have any follow-up and have a great day. Charlie Scharf : Thank you everyone. Operator : And if there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference and webcast. Thank you for participating.",

Good morning and welcome to the BNY Mellon's Third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. This morning BNY Mellon released the results for the third quarter of 2018. The earnings press release and a financial highlights presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at bnymellon.com. Charlie Scharf, BNY Mellon\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer will lead this morning's conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Mike Santomassimo, our chief financial officer. Following Mike's remarks there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC available on our website bnymellon.com. Forward looking statements made on this call speak only as of today October 18, 2018. We will not update forward-looking statements. With that I will now turn it over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Thank You Scott and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. Before asking Mike to walk you through the financials let me frame the quarter with some thoughts on how our businesses are performing. In terms of the headline numbers earnings per share of a $1.06 was up 13% from last year's third quarter. These results included two significant items approximately $0.05 from litigation charges and a $0.05 benefit in our tax line. Year-over-year revenue grew 1%. Expenses grew 3% though 2% of that was related to litigation and we continue to benefit from reduction in our tax rate related to the new tax law in the U.S. and from strong capital return. While we are not pleased with our total revenue growth for this quarter there are some areas with modest strengths and others that are weaker several of which we believe will strengthen over the time. Our investment services revenue growth was 3% and investment management revenue growth is 2%. These were partially offset by lower revenue in the other segments. Mike will cover that later. As I said since joining the company we're not satisfied with our growth. As we've been too reliant historically on the impact of the markets, our focus on organic growth will take time to show up in the revenue line across our businesses and though small there continue to be signs of positive momentum in some areas which we'll cover. With the reality that it will take time to see the impact of our growth activities show up in the revenue growth line, we are disciplined on expenses and will continue to be. Though our expenses increased 3% I mentioned that 2% of the increased related to litigation. So excluding litigation charges we at minimal expense growth. You also know that we've been significantly increasing our investment in technology and infrastructure to get to minimal expense growth all other expenses in total were lower than the prior year. I will discuss this a little more later but we will continue to focus on improving our structural operating leverage while continuing to invest for growth. Looking at our businesses let me first start with asset servicing. Asset servicing revenue growth is 3% and we had a reasonable fee that interest revenue and FX growth. We again saw steady performance in our core custody, middle office and fund accounting revenues on-boarding more than $450 billion of AUCA across a number of investment managers and other clients. Additionally, we have a mandate to provide middle office outsourcing for significant private credit manager where we're investing in new capabilities. Securities lending benefited from the increased demand for highly liquid assets primarily U.S. treasuries and we're benefiting from new clients and expanded business with existing clients and our growth in client driven foreign exchange revenue was driven by new business wins, higher session range volumes and market spreads. Our global pipeline remains strong across all major assets servicing products. As asset managers continue to look for ways to reduce their costs we're seeing increasing consolidation of global operations and technology which is driving demand for outsourcing managed services and data management solutions. In Pershing while we saw a reduction in revenue last quarter from two previously disclosed client losses our total revenues were flat to last quarter and up 3% from the prior year. So this means growth is offsetting these losses. As a reminder we've been awarded multiple mandates that will begin to positively impact results starting in the second half of next year and more significantly into 2020. Timing aside we're confident as ever in our ability to continue to build Pershing over the long term. In issuer services, revenue growth of 2% was driven by mid-single digit growth in corporate trusts partially offset by a decline in depository receipts. Quarter-by-quarter performance in depository receipts as episodic and several significant client events have been pushed from the third quarter into future quarters. Although, the DR markets are weak we're winning our fair share now while remaining disciplined on structure and full-year revenue growth should be strong. Corporate trusts revenue growth was driven by the repositioning of our front office sales and relationship management teams and by better coordinating with our firm wide global client management team to leverage our relationships for deals that our financial institutions and asset management clients are bringing. This is yielding opportunities and mandates and I should add that our pipeline remains strong particularly for CLOs and corporate debt. We have had good momentum with clients although market share stats are imperfect in this business it appears that we've gained some traction in the first half of the year. We've also started to deliver new digital capabilities that give clients better transparency into their loan positions, compliance data, cash activity and trade information and it's been well received. In treasury services, Paul Camp joined us this quarter as the new leader for this business. Paul has tremendous experience and has already brought a renewed sense of urgency and has some great ideas for building our business into a stronger growth engine for the company. Having said that we continue to see growth albeit less than we like in our payment volumes from existing and new clients and are focused on growing the liability balances from our treasury services clients. We're continuing to invest in capabilities such as real-time payments which should help differentiate our offering. In clearance and collateral management we reported 8% revenue growth. We again saw strong revenue growth from the on-boarding of the remaining former JP Morgan government clearing broker dealer clients, higher clearance volumes related to record issuance levels and strong demand for U.S. government debt and treasury issuances and growth in collateral management activity from new business and increased client activity. Here we're seeing interest from new entrants to the collateral market such as corporates in alternatives investing their cash in repo as well as the continued rollout of rules requiring segregation of margin related to derivatives. Our capabilities in clearance and collateral management are a clear point of differentiation. Once such point of differentiation is our collateral optimization engine, it has significant growth potential as collateral management business becomes increasingly important part of the investment process. Turning to investment management, the environment continues to be difficult for the industry and we achieved 2% revenue growth this quarter. We continue to focus on investment performance drive to scaling our business, invest in product development and distribution capabilities and strengthen our wealth management franchise. Net flows return positive this quarter with $15 billion in net inflows. We saw strong flows in LDI as well as positive flows and fixed income and multi assets in alternatives and our U.S. multi asset manager which we've rebranded Mellon has had good activity across a range of asset types including entering into a new sub advisory partnership. In our wealth management business Catherine Keating joined us as CEO and is already identifying opportunities to strengthen this business. We have lot more to say about this in the future. In terms of talent we are continuing to attract great people at all levels of the company. We are working to develop and capitalize on the deep knowledge and specialized expertise that exists across our company and complimenting that with new outside perspectives. In addition to appointing Catherine we added a number of other senior leaders this quarter who expect to play the major roles in increased growth and profitability. These include Roman Regelman who joined us as head of digital he will lead and coordinate our thinking as he set the strategic direction for additional future including data management, analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics. Akash Shah has joined the company in the newly created role of head of strategy. Akash joined us from McKinsey where he called at the capital markets and investment banking practice. And has a strong background focused on exactly what were the [ indiscernible 00 :58-3] transforming businesses for the future and positioning them to drive organic growth and innovation. Emily Portney joined us as our new head of assets servicing for the Americas and will help drive our business forward in the U.S., Latin America as well as overseeing our interest in the CIBC Mellon Assets Servicing a joint venture in Canada. And we announced two key technology hires after quarter end Sabet Elias has joined us as chief technology officer bringing extensive experience in building and operating global high performance machine critical technology environments and Avi Shua was appointed technology lead for wealth management helping us build technology platforms to grow our wealth management business which as I said is a key priority. We are thrilled at our ability to attract such an outstanding group from top tier institutions. So as we look forward, we will continue to methodically build out our capabilities and teams. We have been investing in technology both to improve our existing operations in infrastructure and to build new capabilities for clients and we will continue to invest. We will remain keenly focused on expenses. We continue to believe there is meaningful opportunities to become more efficient which will help fund the technology investments we need to make as well as provide improved service for our clients and we are highly focused on driving that efficiency in both the short and long term. And I will close by describing how I think you would feel if you are inside the company. As I have said we are proud company and we are strong company with exceptional client relationships and we have great subject matter expertise inside the company. But we are not performing as well financially as we would like. We believe our franchise is capable of delivering more organic growth than we delivered thus far. And we are focused business-by-business on changing our thinking developing capabilities, improving the quality of our work and aligning internal resources to achieve this end becoming more efficient is important part of the puzzle. We believe that increased efficiency improves the quality of our work, allows us to invest in what's important for our clients and its pro growth. Importantly, there is a shared understanding that we will hold each other accountable for higher standards of performance and proceed with the strong sense of urgency. Given the nature of our business all the work we are doing will take time to come through in our numbers but I want you to know that every day we are challenging ourselves to get there faster. With that let me turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Great. Thanks Charlie. Good morning everyone. Let me run through the details of our results. Then provide some thoughts on the fourth quarter. Note that all comparisons will be on year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise. Beginning on page 3 of the financial highlights document, in the third quarter we had earnings of $1.1 billion and earnings per share of a $1.06 up 13%. There were two significant items included in the quarter. We incurred litigation charges that increased expenses 2% which negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.05. The charges related to new development for the quarter are previously disclosed matters that we anticipate resolving shortly. And we had a net benefit of approximately $0.05 per share resulting from adjustments to our provisional estimates for the impact of the U.S. tax legislation from last year and other tax changes with decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 4.5%. Year-to-date we had earnings of $3.3 billion or $3.20 per share up 21%. In terms of shareholder capital returned year-to-date we have returned $2.7 billion to common shareholders through $1.9 billion of share repurchases and approximately $800 million in dividends. That includes actions taken during the third quarter where we repurchased 12 million shares for $602 million and paid $283 in dividends. Now turning to the third quarter highlights on page 4. During the third quarter total revenue was up 1%, we did have a couple of items that impacted the revenue growth rate. Securities gains in the third quarter of 2017, lowered foreign exchange currency hedging revenue and the pre-tax impact of our renewable energy investments negatively impacted growth by almost 1.5%. Just a reminder that we get the benefit of our wind investments or renewable energy investments in the tax line but have pre-tax costs that are included in investment in other income. Fee revenue was up 1% to $3.2 billion growth in the quarter benefited from higher equity market values, collateral management and clearance volumes and performance fees. We saw reasonable growth in our assets servicing business including the client driven foreign exchange fees as well as in our corporate trust and clearance and collateral management businesses. Investment management and performance fees together grew 2%. Fees and purging were essentially flat despite the impact of the previously lost clients. Third quarter net interest revenue increased 6% to $$891 million driven by higher interest rates partially offset by lower interest earning deposits and other borrowings. As expected our deposit balances were down year-over-year and sequentially. Year-over-year our average interest-bearing deposits increased 4% while our average non-interest bearing deposits declined 14%. As we have consistently said for our clients that deposit pricing is continually becoming more competitive. With betas increasing as rates rise. On page 7 of our earnings release you can see that the rates on our interest bearing deposits increased from 45 basis points in the second quarter to 63 basis points this quarter. On the surface this would imply deposit beta of approximately 72% globally but when you get to the underlying data for interest-bearing U.S. dollar client deposits which excludes wholesale funding, it is really in low to mid 80% range. The net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 1.27% sequentially the, NIM was up one basis point. Our expenses grew 3% to $2.7 billion as I mentioned earlier litigation increased expenses approximately 2%. The remaining growth in the quarter was due to the continued investments we were making in technology which was partially offset by declines in other areas. As Charlie mentioned we are focused on delivering on our technology investments and driving efficiency across everything else we do. All these items resulted in a 2% decline in pre-tax income to $1.3 billion. The litigation charges negatively impacted pre-tax income growth by approximately 4% and a 9% increase in net income applicable to common shareholders to $1.1 billion which benefited from the lower tax rate. This performance coupled with the reduction in our share account translated to a [13%] increase in earnings per share to $1.06. Our pre-tax operating margin was 33% down 1% from the prior year period. Again the litigation negatively impacted the pre-tax margin by approximately 100 basis points. Our capital position and returns continue to be strong. Our CET1 ratio with 11.2% and our return on tangible common equity was 23%. Before we go deeper into the quarter on page 6 are the year-to-date results which track well with the discussion we had at investor day. Total revenue was up approximately 5% and expenses were up approximately 3% generating solid operating leverage. Foreign exchange translation increased old growth rates by about 100 basis points. Net income applicable to common shareholders was up 17%. Earnings per share was up 21% and return on tangible common equity was up more than 200 basis points to more than 24%. Page 8 highlights our investment services business results. Investment services revenue was $3.1 billion up 3%. Within investment services assets servicing revenue grew 3% to 1.5 billion primarily reflecting higher equity market values, securities lending volumes, net interest revenue and foreign exchange volumes. This includes a reasonable increase in assets servicing fees and a 27% increase in securities lending revenue driven by increased demand for U.S. government securities and some new client activity. Purging revenue was up 3% to $558 million a result of higher net interest revenue, equity markets, long-term mutual fund balances partially offset by the impact of previously disclosed lost business. As I mentioned fees were flat despite the impact of their previously disclosed lost business. Issuer services revenue was up 2% to $453 million primarily reflecting higher interest revenue in corporate trusts. Corporate trusts related revenue was up mid-single digits offset by declines in depository receipts. The sequential increase of 5% reflects seasonality in depository receives. Treasury services revenue increased 3% year-over-year to $324 million primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue and transaction volumes. Clearance and collateral management revenue was up 8% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially to $264 million. The year-over-year increase reflects growth in collateral management clearance volumes in net interest revenues. These increases are primarily due to the on-boarding of the new government clearing clients which was substantially completed in the quarter. As a result of the clients onboard and other increases in activity average tri-party collateral manager balances were up 18% and are just under 3 trillion. Non-interest expense within investment services increased 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $2 billion. The litigation charge negatively impacted expenses by approximately 3% year-over-year and sequentially. The remaining expense growth was primarily driven by increased investments in technology offset by lower staff expense. Also foreign exchange and other trading revenue increased 5% from higher volumes. Assets under custody and/or administration grew 7% to $34.5 trillion and in pershing despite the lost business average long-term mutual fund assets were up 5% year-over-year and average clearing accounts were down just 2%. So some key metrics are showing positive momentum at point to higher organic revenue over time. Turning to page 9 for investment management highlights. Asset management revenue increased 2% to $704 million benefiting from growth in the equity markets and higher performance fees which were partially offset by the impact of net outflows in prior quarters and by lost revenue associated with the sales center square. Wealth management revenue was up 1% to $311 million and down 2% sequentially with the sequential decline a result of lowered interest revenue partially offset by higher equity market values. Assets under management increased slightly year-over-year and increased 1% sequentially to 1.8 trillion. Asset flows improved in most asset classes with net flows of $15 billion. Our actively managed strategies experienced 18 billion in net inflows with $16 billion in LDI inflows, $2 billion in multi asset and alternative inflows and $2 billion in fixed income flows partially offset by active equity outflows of $2 billion. Index had outflows of $3 billion primarily due to outflows from clients for whom we supervised on their index strategies. Cash was flat. Turning to our other segments on page 10 fee revenue decreases year-over-year sequentially primarily reflecting the pre-tax impact of our investments in renewable energy as I mentioned before we get the benefit from these investments in tax line and foreign currency hedging. Non-interest expense decrease primarily reflecting lower staff cost. Turning to capital and liquidity on page 11 our capital and liquidity ratios at September 30, 2018 improved since the end of the second quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital totaled $18.5 billion at September 30, 2018 and our CET1 ratio was 11.2% under the advanced approach. The supplementary leverage ratio was 6.4% and our average LCR in the third quarter was 121%. Now page 12 details our expenses. On a consolidated basis expenses of $2.7 billion increased 3%. The litigation charges negatively impacted the expense growth by approximately 2%. The remaining growth is primarily due to investments in technology partially offset by lower staff expense and lower distribution and servicing expenses. Note that the technology expenses are included in staff, professional, legal, and other purchase services and in software equipment. Expenses were down slightly sequentially primarily reflecting lower net occupancy staff and business development expenses partially offset by higher litigation. The decrease in net occupancy expense is primarily due to the expenses associated with the relocation of our headquarters that was recorded in the second quarter. Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter there are a few things to factor in your modeling. As a reminder our results in the fourth quarter of 2017 included impacts from the U.S. tax bill and severance litigation and other charges. The total cost of relocating our corporate headquarters is estimated to be approximately $75 million of which $12 million was recorded in the second quarter and we expect to record the remaining expense in the fourth quarter. Excluding the real estate cost we would expect the growth rate of our overall expenses in the fourth quarter year-over-year to be directionally similar to what you've seen year-to-date which implies in modest uptake from the third quarter consistent with prior years. As it relates to net interest revenue you should factor in the following. At this early point in the quarter overall deposit levels are slightly higher than the average for the third quarter with non-interest bearing deposits about at the same level. As rates rise we expect deposit beta to continue to increase which we think is consistent with what is happening in the market. We are assuming that one month and three month LIBOR are slightly above the current level on average for the quarter but we have seen some compression and spreads between one month and three months LIBOR and the fed funds rate that will have an impact in the fourth quarter. If these assumptions play out it should result in net interest revenue being similar to what you saw this quarter. Fourth quarter seasonal performance fees are expected to be in line with the fourth quarter of 2017 and excluding the significant items in the third quarter we still expect our full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 21%. With that operator can you please open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning guys. On the asset servicing business so wonder if you can detail a little bit more the flattish kind of results but you said you had some benefits from the broker-dealer business. Can you walk us through how did collateral management act and just out of the core asset servicing act? You mentioned some pending potential wins and not sure if you meant that those were converted as well. So just if we can get the flush out color on what you're seeing currently and what you're expecting out of the core asset servicing. Thanks. Charlie Scharf : Hey Ken are you talking about asset servicing or pershing? Ken Usdin : Asset servicing. Didn't the broker dealer clients come in throughout the servicing are you saying they came in through clearing on the fee side? Somebody at the income statement. Charlie Scharf : Asset servicing revenue growth was 3% overall and when you look at it the underlying fee growth was reasonable we had net interest revenue growth and FX growth. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, so I think so let me sort of dig in a little bit Ken for you. So obviously I will just pick it apart so tell me if I miss something but for the new clients that Charlie referenced that we on-boarded very little revenue in the quarter from them so far. So you'll start to see that kick in as you look forward. So that didn't contribute much to this quarter. I think for the where you'll see the new JP Morgan, the clients that converted over from JP Morgan that'll be in the clearance and collateral business line in our release and as you sort of think about the asset service seeing fee line as Charlie said when you sort of dig into the underlying businesses both an asset servicing and clearance and collateral we saw some reasonable growth involved quarter-to-quarter. Ken Usdin : I got it. Yes there's a little mixing matching there between business line and income statement I think that's where my question was a bit confusing but thanks for clearing that up Mike. And then okay so then separately just on the balance sheet the beta's can you talk about \u2013 you talked about that you expect them to move up from here, can you do it \u2013 would you still anticipate as long as LIBOR is moving the right way can the NIM expand from here or is it going to be more of a function of just what the mix is looking like every quarter because obviously there's pushes and pulls between the dollars and the NIM spread. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, I think on NIM Ken, I don't know that you can expect it's always going to be a straight line up right, but I think you sort of look at the various components of it that where we're sort of our biggest driver as you know well is sort of how we were reinvesting in securities portfolio and those deals continue to sort of move up each quarter. So, all the we're seeing probably a 15 basis points sort of increase and sort of pay downs versus where we're reinvesting their votes. So, maybe a little more little less depending on an average depending on sort of where you are. So, I think you can see the NIM sort of grind up over time but I don\u2019t know that you can always expect it to be sort of a straight line up every quarter. And I think when it goes to LIBOR, as we said in sort of my commentary, we're sort of expecting LIBOR to be slightly above, call it a few basis points above what you see one and three months today and that all sort of give you the result of which sort of highlighted in the release. Charlie Scharf : The only thing I'd add is just remembering the timing of the change in days doesn't always align with the timing of the re-pricing of our portfolio. Yes. Ken Usdin : Thanks guys, I appreciate that. Charlie Scharf : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hi guys, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just picking up on the last discussion. I guess, understanding that quarter-to-quarter the balance sheet could be a little volatile but as you look out to next couple of years and we continue to go through the rate cycle, how do you expect the balance sheet to perform. Do you think there is any growth there or do should we think the balance sheet will continue to kind of shrink and then in terms of the mix between interest and non-interest bearing deposits, kind of similar so I guess that has been coming down a little bit, I think you guys have about 29% of non-interest bearing as a percentage of total. When you look pre-crisis, I think that was somewhere in the mid-20. So, should we think of that as still kind of reasonable level toward non-interest bearing deposits will go? Charlie Scharf : Hey Alex, it's Charlie. Let me start with just some broad comments and then I'll hand it over to Mike. I think one of the interesting thing is that we have as we've gone through this rate cycle, as I think we all believe that we can be far more proactive as we do of our clients in understanding what's going on with deposits and being more proactive without attracting the kind of deposits that we would like to attract. I think its true and almost all the businesses that we have. So, I think the level of rigor that we have today about thinking about rates, thinking about conversations with clients, making our desires clear across asset servicing corporate trust, clearing some collateral management, treasury services, all of them. I think over a period of time, we feel absolutely like we could do a better job at attracting balances as opposed to having balances just be something that happens to us. That obviously takes some period of time but it's a very different kind of discussion today than we were having six or nine months ago here. Mike Santomassimo : And I would, I'll add a few things. So, I'll just add and as we sort of grow the underlying client franchise, that's going to bring deposits with us. So, that's another piece where you will see some grow overtime. I think, as you sort of think about the non-interest bearing deposits in the percentage of the total, I think we've been pretty consistent over the last couple of years that we seem to add that percentage will sort of grind down. But it's been it bumps around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, a little lower last quarter to a little 29%. This quarter you can see that from the release. I will though just remind you a little bit about the nature of our deposit base. We don\u2019t just close non-interest bearing by line of business but when you sort of what we showed at the Investor Day was about half of our deposits in total are from asset servicing. And the rest the next biggest pieces are corporate trust and treasury services. When you look at the non-interest bearing components of it, the percentage that come from the asset servicing business, that sort of traditional asset managers hedge fund private equity, the whole mix is far less than 50%. So, the other pieces of the puzzle namely corporate trust and trading services drive the bigger piece of the overall non-interest bearing for us. So, that should sort of needs to be factored in and so sort of think about the trajectory of them over time. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thanks for that, it's a useful color. And I guess my second question just around clearing fees and those are just the actual fees and not the entire business line item. So, down a little sequentially and I think it's largely a U.S. business for you guys. So, I guess market should have been a little bit of a helper. Is it all due to just below our client activities, lower volumes, in the third quarter or is there something there going on underneath? Mike Santomassimo : I mean, the third quarter typically is a little bit slower than the second quarter but so there's nothing there's no underlying trend there at all. Alex Blostein : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Just actually wanted to follow up on that last point in question on the non-interest bearers and like there was thanks for enlightening us all of the different business mix which definitely leads to a larger portion and non-interest -- deposits. Mike Santomassimo : Wait, see -- what. Brennan Hawken : In the past we've heard that there were certain economic incentives provided to clients such as fee credits on some of those non-interest bearers. But that explanation was under the prior management team. So, kind of curious whether you all have sustained some of those incentives or whether the approach to those deposits has changed at all under your guy's plans and your approach. Mike Santomassimo : Now, hi Brennan. I think that where you have earnings credits which is a pretty normal thing to do for some businesses has really focused on our Treasury Services business. You don\u2019t see earnings credits at any or not really prevalent than the other businesses. And so, that's how which is a pretty consistent way that us and others provide value for some of those client deposits in treasury services. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying that. And then, thinking about the portion of deposits that are in U.S. dollar, is it still around 70% for you all and if so was there just some kind of noise in the deposit cost this quarter or catch-up or what have you that worked out to about the 80% deposit beta that you referenced Mike earlier. Because when I do the math, I get to a number that's a bit higher than that. So, just curious whether I need to make some adjustments to my calc. Mike Santomassimo : I think you do. But the -- so, I think it's sort of highlighted in my commentary, Brennan. So, it's really the wholesale funding which is a very small piece of our overall funding mix, drives some of that surface level sort of a calc that you've got there. So, when you dig underneath that though, it's what I refer to the 80% to 80% low 80% range, low to mid-80% range, which again I'll say is very consistent with what we're seeing and hearing from clients across in markets. Brennan Hawken : Great, thanks. Well, I'll follow-up offline for some of the details on that wholesale funding adjustment. Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So, I just wanted to dig in and to your just on tax some of the commentary on deposits but more specific to the impact at QV online. I think the last fulsome update you gave was at 2014 Investor Day, you guide it to about 40 to 70 billion in of expected deposits run-off from that balance sheet normalization. And since you gave that guidance, it looks like deposits have come down about 30 billion or so. And now that we does have better visibility in that process, I was hoping you could maybe help us frame how to think about the remaining run-off impact as the fed continues its process over the next couple of years. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Look Steven, its Mike. Like you were referring at some guidance that was provided I think back in 2014. It's a lot obviously has evolved since then. But I think when you think about wholesale deposits more generally, they are definitely correlated to what you're seeing in excess reserves as a fed. And so, as that sort of grinds down, you're going to see liquidity come out of the system. And that all that's equal potentially drives deposits continues to drive deposits down a bit. But as Charlie mentioned, I think we think there's an opportunity to be more proactive, smarter, about how we sort of go after the opportunity with our clients as well as sort of the impact more how this sort of grow line franchise. So, I don\u2019t think you can just take the fed QV online is sort of let's think it about it in a linear way as you think about our deposit base. Steven Chubak : Okay. So, just as a follow-up, is there an expectation that there's enough of it organic growth opportunity where you could actually see the deposit balances increase even with the headwind from fed QV online only because the impact seems to be fairly pronounced and the correlation quite high around 96% between the two. Your deposits and industry excess reserves. Mike Santomassimo : We're not going to predict it at this point. Obviously time will tell but I think we feel like we could a better job at gathering deposits in any environment whether it's in an environment with the effects of the unwinding of QV rising performing rates, any of the above, how those two interact, we'll have to see. Steven Chubak : Got it. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Mike Santomassimo : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Mike Carrier : Right, thanks guys. First question is just on the asset servicing and this is just on the fees. When I look at it sequentially, it seems like that was a bit more muted. You've just given what we would have expected just from the market returns. Maybe just a little color if you can provide on what else is included in that line, is there some seasonality from like a transaction standpoint that can limit the growth in like the third quarter? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, like I think would -- hey Mike its Mike. I think we said I think at one point a year or two ago, like that it's you can't think about it just based on what's happening in the market. The asset servicing fee line I think what we've said a while ago, let's call it 25% or 30% of it's influenced by overall market levels or the -- and that will sort of move up and down. But you've got impacts from transaction volumes that go through there and a whole series of other little factors that may drive it sequentially in a quarter or two, quarter-to-quarter. Mike Carrier : Okay, that's helpful. And then, just on the expenses, on the legal item, just any color around that and if it was like a one-off versus would be kind of ongoing legal cost. I'm just trying to understand that just in a relative to like going forward for a run rate there? Charlie Scharf : Yes, this is Charlie. Listen, I think we have a fairly clear disclosures about what the litigation we have in progress. This one related to approaching conclusion for two of those items that were mentioned. So, we obviously have the remaining items to go. Some might get results sooner, much some other might go around for a long time but they were known cases that moved along I would say quicker than we probably would have thought a couple of months ago and that's what happens when you have settlement discussions in there are other things going on with others in the industry as well. Mike Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just go back to fourth quarter seasonality. Maybe, Mike if you could just touch on a couple of different areas. Clearly, we have the performance fees from investment management but maybe if you can flash out the deposits where you receive come in and the delay of revenue into fourth quarter from what typically is seasonally strong third quarter. And then, any other areas clearly volumes tend to be strong in the fourth quarter but maybe just to clarify what you think can be the improvement on the Pershing side and then also the contribution from JPM on the clearance and collateral management side. Mike Santomassimo : Okay. I'll try to pick that and maybe hopefully that go all your pieces Brian. Thanks for the question. As you sort of think about PRs, these events that cause bigger fees in any given quarter or not in our control, so it's sort of corporate rigor or dividends, splits, things like that. And so, I think coincidentally a bunch of that stuff historically happened in the third quarter. And there's a couple of items that got pushed out of the third quarter and the future quarter. So, whether it happens in the fourth quarter or in a quarter or two, I think that will be dependent upon the clients finalizing their activities. And so, you will sort of see that come through. But there are one or two of those as Charlie sort of mentioned. As you sort of think about Pershing on a go forth basis, I think you saw over the last two quarters that things sort of stabilize post the client losses. We did highlight last year that there were some termination fees related to the losses in the fourth quarter. So, that will have a bit of a impact on the sequential results. But overall, we're seeing good activity in that business, pretty consistent and pretty consistent activity in that business over the last number of months. Then I think those are the items --. Brian Bedell : JPM clearing --. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. So, we did finish the conversion of JPMorgan clients into the business, probably a later part of the third quarter. So, you will see a little bit of an uptick as we go into the fourth quarter, so you'll see that in the run rate as we go. Charlie Scharf : And this is Charlie. I just want to just maybe just make a couple of comments about revenue growth look beyond next quarter. So, I think first, I guess the way I would characterize it is I think when you just think I mean look at the businesses and the way they're performing today and our expectations for opportunities are. Within the investment services business which produce 3% revenue growth this quarter in total, asset servicing was 3% growth. When we sit here and think about the opportunities that sit in front of us versus the pressures, we think there are more opportunities than there are pressures. We think whatever pressures exist will continue but we have opportunities to grow that business faster than we have. And as I've said that is a long cycle of business from the sales perspective and it takes time but we feel very good about our position in the opportunities. Pershing, we've talked about multiple times, we have these, we have two specific losses that we've known about for a long time, it effects the numbers in the short term, we know we have a series of winds that were in the process of on boarding which take a long time to do the work. We have the expenses embedded in our results or at least a big part of it to do that, we have no revenues from it, we know they're coming but more importantly we love our position in the business. We believe we got significant opportunity in the RIA space. And so, again we're not going to put timeframes around it necessarily but relative to the quality of the business and the opportunity we think it's significant. Issue or services space, corporate trust, that is one where you start to see progress more quickly and that's a little bit lock intact going its better technology, it's a better Salesforce, that's better organized, leveraging the relationships across the franchise and we're starting to see that impact. DRs as we said very seasonal quarter-to-quarter, lot of volatility year-over-year I think the numbers will be pretty strong relative to what we saw last year. Treasury services, new leader meaningful opportunity for us in a much more significant way than we've had in the past. And I put wealth management in that category as well. So, I just think I know obviously there is lot of focus on quarter-by-quarter, I say this consistently hard to move these businesses in a single quarter. But as we think about what the opportunities are given the market positions that we have and the type of people that we're bringing in with the ideas that we have. It's we certainly feel good about the opportunity, it's just going to take some time. Brian Bedell : That was exactly my second question, Charlie through we anticipated it. Thanks for that. Maybe just one little area on middle office that you need to cover. You guys really start to ramp that up when you order the T. Rowe deal and I think you would to an another mandate coming soon. Maybe just talk about your strategy there, obviously stage two is in the big fish in the pond on that one. Do you guys plan on being more aggressive in that space? Charlie Scharf : Yes. I think middle office is it's complicated as you all know. It's complicated because there's no one middle office solution out in the market place. Historically, they've been very bespoke. Generally more complicated than people think when you decide to take something on. And so, I'm not sure when you look at the profitability across the industry the idea of we don\u2019t look to middle office to be a gigantic profit contributor to the company. Having said that, it is a very it\u2019s a paying point for our clients. We think over a period of time we can't help build scale which means we have to create some more consistency in the industry. And if we can do that for clients that gives you the opportunity to talk more broadly about other pieces to the equation. So, that's something that we are interested in doing. It has four more important deeper relations for us. And so, we'll continue to do that. Longer term more broadly, we all as an industry there's opportunities to figure out how do simplify middle office dramatically and that's something that we're equally focused on over the much longer term. But in the short term, it is an opportunity for us to help our clients. Brian Bedell : Great. Thank you, for the color. Charlie Scharf : Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Charlie Scharf : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. Charlie you spent a lot of time on the new hires. Where are you in terms of changing the culture, how long should that take and what do the new hires bring to the table? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Obviously it's a hard question to answer where are we. I think and I tried to in my remarks talk about the way you feel if you're inside the company to get to that point. I think this is a company of 53,000 people that's done certain things a certain way and it takes time. And when I takes time, I don\u2019t think it's a question of winning the hearts and minds of people here. I think as I said before it's a very objective group of people that come in genuinely every day and want to do a better job for the clients which ultimately should translate to better result for ourselves. It's a question of what does that mean, how do we operate, do we have enough people role-modeling behaviors and things like that. And so, if I had to say where we were, I would probably in the earlier innings rather than the later innings but I also feel like if you were to talk to people inside the company we've been here, they would say I hope I think they would say it's fairly substantially different. We have I think and I've seen this in my prior lives I think this question of bring accountant from the outside, it is a question of balance. And I really genuinely mean this, I've said this in my remarks, we have great subject matter expertise here. As I've said we've got people that deeply care about clients but you can't be two inwardly focused in an environment which is changing dramatically around you. And so, the idea of bringing in people that have just been at different companies that think about the businesses differently, operate with a different sense of urgency than we've operated in the past had experienced a growing businesses. Those are all additive to the discussion when you're sitting around the table along with that consistency. So, you will not and I had say call individuals out because it puts a lot of pressure on them and also it's a little bit unfair on everyone else. But I mention Paul Camp who joined us to run treasury services. We have a strong treasury services business today which is high quality. But we think that we can do much more than has been done with it. I think if you were to talk to people inside the company what has Paul brought to it in the short time he's been here, you walk into a meeting with Paul and you got energy, you got excitement, he has huge respect for what's been built here in treasury services but then will talk about all the opportunities in front of us both in terms of how we organize, in terms of where we want to get more aggressive, in terms of kind of products we need to build. So, it's just it should be a shot in the arm for business or areas that complement the great talent that we have here. So, this is not a question of replacing every job with someone on the outside but and I -- we don\u2019t usually go out and call out peoples name specifically but this it's a substantial list of people in very senior jobs which we think will be very important not just in their areas but helping shape the mind-set of what growth means. Now, I said this before, growth has not, we just don\u2019t come in one day and decide okay we want to grow today. So, let's just tell everyone and make it happen. Growth is about teaching how to go about doing that, it's you need to think about do you have people in place that actually can think about the strengths of the organization, what products we should be building, how we should work more closely across the organization. Do we have the right product set, do we have the right people in product development, are we incenting people properly for it. I mean, the list goes on and on. And so, having some people that have done that before that think that way, helping role model those behaviors for people here that are very open minded about it. I hope over a period of time it just continues to build on the transformation that's in progress here. I hope that was helpful. Mike Mayo : All right. Yes, that was very comprehensive, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Charlie Scharf : Good morning. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a question on expense. -- good morning. A Question on expense. As you talked about a meaningful opportunity to get more efficient in the short and the long term. Can you maybe give us a little more detail on where you see the biggest opportunities to get more efficient? Charlie Scharf : Yes. So, I think -- and thank you for the question. Because we do get a lot of questions from people saying well we've done a good job of controlling expenses over a period of time, is there more to go. I personally think there is a lot more to go and it's not because we've done a bad job, it's because it's like peeling an onion back. The more you peel the onion back, you start to see the next layer. And I think that's what we're experiencing. And it's the short term and its long term. It is tactical and it's structural. Examples: we've done a very good job here if you look at real-estate costs. If you look at what's driven our ability become more efficient over the past four years or so, a lot of it's been driven by being smarter about consolidating and moving the lower cost locations. Having said that, we still have more we can do. We've highlighted the fact that we relocated corporate headquarters. The building where we're sitting in now which is our corporate headquarters, we probably have 3000 on grounding, 3000 or so people in it at the beginning of the year. We got out of 325,000 square feet couple of blocks away. Some of us are here, the rest will be here by November. We're going to get paid call it forget about the accounting for a second, we're going to get $15 million to $20 million a year by someone to sublet that space. We have 3800 or so people in it by the end of the year. We think we can get 5000 to 6000 people in this building. And by the way, again we can go back historically and so and it's not as if that wasn\u2019t happening but as these things happen you get more and more clarity and more and more opportunity. We think about how we manage the company. I many, pretty basic things; layers in the company. When you think about and then think about the layers between me and the most junior people inside the company. And across the company consistently it's 10 to an 11; which is far more than I've experienced in other organizations; average spends of controls. And then you go through some of the more structural things and we just think about the physical manual work that we do that should be automated. And so, as we think and as we think about this, we're focused on really two different dimensions. 1) In the short term, we are going to spend more money on technology. That is the livelihood of who we are; we need to do it; we need to improve our basic operating infrastructure; and we need to build products and capabilities for the future. That will take more to do. And so, we need to continue to drive these efficiencies in the shorter term, not because we needed to fund that stuff but because it will fund that stuff. And as you walk around the place, it becomes more obvious what these things are. At the same time, over the longer term, we do need to build capabilities that allow us to become much more structurally efficient, those are multi-year projects that relate towards automating tasks that are manual today using technology and things like that. So, as we look over in a multi-year period, it's something that we think is there's still plenty of opportunity left. Jim Mitchell : All right. That's great for the color. And maybe just a quick clarification question on 4Q. On the modestly up expenses, I think you noted that excludes the real estate charge but does that the comparisons include the legal charge in 3Q or should we pull that out as well. Just want to make sure I'm getting that right. Charlie Scharf : I would pull it out. Jim Mitchell : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You touched last time on the efforts around CCAR and capital planning. And looking at the mid-cycle resubmission, the mid-cycle DFAST that you submissively published. Your company run stress capital ratios have improved quite a bit. What does that leave you in terms of any efforts to accelerate the process of getting some of that excess capital out? Charlie Scharf : I think we said last time that we're highly we are -- our constraint is our model, not the Federal Reserve's models. It's something we've been and continue to be highly focused on. And if we got something to say, we'll say it. Geoffrey Elliott : Okay. I guess we'll leave it at that. Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Okay, thanks Geoff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. A quick question on the non-interest bearing deposits. Before you've said that they're historically averaged about 30% of your total deposits. Could you go back much further in time and look at the end of the rate cycles, both in the 90s and the 2000s. So, its non-interest bearing deposits really troughed out around 20% of total deposits. So, is that what we should be thinking about this time, it that on average over cycle of 30% but really we should be dragging more closer to 20% as they have in the past? Mike Santomassimo : Brian, its Mike. We haven\u2019t said that that's sort of the historical average. I mean, I think that's the experience over the last few years. But as you point out that number was lower or sort of in history. A lot sort of changed since then in terms of the business stakes and stuff so. So, like I think we would stay with sort of what we've been saying consistently right is that they're going to bounce around quarter-to-quarter but we think that number will sort of grind down a little bit over time. Where it bottoms out we'll see. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And a separate question on investment management. If you kind of look at the flows years to day and let's exclude LDI which is still in a strength in the business. I mean, long term active is flat, you look at your index it's down 23 billion and your cash is down 25 billion. I mean, what it takes to get those to turn it from outflows really to inflows from here. When can we expect to start seeing better traction and close in the business? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I think when you look at our business, I mean it's hard to put it altogether and think about it as one. We have Walter Scott which is an active asset management company in the equity space which over a period of time with differing performance levels inside the market should differentiate us presumably more in difficult markets than in very strong markets. It is they're long term holders, not focused on the technology sector, have a great track record and so again depending on what happen in the markets over a period of time, you should see stronger performance there. In our asset manager here in the U.S. we're going through a restructuring as you know of combining the three into one called Mellon. We've been pretty clear that our performance historically hasn\u2019t been great. We are strategically making a significant change and putting serious capabilities there to create a multi-stat asset manager which we have to prove to the market is more attractive than the separately managed firms that didn\u2019t have the appropriate scale inside the market. And so, that hopefully over the next year or so we'll start to see more progress there. So, it's some again they're all very different that have different drivers to them but I can assure you when we think about each one we're focused on driving improved performance in each of them but that two will take time just given the nature of the business. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And it does appear we have no further questions in the queue at this time. Charlie Scharf : Thanks everyone, for joining. Thank you, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call webcast. A replay of this conference call webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 02 :00 PM Eastern Standard Time today. Have a good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Scott Freidenrich. You may begin. Scott Freidenrich : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the BNY Mellon's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. This morning BNY Mellon released its results for the fourth quarter of 2018. The earnings press release and a financial highlights presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at bnymellon.com. Charlie Scharf, BNY Mellon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will lead this morning's conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Mike Santomassimo, BNY Mellon's Chief Financial Officer. Following Mike's prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC available on our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 16, 2019 and will not be updated. Now, I will turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As usual, I'll make some comments and then turn it over to Mike. You can see that we reported earnings per share of $0.84, down 22% from last year's fourth quarter. Both this quarter and last year's fourth quarter included a number of notable items that made comparisons difficult, but we will do our best to explain what's included, so you could perform your own analysis of the quarter. Notable items in the fourth quarter of 2018 reduced earnings by $0.16. This includes cost related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters, severance charges, and litigation expenses. Those costs were partially offset by some tax adjustments. As a reminder, our fourth quarter results in 2017 included notable items that increased earnings by $0.17 per share, these items were related to the estimated benefit of U.S. tax legislation, partially offset by some actions we took. On a GAAP basis, our revenues grew 7%, expenses decreased 1%, pretax earnings grew 40% and after-tax earnings decreased 26%. If you were to exclude these notable items in both periods, which you can see in the reconciliation table on the second page of the earnings release. Revenue declined 1%, expenses were essentially flat, pretax earnings decreased 3%, after-tax earnings increased 4%, and earnings per share increased 9%. Mike\u2019s comments will refer to our results, excluding notable items in both periods. Let me run through a few things about the overall results. First, while we aren't happy with the revenue decline of 1%, it's important to note that we saw growth in many of our Investment Services business. In total, Investment Services revenue grew 3% and Investment Management revenue declined by 8%, due to the combination of outflows, currency, and the impact of lower equity markets. And we continue to benefit from the increasing interest rates, albeit at a slower rate than prior quarters. The second thing is that we remain extremely focused on controlling our expenses, while we continue to significantly increase our technology and infrastructure investments. Excluding the notable items, our expenses were essentially flat to the prior year. Our technology expenses increased about $100 million versus the prior year while all other expenses decreased a little more than the same amount. I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call that we see meaningful opportunities to become more efficient across the Company. While we're looking to automate many of the manual tasks we perform, we also see broader opportunities to continue to drive efficiency. On last quarter's call, I used the example of a significant opportunity to reduce management layers and increase spans of control. This quarter's GAAP results include a severance charge, which includes these actions, many of which we've already completed. We anticipate that the payback on this severance will be less than one year. These savings and other efficiencies we continue to drive towards will allow us to continue to increase our investment in technology and infrastructure without significantly increasing our expense base. But, as I also said on last quarter's earnings call, while these changes result in lower costs, they help advance our culture by improving decision-making, allowing us to move more quickly, and making sure we have our best people in roles, which allow them to grow and contribute more significantly to our growth agenda. And thirdly, as we said consistently, the road to increase our organic growth will take time but we do see some progress. The impact on the markets and interest rates will ebb and flow but we must grow the franchise and we remain focused on methodically building our capabilities to increase our rate of organic growth. As 2019 unfolds, we hope to provide a clearer roadmap of how this is playing out. Let\u2019s go through our businesses starting with Asset Servicing. Asset Servicing revenue was down 2%. Although we continue to have a healthy pipeline, the impact from new business was minimal. There were negative impacts from asset outflows from existing clients. These clients did not leave us, but saw outflows from their accounts. This can shift based on market conditions and investor behavior. The decline, combined with a little lower foreign exchange and securities lending volumes as well as the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, drove the lower revenue year-over-year. The declines were offset by higher net interest revenue due to higher rates. We are continuing to invest across this business to improve our core custody and accounting service, extend our servicing capabilities for alternative managers including credit managers, middle office and data management. If we turn to Pershing, while revenue was down year-over-year due to the two previously disclosed client losses, revenue was flat sequentially. Excluding the impact of the lost clients, the revenues grew about 4%. In addition, the business has grown in a number of other fronts. The impact of the lost clients has been fully in our run rate since the second quarter of this year and the impact on the year-over-year growth rate for Pershing will abate after the first quarter of 2019. We continue to have a sizeable pipeline of new business that we are on-boarding now, which will begin to go live in the second half of 2019 and have a more meaningful impact in 2020. So, we expect Pershing will return to revenue growth as the negative impact of the two client losses abate and we onboard the signed business. We are as confident as ever in our ability to continue building Pershing over the longer term. In Issuer Services, revenue growth of 25% was driven primarily by depository receipts, corporate action activity and higher volumes, although corporate trust also generated a little bit of revenue growth. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, depository receipts revenue is seasonal, and volatility in the market drives cross-border settlement activity. The timing of corporate action events during the quarter drove significant year-over-year growth, and volatility levels were particularly high in Latin America. Corporate trust also had some revenue growth this quarter, albeit small. Our efforts to reposition our corporate trust sales and service teams, has helped us to drive incremental growth. In insurance linked securities and CLOs, our pipeline remained healthy. While market share statistics in this business are imperfect, as I've mentioned before, we're gaining share, particularly in the structured finance space. In Treasury Services, we\u2019re continuing to see modest growth in this business. Payment volume, which is the key driver of our fee revenue growth, was up 5% year-over-year and sequentially, driven by the volume growth from both new and existing clients. Our focus on growing liability balances from our Treasury Services clients has been paying off as we experienced growth in attracting competitively priced interest bearing operational client deposits to support our clients\u2019 payment activities. In Clearance and Collateral Management, we recorded 10% revenue growth. We again saw strong revenue growth from our historical clients, newly converted government clearing broker-dealer clients, higher clearance volumes related to record issuance levels and strong demand for U.S. government and treasury issuances, and growth in collateral management activity from new business and increased client activity. Our Clearance and Collateral Management capabilities are among the best in the business, and collateral optimization and segregation services go beyond what others can provide. As collateral management becomes increasingly important part of the investment process, we are major beneficiary. We\u2019re seeing interest from new entrants to the collateral market, such as alternative asset managers investing their cash in repo. Turning to Investment Management. Asset Management had a difficult quarter with revenues down 11%. The cumulative impact of outflows year-to-date, particularly in our active equity strategies, as well as lower equity markets, the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and some small divestitures drove the results. We saw strong flows into our liability-driven investment strategies as that business has continued to consistently perform well over a number of years. Performance across some key strategies has been good, evidenced by solid performance fees in the quarter and for the full year. Wealth Management revenues were down 2%, primarily driven by the impact of lower equity markets and lower net interest revenue. We continue to believe that we should be able to drive more growth in this business over time. Shifting to talent. We continue to attract great people. During the quarter, we announced that Lester Owens will be joining our executive committee next month as Head of Operations. Lester's an experienced operations executive who has occupied key roles in large complex financial services organizations. He also has a reputation as a great leader with the passion for efficiency, transformation, controls and working with clients. Lester will join us next month and help us and our clients rethink how we process securities and cash with the goal of gaining material efficiencies and improved quality. On the capital front, we continue to be keenly focused on intelligently deploying our capital, including returning excess capital to shareholders. Last month, we announced that we received approval to increase our repurchase program of common stock, find additional $830 million and we completed it in the fourth quarter. In the past, our ability to return additional capital to shareholders has been constrained by our internal CCAR models, and we've refined those models. We are pleased to now be in the position to return additional capital to our shareholders. And we're confident that we'll continue to maintain strong capital ratios and will be able to invest in our business going forward with this higher level of capital return. In terms of 2019, while we cannot predict market levels and interest rates, the environment is clearly more difficult today than one quarter ago. And to state the obvious, at these levels, the markets will not be a significant contributor to our results in 2019. Therefore, we remain focused on building the underlying franchise to drive higher levels of organic growth, and we'll continue to remain disciplined on expenses. And even if the market constrains our short-term growth, our goal is to ensure, we drive EPS growth as we benefit from our strong expense disciplines and capital actions. With that, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thanks, Charlie. Let me run through the details of our results for the quarter and the full year and then provide some further thoughts on 2019. Note that all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. Beginning on page three of the financial highlights document, in the final quarter of 2018, we had earnings of $832 million and EPS of $0.84, down 22%. But, as Charlie mentioned, both the current and prior year reporters included a number of notable items that made comparisons difficult. As a reminder, our fourth quarter 2017 results included $0.17 per share net benefit related to the new U.S. tax legislation and charges related to severance litigation and asset impairment and losses on sales with certain securities in our investment portfolio. Our results in the fourth quarter of 2018 included $0.16 per share related to severance charges, expenses associated with the real estate consolidation, and litigation charges, partially offset by a positive adjustment to provisional estimates for U.S. tax legislation and other changes. The severance expenses, which are a little more than half of the charge, are related to actions we are taking to drive more efficiency across the firm. Many of the actions are already completed, and we expect to see the payback in 2019. As I have noted throughout the year, the remaining $16 million of the costs associated with relocating our corporate headquarters was recorded in the fourth quarter and is included in the notable items. Excluding the notable items, we had earnings of $987 million and EPS of $0.99, up 9%. In terms of shareholder capital return, as Charlie mentioned, we received approval to buy back $830 million of additional common shares and completed it all in the fourth quarter. In total for the quarter, we repurchased approximately 29 million shares for $1.37 billion and paid $278 million in dividends. For the full year of 2018, we returned $4.3 billion or just over 100% of earnings to common shareholders through $3.3 billion of share repurchases and approximately $1.1 billion in dividends. Now, turning to our GAAP financial highlights on page four. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was up 7% year-over-year, pre-tax income up 40%, and net income applicable to common shareholders was down 26%. Page five shows the highlights after excluding the notable items in both quarters, which may help better understand the underlying performance. Total revenue was down 1%, fee revenue was also down 1%. Please note that the impact of notable items or revenue is all in the other segment, so it does not impact the revenue disclosures in either Investment Services or Investment Management. Fourth quarter net interest revenue increased 4% to $885 million, driven by the impact of higher interest rates on interest earning assets and a leasing adjustment recorded in Q4 2017. This was partially offset by lower noninterest-bearing deposits. Net interest revenue declined 1% sequentially due to higher deposit rates and the impact of interest rate hedging. This was partially offset by higher deposit balances. Sequentially, the impact of higher interest rates on deposit pricing and other interest-bearing liability rates was greater than the benefit due to the securities portfolio yield and other interest earning assets. On page eight of our earnings release, you can see that year-over-year our average interest-bearing deposits increased 9% while our average noninterest-bearing deposits declined 15%. Sequentially, average interest-bearing deposits increased 9% and noninterest-bearing deposits declined 3%. As we have consistently said, for our client base, deposit pricing is continually becoming more competitive with betas increasing as rates rise. The rates on our interest-bearing deposits increased from 63 basis points in the third quarter to 86 basis points this quarter. On the surface, this would imply the positive beta of approximately 82% across all currencies. When you focus on core interest-bearing U.S. dollar client deposits, excluding wholesale funding, betas have been in the mid 80% over the past few rate hikes and more closer to 100% in the fourth quarter. The net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 1.24%. Sequentially, the NIM declined 3 basis points. While we focus on NIM, we are seeking to maximize earnings and take advantage of opportunities to use the capacity we have on our balance sheet. For example, we will take on temporary non-operating deposits and reinvest them risk-free at a central bank or a government security. We had the opportunity to do that in the fourth quarter. These riskless transactions are accretive to net interest income but they may have a modest spread that could negatively impact the NIM. Also note that the effects of certain hedging activities are recorded in fee revenue and not reflected in net interest revenue or the NIM. This negatively impacted net interest revenue and the NIM by approximately 1.5 to 2 basis points sequentially. Picking back up on the highlights after excluding the notable items on page five. Our expenses of $2.7 billion were essentially flat as our continued investments in technology were mostly offset by decreases in other expenses. Pretax income was down 3%, net income applicable to common shareholders, which benefited from the lower tax rate in the U.S. was up 4%, and our earnings per share were up 9%, when you include the impact of our share repurchases. The full-year results on a GAAP basis are on page six. We had earnings of $4.1 billion or $4.04 per share. Our earnings per share was up 9%. And our return on tangible common equity was 22.5%. On page seven are the full-year results excluding the notable items. We had earnings of $4.3 billion or $4.21 per common share and our earnings per share was up 18%. Page eight highlights our Investment Services results. Investment Services revenue was $3 billion, up 3%. Within Investment Services, Asset Servicing revenue was down 2% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting lower client assets and activity and the impact of a stronger dollar, partially offset by higher net interest revenue. This includes a modest decline in securities lending revenue due to lower U.S. equity and lower U.S. government balances and spreads. Pershing revenue was down 2% to $558 million, due to the impact of previously disclosed lost business, partially offset by higher clearance volumes and net interest income. Excluding the impact of the lost clients, the underlying business grew closer to 4%. Issuer Services revenue was up 25% to $441 million, primarily reflecting higher depository receipts revenue, driven by corporate actions and higher volumes in depository receipts, and a smaller volume increase in corporate trust. The sequential decrease reflects seasonality in depository receipts. Treasury Services revenue increased 2% year-over-year to $328 million, primarily reflecting higher payment volumes and net interest revenue. Clearance and Collateral Management revenue was up 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, to $278 million. Both increases reflect growth in Clearance and Collateral Management and higher net interest revenue. The new clients that we on-boarded and other increases in collateral activity drove a 22% increase in average tri-party collateral management balances. Non-interest expense within Investment Services increased 1% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, driven by investments in technology, partially offset by the impact of the notable items. And sequential increase of 4% primarily reflects higher severance expense and investments in technology. Also on the metrics, foreign exchange and other trading revenue was down 3%. Assets under custody and/or new administration declined 1% to $33.1 trillion. And just a reminder that approximately one-third of our assets under custody and/or administration are equities. And average long-term mutual fund assets were down 4%, primarily due to the impact of lost volumes and lower equity markets. The sequential decline was primarily driven by the decline in equity markets in the fourth quarter and other activity. Now turning to page nine for the Investment Management business highlights. Asset Management revenue was down 11% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $660 million, primarily reflecting the impact of net outflows in prior quarters, lower equity markets, and lost revenue associated with the sale CenterSquare and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Wealth Management revenue was down 2% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $303 million with both decreases driven by lower market values and lower net interest revenue. Assets under management decreased 9% and 6% sequentially to $1.7 trillion. We had outflows in most asset classes with total net flows of $18 billion. We had $14 billion of inflows into liability-driven investments. As Charlie mentioned, this business continues to perform well. Equity outflows were $8 billion with a little under half of that coming from lower fee mandates; fixed income outflows were a $1 billion; and multi-asset and alternative outflows were $2 billion. Index strategy outflows were $11 billion, primarily from equity index products, and approximately half of that was from one institutional client rotating asset classes. Cash outflows were $10 billion, approximately half of which occurred at year-end, some of which we have seen return within the first week of 2019. Now, turning to our other segment on page 10. Fee revenue increased year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting the negative impact of the U.S. tax legislation on our investments in renewable energy in the fourth quarter of 2017, the benefit of which shows up in the tax line. Non-interest expense increased year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting expenses associated with relocating our corporate headquarters and higher severance. Moving now to capital and liquidity on page 11. Our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong. As of December 31st, our key ratios declined since the end of Q3, primarily due to share repurchases in the quarter. Common Equity Tier 1 capital totaled $17.6 billion at December 31st, and our CET1 ratio was 10.6% under the advanced approach. The supplementary leverage ratio was 6%. Our average LCR or liquidity coverage ratio in the fourth quarter was 118%. Page 12 details our expenses. On a consolidated GAAP basis, expenses of $3 billion were essentially flat, reflecting investments in technology and the expenses associated with relocating our corporate headquarters offset by lower staff expense, lower bank assessment charges and the favorable impact from a stronger dollar. Note that the technology expenses are included in staff, professional, deal, and other purchase services as well as software and equipment. The 9% sequential increase primarily reflects higher severance expense, expenses associated with relocating our corporate headquarters, and investments in technology, and partially offset by the lower bank assessment charges, primarily FDIC expenses. Now, let me spend a few minutes on how we're thinking about 2019. The equity markets and higher interest rates have been key drivers of revenue growth for the last couple of years. If these levels persist, the markets would not be a significant contributor to our results in 2019. While our business model does benefit from economic growth and increasing markets over time, we are focused on organic growth, and are adding services, products and technology, entering new markets, improving the client experience and working to be more solutions driven on behalf of our clients. Across our Company, we've been making investments and shifting how we operate in support of organic growth. But, those actions will take time to show up in our numbers. One note on fee revenue for the first quarter. Investment Management fees will be impacted by the market levels and outflows in the fourth quarter. I would factor that into modeling. With respect to net interest revenue there are a few variables to consider. At this point in the quarter, interest-bearing deposits are trending in line with the fourth quarter. We would also expect the non-interest bearing deposits which continue to tick down, but it's still really early in the quarter. Deposit betas are consistent with what I discussed earlier. The yield on our securities portfolio should continue to grind up through 2019. The portfolio yield should benefit from factors including higher short-term rates and reinvestment opportunities. The sequential change in the yield in the first quarter should improve versus the change in the fourth quarter. The change quarter-to-quarter through reminder of the year will be dependent on rates. Just a reminder that the duration of the portfolio is approximately two years and approximately 30% of it reprices each quarter. If all these assumptions play out for the first quarter, we would expect net interest revenue to be flat to up a little versus the fourth quarter 2018. On the expense front, we expect our technology spend to increase in 2019, reflecting the ramp-up of spend this year, in 2018, which was largely included in the fourth quarter run rate. This spend continues to be focused on our operating platform and the expansion of development resources to extend and enhance our capabilities and to support new business onboarding in support of organic growth that we discussed here and back at our Investor Day. Even with these investments, excluding the notable items, we do not expect to significantly increase our expense base in 2018. With regard to expenses in the first quarter, a reminder about the typical first quarter impact to staff expense from the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense for retirement eligible employees, the impact of which should be similar to last year. Despite that, adjusted for the notable items discussed earlier, we expect expenses to go up around 1% to 2% versus the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2018. We should see the benefit of actions related to the severance that we booked in the fourth quarter to streamline our organization and boost productivity later in the year. In terms of our tax rate, there were a number of clarifications to new U.S. tax legislation that were published in late November and December. Based on our interpretation of those rules, we currently expect the full-year 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%. As I mentioned, we completed the full $830 million of additional buybacks in the fourth quarter. This coupled with the impact of further capital distribution should be incorporated into your modeling. Assuming the assumptions play out, our goal would be to have reasonable growth in earnings per common share. Before opening the call, I just want to mention one additional thing. We have approximately $160 million of exposure to the California Utility that's been in the press release lately that has plans to potentially file bankruptcy. We increased our provision on that credit in the quarter a bit, but may have additional impact depending on how the facts and circumstances develop. With that, operator, can you please open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, good morning. Just one clarification that I know will come up. When you guys are talking about reasonable EPS growth this year, can you just level set us on your starting point? Is that off of a GAAP basis or is that off of your adjusted basis? Mike Santomassimo : It's often adjusted basis. Ken Usdin : So, off of the 421 basis, you'd expect EPS growth? Mike Santomassimo : Well, again, I mean that is what we're shooting for. Obviously, it depends on what the market is but that is absolutely true. Ken Usdin : Okay. And secondly, then to your point also about not increasing expenses by much, is the thought that you have on 1% to 2% year-over-year in the first quarter that generically we should be thinking about expenses over the course or does something change with the trajectory as the severance benefit -- the benefits from the severance you took starts to layer in against future investments? Charlie Scharf : Yes. I think, I don't think we want to give you a number for the full year, otherwise we would have. But I think the way you're thinking about it is right, which is the benefits that we will get on the severance actions that we\u2019ve taken this quarter will really start second quarter and then in the second half of the year. And so, there will be more benefits in that period of time. So, overall, again, I think the words are the words that we intended to use. It's obviously early, but I think the point we want to make sure you understand is number one is we're highly, highly focused on driving efficiency inside the Company. We think that and I've described this before that when we -- when you take actions, the next set of actions become even clearer. And so, that is something that in our business we're going to continue to do. And we're going to do it at the same time that we are going to increase the spend where we need to expend it. So, all-in-all, we feel very good about our ability to really control expenses, while investing where we think we need for next year. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then just to clarify, when you -- do you expect like the GAAP between your -- GAAP expenses and adjusted expenses to narrow, like do you expect, as many of these non-core notable items as you go forward? Are we going to see, like these big severance things every quarter? I guess, that\u2019s the question. Charlie Scharf : No. Listen, certainly we hope not. I mean, it's something -- these things at some point have to become a -- just part of what we do is we right size the employee base. I mentioned on the last quarter call that we were taking a step back and really thinking about how the Company was organized. I talked about the spends and the layers and the managers that have very few direct reports. That was a very specific initiative that we looked at across the entire Company. I think, what we would hope is as we go forward, it becomes more ordinary course as managers manage based upon attrition and things like that. And hopefully these things do go away. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : First question, some of the investments that you have been making, and both your comments just on the focus on organic growth, I just wanted to get an update on maybe where you're seeing some of the earlier traction and what we should be focused on as we move through \u201819 and \u201820 to see some of the kind of realizations. Charlie Scharf : This is Charlie. Thanks for the question. Why don\u2019t I start and then Mike will comment along the way. I guess, as we said, we've talked about the fact that given the nature of what our business is, it does take time. Having said that, there are some businesses that are further along and we see a clear path towards increasing the rate of revenue growth; others is still evolving. Let me start with Pershing as an example. In the world in which Pershing operates, we've talked about the opportunity to expand our offerings and grow in the RIA category. Historically, we've been very, very strong in the broker- dealer category. So, that\u2019s still a significant opportunity that we see. And just more generically, there are more banks and broker dealers that are looking at us for outsourcing. And I just -- when you just think about the increasing technology needs, the increasing complexity of what's required, other priorities they have, they're looking to us to figure out how to help them, both wind up as with the better product but also allow them to focus on what they can actually create value in. Today, we mentioned that in our remarks that Pershing revenue declined 2% year-over-year, even though it was flat year-to-year. Big portion of that is driven downward by these two clients that we have mentioned. Excluding that, we were up 4%. And I think the most important thing beyond that which we've mentioned is, we have a very significant pipeline of signed business within Pershing where we're actually spending the money today to onboard those clients. As I mentioned in my remarks, that will start to happen in the second quarter of \u201819 and into 2022. But, the pipeline as we see it, I asked the question and it's hard to get the exact answer because of the size of the pipeline. But, it's as big if not -- it is bigger than any pipeline we\u2019ve had in at least five years and probably more than that. And the wins and the opportunities are in the U.S. and then there is Europe as well. In Europe specifically, we see continued opportunities as the Wealth Management market here develops. So, it's a lot on Pershing, but we feel really good about it because of what we actually see in the pipeline, even though we've got to wait a little bit to see it in the revenue line. But longer term, Pershing is a -- it's a hugely important platform for us to participate in the growth and the Wealth Management in the U.S. and in Europe. In addition to that, our own Wealth Management business, I've spoken about, this one is early on. Catherine Keating was just showing this in the third quarter. She's working on developing exactly what the plans are and she's starting to move towards implementation of what those are. It\u2019s products, it\u2019s banking infrastructure, it\u2019s sales products, it\u2019s incentives. And so, that's not something we would expect to see in the next couple of quarters. But just given what we know we've done there, as I said, we've been a consistent performer. But, we have more and should be able to grow faster than we're growing. Mike, maybe you want to talk a little bit about Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Mike, maybe I'll start with Clearance and Collateral first. So, when you look at that business, obviously one of the big drivers of it is that business we're bringing in from the other competitor around the government clearing business. And when you look at the tri-party balance growth of 22%, about two thirds of it is from those clients coming in from JPMorgan. About third of it is actually other new activity happening, both new clients and activity from our existing clients. And you're seeing good traction in products like our margin segregation product where market participants now need to hold segregated margin balances with providers like us. And that was a business that was zero just couple of years ago and we're seeing good traction, and that's contributing to sort of the growth in the collateral balances you see there. And there is a whole set of other initiatives that sort of underlie that business. And as we sort of bring in these government clearing clients, I think they're finding that our capabilities are bit differentiated in the collateral space and then what they saw, and the conversations are happening -- are getting better and better and sort of happening real time here. And more people are interested in our collateral optimization service and a whole series of things that we've been trying to do there. On Treasury Services, again, this is another business where we brought in a new CEO just in the summer. And what Paul Camp has been working on is helping reposition sort of the way people think about us. Historically, we've positioned ourselves as more of a receivables bank, i.e. we\u2019ll collect your payments, a collections bank versus a payments bank. And when you start focusing more on the payments piece, that's what brings liquidity balances and a broader set of dialogue that we can have with these clients. So, we've changed our -- we\u2019ve changed the leadership and focuses of our sales team, we've changed the incentives, we have -- underneath it, you can\u2019t see it from the disclosures but underneath that the Treasury Services deposits are growing just over 10% just from the third quarter. So, when you look at third quarter to fourth quarter, they're up about 10%. And so, you're seeing sort of the traction real time. And if I just use sort of one example, I\u2019m not going to give you a client name, but when you look at, there's an international development bank that we've been working with for a number of years in a very small way with Treasury Services. We have a strong relationship across the company with them. And what -- and we've been working to improve a couple very minor changes to some products that we have that opens up a wallet of billions of dollars of deposit balances that we have mandated out now and are sort of in the process of coming through. So, you're seeing a good traction in really all of these businesses that I think builds up over time to show sort of that organic growth story. I don\u2019t Charlie, you want to talk about Asset Servicing? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Maybe I'll just -- I know this is a long answer but obviously this is extraordinarily important. Asset Servicing is hugely important part of the business. Our belief is we have real differentiation here. We have a data platform; we are willing to work openly with front-end providers; and we're working towards more tight integration to the benefit of our clients; and we're continuing to improve infrastructure and the quality of what we do, which isn't a sexy thing to talk about but in what we do, it really does matter. And so, this is more of a long-term build because of the nature of what these relationships are, how long the sales cycle is. But, there's progress in what we're doing. This quarter, we brought in a $100 billion of fund administration from just one client specifically $400 billion [ph] of new custody, ETFs and mutual funds from a provider. So, we have plenty of examples of places they're winning. But this will be a slower build because of where we're starting from and what we've seen in Pershing and some of these other businesses. So, why don\u2019t I stop there? Michael Carrier : Okay. No, thanks for all that. And then, Mike, just a quick one on capital. Just given the decline in the ratios with the buybacks and then what you mentioned on the balance sheet. Just how should we be thinking about managing that going forward, just through the regulatory process and then just some of the opportunities that you're seeing? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I mean, obviously Mike, between now and the second quarter of 2019, our remaining buybacks are already sort of defined based on what got approved in CCAR last year. So, that should be pretty easy to sort of think about for the first half of the year. And as we look to CCAR 2018 -- or 2019, sorry, a lot of the work that we put into getting the incremental $800 million -- $830 million approved, sort of flows right into sort of the modeling that we'll do as part of that process. That process kicks off sort of as we speak. And so over the next couple of weeks I think we'll all have a better sense of sort of the inputs that go into that. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Maybe just to follow-on on the organic growth. Thanks guys, you covered a lot of that, a couple of additional questions. In terms of the market conditions, obviously, they're challenging right now. But, how would you expect volatility to help your overall revenue, including on the organic growth side? If we have a situation in 2019 where we have choppy markets, maybe flat but much more volatile. Can you talk about the potential benefit for both the collateral management business that you referred to Mike, and FX and other trading? And then, also just quickly on the lag between expenses of the onboarding for Pershing versus clocking that revenue in? Mike Santomassimo : I mean, look, the expenses as we -- I'll start the last piece first. So in Pershing, as we said, most of the expenses that we're incurring to onboard that business are being spent as we speak. And so, the profile of the Pershing expense base isn\u2019t unexpected to change substantially in 2019. And as Charlie mentioned, that revenue will start to kick in, in the second half of \u201819, and more substantially in the first part of 2020. So, you'll sort of see come in that trajectory. As you sort of think about volatility for us and sort of --- if I sort of tick through each of the businesses, just to give you a sense of where we see it. So, in Pershing, we do see increased transaction volumes at times during periods of volatility. Having said that, much of the accounts that sort of that are underpinned are book of business, are managed accounts. So, we're not in a -- we're not necessarily supporting sort of retail, self directed retail brokerage type clients. And so, you won't necessarily see the peaks and valleys of transaction activity as sort of volatility spikes up and down, but you will see that sort of positively impacted. And as you look back over the last few months, transaction volumes were up a little but they weren't outsized in sort of any way in that business. And then in Asset Servicing is where you'll -- you may see some of it as well. And so that -- we give you disclosures around our foreign exchange revenue. So, obviously, if volatility picks up in foreign exchange, you'll see that come through the revenue line. And then the volumes that we see will be dependent upon underlying client activity. And then, in the core asset servicing business, think of that revenue as probably about a third of it is sort of transaction-driven revenue. And so that piece of it will move up and down based on what you see in the market. But, keep in mind that as I said in my remarks, about a third of our assets in our custody are equities. So, just because you see big spikes and valleys in sort of the equity markets and volatility there, doesn't necessarily mean that's going to translate into huge upticks in sort of transaction-related revenue. Charlie Scharf : This is Charlie. I want to add one quick thing, which is, all that's very -- that\u2019s kind of what should drive some of the steps more mathematically, but to state the obvious, which is the reasons behind the volatility really matter to us. There's good volatility and there's less good volatility. What we've seen this quarter is that kind of volatility which drives assets away from the businesses that we benefit from. And so, the why will really matter to us as we look out over the next year. Brian Bedell : Right. That makes sense. Maybe just a follow-on on the expenses. Charlie, if you can talk a little bit about -- a little bit more about the nature of some of the investments that are now in the run rate and maybe just highlight of a couple 2 or 3 of the most major ones. And then, just from that, your discussion of the expense rate, not -- expense base not significantly going up, is that an assumption on the markets remaining flat and say to set on hold or the markets improving? And then maybe just which management layer areas were most restructured in terms of the businesses? Charlie Scharf : So, let me try and remember all three of them. I\u2019ll do backwards. On the third one, it was across the entire Company. As I said before, we really looked at spans, layers and the series of things like that across the entire entity from the staff areas to investment services to our investment management businesses. And so, I think it's very consistent. In addition, ongoing efficiencies through our operations areas on top of that are things that we've seen, and then, just tactically, some spots in different places. But overall, I would say, it was pretty consistent. On the second question about expenses relative to the environment, I would characterize it as, we're thinking about what the right level for us to invest in. And so, I think with a cautious eye towards next year, that's where we plan for. To the extent that the environment gets even worse, we always have levers we could pull if we thought things were going to really get bad and actually stay there for a period of time, and maybe spend a little bit more, if all of a sudden the world changed very dramatically. But, I don't want to overstate either of those two cases up or down. I think where we're planning for is where we feel the right level of spend for us is within a reasonable range of outcomes for next year. And I'm sorry, the first\u2026 Brian Bedell : The first one was just the -- maybe a couple examples of the investments that you made most recently and in which areas? I am sorry, technology investments. I\u2019m sorry. Charlie Scharf : Sure. So, first of all, Mike's referenced and I, both referenced the work that's ongoing in Pershing to onboard these clients. A lot of the work to bring on these clients isn't just bringing -- I mean, it takes a long time, because you have to build a set of capabilities. And you build a set of capabilities that you can then scale and provide to others. So, there's a significant amount of technology work that has to go into bringing on those Pershing clients. And that's embedded in the overall spend numbers that we talked about. We've talked about in the corporate trust business how we continue to build out our technology platform for things other than just pure traditional products. That\u2019s embedded in the spend. As we think about asset servicing, we're highly focused on automation; we're highly focused on figuring out how to continue to build our data infrastructure. So, I think those are just some examples. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'm sorry, Charlie, were you in the middle of saying something? Charlie Scharf : Yes. The only thing I just -- in my mind I'm just thinking, I think we -- one area that we haven't mentioned is our markets business. And as we think about where we would make the investments, we\u2019ve talked about this in the past. We\u2019ve talked about the progress that we've made. You\u2019ve seen it in the numbers, you see -- we've talked about some of the new products that we've offered. And a lot of what's happening there is really based upon technology spend. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Bedell, you owe me one. I just gave you a little OT on your last question. Curious about deposit trends. So, I think, Mike, you had commented that you guys see them as consistent quarter-to-date with what you saw in the fourth quarter. But, deposit trends were a little mixed under the surface. And you excluded the wholesale or the CD prices from your deposit betas. So, I'm curious, when you comment on deposits, are you talking about the total interest-bearing deposit balance that on average was 161.7 or are you talking about the deposits excluding the CDs? And how should we think about that CD growth? It's really picked up -- the growth in CDs has picked up pretty substantially here the last few quarters. How are you thinking about that into next year? Charlie Scharf : Yes. My remarks were in total, Brennan. Thanks for the question and clarify that. And the reason why I think you sort of need to look through the -- look through into sort of what's happening with your client deposits. Obviously, wholesale funding is more index-based pricing for the most part. And so, you really want to try to understand what's happening with your clients in those conversations. So, that's why we\u2019re trying to give you that color. I think as you sort of think about the wholesale funding, I don't see it moving in any substantial way from current levels. Brennan Hawken : Okay. All right, great. Thanks for clarifying that. And then, so the second question on issuer services. You guys provided some color in the commentary on the fact that there were some elevated activities, depository receipts, LatAm. Kind of curious about how sustainable you would see this activity level, was this corporate action activity impacted by maybe the volatile markets that we saw in the quarter, or it was also quite a quarter for M&A closing activity? Did that come into play into that line as well? Thanks. Charlie Scharf : Yes. So, M&A closing activity no; volatility, a little bit, I guess I would say. And I think relative to the question of sustainability, I guess, the way to think about it is -- and we've talked about this, which is within issuer services that's corporate trust and DR. Corporate trust, we are seeing revenue growth, it's not huge but it is growing. And based on the actions that we've taken, hopefully that will continue. That is deal by deal. And we feel better about our calling efforts, we feel better about the capabilities that we continue to build. So, hopefully that growth will continue. Within DRs, you know this and we've said this is -- it's quarter-by-quarter can be very volatile, be very, very seasonable. And if you look at our yearly performance from I think it\u2019s \u201817 to \u201818, while the quarters matter a lot, overall, when you look at the full year, relatively -- I don't remember exactly but relatively flat. When we look at 2017 to 2018, same thing is true, albeit within the fourth quarter we had strong performance. And part of that by the way is driven by in the fourth quarter of the prior year, we actually had a very weak DR quarter. So, that's a long way of saying that as we look forward, we would think that the full-year performance is sustainable, albeit it's going to be volatile quarter-to-quarter. Brennan Hawken : That's really fair. Thank you. Just, I'm sorry, one follow-up in your comment on corporate trust. How much has CLO -- the CLO trustee business helped in some of that corporate trust growth recently? Could you walk through a little bit about how sustainable you think that growth might be? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Look, Brennan, underneath -- we don't disclose the components of corporate trust, as you know. But, the CLO business has been an area of strength for us this year where we have picked up market share. And so, it has been a contributor to that underlying growth. And we've been talking consistently now for the last year or so where we've been making some investments in some of the underlying technology for to better support that business. And we're seeing the benefits of that come through, through some of the market share that we've been picking up this year. And so that has been a contributor. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for letting me sneak in one more. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Thanks. Hey, good morning, guys. So, first question is just around the expense trends. I think in the beginning of the year, last year you guys talked about reinvesting the majority of the tax savings, which I think was in kind of the $250 million to $300 million range. Charlie, I think you mentioned 100 in tech spend this year. So, did the investment pace change or some of that is just kind of slipping into next year? Mike Santomassimo : Alex, maybe just to correct that. So, I think what Charlie was referring to was the quarter. So, if you look at the spend on a full-year basis for \u201818, then we spent probably just over $300 million. Alex Blostein : Got it. So, that's all in the run rate. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Alex Blostein : Got it, understood. And then, just digging into the issuer services again for a second. If we look at just the fee components, not so excluding the NIR, I think the growth was quite substantial this year, I think 10% plus. Can you help me understand again kind of sustainability of that growth? Because to your point, I mean, it's a fairly mature business; it\u2019s something we haven't seen that type of growth from there in quite some time. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. As Charlie mentioned, if you sort of unpick both corporate trust and DR, Alex, I think the corporate trust fee line is a pretty consistent sort of story, right, where you've seen that sort of tick up sort of gradually over the over the last number of quarters. And given the trend we're seeing on a full-year basis, we would still expect that to sort of tick up a little bit in 2019. I think the DR revenue I think is the place where you've seen a little bit more volatility sort of year-to-year. So, in \u201817 to \u201818 it was up a little. And given some of the things that Charlie talked about in terms of some timing of corporate actions that happened, the volatility that we saw that drives transactional volume in some of the different quarters. And so, as we said, as we sort of as we sort of look to 2019 we think that the 2018 numbers plus or minus sort of a little look like a good way to think about the full-year story for next year. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Rob Rutschow : Hi. It's Rob Rutschow for Mike. Just a follow-up on the expenses. You've mentioned I think previously that there are 11 layers of management between, Charlie, in the bottom of the organization. What's the right level and how long does that take to get there and then how should we think about that from an expense perspective? Charlie Scharf : We have eliminated, depending on where you are in the Company, call it 2 to 3, as part of this exercise. And the actions, as we said, a bunch of them have already happened in the month of January. And so, over the next couple of months is when we\u2019ll actually see the impact get into our run rate. Rob Rutschow : And then, I understand that I guess severance is kind of a recurring or nonrecurring, but what was that in the quarter and how should we think about that going forward? Charlie Scharf : I answered the question earlier about how to think about it going forward. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And in my remarks, Rob, I mentioned that the severance charge is little over half of notable items -- expense notable items for the quarter. Rob Rutschow : Okay. Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks. Sorry, it's a day with overlapping calls. So, if I've missed some of the, sorry. Severance is over half just going to those noncore just so that we can have our numbers correct, as we look forward. Charlie, I missed your comment on how to think about it going forward. But I will go back and talk to IR. $16 million in real estate relocations. So, is the rest all from higher litigation? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. The three components of the notable items, Vivek, this is Mike, obviously are the severance, the real estate charges, and litigation. Correct. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And when you are saying little over half, you're talking 50%, 60% kind of -- a little over that in that range, but not above that? Mike Santomassimo : That's a good way to think about it. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Sorry, we\u2019re just trying to\u2026 Mike Santomassimo : Yes. We know it\u2019s a busy morning. No worries. Vivek Juneja : It's an unfortunate morning. I'll just -- I'll let you go. And thanks for the clarification. We'll catch up with IR later. Mike Santomassimo : All right. We're happy to talk later, Vivek if you want. Thanks everyone for -- I think that\u2019s the last one. So thanks everyone for joining. We appreciate it. Charlie Scharf : Could we just double check with the operator that there are no more? Operator : And that's correct. We have no further questions in the queue at this time. Mike Santomassimo : Great. Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call webcast. A replay of this conference call webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 p.m. Eastern Standard time today.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to BNY Mellon. You may begin. Magda Palczynska : Good morning. This is Magda Palczynska, Head of Investor Relations. Today, BNY Mellon released its results for the first quarter of 2019. The earnings press release and the financial highlights presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at bnymellon.com. Charlie Scharf, BNY Mellon's Chairman and CEO, will lead this morning's conference call. Then Mike Santomassimo, our CFO will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Mike's prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC all available on our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 17, 2019, and will not be updated. With that, I will hand over to Charlie. Charles Scharf : Thanks, Magda. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before turning over to Mike to take you through the first quarter financials in more detail, let me share some high level thoughts about our performance. Reported earnings per share were $0.94, down from $1.10 a year-ago. Revenue was down 7%. Both fees and net interest income declined. Expenses were down 1% and after-tax earnings decreased 20%. Return on tangible common equity was 21%. A few thoughts on our results. Our performance this quarter was mixed. Several of our fee-based metrics in Investment Services were consistent with recent results, while we experienced weakness in Investment Management and net interest income. The year-over-year declines in revenue and earnings per share were primarily driven by the changing mix and cost of our deposits and the impact of the prior year asset management outflows. We also saw lower foreign exchange volumes and volatility, volume reductions and spread compression and securities lending and lower clearance volumes in Pershing. In addition, the impact of divestitures and asset gains and particularly strong markets and deposit balances in last years first quarter also made the year-over-year comparison more difficult. Last quarter, we said that if our rate assumptions played out, we would expect net interest revenue to be flat to a little up versus the fourth quarter. As you'll see, it was down 5%. Subsequent to our last earnings call, rates across the entire yield curve declined versus our assumptions, deposit balances declined and we saw changes to the mix between interest and non-interest-bearing deposits. We see significant competitive pressure for deposits. I'll let Mike discuss that in more detail. As we've said, we remain focused on our expense base and our overall expenses remained well controlled while we continued to significantly increase our investment in technology and infrastructure. Our assets under custody and/or administration reached $34.5 trillion, up 3% reflecting higher market values and net new business partially offset by change in foreign currency translation rates. Let's go through our businesses starting with Asset Servicing. Asset Servicing fees were down year-over-year largely due to lower foreign exchange and securities lending volumes and lower activity from existing clients. On a linked quarter basis, fee-based metrics were generally consistent. We continued to see growth in alternatives with recent wins and a strong pipeline in real estate, credit funds, private debt and private equity. Let me make a few additional comments about our BlackRock strategic alliance. We have said we will work with third parties to more closely integrate the front-to-back operating model, and this is one meaningful example of how we will use data and tools to benefit our clients, working on our own solutions and with third parties. For the past few years, we've been working with BlackRock to transform the investment manager operating model. Through our collaboration, we've driven increased quality and efficiency with high straight-through processing rates, increased transparency throughout the investment lifecycle, accelerated information delivery and synchronized data that supports core functions for asset managers. Those benefits are available to our common clients in addition to benefits related to our new integration. By integrating our data insight, accounting and servicing tools into Aladdin, we offer seamless connectivity, transparency, and near real-time insight to our common clients through a single platform. These joint capabilities bring immediate benefits across the investment lifecycle by helping clients simplify workflows, improve efficiency and drive performance. In addition, we're working closely with BlackRock to bring more tools and functionality to the market soon. This is the beginning of us offering additional value-added services ourselves and working with third-parties. In Pershing, revenue was down year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the two previously disclosed client losses, which will no longer impact year-over-year growth after the first quarter. We also experienced lower clearance volumes than a year-ago quarter when they were particularly strong. This was partially offset by growth in total client assets. We've been successful in converting our Broker-Dealer pipeline into signed business and are currently onboarding more new business than we have in many years. This will start to show up in our results in the latter part of the year, and we will have a more meaningful impact next year. In addition, the pipeline remained strong. In Issuer Services, revenue was down reflecting lower fees in Depositary Receipts. The Corporate Trust business continued to grow despite a slower debt issuance market. We are acting with a greater sense of urgency and our work in repositioning our sales and service teams has yielded incremental growth in rising asset classes like insurance-linked securities and CLOs. We're continuing to focus on the structured finance market where we are capturing additional market share and will benefit when issuance volumes recover. We have begun converting clients onto our new CLO platform, which we got up and running in less than six months. Clients are already benefiting from our loan reporting platform, which provides them with access to high quality loan and CLO compliance data. The combination of the two platforms will allow us to automate a number of functions and become more scalable. In Treasury Services, revenue was down slightly due to lower net interest revenue, while total client deposits continued their upward trend. The benefit was offset by the change in mix between non-interest-bearing and higher cost interest-bearing deposits as clients more actively managed their balances. We're focusing our relationship and sales teams on growing higher margin areas of our business, including electronic payments, liquidity and trade, and associated deposits from our global clients. We have seen some very positive results year-to-date in terms of client wins in these higher margin areas. Our focus on FX payments is showing early signs of progress with a growing pipeline. In Clearance and Collateral Management, we reported 8% revenue growth. We again benefited from the full run rate of the newly converted government clearing Broker-Dealer clients, higher clearance volumes related to the heightened level of U.S. Treasury issuances and increased market volatility, and growth in collateral management activity from new clients as well as increased activity from existing clients. We're investing to extend the service to market participants, help clients optimize their funding needs and provide more options for our clients. As part of those investments, we've been developing capabilities to help market participants with new margin requirements for derivative transactions not cleared with the Central Counterparty Clearing House. Since 2016, we've been providing services to over half of institutions that are currently effective and we will start to assist smaller institutions that are coming into scope later this year. Turning to Investment Management, it was another tough quarter for asset management with revenues down to 17% reflecting the impact of divestitures and cumulative assets under management outflows over the last 12 months. On the positive side, outflows have slowed significantly from the fourth quarter and investment performance across some key strategies has been strong, which contributed to the improvement inflows and generated solid performance fees. To further abate outflows, we\u2019re developing multi-asset capabilities at Mellon. We're realizing savings and supporting back-office functions, and reinvesting and developing enhanced capabilities that deliver solutions for our clients. Wealth Management fee revenue was mainly impacted by lower net interest revenue and lower fees. While still small, we\u2019ve seen positive flows over the last few quarters. In terms of talent, last month we announced that Senthil Kumar will be joining our Executive Committee as Chief Risk Officer in July. Senthil is an accomplished risk executive with extensive experience. He knows the global financial markets. He has a deep understanding of the regulatory agenda and he's the right leader to continue to strengthen our risk culture and capabilities while partnering with our business to support our growth agenda. Lester Owens has joined us as Head of Operations and he is beginning to revisit how we process securities and cash with the goal of gaining material efficiencies and improving service quality. And we made several important hires in the digital area to focus on building and launching new digital offerings and reimagining the end-to-end client journey. As we look ahead, while the current expectations for the yield curve will likely negatively impact our revenue growth for the next several quarters, we will remain disciplined on expenses and continue to build-out capabilities which should eventually enable stronger growth. As you can see on Page 3 of the financial highlights document, we're adding new capabilities and unique functionality to help our clients become more efficient and make better investment decisions. We're building and upgrading platforms in many of our businesses to better support our clients, attract new clients and capture market share, and we're investing in technology and digitization to drive a more efficient and complete product set than we have today. While we certainly aren't happy with this level of performance, we remain focused on building the franchise and remain confident in the actions we're taking. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks, Charlie. Let me run through the details of our results for the quarter. Note that all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. Beginning on Page 4 of the financial highlights document. In the first quarter, total revenue was down 7% to $3.9 billion. Total fee revenue was down 9% year-on-year with just over a third of that driven by adverse currency translation due to a stronger dollar, the impact of divestitures and asset management and asset gains in the first quarter of 2018. I will cover the other drivers later in my commentary. Sequentially many of the investment services, fee-based metrics were consistent with or had small variations versus the fourth quarter with the exception of Issuer Services or volatility quarter-to-quarter is normal. Within Investment Management fees were down due to the timing of performance fees and lower Investment Management fees. Net interest revenue was down 8% driven by lower non-interest bearing deposits and loan balances, higher deposit rates and the impact of hedging activities. This was partially offset by higher yields in the securities and loan portfolios. The lower day count is a revenue drag of approximately 1% versus the fourth quarter. Non-interest expense was down 1%. The stronger U.S. dollar had a favorable impact of approximately 1% and sequentially expenses were down slightly excluding the notable items booked in the fourth quarter of 2018. This resulted in a 17% decline in pretax income to $1.2 billion, $910 million in net income applicable to common shareholders, a 15% decrease in earnings per share to $0.94 which was helped by our common stock repurchases, which reduced the share count and partially offset decline in net income, and our pretax operating margin was 31%. Now moving to capital and liquidity on Page 5. Our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong. As of March 31, our key ratios increased since year-end primarily due to earnings, unrealized gains on our investment securities portfolio and capital related to stock awards offset by capital distributions. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.2 billion as of March 31 and our CET1 ratio was 11% under the Advanced Approach. Our average LCR in the first quarter was 118% and the SLR was 6.3%. In response to legislation passed last year, the U.S. agencies released a proposal at the end of March that would exclude central bank placements with some limitations from the denominator in the SLR for us and a couple of our peers. As written, this proposed change would add about 130 basis points to 140 basis points to our SLR. While we support this proposal and it adds flexibility to our day-to-day balance sheet management, our binding capital constraint remains the Tier 1 leverage ratio in CCAR. Looking at net interest revenue on Page 6. First quarter net interest revenue was down 8% to $841 million and was down 5% sequentially. Sequentially, the day count accounted for approximately 1% of the decline in net interest revenue. Year-over-year, our deposit balances decreased. As discussed last year, our deposits in the first quarter of 2018 were higher than expected. Given the elevated deposits last year, it might be more helpful to look at the sequential change in deposits. Non-interest bearing deposits continue to decline as clients redeployed balances the higher yielding alternatives or used the cash for other needs. Our interest-bearing deposits were also down slightly versus the fourth quarter. As I've mentioned each quarter over the last year, pricing continues to be competitive and betas are high. The rates on interest-bearing deposits increased from 86 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 99 basis points this quarter. On the surface, this would imply the positive beta of approximately 50% across all currencies. When you focus on core interest-bearing, U.S. dollar client deposits, excluding wholesale funding, betas have been on average a little lower than 100%. Although the rate curve is flattened and expectations for future hikes have lessened, we have not seen \u2013 yet seen a decline in the competitive pressure for deposits. Higher yields in our securities and loan portfolios where the primary driver in the increase of the yield on our interest-earning assets, which was partially offset by the impact of lower deposits and loans and higher deposit pricing. Loan balances decline year-over-year and sequentially driven by lower margin loans in Pershing due to lower client activity and lower volumes in other areas due in part to normal paydowns. The net interest margin decreased 2 basis points to 1.2%; sequentially the NIM declined 4 basis points. Also note that the effects of certain hedging activities are recorded in fee revenue and not reflected in net interest revenue or the net interest margin is negatively impacted net interest revenue by a little more than 1% and the NIM by approximately 2 basis points, against both comparative periods. The offsetting benefit is reflected in FX and other trading and is not included in the net interest margin. Page 7 details our expenses. On a consolidated basis expenses of $2.7 billion were down 1%. The stronger U.S. dollar had a favorable impact of approximately 1%. We remained vigilant on managing expenses and funded our increased investment in technology with ongoing efficiency efforts and other decreases and expenses, including lower incentive expense, volume related expenses and lower bank assessment charges. Please note that the technology expenses are included in staff, professional, legal and other purchase services and software and equipment expenses. We continue to believe we have opportunity to drive more efficiency across the organization in the coming quarters. Now turning to Page 8. Total Investment Services revenue was down 5%. Asset Servicing revenue was down 7% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting lower foreign exchange activity, lower net interest revenue due to lower deposit, lower client activity and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. We are asked a lot about pricing pressure and asset servicing, while there continues to be pricing headwinds, the pressure has been consistent with recent years. We haven't seen a meaningful uptick from the trend. Pershing revenue was down 5% to $554 million, previously disclosed loss business impact at growth by approximately 3%. The remaining decline was primarily related to lower clearance volumes compared to the first quarter of 2018 when volumes were particularly strong. The decline was partially offset by growth in client assets and good growth in the RIA Servicing business. Although RIA Servicing is a smaller piece of the revenue, it grew roughly 10% year-over-year. The sequential decreased reflects \u2013 lower net interest revenue primarily due to lower margin loans, which was a result of lower client activity. As discussed previously, the new business that we were onboarding will start to show up in our results and a lot of part of the year and have a more meaningful impact in 2020. Issuer Services revenue was down 5% to $396 million, primarily reflecting lower fees and Depositary Receipts and lower net interest revenue due to lower deposits in Corporate Trust, partially offset by slightly higher volumes. Given that the timing of fees in Depositary Receipts can vary quarter-to-quarter based on client activity, it's more meaningful to focus on fees over the full-year versus one single quarter. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower Depositary Receipts fees, volumes and net interest revenue in Corporate Trust. Treasury Services revenue was down slightly to $317 million, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue. Although total deposits are up in this business with the greatest traction coming from clients in Asia, we were seeing the impact of lower non-interest bearing deposits and higher competitive pressure on pricing for interest-bearing deposits. Clearance and Collateral Management revenue was up 8% to $276 million primarily reflecting growth and collateral management and clearance volumes, while the majority of the growth in this business was driven by the conversion of new clients due to a competitor exiting the U.S. government clearing business, we are seeing growth from other new clients and also increased activity particularly in the U.S. Average tri-party collateral management balances were up 21%, reflecting the strong growth. A few additional items of note, as you can see, foreign exchange and other trading revenue was down 7% within that foreign exchange revenue within the segment was down 18% driven by lower client volumes and lower volatility, and securities revenue was down 8%. Assets under custody and/or administration increased 3% year-over-year to $34.5 trillion, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business offset by the impact of stronger U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted assets under custody administration growth by approximately 2%. Turning to Page 9. Although we have already covered all the details for Investment Services, hopefully this will be an easy reference page for you. It summarizes the key drivers that affected revenue versus the first quarter of 2018 for each of the Investment Services businesses. Now turning to Page 10 for the Investment Management business highlights. Total Investment Management revenue was down 14%. Asset Management revenue was down 17% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $637 million. Almost half of the year-over-year decrease resulted from the impact of the 2018 divestitures and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, principally versus the British pound. The rest of the decrease primarily reflects the cumulative impact of assets under management outflows over the last year in lower performance fees. The sequential decreased primarily reflects the timing of performance fees and the impact of outflows partially offset by higher equity market values. Our overall flows were flat in the quarter. We had $4 billion of outflows from equities driven in part by lower performing strategies in a shift to pathos and $2 billion of outflows from index products, primarily driven by two clients withdrawing assets. Multi-asset and alternative outflows were $4 billion. Fixed income and cash turned to inflows with $3 billion and $2 billion respectively. Our liability-driven investment strategies had $5 billion in inflows after strong inflows in the second half of last year and the pipeline for LDI remains strong. Overall assets under management of $1.8 trillion is up 7% versus the end of the fourth quarter primarily due to higher markets. Wealth Management revenue was down 5% year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially to $302 million with a year-over-year decrease, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue and fees. Within Wealth Management, client assets decreased 1% and were up sequentially to $253 billion. Wealth Management client deposits grew both year-over-year and sequentially. However, net interest revenue overall decline due to lower loans and higher deposit pricing. Now turning to our other segment on Page 11. Fee revenue decreased year-over-year primarily reflecting asset-related gains recorded in the first quarter of 2018. Also just to reminder that the last year, we recorded $49 million of net securities losses related to the sale of approximately $1 billion of debt securities. Non-interest expense decreased year-over-year reflecting lower incentive expense. The sequential decreased primarily reflects the expenses associated with severance and relocating our corporate headquarters both recorded in 4Q 2018. Looking ahead to the second quarter, there were a few things to consider for your modeling. With respect to the net interest revenue, I'll walk you through the assumptions for the key variables impacting NIR. As of today, our total deposit balances and non-interest bearing deposits are a little lower than the average deposits in the first quarter. We are expecting net average non-interest bearing deposits will continue to come down. Short-term rates have declined since the first quarter and the yield curve has flattened. As a result, we expect the yield and our securities portfolio to be relatively flat to the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, competition for deposits is still high and thus we expect that the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits will increase a little. Given these assumptions, we would expect net interest revenue to decline between 3% and 5% in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Given the levels of assets under management, we should benefit modestly versus the first quarter in Investment Management fees. And lastly, we continue to expect the full-year 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%. With that, operator, can you please open the lines for questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Charles Scharf : Good morning, Betsy. Elizabeth Graseck : Couple of questions. One on the deposit guidance \u2013 the NIR guidance that you just laid out. I know you gave us a lot of detail around 2Q and I guess I'm just wondering as we think forward from there, do you anticipate that the deposit competition would slow and then really it's a function of yield curve or is there anything that you expect you\u2019d be doing in the balance sheet to shift the trajectory of NIR if this current rate environment held? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Hey Betsy, it\u2019s Mike. I'll take a shot and Charlie can add if you want. I think if rates sort of stay where they are, we would expect over time that pricing sort of stabilizes. As I said in my remarks, we haven't quite seen that yet, but we would expect pricing to stabilize as we go. And as you sort of think about the new rate environments and things we can do on the balance sheet, we're doing all the things you would sort of expect us to do as we sort of look to optimize, as we look forward both on the funding side and how we sort of manage the securities portfolio primarily. Elizabeth Graseck : Okay. Anything on like bringing down other wholesale cost of funds or shifting the liability structure at all that might help out here? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, we're looking at all of that and I think there's things we can do both on our long-term debt that we've got both on tenor and quantum as well as sort of all of the funding sources that we\u2019re sort of looking at. Elizabeth Graseck : Okay. Thanks. All right. And then separate topic on the efficiency improvements that you outlined. Maybe give us a sense as to the quantum of that and kind of the time frame that you think that that would occur over? Charles Scharf : Sure. Hey Betsy, it's Charlie. So when we talked last quarter, what we said was we're continuing to significantly increase our investment in technology and we wouldn't expect to see a meaningful change in expenses this year. So obviously embedded in there are a whole series of efficiency improvements that we expect to get throughout the year, and we feel very good about our ability to deliver that. I'll say that we are in the early stages of figuring out kind of what's next taking it to the next level. We have several new people who have joined us. As I mentioned Lester, who runs over 20,000 of the 50,000 people, I think we all have \u2013 we all believe that there's continued meaningful opportunity to become more efficient and improve the quality. And so hopefully we would expect there to be more, but not quite sure on the timing yet. Elizabeth Graseck : Okay. And then just lastly on\u2026 Charles Scharf : All I can say is just you can assume that we're pushing as hard as we can. Elizabeth Graseck : Okay. And then just lastly on the announcement that you made with BlackRock regarding the Aladdin functionality that you're enabling your clients to benefit from. Could you give us a sense as to how much you think that is going to help out either on your efficiency or your client's efficiency? And I know in the press release, you highlighted this was the first of many or \u2013 enhancements that you're anticipating, maybe give us some color on the roadmap that you're expecting with this strategic alliance. Charles Scharf : Yes, so I put it into two different categories. There\u2019s series of things that we've been working with BlackRock for a long period of time line. That relate to the processing requirement that we have between what Aladdin does and what our capabilities are. And as we have gone through that journey with them, and by the way, just to be clear, a lot of it is \u2013 I'm not saying this is just us. We\u2019ve just taken the efficiency with which we process our transactions to an extraordinarily high level that we haven't seen in many other places, and so that's an opportunity which benefits us because we become more efficient, but it obviously benefits to the asset manager as well because they see efficiencies on their side as well as quality improvement with the extraordinarily high rates of straight through processing that we ultimately have. So those are our opportunities that common clients have. And then in addition to that, we've introduced a series of analytical capabilities that benefit both operations professionals and investment managers embedded in the Aladdin technology that we think provides further benefits. So I think as we look at it, it benefits us for sure, but it also creates additional capabilities for clients that today \u2013 that are available in the marketplace today. This isn't something that we're dreaming of. This isn't an idea that we have. It's there today. And our goal is to continue to expand the integration and to think about other third parties that are important for our clients, who are non-Aladdin clients. Elizabeth Graseck : Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you so much Charlie. Charles Scharf : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks so much. Looking for a little more color on the comments around the significant deposit pressure, and we all know it's real and ongoing, but I'm curious on how it manifests itself, how the dialogue happens. And more importantly, if you have metrics around overall client profitability that you can price per client, I'm just looking for a little bit behind the scenes if I could? Michael Santomassimo : Hey, Glenn. It\u2019s Mike. Sure. So as you know, most of what we do is a \u2013 it operates in a pretty competitive marketplace right across lots of strong competitors both here in the U.S. and outside the U.S., and so our clients are \u2013 and many of our clients are doing business with multiple providers both in the Asset Servicing space and the Treasury Services space. So the price transparency around deposits is there for clients and so they're very well informed and in dialogue with all of those competitors, and so it happens naturally and sort of the conversation around what am I getting paid on my deposits and here's what so and so is sort of offering. And so very natural conversation sort of with clients and that \u2013 as I said, that transparency is very much there in the marketplace. Now just keep in mind, as you know most of our deposits are linked to operational activities, but there is ability for clients to sort of move deposits on the margin to take advantage of where there are differences and what clients are sort of paying. So I think that's the nature of that. What was the second part of the question? Charles Scharf : Our client profitability. Michael Santomassimo : Client profitability, sorry. Yes, so we do very detailed client profitability for our clients and have a very good sense of what's driving that and can be smart about pricing both deposits as well as sort of the overall relationship in a way that optimizes it by client. So we feel pretty good about that. Charles Scharf : Yes. And I'll just add to it. I think it's a strong discipline that exists, not just in how much we make on NII of the client, but it's a relationship view where we see all the activity that we do with the client across the entire firm. And I think we try and be smart about maximizing profit and returns relative to what the relationship looks like. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. Just one other quick one. And we could stay high level, but the notion of non-transparent ETFs obviously is on display with the SEC\u2019s recent comments. So the question is from both Asset Management, Asset Servicing, I would think from asset management\u2019s stand point, I'm curious on your thoughts on how much of a benefit and how much product design you might have in motion? And on the flip side, is there risk on the Asset Servicing side simply because I think of a generically of \u2013 look these products, if they succeed in the future or succeed because they bring a lower cost and lower cost Investment Management fee, lower cost on the Servicing side. So how much of an impact is that there for you guys? Charles Scharf : Glenn, we're looking at that now. As you know, it's not a big piece of the pie now, nor do I personally think it will be a big piece anytime soon. But we're spending some time looking at it now both in the Asset Management side and Asset Servicing make sure, we understand it fully. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate it guys. Thanks. Charles Scharf : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi, great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just to go back to the deposit questions to Charlie and Mike. Can you talk a little bit about some of your organic growth initiatives, the progress on the priorities that you highlighted in the presentation in terms of the ability to grow deposits organically. And then you\u2019ve potentially stabilized the net interest revenue profile, maybe regrow it maybe later in the year or is that longer-term? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, I think \u2013 just sort of think about the organic growth initiatives, I mean Charlie sort of highlighted a bunch of them by business. And as we said, this will take some time to really be meaningful across any of the businesses or sort of in total. But we're seeing good traction in a lot of it. Charlie highlighted the Corporate Trust activity that we're seeing. We're seeing some green shoots in sort of that business as we sort of build-out the capabilities. Pershing continues to be strong and getting stronger in terms of the pipeline. Asset management has been doing a good job, building out some differentiated strategies, like risk parity and a whole bunch of other items that will build over time. We've seen \u2013 also seen some good performance in some of the key strategies that will take in that business as well. And so I think, we feel confident sort of our ability to sort of execute on these. But as we've said, it will take some time to see it come into the picture. I think \u2013 do you want to add anything Charlie? Charles Scharf : No. I just \u2013 we're going to hide behind the facts of the quarter, right? They are what they are. NII is disappointing. That's obviously clear when you look at the results. But when we look at the underlying metrics of the progress that we're making, which is what will drive the long-term performance within the Asset Servicing business, we feel very good about the pipelines and the types of things that we're seeing. The things that we've announced with BlackRock and other things we're working on are what's going to drive the success in the future, both in fees and ultimately in our ability to attract deposits, which come at that business. We've talked about Pershing extensively about getting through these couple of losses that we've had, but we've got a lot more coming and we feel great about the pipeline there. Issuer Services, we talked about the share that we're taking or I should say winning back in some respects. In the Corporate Trust business, Treasury Services, we feel very good about the way we're building the business and what the opportunities are there. Clearance and Collateral Management is done extremely well, not just because of the conversions from JPMorgan, but just the underlying growth that we've been able to generate there. And Investment Management, we had the outflows last year, but performance is coming back. So I just \u2013 we do have to get through the reality of the interest rate environment, but the things that we're doing to drive growth over a period of time, we don't feel any worse about. And I think on the margin, we feel slightly better and we're continuing to drive it. But it will take time to show up in the numbers. Brian Bedell : That's super helpful. And then just on the back to the BlackRock announcement, I think its 40 or so clients said \u2013 I think we saw in the press, in terms of common clients between BlackRock and Bank of New York? Can you just talk about the timing of the integration of their services on the two platforms? And then the organic growth potential from that combined offering as you look to your other BNY clients that are not using Aladdin right now, but maybe could either switch and sort of how you think about that in the long-term paradigm of integrating the front through back office given the sort of industries shift in that direction? Charles Scharf : Yes. As I said before, the additional capabilities and the widgets in the apps that we have created, the integrated into Aladdin are available immediately, and our ability to integrate data in a more seamless way to help drive the more efficient operational process that's available today. So we made the announcement. We're in conversation with the common clients that we have to make sure they understand what the capabilities are. And so we'll see what the next couple of months what the uptick is. Again, we feel very good about the value add that's there. And as I said, we're continuing to \u2013 the capabilities that we announced aren't the end of the road. We're continuing to build new capabilities, which will be integrated. Beyond Aladdin, as I said, we believe that we should be an open platform. In fact most asset managers use more than one provider. To the extent they want to use Aladdin. We're obviously there to support them today, but we also want to be where our clients are. And so there are a lot of very strong platforms out there that our clients use. You can assume that we're having lots of discussions and the benefits that we've been able to bring to Aladdin. We would assume we would able to bring to other providers as well so we can help a bunch of broader set of our clients. Brian Bedell : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Thanks guys. Maybe just a two part question. You gave a lot of guidance on the net interest income. Just wanted to get sense given the rebound in the markets, can you provide some context on how you see that benefiting some of the fee revenues ahead? And then have you seen any improvement on the transaction side across some of your businesses like throughout the quarter given the weak start that we saw across the capital markets at beginning of the quarter? Charles Scharf : Yes, I'll start on the second part first, Mike. I think transaction volumes were pretty muted all quarter. So we didn't see really any big uptick in the second part as we sort of came out of the quarter. So it was pretty consistent. And if you recall last year, last year's volumes were very high particularly in the first half of the first quarter of 2018. So we certainly didn't see even as the market rallied in the first quarter, at least in the U.S. We didn't see that transaction volume sort of follow with it. So I think that's the case. I think on just the overall market impact, I think you can see in our disclosures in asset management what the AUM looks like. So that will give you a good sense of how we're entering the quarter by asset class and how to think about that. And then on the Asset Servicing side in particular just if you recall, roughly two-thirds are a little less of our ACI is fixed income and so we get the benefit of the market impact on the rest of other pieces of ACI \u2013 so you get a sense of how to model that as you go into the second quarter. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Adam Beatty : Thank you and good morning. This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. Just wanted to step back for a sec and talk about EPS growth. You guys said earlier, you outlined being able to grow adjusted EPS off for 2018 base. Could you just outline for us what are the key building blocks or drivers of that? Where you expect to have that growth? Thanks. Michael Santomassimo : Well, just to be clear as we've laid out here, it's a different environment today than when we made those remarks. And so our ability to fill exactly those words is certainly far more challenging. And I'm not sure how to answer the question other than revenues and expenses, right. I mean, we have the pressures that we've seen in NII, which we've laid out, fees presumably will continue to grow both with the net wins that we\u2019re seeing in our businesses, the improved flows in asset management and the market levels. And as we've talked about, we're going to continue to be very disciplined on expenses and continue to see what else is available. Adam Beatty : Understood. Thank you. Then just to hone in on deposits, particularly non-interest-bearing deposits, they were down a fair bit and you've talked a bit about that. How much of that do you view as seasonal versus the yield seeking that you identified and what's the outlook? Should we expect the stabilization from here? Charles Scharf : I wouldn't think of the decline as seasonal. I don't know that would be the right way to think about it. And look I think as we've said for a while and as I said in my remarks, we would expect those to come down a little bit more in the second quarter and I wouldn't go any further than that at this point. Adam Beatty : Great. Thank you for taking our questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein : Thanks. Hi, guys. Good morning. So first question, just looking for a little bit more color on [indiscernible] beyond sort of second quarter commentary and specifically as the yield curve has flattened out here. Can you help us think through the repricing risk on the fixed side of the securities portfolio to kind of where you reinvested today, what\u2019s rolling on versus what's rolling off? And if the curve kind of stays at its current state, what sort of the spread pressure we should anticipate over the next coming quarters? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. So Alex, this is Mike. So I think what we've said in the past which is still the case, call it a third of the securities portfolio reprices every quarter, roughly a third. So that's either maturing securities or floating that sort of coming into what the current rate \u2013 what the yield curve looks like. So I think you can sort of use that as the basis to do your modeling. And then I think as I said for the second quarter, we would expect pricing to inch up a little bit on interest-bearing deposits and so that'll give you a sense of how to think about the compression there. Alexander Blostein : Okay. And then on the expense outlook, I don't know if I heard you guys update the guidance there, but I think on the last call you talked about sort of flattish maybe slightly higher expenses for the year, which I think, call it $10.9 billion expense base last year. Obviously, the environment has changed where you guys are doing what you can on that front, so a nice reduction in the headcount this quarter. But I guess as you look beyond, does the expense got hold, still kind of flattish expenses for the year or should we anticipate slightly lower costs? Charles Scharf : I think I answered this earlier, I think we are still very comfortable with what we've said, which is we're continuing to significantly increase the investment in technology and offset it with efficiencies that we're getting elsewhere. And so our ability to deliver on that, I think we still feel very, very good about. We've got some new people in some big jobs here that are continuing to dive in and figure out what comes next. We all feel like we've got a lot more opportunity than we've currently addressed, but not exactly sure what the timing is. So more to come as the year unfolds. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks. Charlie, I just wanted to follow-up on something you mentioned earlier. You said the widgets are already for the Aladdin to be able to roll that out to all your clients. But you also talked about developing stuff for the others. Are you already ready with developing products for other providers like Aladdin or is that something in process? Where are you in that process? Charles Scharf : Yes, that's a good question. And so just to be clear, the capabilities that we have in these applications in widgets can be integrated into countless operating environments elsewhere as long as they can accept them. So these weren't built necessarily for one specific environment and so we're going full speed with others. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. And so is the next step now just sort of going out and offering this to your Asset Servicing clients and is this something that you'd get paid, for Charlie, a separate fee? Or does it roll into the overall fee rate? Can you walk through sort of what it means from our revenue and business standpoint now that you have this and can provide this? Charles Scharf : Yes. So for the things that we have rolled out now, these are \u2013 they're actually capabilities that existing clients currently have in our Asset Servicing space. And so whatever we get paid for the business we have with them they have access to those capabilities. What the integration with Aladdin does is it makes it far, far easier to actually access our capabilities at the act. At the same time, they're accessing, all of the information and capabilities that lead up to the time we get involved in the trade. So just think of the ability to be \u2013 have one screen with your front-end on one part of the screen, your backend on the other, and being able to answer questions real time effectively on one screen. And so to the extent that we build-out additional capabilities, just like we wouldn't our typical business, those are things that we might or might not charge for. But what we're doing today is what we're getting paid for. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Charles Scharf : But I would say that there is relatively little uptick on the things that we have created because it's hard to use them in concert with the front-end and what we've done with Aladdin solves that problem. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Now if we \u2013 compare this with what State Street did by buying CRD? Do you feel this sort of completely fills that without having \u2013 you having to do the acquisition or does this more stuff that you need to add or built from a capability standpoint? Charles Scharf : Yes, listen. I think, we've been very, very clear that we don't believe that owning a front-end is necessary or even the right thing. I'm certainly given what our businesses. As I said before, many \u2013 most asset managers use multiple providers. Staying at the forefront of building capabilities on the front-end is an entire business unto its own that has changed and will continue to change dramatically. That's not our sweet spot. But there are others that do nothing but this that focus on that. And some of them are really good at it. And so what we want to do is make sure that we're working as closely together as we can, not just on integrating capabilities, but working on common data sets in a whole series of things that do make the process much more seamless than it's been. And so that's the journey that we're on and we think that's it would be extremely attractive to asset managers and asset owners. Vivek Juneja : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll next go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kenneth Usdin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a big picture question on just the activity levels, I think for the last couple of quarters we've been understanding just how good the year-ago was and getting down to some different level now? Can you just characterize what do you think of the activity that we saw across the businesses in the first quarter, and if you're getting any sense that you're feeling that this is either a baseline or more stable or more just and trying to put it into perspective, and how you would think about a kind of a normal environment? Michael Santomassimo : Hey, Ken. It\u2019s Mike. I think given sort of the moves in the market that you've seen over the last couple quarters, I think the activity is definitely a little more muted than what we would have expected, in terms of just pure transaction activity across the different businesses. Is it a new normal? It's hard to say, right? I think that could change tomorrow depending on sort of how investors are sort of feeling and the activity levels that are sort of coming off the back of that. So \u2013 but I would definitely say it's a little more muted than what we would have thought, just given the moves and that are happening in the market. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Follow-up on the deposit competition that you mentioned, last quarter you talked about a 100% betas, obviously with rates stopping, we can't really measure beta anymore, but when you talk about competition for those deposits, how do you gauge when that starts to abate? What do you think it\u2019s driving that pressure and do you have a feel for the magnitude of deposit costs increase you're still expecting? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Look, I think it's \u2013 I think the way we're going to know, it\u2019s abating is based on the client dialogue that we're having, right, which is happening every day, right across different teams. So we get real time information about sort of what we're seeing in the marketplace. And so I think that will be the best judge as we start to see those dialogues, change a bit. But do you would expect as we discussed earlier that as rate sort of stayed here for a while that that pressure would it be at some point? Charles Scharf : Yes. And just how we're building on it to that, the way we know is we sit in the room with the business leaders and we'd go through exactly what they are seeing in the marketplace as they talk to clients because it's not like we just sit and look at a bunch of reports and see numbers go up or down. Those conversations, where's the money coming from? Where's the money going to and exactly what rates are we paying? What rates are others paying? And I just echo what Mike said is I think as we've gone through a period of change, people have done some different things in the marketplace, but as rates stabilize, you would expect deposit \u2013 the rates that people pay to do the same as well. Michael Santomassimo : Ken, I would just add, I think if you looked across the folks that we compete with every day in our businesses and you could actually see into those businesses, you would see the same dynamic. It's just more transparent here. Kenneth Usdin : Yes. Okay. Last quick one just on CCAR, obviously we know you just submitted. You guys did a nice job asking for that re-up for last year. Capital ratios continue to build. Can you help us frame just how you're thinking about capital return in the context of still being in a really strong position versus still waiting for some of the things from the fed to swing one way or the other? Charles Scharf : I think we've said what we have to say on capital, right, which is to the extent that we're not going to be using it to grow. We believe we should return it, and we feel good about our position and the process is the process. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys. Charles Scharf : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Following up on the deposit commentary that you guys had this morning, have you been able to determine from your customers \u2013 the customers that are taking deposits out of non-interest-bearing, which ones are putting into interest-bearing versus putting it into their own businesses? Have you been able to decipher how much is going into their own business versus than just moving in over for a higher yielding deposits? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, I think it's almost an impossible question to answer with any degree of like certainty by client. But I think as you sort of look at the themes, like it's clear, people are managing their cash more \u2013 they're trying to optimize the yield to get on their cash and being a little \u2013 having more urgency around that. And some are \u2013 some asset managers are putting to work, some companies that we deal, other corporates that we deal with maybe investing, but it's hard to say that with any degree of certainty. Gerard Cassidy : I see. Okay. Thanks. And then second, if Chairman, Paul pivots similar to what Fed Reserve Chairman, Greenspan did following the 1994, 1995 tightening cycle where they were raising rates in the spring of 1995 and cut by July. If we see rate cuts and some of the futures markets is calling that the Fed funds are able to be cut this year. How quickly do you think your deposit betas could fall in that kind of environment? Charles Scharf : I think it's \u2013 I mean obviously we'll have to see what's happening at that time, but if rates start to decline, we would expect that we would recapture that very quickly. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks, Gerard. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great. Good morning. Quick question on the loans, you mentioned that there was lower client activity driving down the balances in the lending. Can you just maybe highlight it or give a little bit more color as to what the client activity was? Was it decreasing? And is that expected to increase at any point? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, like loans are really small driver for us as you know from our balance sheets. But just to give you a sense of a little bit of color, we have margin loan activity or other securities-based lending activity in Pershing as an example, and we saw that come down. We don't think that's a permanent decline, but we saw that come down based on activity in the quarter. That's just an example, but it's a pretty small driver overall for the results. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then just separate question on Asset Servicing. You mentioned you saw a growth in the alternatives. Was that new or was it alternative clients new to outsourcing? Or was it just building relationships from clients that are already outsourced? Charles Scharf : The mix, both. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. Charles Scharf : Okay. I think that's the last one. Thanks. We appreciate everyone dialing in. Thanks for the time. We'll talk soon. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call webcast. A replay of this conference call webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 p.m. Eastern Standard time today. Have a good day.",

Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.I'll now turn the call over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon's Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Magda Palczynska : Good morning. Today, BNY Mellon released its results for the second quarter of 2019. The earnings press release and the financial highlights presentation to accompany this call are both available on our website at bnymellon.com. Charlie Scharf, BNY Mellon's Chairman and CEO, will lead the call; then Mike Santomassimo, our CFO, will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Mike's prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions].Before we begin, please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC, all available on our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July 17, 2019, and will not be updated.With that, I will hand over to Charlie. Charles Scharf : Thank you, Magda. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll share some overall thoughts about our second quarter performance, then I'll hand it off to Mike who will then take you through the financials in more detail. We reported earnings per share of $1.01, down 2% versus a year ago. Total revenue was down 5% year-on-year. As we anticipated, the level and shape of the yield curve negatively impacted our results due to lower NII. In addition, continued low levels of volatility and overall muted market activity negatively impacted our foreign exchange and securities lending activities in Asset Servicing. And our Asset Management business suffered from the impact of lower assets under management and the impact of divestitures.Against that backdrop, we continue to maintain strong expense discipline without sacrificing investments for the future of our franchise. Total expenses were down 4%. This includes a significant increase in our technology investment, which was more than offset by savings in other areas. So we're being very judicious and ruthlessly prioritizing investments while also benefiting from our continued progress in increasing our underlying efficiency.On the capital front, return on tangible common equity was 21%. Our capital ratios remain strong, and we continue to return the substantial amount of capital back to our shareholders. We're increasing our quarterly common stock dividend by 11% to $0.31 per share starting in Q3. We also plan to repurchase up to $3.94 billion of common stock through the second quarter of 2020, an increase of around 20%.The significant impact of lower NII on our business certainly impacts our thinking of how we manage the company in the short term, but it does not change our longer-term focus and our work to build out our franchisees. Our business mix is unique, our market positions are strong, and we see opportunities across the company to build out a stronger longer-term growth profile.Pershing is a great example. We occupy a great position serving the wealth community and continue to invest in our market-leading platform to serve independent broker-dealers, but we also continued to invest significantly to capture more of the fast-growing RIA segment. We held our annual client event this quarter with attendance by a couple of thousands of our clients and partners. At that meeting, we announced a series of initiatives aimed at improving our clients' experiences.We're streamlining and digitizing customer onboarding for our clients to enable them to spend to more time, what they do best. We're also rolling out a new capability that will allow firms and advisers to use net asset flows and KPIs to measure their overall business performance and identify trends in their business more quickly. We've also just released a new technology assessment tool to help advisory firms pinpoint their technology needs, identify the right technology stacks and drive better returns on technology investments at a time when clients are increasingly struggling with those topics.And as we said over the last few quarters, we're moving beyond the impact of the client losses that impacted our results over the last year and expect to see continued improvement in our revenue growth as we onboard a series of new mandates later this year. In addition, our sales pipeline continues to be strong.In Clearance and Collateral Management, you see another example where we have distinct competitive advantages and are seeing continued strong performance. Given our role in servicing both in the buy and sell side and our status as the sole provider of U.S. government clearing, we can help clients optimize their funding needs in a way that others just can't. We continue to generate additional revenue through collateral optimization services as well as attracting incremental balances.In addition, client activity and market demand is driving increased securities settlement volumes and growth in collateral management balances. We continue to see strong U.S. government securities settlement volumes driven by elevated levels of U.S. Treasury issuance and secondary market trading. This business should continue to be a source of strong organic growth. Both banks as well as nonbanks are seeking access to our government securities settlement platforms and access to U.S. dollar funding market through tri-party and other repo clearing capabilities.As we increase the coordination of our government securities clearance platform and our global collateral management capabilities, we expect to provide enhanced capabilities across regions especially as we develop interoperability across those regions and assets. We're currently working to build the next-generation global collateral platform to support these capabilities as well as enhance resiliency and data and analytic capabilities not currently available in the market. We think it will significantly boost our ability to attract new market participants as well as additional business from our existing clients. In addition, the business remains focused on technology-enabled solutions for our clients, facilitating optimization of collateral across our platform as well as for collateral held away from us and the ability to monitor intraday liquidity credit usage on-demand with our proprietary APIs.We're also seeing progress in Issuer Services. Our reduced CLO platform has been received well by clients and should provide the foundation for us to compete more effectively. We continue to see good business momentum in Corporate Trust as we gain market share in a number of our key debt products.In Treasury Services, while we're challenged by the impact of the yield curve, we do see some success in our focus on expanding our client relationships, which was -- has resulted in higher deposit balances. While these are interest-bearing deposits predominantly, they are from strong relationships across multiple geographies and we think strengthens our business over the long term. We remain focused on building our liquidity, trade finance and payments businesses as well.In Asset Servicing, although equity markets particularly in the U.S. have been strong, reduced client activity and the impact of the yield curve has negatively impacted our financial results, but we continue to experience important new wins across client segments and geographies. Just to highlight 2 of them : We were recently awarded mandates by ATP, Denmark's largest pension fund; and in the U.S., we were named Microsoft's new Global Custodian for their treasury operations, the first time in nearly a decade that Microsoft has switched custodians. And we continue to expand our service and capabilities for higher-growth asset classes, such as alternatives and ETFs. In fact, assets under custody related to ETF servicing are up roughly 50% against a year ago, a sign of our traction in the marketplace.The client response to our commitment to work with third parties to more closely integrate the front-to-back operating model has been positive. Our alliance with BlackRock has also been well received, and we're in the process of enabling our integrated functionality to several joint clients and continue to have extensive discussions across existing and potentially new clients.And as I mentioned, and Mike will cover in more detail, low levels of volatility and market activity have significantly impacted our foreign exchange and securities lending activities. While we haven't seen a change in these trends just yet, they can and will change very quickly at some point, we will be the beneficiary of that.In our Asset Management business, though our performance in Asset Management was negatively impacted from cumulative outflows over the past year, the level of outflows in our higher-margin products has slowed and we're seeing continued improvement, investment performance, particularly in some of our larger equity strategies.In our Wealth business, we were negatively impacted by the interest rate environment, but our assets under management flows, where we get paid for investment advice, continued to be positive.On the expense side, you see the impact of our continued focus on using our resources wisely. We have not announced a special program to reduce expenses, but as I think you can see in our results and will continue to see, we're embedding quality improvement and a clear focus on increasing efficiency into the BNY Mellon culture and how we manage the company. This includes eliminating unnecessary management layers across every area of the firm, from staff to sales to operations; automating processes which are today manual; and rethinking the flow of activity between us and our clients.Just a reminder, while these activities will result in lower expenses, it's actually more important that they will increase the quality of the work we do for our clients. While it sounds more strategic to discuss new capabilities we're building, which we are, there's a meaningful opportunity to improve our growth trajectory by differentiating our firm through the quality of the work we delivered day in and day out. We're far from done here. This is a multi-year journey and the ability to continue to drive benefits for both our clients and ourselves continues to be extremely meaningful.And as I mentioned earlier, though our expenses declined this quarter, they continue to include a significant increase in technology and product development investments. While some of these expenses are discretionary to some extent, we remain committed to these investment to build the business for the future. We will continue to keep an eye on the impact to the environment and our business and know that we have this lever and others to pull if we choose to reduce the expense base even more significantly. But we believe we should protect these investments as much as we can as they will drive much of the future success of the company. Having said that, we remain confident that our ability to continue to drive improved quality and drive efficiency will offset these investments for the next couple of quarters.We also continue to bring in and elevate exceptional talent to help us accelerate our progress. There have been a couple of talent changes worth highlighting. Bill Daley has joined s Vice Chairman and will be responsible for overseeing our government affairs, philanthropy and corporate and social responsibility efforts. I've known Bill for many years and couldn't be more excited to attract someone with his reputation, abilities, experience and judgment. Jim Crowley has become CEO of Pershing. Jim has spent his career at Pershing and has overseen a broad range of responsibilities, from sales operations, most recently serving at the Chief Operating Officer. He knows our clients, systems and organization, so it's been a quick and seamless transition. Most importantly, Jim understands the importance of not missing a beat with our business while thinking through where we can go to play an even bigger role in the support of the growing Wealth business.And we just announced that Jolen Anderson will be joining in September as Head of Human Resources. I've known and worked with Jolen and know how important she will be in our journey at creating a high-performance culture that can support the growth of our business.So in closing, we in the industry will have to continue navigating market challenges as the yield curve creates headwinds in the short term, but believe that we will be beneficiaries of Central Bank actions as we are confident they will ultimately result in stronger global economic growth and stronger market activity.We have not changed our belief that opportunities across the franchise to drive higher growth exist, and we continue to remain focused on balancing our short-term performance with building our company for the longer term. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks, Charlie. But let me run through the details of our results in the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise. Beginning on Page 4 of the financial highlights document. In the second quarter, total revenue was down 5% to $3.9 billion. This mainly reflected lower net interest income, the impact of prior year outflows and divestitures in Asset Management and reductions in foreign exchange and securities lending, which were driven in part by market factors. Total fee revenue was down 3% year-on-year. Within Investment Services, we saw fees grow across a number of our businesses. Net interest revenue was down 12% and expenses were down 4%. This resulted in an 8% decline in pretax income to $1.3 billion, $969 million in net income applicable to common shareholders and a 2% decrease in earnings per share to $1.01, which was helped by our common stock repurchases. And our pretax operating margin was 33%.Moving now to capital and liquidity on Page 5. Our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong. As of June 30, our key ratios were stable and up since the end of the first quarter. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.5 billion and our CET1 ratio was 11.2% under the Advanced Approach. Our average LCR in the second quarter was 117%. The SLR was 6.3%. And as Charlie indicated, we are pleased with the significant capital return that we announced a few weeks ago.Now looking at net interest revenue on Page 6. As I mentioned, net interest revenue was down 12% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Total average deposits were up both year-over-year and sequentially. This was driven by higher interest-bearing deposits partially offset by the expected decline in non-interest-bearing deposits. The rates paid on interest-bearing deposits increased from 99 basis points in the first quarter of 2019 to 104 basis points in the second quarter. Despite the expectations for lower rates, pricing has continued to be competitive throughout the second quarter but appears to have stabilized. Loan balances declined in Pershing and Clearance and Collateral Management primarily driven by lower client demand for leverage. The net interest margin decreased 8 basis points sequentially, driven by the impact of higher deposit rates and lower market rates impacting our reinvestment yield.On Page 7, we'll go into more detail about how our net interest revenue changed versus the first quarter. As I said, net interest revenue was down 5% sequentially, which was at the low end of the range we provided with our first quarter results. At that time, I'd said that we expected that average non-interest-bearing deposits would continue to come down and that the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits would continue to increase due to competition. Both of these happened as expected.At that point, we also expected the yield in our securities portfolio to be relatively flat to the first quarter. Given the downturn in rates since then, the yield on securities portfolio was actually down approximately 5 basis points. U.S. short-term rates moved 5 to 20 basis points lower during the quarter, impacting our loans and floating rate securities. The longer end of the curve is lower by between 30 and 40 basis points, impacting our fixed rate securities portfolio reinvestment yields. European government securities yields are also lower. As reminder, about 1/3 of our portfolio reprices every quarter. Including the lower yield on the secured portfolio is the negative impact from higher premium amortization. These reductions were partially offset by the higher interest-bearing deposit balances and we took advantage of short-term investment opportunities.We're taking action to increase NII while maintaining our current risk profile. For example, we sold low-yielding munis in the quarter and reinvested in high-grade CLOs and other asset-backed securities. We also took advantage of attractive pricing in the reverse repo market and are selectively investing in short-term loan assets as well as optimizing funding in long-term debt issuance.Now Page 8 details our expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $2.65 billion were down 4%. Approximately 1% of the decrease was driven by the favorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The remaining decrease reflects lower staff expense and our continued expense discipline which resulted in decreases in most other expense categories while absorbing a significant increase in technology investment, which is reflected in staff, professional, legal and other purchase services as well as software and equipment warrants.As discussed over the last couple quarters, we have executed a number efficiency initiatives, including organization streamlining, which helped drive the expense improvement in the quarter. We remain confident that we can become significantly more efficient in the future.Turning to Page 9. Total investment service revenue was down 3%. Assets under custody and administration increased 6% year-over-year to $35.5 trillion, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Within Asset Servicing, revenue was down 8% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue, foreign exchange and securities lending, lower client activity and the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. As you can see, foreign exchange and other trading revenues down 11%. In foreign exchange, client activity was modestly lower and volatility has been historically low for some time.Securities lending has also been negatively impacted by lower demand and tighter spreads. Although revenue was down, the securities available to lend increased 15%, which should position us well as the markets change. Consistent with the last number of quarters, we don't see an acceleration in pricing headwinds in the business, just a continuation of what we have seen in recent years.In Pershing, revenue was up 1% to $564 million and up 2% sequentially, reflecting the impact of higher client assets and growth in accounts and clearing volumes, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. The sequential increase includes a small piece of the new business pipeline that we've been talking about, which we expect to impact the results later in the year and have a more meaningful impact next year.Issuer Services had a good quarter. Revenue was up 3% to $446 million, benefiting from higher Depository Receipt fees and higher volumes in Corporate Trust, partially offset by lower net interest revenue in Corporate Trust. The 13% sequential increase primarily reflects higher fees in both businesses. The sequential increase in Depository Receipts was primarily driven by timing of corporate actions and a little increased transaction volume. We continue to see good business momentum in Corporate Trust.In Treasury Services, revenue was down 4% to $317 million, reflecting lower net interest revenue. Although total Treasury Services deposits are up, we are seeing the impact of the shift from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits and higher cost of it -- of the interest-bearing deposits.Clearance and Collateral Management revenue was up 6% to $284 million due to growth in current volumes in collateral management due to the new government clearing clients that we converted last year in other new clients as well as higher clearance volumes related to heightened levels of U.S. Treasury issuances. Average tri-party collateral management balances were up 21%. Approximately 2/3 is from the client conversions and the remainder is from new business and more activity from existing clients.Page 10 summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of the Investment Services business.Now turning to Investment Management on Page 11. Total Investment Management revenue was down 10%. Asset Management revenue was down 12% year-over-year to $618 million, primarily reflecting the change in AUM which was impacted by the cumulative outflows since the second quarter of 2018, partially offset by higher market values. It also reflects the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar principally versus the British pound and the impact of divestitures and hedging activities. Just a reminder, performance fees can vary based on client anniversary dates and were lower compared to significant outperformance last year, particularly in LDI.We had outflows of $24 billion in the quarter, primarily driven by $22 billion in outflows from low-fee index strategies with 2/3 of that from a single client that took assets in-house. We had equity outflows of $2 billion for the quarter. Despite the outflows, we had strong investment performance in our largest equity strategies. We had $4 billion of outflows from fixed income products, and multi-asset and alternatives inflows turned positive at $1 billion. We had $1 billion in LDI inflows and $2 billion in cash inflows and overall assets under management of $1.8 trillion, which were up 2% year-over-year due to higher markets, partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar and net outflows.Wealth Management revenue was down 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially to $299 million, with both decreases primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue partially offset by higher market values. Within Wealth Management, client assets increased 1% and were up sequentially 2% to $257 billion.Turning to our Other segment on Page 12. Noninterest expense decreased year-over-year, reflecting lower staff and occupancy expense related to consolidating our real estate that was recorded in the second quarter of 2018.Now looking ahead to the third quarter, there are a few things you should consider. With respect to net interest revenue, let me walk you through some assumptions, but as always, you should make your own assumptions as well. Based on what we see today, our interest-bearing deposits will be similar to the second quarter. We expect that average non-interest-bearing deposits will continue to come down. The rate environment has been changing quickly and the forward curve is currently pricing in at least two cuts this year, and as a result, we expect the securities portfolio yield will decline in the third quarter.The competition for deposits remains high and deposit repricing is difficult to predict with a high degree of certainty but we expect the betas on the back of the Fed rate cuts will be close to 100% for some parts of the deposit book but the overall beta will be less than 100%. Given these assumptions, we would expect the sequential percentage decline in net interest revenue to be similar to what we saw in the second quarter, depending on the yield curve, deposit pricing and non-interest-bearing deposit volumes. Keep in mind that depending on the on balance sheet and market dynamics, there may be shifts of revenue between net interest income and FX and the other trading volume. And I would continue to caution you that's very early in the quarter and the environment has been dynamic.Although equity markets have been rising, a little less than 1/3 of our AUM is correlated to the equity markets. So you should factor that into your expectations for Q3 Investment Management fees.And a reminder that we had some notable items in the third quarter of 2018 which you should factor into your modeling. And lastly, while we remain committed to continue to invest more in technology and product development, we will continue to monitor the impact of the environment in our businesses and know that we have levers to pull if necessary to further reduce our expense base.With that, operator, can you please open up the lines for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : I just have to ask on that rates part of the outlook, Mike. So you said 1/3 of the book reprices every quarter. And I'm just wondering if you can elaborate further on just the pace of change, what that means for investment yields, just presuming this curve environment. I'm assuming that then means then, if even we'll stay here, we'll have continued pressure past the third quarter. Can you elaborate on that? And also just where -- how your -- that magnitude of change and duration, where the duration stands today. Michael Santomassimo : Ken, thanks for the question. So as you would expect, I'll make sure I cover all pieces of it there and take it apart, right. But on the duration, as you would expect, given the down-tick in rates, the durations come down just naturally as pre-pays have gone up in the mortgage back book. We've -- as we continue to take action on the maturities that come through the portfolio, we add a little bit of duration back. But overall, it's ticked down slightly sort of in the -- sequentially in the quarter. As you sort of think about the impact of lower rates, there is a lag as that sort of kind of bakes into the book if 1/3 of it's repricing every quarter. So I think that you should be able to model that pretty easily, I think. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. And my quick follow-up is then, just you mentioned I guess trading rate risk for credit risk. Can you just talk about the philosophy at this point in the economic cycle of making that move, and your confidence from a risk management perspective? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I think in the -- you're talking about some of the changes we've made in the securities portfolio with be the munis and CLOs and et cetera, that I mentioned. Is that where you're -- what this was about? Kenneth Usdin : Yes, that's it, that's it. Yes. Michael Santomassimo : Yes, yes, look. I mean, I think when you look at what we did, it's -- one, it's not a major sort of driver in the book. But the munis we sold were yielding below IOER. And so all we did was sort of redeploy those in some very high quality asset-backeds and CLOs. And so I wouldn't take those as a bet or a direct -- a big change in direction of the book. Charles Scharf : Now I would -- this is Charlie. The only thing I would add is I would just take it as we're going through everything that impacts NII to figure out what we can and should do on the margin that can be additive without changing the risk profile in a real material way. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. So on the expense side this quarter, really good results. Wanted to understand. I know you gave some basic explanation on where that came from, but maybe you could drill down a little bit on how much more expense cuts you could continue to do that are not touching the investment spend. Because we get the message on NIIs coming down, but I think part of the story this quarter was you were able to offset that with the expense cuts. Charles Scharf : Yes. Betsy, it's Charlie. Listen, I've been very, very consistent I think since the day I got here about what we say on this, and nothing is different, which we continue to believe that there are meaningful opportunities to reduce expenses and that will continue for a relatively long period of time, meaning beyond what we actually even think about at this point. It cuts across a whole series of initiatives. Everything, as I've talked about, from reducing layers, location of employees, automation of things like reconciliations, instructions with clients, corporate actions, NAV automate, I mean, we'll do the long list of things that we're constantly looking at.And what I'd say is in an environment like this, you get even more focused on figuring out what you can do more quickly to have actually impact our results. Again, we do it because it drives quality. The byproduct of that, quite frankly, is that we become more efficient at this. And so as time goes on, I think we get more and more confident that there continues to be more opportunity for us, which is why I made the comments relative to the efficiencies relative to the size of the investments we have to make.We think, as I said for the remaining couple of quarters, the efficiencies will more than offset the increases. But if we think the environment warrants a change in the level of investment, we can do that. But we feel very, very positive about where we're going with the expense trajectory of the company in a way which is positive for our clients. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So I wanted to dig in a little bit to the securities book and some of the NII disclosure. And you spoke of some changes to the securities mix and maybe reinvesting in CLOs. You also talked about potential to optimize some of the higher-cost funding sources. I'm just wondering whether some of those changes or some of those actions are contemplated as part of the NII guide. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I mean, look, all if it is contemplated, Steve, as we sort of look at it. And as Charlie mentioned, sort of we're going through every last piece of it, that sort of builds up to drive NII. And we're going to continue to work to optimize it as best as we can without substantially changing sort of the risk profile that we've got. Steven Chubak : Got it. And just one -- for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about capital ratios and maybe more specifically try to get a sense as to, as you look out over the next couple of years, just given the strength of your CCAR track record, how you're thinking about managing or determining what's the appropriate capital target, especially in anticipation of the fact that the SCB could potentially be deployed or implemented as early as 2020. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Look, Steve, I think we've got to just kind of let the capital rules get finalized, right? And hopefully that will happen sooner rather than later, but we've been waiting for a while for that. So I think that will -- that's going to happen sort of first. And as you know, we've been sort of constrained with -- based on sort of the leverage ratio in CCAR for the last number of years. And so that -- we don't see that sort of changing. That's been the constraint for us going forward at this point. And we're -- as you can see over the last couple of years, we've been very active to both optimize sort of how we think about our modeling that goes into stress testing and CCAR. And I think you've seen that as we've sort of increased our capital return over the last couple of years. And I think it -- we'll continue to sort of do that as things evolve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : First question, just on Pershing. So that showed some growth in the quarter. You guys mentioned some of the onboarding of clients. Can you provide an update on the timing and the impact ahead of some of that new business as well as what drove the lower margin balance in the quarter? It seemed a little I would say counterintuitive from what we're seeing with the peers. Michael Santomassimo : Mike, it's Mike. I'll take that. So as we've said over the last few quarters, I think on the new business side, we would -- we're in the middle of onboarding a number of those clients now, and we would expect to start seeing that more meaningfully towards the end of the year and into the first part of next year. On the margin balances, there's really no story other than we've seen a lack of demand from clients right now. And that could turn pretty meaningfully pretty quickly, but it's really just been muted activity from the existing clients. Charles Scharf : Yes, but it has nothing -- I mean, it has nothing to do just the clients -- net changes in clients in our business. It's actual activity of the existing clients that we have. And it's just the impact of the way to think about the risk they want to take in the market today. Michael Carrier : Got it. Okay. And then just as a follow up. Charlie, just based on the investments, you guys mentioned the Pershing wins, you pointed to some of the asset servicing wins, you have traction on the collateral and the clearing management. So it seems like some of the organic growth initiatives that you guys have been putting in place are starting to gain some traction. Just wanted to get an update on your view on more of the strategic repositioning and outlook. Because obviously, there's a lot of focus on NII and the rate headwinds, but it seems like you're making some good traction on some of the business areas. Charles Scharf : Yes. Listen, I think it's very early and so there, too -- just because we have some businesses which have seen some growth, doesn't mean we -- that internally, we feel better about it than we should. But we do have some businesses that have continually shown some organic growth and others where it's still slow, predominantly because of the time it takes for us to build up our capabilities and the long sales cycles.We highlighted those we're seeing growth in the business and those are -- they're real, they're consistent. They relate to both our execution and the market positions that we have. And on the longer-tail businesses, such as Asset Servicing, that continues to be a work in progress, but we feel as good as we have felt that the opportunities are there. It just will continue to play out over time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Mike, you referenced, I think, a high beta expectation when in a rate cut environment. And I just was curious to get some color on what drives -- you the confidence that it will be high. This quarter, we saw market rates begin to fall and yet interest-bearing deposit yields went up. It looks like the policy -- if we get a policy cut, it'll be viewed as an insurance cut. And in the past, those haven't had as high beta. So just kind of curious about what it is that you're seeing in the market and what you're hearing from the folks closer to those deposit markets and what would give you the confidence that those betas would be high. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I mean, Brennan, look, I mean, obviously, we'll see how things play out over the next coming weeks, but we've got a very disciplined process where we go business by business, segment by segment within those businesses and try to be realistic about what the beta is going to look like for each of those segments. And that's sort of how we go about the process of trying to understand what's possible. And some of those segments are more competitive than others and will have lower beta than others, and there's dynamics that we sort of take into account. And so we're going to continue to do that and work through that as sort of rates sort of come down. Charles Scharf : The only thing I'd add, Brennan, and I know you know this. But we don't sit here and pretend to be able to forecast how many rate cuts there will be. What he said is we're just taking what's in the implieds and saying, \"If that holds true, here's what we would expect.\" To the extent that it's something less than that and it's something more insurance-like, you might be right, but then that also changes the outlook for NII in a more positive way than it otherwise would have been for some of the out quarters. But if it is a series of cuts, then the rate at which we and others will be willing to move is impacted by that. So a lot will have to do with what the actions are and what the words are around it and what the expectations are beyond that first cut. Brennan Hawken : Yes. That's all really, really fair and helpful. My next question is on expenses. You guys have talked about how you have been, that this quarter is a reflection of the discipline and how you have the ability to step up when you need to and show the impact of the efficiency efforts you've been baking. Is this -- as we think about tuning up our models here, should we think about this as the right jumping-off point for the rest of the year? Or are there some factors that we might be missing that we should consider when we consider the back half here? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I think -- Brennan, I think you really got to sort of look at it year-on-year because there's dynamics that sort of change as you sort of look at individual quarters. And so I think you got it -- so I think you could sort of take the view that both Charlie and I gave in terms of the efficiencies offsetting all the investments and sort of think about that on year-over-year basis for each of the quarters going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : A quick follow-up on that -- your comments on ETF servicing up like 50% versus last year. Curious if you can help us with thoughts on what kind of base are we talking about? And maybe just talk a little bit more towards overall positioning, winning new clients. Is the revenues coming from current clients and their organic growth? Just curious of... Charles Scharf : Yes. This is Charlie. I'll take that. Listen, we don't disclose the individual pieces, but it's -- when you look at who services the biggest ETFs out there, we have not historically been one of the large ETF providers. So just a way of saying relative to what you see in the world, it's from a small base, but it's also just very clear for us relative to the focus that we have on it. We have won -- so I would describe it as a significant piece of business from a strong name in the market that wants to grow in the ETF space. And we're very, very focused on growing it in a more material way than what you've even seen in the past. So that's the reason why we wanted to highlight it. Not a huge revenue impact in the short term, but important strategically for us. Glenn Schorr : Understood. And maybe I could go over to Asset Management side. Last quarter, I think you pointed out some of the investments you're making in passives, all -- smart beta, LDI. Maybe you could provide a little bit more color on -- I know these are longer-tail investments, but curious on what you're working on right now. Charles Scharf : Yes, listen. It's exactly the same sort of list. As you pointed out, it doesn't change quarter-on-quarter. When you looked at the results in the quarter, obviously, you saw the flow of information. Mike talked about it. Big piece driven by one very specific client that took something in the index base in-house. We are focused on the things that we spoke about. And it is a relative -- it's not the easiest environment, but we're -- what we're focused on our existing platform is ensuring we have the right products and focused on performance. And we walk you through some of the things on the performance side which should, over a period of time, drive flows and drive our own financial performance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : In view of the pressure that everyone is seeing on the margin because of the rate environment, have you guys considered -- obviously, your loan book is not as big as your securities book, but is there any consideration of trying to focus on maybe growing the loan book to offset some of these pressures that you're seeing on the margin? Charles Scharf : Listen. I think we are -- as Mike said, we are focused on looking at every component of NII, but not rethinking the risk profile of who we are and what we are. When you looked at what we do in the lending space, for the most part, what we do in the lending space supports the rest of the businesses that we're in. It's slightly more than an accommodation, that's the way I would think about it. It's an important component of what we do and what we provide for clients. But we don't have the infrastructure. We don't have the diversification. We don't have the size lending platform that some of the others have. And our view is if you just entered that just for the sake of creating NII to solve a short-term problem, that probably won't end well for us if we went down that road. So we're trying to be far more selective about where we can pick up some yield without putting ourselves in a position, especially at this point in the credit cycle, that will -- that we will regret later on. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then following up on your assets under management comments, recognizing that equity is not a material part of your assets under management. But can you share with us -- the trend obviously that many of the active managers both in fixed income and equity are seeing is the pressure from the passives, of course. Can you share with us, are you guys seeing that same kind of pressure in your active part of the assets under management, and what are you trying to do to offset it? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I mean -- Gerard, it's Mike. Certainly, some of the -- in some strategies, we're seeing more pressure than others, but -- and I think what we're trying to do is make sure that our -- where we have differentiation, that we're focused on performance. And as you sort of look at our large or -- larger strategies, they do -- they are differentiated. They're not sort of like index-hugging kind of strategies. And I think we've seen good performance. We've seen a slowdown in outflows, and in some cases, a return to inflows in a few of them. And so we're focused on those differentiated strategies which I think will help us over the long term. Charles Scharf : And I guess I think what I would add is I always break it into two parts, there's flows and just the fee environment. I would say the pressure that we've seen on fees, while it hasn't gone away, it hasn't increased. And it's probably -- we've had probably had more filter through than less at this point. So that's on a relative basis. A negative going away for us, which is certainly a good thing. And as I said, we're focused in our equity business, whether it's on the Walter Scott business or any of the others focused on performance. And the performance has been quite good. And when you see better performance, you see better impact on flows. It's early, but it certainly feels better when you got the stronger performance than when you don't. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Just hoping to follow up on a couple of specifics here. So I think, Mike, you mentioned the beta on rate cuts will be closer to 100% on the portion of your deposit base. What percentage of your interest-bearing deposits will have that kind of 100% beta on the rate cut? Which I'm assuming is more contractual, which is why you kind have that level of confidence. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I mean -- and Alex, and that's not something that we sort of disclose in that level of detail. But as I said, you should assume it's not just where we've got contractual sort of rights to do that. We're being very disciplined about how we sort of go through the segment by segment review of the book. Alexander Blostein : Okay. And then lots of color around expenses, more on the qualitative side, but I was hoping what to think through the rest of the year and maybe into 2020. If I hear you guys correctly, it sounds like the efficiencies are more than offsetting technology spend. So should the expense run rate be down versus kind of the first half of the year or for the back half of the year? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. As I said, Alex, you should sort of think about it through year-over-year, right. For the third and fourth quarter, just given some of the dynamics that you sort of look at, the way the P&L sort of works out, and you should assume that the efficiencies offset the -- any of the investments we're making in the third and fourth quarter year-on-year. So sort of flattish year-on-year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : So I heard you're controlling what you can control with the expenses, but I'm just wondering about the pricing environment. So assets under custody are up 5% year-over-year, but servicing fees are only flat. You said the pricing pressure is the same as it has been. So should we think about that relationship as the pricing pressure? Or if not, how should we think about it? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, Mike. I would -- it's Mike. I would just remind you that as sort of the markets go up, so in particular, the U.S. markets have sort of gone up year-on-year, right? So that does have an impact of AUC/A. And as -- if it's just market sort of driving AUC/A up, you don't get paid the same for that increase that you do for bringing in sort of new clients, right? Because clients have sort of graduated fee schedules. So there's a little bit of that you see in there. And then we'll go back to what we said on the pricing. Like, we really see no discernible difference at this point relative to what we've seen over the last number of years. Charles Scharf : I will say the following thing, Mike, which won't satisfy you, but it's just the reality. We don't spend a lot of time looking at that ratio. There is -- assets under custody are not directly related to that line. We get paid for different things, not just the level of AUC/A that exists. Sometimes, it's based on transaction, sometimes it's based upon the activities that we have. So we would expect that number to grow over time at a faster rate, but that doesn't mean that we won't see benefits in the net interest -- I'm sorry, in the operating margin of the company over a period of time. That's the way we think about it and what we look at. Michael Mayo : Well, that's helpful. So maybe just a more specific question. When you talk about pricing pressure, what is pricing pressure? Like, if you say it's kind of similar the way it's been the last few years, is it 1%, 2%, 3%, 0.5%? How would you quantify that? Charles Scharf : We don't talk about the specifics. It's obviously embedded in the overall number. On a percentage basis relative to just when you look at our revenue growth number, the negative impact is not a hugely significant number. Michael Mayo : Okay. And then last follow up. Some of your peers have reported so far that the money center banks have shown servicing fees up 5%, whereas yours was down 5% -- I'm sorry. It was much different on a core basis. So yours -- anyway, no matter how you slice it, the money center banks did a lot better this quarter. Is there anything unique to them or unique to you? Or like you said, new business flows on later this year and maybe that changes them? Charles Scharf : Listen, we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about our competitors, and there's a lot of that's hard to understand when you just look over our press releases relative to these businesses. What we've looked at for our competitors, for comparable businesses, doesn't agree exactly with what you said. But we can certainly follow-up with you later on that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : First question, Mike. Just you talked about Issuer Services and some of the differences on the DR timing where we've had some shift between the second and third quarters and the timing of that. So now maybe you can just talk about the impact of that in 2Q on a sequential basis. And then sort of given the timing, what the outlook on the ADR side might be for 3Q in terms of seasonality. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Brian, so as I said I think a couple of quarters ago, you really sort of need to look at Issuer Services over the full year and not focus too much quarter-to-quarter. And I think when you do that, you sort of see actually more stability over the last few years than you sort of look at that, as you might guess, than looking at it quarter-to-quarter. So I would just encourage you to sort of look at it that way and go back to sort of what we sort of printed in 2018 and use that as a base to sort of think about the whole year. Brian Bedell : Okay. Fair enough. And maybe just a question on the organic growth. Obviously, both you guys talked about some of the progress you're making, especially in Clearance and Collateral and within Pershing. I mean, I guess at this sense -- at this stage, do you have sense of how you would characterize that organic revenue growth, parsing that out from the market impact in at least those areas where you are growing? And then in conjunction with that, you made some new hires obviously while you're still reducing the expense base on the comp side. So maybe if you can talk about whether you still plan on making some other senior new hires to accelerate that organic growth in other businesses. Charles Scharf : So let me just start with the second piece first. First of all, I want to point out, we didn't just highlight hires from the outside, we highlighted promotions from within. And so because there are a series of very big jobs here which we promote from within and are thrilled with the talent that exists here. Listen, I think we're -- we highlighted in this earnings release because we do think the jobs that we've talked about are important to continuing to further our progress inside the company. Over a period of time, we should talk less and less about that as we create more stability in the senior management ranks. But the positions that we've added that we talked about we think are meaningfully additive to our ability to think differently about these businesses and grow them. And the first question was? Michael Santomassimo : The significance of the organic growth... Charles Scharf : Yes, listen, I think it's a hard question. I think we would -- if you just ask, like, what's the tone that we want to set relative to the way we're thinking about it, is we are very early on in our journey to build a company which has a higher rate of growth than it had in the past. The fact that we have some businesses that are showing underlying organic growth is certainly a good thing. It's real. We think it's -- while there might be some volatility, it's sustainable both because of the work we're doing and the quality of the franchise that we have. It's not everywhere. We have a lot more work to do. So the trends are mildly positive with still a lot more to do. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Robert Wildhack : On the balance sheet. I think in the past, you said that the Fed's normalization was going to lead to deposit runoff of I think $70 billion. But that was from a while ago. Anyway, you can help us quantify the impact that process has been having and how that will change once the Fed stops? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Look, Robert, it's Mike. As I've said in my remarks, we sort of expect interest-bearing deposits to -- at this point in the quarter, to be about where they were last quarter and then noninterest-bearing to keep coming down a little bit. And I think post QE stopping and the Fed reducing its balance sheet, that should be a net positive going forward. But we'll see how it plays out. Robert Wildhack : Okay. And then can you just give a quick update on the BlackRock-Aladdin or -- yes, BlackRock-Aladdin partnership and how that has progressed? And what the client uptake has been like on the additional capabilities you've built out? Charles Scharf : Yes. I think what we've seen is a very, very high degree of interest from both existing clients that we have and potential clients. We're in the process of onboarding, of the existing common clients we have, a meaningful portion of those to give them access to the new capabilities. And most of the remaining ones are extremely interested and we're just in the process of going through that discussion. So all in all, I think we just feel very good about what we've done there and continuing to talk to other third parties about being able to do the same. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just a quick question. You're still seeing good growth in the tri-party collateral balances. How much of that is still coming from the on boarding from JPM? Or is that fully done at this point in time? Michael Santomassimo : The onboarding finished in the late third quarter last year. So you're still seeing the annualization of that, Brian. So roughly sort of 2/3 of it from the conversion and the other -- the remaining from either new clients or growth from the rest of the client base. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then you mentioned on the expenses that the tech spend was going to be offset by efficiency saves. But when should we see the tech spend slow? Assuming there was some accelerated expense to get the platform as you want it to be. But should we see it slow in 2020? Or is this just an ongoing rate of spend that we should expect for the near term? Charles Scharf : Yes. I don't know answer to that is the short way of think -- is the succinct answer. I think we've certainly thought about it in detail through the end of the year. We're at the beginning part of our process for thinking through next year in detail. There's no doubt that the tech spend should become more efficient as time goes on. There's still a lot to do. So relative to the way we think about overall expenses, obviously, that will be governed by the way we're thinking about what our requirements are and what the environment is. So we're very conscious of the world that we live in, but I think we'll defer the answer to the question until we think about it some more through our process. Operator : And gentlemen, it appears we have no further questions at this time. Charles Scharf : All right. Thanks, everyone, for the time. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call webcast. A replay of this conference call webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.I'd now like to turn the call over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon's Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Magda Palczynska : Good morning. Today, BNY Mellon released its results for the third quarter of 2019. The earnings press release and the financial highlights presentation to accompany this call are both available on our website at bnymellon.com. Todd Gibbons BNY Mellon's Interim CEO will lead the call. Then Mike Santomassimo, our CFO, will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Mike's remarks, there will be a Q&A session. As a reminder please limit yourself to two questions.Before we begin, please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC, all available on our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 16, 2019, and will not be updated.With that, I will hand over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thank you, Magda. Good morning, everyone. Glad to be back with you. As it\u2019s my first time speaking to you as CEO, I will focus my comments on my immediate priorities, as well as my perspectives on our businesses and will only briefly touch on our third quarter results. I'll leave that to Mike.First, let me say how tremendously excited I am to be leading this great organization. During my long career at BNY Mellon, I've held leadership roles across risk, finance, client management and many of our businesses and I believe that gives me a strong grasp of the fundamentals of our company and what our stakeholders need and expect from us. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with Mike and the rest of the executive committee, as well as all of our employees, to stay on course and positioning our franchise to drive better performance and create sustainable growth.We've got an ambitious agenda and I strongly believe that we\u2019re absolutely on the right path. The improvements we\u2019ve made to our culture are clear. We're acting with a greater sense of urgency and greater responsiveness and I'm proud of the team's ability to stay focused through leadership change and to continue to deliver great service to our clients.It's my intention to ensure we maintain a strong performance culture and remain focused on service quality, continue investing in technology and innovation and improving every aspect of our operations. Through that focus we've made significant progress in the last few years, which I believe positions us to improve our results over the longer term.Now, while I was Head of Global Client Management, as well as a number of our servicing businesses, I've had the pleasure of working closely with our clients. During this period I've seen us meaningfully improve our services, as well as provide the technology and expertise to help them navigate challenges and achieve their goals. Our investments in our operations and technology are proving and broadening our capabilities and the adjustments we've made to our client coverage model are helping us deepen relationships and identify more opportunities.Before getting into the quarter, let me run through what I'm seeing in our businesses. In Asset Servicing we continue to see the opportunity to do more for our clients, as changes in the asset management business puts pressure on their operating margins. These trends should offer more outsourcing opportunities in key segments, such as alternatives.In terms of what we're actually doing, we're focused on continuously improving quality, which is fundamental. We are also investing in expanding capabilities to server alternatives such as private equity, credit funds, real-estate and ETFs. For example, we just recently implemented a significant mandate with Goldman Sachs Asset Management who pointed us to deliver a range of asset services for their newly launched European ETFs and we are encouraged by our attraction in this space.We are building data and analytic solutions to help clients navigate a changing Investment Management landscape. The basic offering starts with a powerful aggregation capability. We can then apply analytics around that. Leveraging our data and analytics solutions technology, we enabled a large global asset manager to insource $250 billion of AUM within three months. The client now has a higher level of transparency in to cash and positions for the front office trading and has achieved better operational efficiency by leveraging their previous investments in our technology.We think our data and analytics capabilities will be a true differentiator over time, but the alliances we are forming will create a more integrated front-to-back operating model. We recently announced a strategic alliance with Bloomberg to integrate our data analytics and servicing capabilities with Bloomberg's Portfolio Management, training and compliance platform. This will allow our common clients to experience faster onboarding, higher straight-through processing rates and more efficient data exchanges.This new partnership comes on the back of the one we announced with BlackRock\u2019s-Aladdin platform earlier this year. Client reception to our partnerships has been positive as it helps them simplify workflows, improve efficiency and drive their performance.In Pershing, we're focused on helping our clients drive their business in a dynamic industry. The pipeline of opportunity remains strong and we on-boarded a number of new clients in the Broker Dealer and Registered Investment Adviser Space. In the high growth Wealth and Advisory Segment we're investing in technology to improve the client experience, as well as investing in talent and strengthening brand awareness.One of our priorities is to meet emerging client needs as investor preferences drive firms to transform. For example, we are enabling clients to integrate our technology and leverage pre-built business functions such as trading, reporting and asset movement, without them having to make big investments in their own technology. Overall, we're very excited about the potential for Pershing.Moving on to Clearance and Collateral Management, it\u2019s a key differentiator for us. Tri-party Collateral Management balances are up, mainly the result of growth from existing clients and new business and to a lesser extent from last year's client conversions.We are confident in the organic growth prospects of this business. We are currently rebuilding our platform to give our clients the ability to seamlessly move securities globally, as well as offer enhanced resiliency and data and analytic capabilities, not currently available in the market. We think it will significantly boost our ability to attract new market participants, as well as additional business from our existing clients.In Corporate Trust we're seeing benefits from the investments we\u2019ve made in structural products and we continue to build out capabilities to better serve clients. This is broadening our relationships, especially in the important alternative Asset Manager Segment.In Treasury Services we've been refocusing on higher margin and high growth businesses such as trade, foreign exchange and our liquidity offering. Our clients consistently tell me our service is excellent, which reflects on the quality of our people. In addition, we're looking to build off the investments we have made in real time payments.In asset management we feel good about a number of the underlying strategies and continue to invest in the U.S. and build solutions to meet investor demand. We are actively launching new products across a number of areas including fixed income products, ESG, enhanced data and multi asset solutions.For example, Alcentra raised 5.5 billion euros for its European Direct Lending Fund, double the minimum target. We are investing in rebranding to consistently use the BNY Mellon brand and make it easier to navigate our multi-boutique model. Lastly, performance has been solid across many of the largest strategies.Moving to Wealth Management, it\u2019s strengthening our banking investment products and creating a strong foundation by investing in people, technology and platform.Now let me turn briefly to our results for the third quarter. EPS was $1.07, that's up 1% versus a year ago. Total revenue was down 5% year-over-year and that was largely driven by net interest revenue. There are a couple of items that impacted both revenue and expense and Mike will walk you through those in some detail.Our Investment Services fee lines were nearly or were up nearly across the board as the investment decisions we've been making are starting to yield some incremental positive results. Operating margin was once again resilient at 33% and we continue to deliver strong capital returns to shareholders.With that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thanks Todd and good morning everyone. Let me run through the details of the results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.Beginning on page three of the financial highlights document. First, the table at the bottom of the page summarizes a couple of notable items in the quarter that had a very small impact on earnings on a net basis, but did impact net interest revenue and expenses. I will describe them later in more detail, and as a reminder, the table also includes some items we highlighted in the third quarter of 2018.This quarter, total revenue was down 5% to $3.9 billion. The notable items negatively impacted revenue by a little under 1.5%. The remaining decline primarily reflected lower net interest revenue, the impact of prior outflows in asset management and lower performance fees, as well as the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.While total fee revenue was down 1% year-on-year, investment services fees were up in most categories as Todd mentioned, excluding securities lending.Net interest revenue was down 18%, partially driven by a $70 million lease related impairment. The impairment was for a legacy portfolio of leases and decreased net interest revenue by 8% and earnings per share by $0.06.Expenses were down 5%, mainly reflect a $74 million net reduction of reserves that benefited non-interest expenses and increased earnings per share by approximately $0.06. This was related to a pretax charge that was recorded in the second quarter of 2014 in connection with potential tax related exposures of certain Investment Management funds that we managed. Excluding this and the impact of lower litigation charges, expenses were essentially flat.A few other highlights from the page. Pretax income declined by 4% to $1.3 billion. The effective tax rate was 19.1% compared to 16.5% in the year ago quarter. We generated $1 billion of net income applicable to common shareholders, earnings per share of $1.07 was up 1% and our pretax operating margin was 33%.Now, moving to capital and liquidity on page four. Our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong. Our key ratios were similar to the second quarter. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.3 billion and our CET 1 ratio was 11.1% under the advanced approach. Our average LCR in the third quarter with 117% and our SLR was 6.1%.Turning to page five; my comments on the balance sheet will highlight the sequential changes, as this is a better comparison for you. Our average interest earning assets increased due to the client deposits driving our balance sheet higher. The average rate earned on interest earning assets declined in the third quarter, primarily as a result of the impairment that I mentioned earlier. Excluding this the average rate would have been down only slightly.The average rate was negatively impacted by the Fed and ECB lowering interest rates. This resulted in U.S. short term rates moving lower by 20 to 30 basis points, while the long end was down by around 50 basis points since the second quarter which impacted the yield in our securities portfolio. This was partially offset by a modest benefit from our legal activity.Loans increased in Clearance and Collateral Management and our trade loans grew within treasury services. However we continue to see low appetite for leverage in Pershing, which continues the impact of our margin loan balances.As expected, non-interest bearing deposits declined, while interest bearing deposit increased. Deposit basis were broadly in line with our expectations and the net interest margin decreased by 3 basis points to109 basis points excluding the impairment.Page six gives you some more detail of the drivers of the net interest revenue decline versus the second quarter. As I mentioned, we saw a continued decline in average non-interest bearing deposits, which had a negative impact on net interest revenue. We had a benefit from the increase in average interest bearing deposits, as well as lower deposit pricing due to the rate cuts.Competitive pressure on deposit rates appears to have stabilized since the second quarter, but remains high. The yields on the securities portfolios was down by 15 basis points, which more than offset the benefit of higher portfolio balances.Loan balances were mixed, with non-margin loans up and margin loans down and coupled with lower rates as the assets are typically a floating rate which negatively impacted net interest revenue.We continue to look for opportunities to deploy our balance sheet and took advantage of higher reverse repo rates, which modestly benefited net interest revenue. As a reminder, we engage in limited hedging and funding activities, but this quarter positively impacted our interest revenue and our net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. There is an offset to that reflected in FX and other trading.Finally, the lease-related impairment of $70 million reduced net interest revenue to $730 million.Now page seven detailed our expenses. On a consolidated basis expenses of $2.6 billion were down 5%. The decrease reflects the reduction of reserves for tax related exposure of certain Investment Management funds and the lower litigation expenses that I mentioned earlier. Excluding those items, expenses were largely flat with our investments being offset by declines and other expenses.Turning to page eight, total investment services revenue was down slightly. Assets under custody and administration increased 4% year-over-year to $35.8 trillion, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.Within asset servicing revenue was down 4% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting lower client activity, securities lending revenue and net interest revenue, as well as the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. As we have said in the past, we have not seen an acceleration in pricing pressure in the business.Securities lending revenue continues to be negatively impacted by lower balances on the back of weak market demand and tighter spreads and foreign exchange and other trading revenue was slightly down as FX volumes and volatility remain subdued.In Pershing, revenue was up 2% to $568 million, reflecting higher client asset values and accounts together with higher clearing and custody volumes. This was partially offset by lower net interest revenue.Clearing services fees were up 7% as we continue to onboard new clients and we benefit from growth of existing clients. We are encouraged by the momentum we're building in the business with both RIAs and broker dealers. Issuer Services benefited from higher activity in depositary receipts. Revenue was up 3% to $466 million with 13% fee growth, mostly offset by lower net interest revenue.Growth in Corporate Trust benefited from new business and volumes and depositary receipts revenue was up due to the timing of fees and higher cross border selling activity.Treasury Services revenue was down 4% to $312 million with fees up slightly year-on-year, while net interest was lower. Deposit balances increased year-on-year by over 20%.Clearance and Collateral Management revenue was up 11% to $293 million due to higher clearance volumes related to high levels of U.S. treasury issuance. In recent quarters the majority of our growth was driven by the client conversion from last year, but in the third quarter this shifted with more than two-thirds of the increase coming from existing and other new clients.As a reminder, the client conversions were in the run rate starting in the fourth quarter of 2018 and average tri-party collateral management balance were up 19%, and I also want to note that the recent volatility in the repo markets was not a driver of the revenue growth in Clearance and Collateral Management.Page nine summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our investment services businesses.Turning to investment management in page 10, total investment management revenue was down 12%, asset management revenue was down 14% year-over-year to $605 million, primarily reflecting the cumulative AUM outflows since the third quarter of 2018, as well as lower performance fees, the impact of hedging activities and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, principally versus the British pound, which was partially offset by higher market values. Performance fees decreased due to a particularly strong year of performance for our LDI strategy of last year.Our largest revenue strategies continued at solid performance over both short and longer time frames. We had inflows of $1 billion in the quarter, primarily driven by cash inflows and abatement and index outflows. We had $11 billion of inflows into cash and $2 billion of inflows in to fixed income products, while our other strategies saw outflows of $12 billion.Overall assets under management of $1.9 trillion are up 3% year-over-year due to higher markets, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and net outflows. Wealth Management revenue was down 8% year-over-year to $285 million, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue, partially offset by higher market values.Turning to our other segment on page 11, total revenue and net interest expense decreased year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting the lease related impairment and corporate treasury activity. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, there are a few things to consider, with respect to net interest revenue, market dynamics are changing quickly, but let me walk you through what we are seeing now, which I\u2019ll remind you is very early and you should make your own assumptions as well.The market appears to be pricing in a Fed cutin October and another in early next year potentially January, which impacts the forward curves. We expect the average non-interest bearing deposit balances will continue to come down.As of now our interest bearing deposits are a little lower than the third quarter. We do not expect the issues in the repo market to repeat themselves. This will negatively impact net interest revenue by approximately 1% versus the third quarter and we expect the portfolio yield to come down versus the third quarter. If these assumptions persist, we would expect that net interest revenue will be down sequentially by approximately 4% to 6% versus the lease-adjusted net interest revenue in the third quarter.In Issuer Services we expect full year fees to be around the same as in 2018, give or take a little bit, so we expect a down-tick in the fourth quarter. As we announced during the third quarter, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in Promontory Interfinancial Network, with an expected after tax gain of approximately $600 million. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter subject to approvals.As we continue to streamline and optimize the company, we may look for opportunities to accelerate actions which could result in pretax charges in the fourth quarter in the range of $100 million to $200 million. And a reminder that we had some notable items in the fourth quarter of 2018; something else to factor into your modeling.With that operator, can you please open up the lines for questions? Operator : Yes sir. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello! Thanks a lot. I know it's a different client base, but I'm curious if you think the price in reductions on the E-broker side and the retail side of E-broker LAN can have an impact on to your Pershing RIA clearing business? Just, could you help us think through that? Todd Gibbons : Sure, good mooring Glenn, its Todd. Our business model is quite a bit different than the E- traders. As you know, we are a B2B; we are not a B2C business, so we don't actually charge commissions. We get paid on a number of different revenue streams like assets, as well as the clearing and settlement. So we don't foresee this as having any material impact at this time. Glenn Schorr : Okay, and then maybe just a quickie follow-up on the NII, because I appreciate \u2013 I just want to sure I wrote it down. The NIR down 4% to 6% versus the lease adjusted number in the third quarter, and could you just repeat that part. I just want to make sure that we get the right jumping off point for 4Q and rolling into the next year? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, hey Glenn, its Mike. If you look at page six of the deck, you know the lease adjusted number for the third quarter was 800. So that\u2019s your jumping off point and so the 4% to 6% off of that base and if you \u2013 in my commentary I also mentioned part of the decline is related to the modest benefit we saw from the repo activity in the third quarter, so that\u2019s about a percent of it. Glenn Schorr : And the rest is just the cuts we've seen and the deposit migration? Mike Santomassimo : Correct, yeah it's net interest bearing deposits coming down a little bit, it\u2019s the yield on the portfolio continuing to grind down a bit, and it\u2019s based on where we see the positive balances right now, which are a little bit lower than what we saw in the third quarter, but as you know it\u2019s very early in the quarter to project with a high degree of certainty at this point. Glenn Schorr : Okay, and I just want to make sure. You saw some extra deposit slide in from the repo mess in the quarter, but unclear if they stick around. I'm putting words in your mouth, but I just want to see what your thoughts are? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, no. I think the deposits we saw, the incremental deposits we saw in the third quarter were not necessarily related to the repo volatility; that was just underlying client behavior. We made some money by deploying some of our excess liquidity into the repo market, you know during those few days. That coupled with our cleared repo program that we've got you know for clients is where we made the extra money during those few days of the volatility. Todd Gibbons : And Glenn, that wasn't a huge amount of money. I mean we had \u2013 we have a lot of liquidity. If there's a little bit of a distortion in the market, we\u2019ll take advantage of it and we did and it had a little bit of help, but it didn\u2019t impact balances. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Todd, first just a quick one on sort of a high level. Just wanted to \u2013 you know interested in your thoughts on level setting and very helpful to hear your comments in the beginning of the call. But clearly we had a bit of a movement on the top here with BK with you know Charlie moving on and you stepping in.And so clearly you were part of the management team, you\u2019ve been at Bank of New York for a very, very long time, developed their plan, so that seems straightforward. But can you help us maybe think about tactical timeframes; how's the Board thinking about their search at this point? Most investors assume that you're going to be part of the consideration for that search; is that fair? And could you help us think about, just in the near term how there might be some tactical adjustments in strategy or is it going to be very, very similar to how we\u2019ve been going, you know steady as she goes, so to speak. Todd Gibbons : Okay Bryan. There is a lot there, but let me start that you know with the change at the top, the board executed its succession plan and is going through the due-diligence. It has initiated a search and I have indicated my interest to be a part of that, so that's in the process and we don't have any strict time frames on that, that will flow as it flows.In terms of my own priorities and you know anything tactical that we're seeing, frankly I've been in the middle of driving the change agenda that's been going on that Charlie had lead over the past couple of years, and I really felt like I'm an integral part of it. Actually I've enjoyed it. So what I'm not going to do is revert back to some of the ways that things were. So we're going to continue to drive a very strong performance culture.I see us holding ourselves more accountable. We're expecting \u2013 we really expect and demand excellence from each other and I'm not going to let that change, so that\u2019s at the high level. The investments that we're making in technology are going to continue. They are going to be focused on a number of things, not only that we make our services more resilient, that we improve the client experience and where we are having some real successes around improving operational efficiency. So that continues to be high on my list and I think there is a lot more that I would follow in my next point here is that we will automate and continue to approve operations.I think we've got a lot of attraction that we can point to, a lot of successes and opportunity to do more. I got to stay focused on regulatory relations given who we are and what we're doing and so that will be a high priority, and finally you know Mike and I are now pouring through the planning process and we've got to make good decisions around our investment opportunities. We have quite a number of them and that actually will be fun.So I think it's been a very smooth transition. At this point I don\u2019t think anything has changed people and I really am quite pleased with the leadership team, how smoothly they've moved on. Brennan Hawken : That's great color, thank you so much Todd for that. One question here for Mike. Previously you guys had guided to the back half of 2019 being flat for operating expenses versus the back half of 2018. I believe that the core expenses in the back half of 2018 were $5.4 billion. It looks like core expenses this quarter is 2.7. Does that mean that we should be looking at core expenses for the fourth quarter to be roughly flat with the core to this quarter, is that fair? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah I mean, I think it would take a little bit Brennan, so \u2013 but yeah, I mean I think the guidance we gave in terms of sort of being flat, you know year-on-year give or take a little bit still holds. Brennan Hawken : Okay, you mean you obviously laid out the charges, but that would not be core, right? Mike Santomassimo : Correct. Brennan Hawken : Yep, thank you. Mike Santomassimo : You have to look through that. Brennan Hawken : Perfect. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Todd Gibbons : Good morning, Gerard. Operator : Gerard, you may be on mute. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. I apologize about that, I was on the mute. Thank you. Following up on your comments about the repo destruction and how you had a small benefit, and I know you don't expect it going forward. Can you guys give us any color? Is there any benefit of the treasury now or the Fed I should say coming back in. They are not calling a quantitative easing, but we know they're going to come in and start buying securities. Do you guys see any benefits for your business from their activities? Todd Gibbons : Well, you know the Fed conducts its open market transactions through repo and they do use our repo platform, our tri-party platforms for some of those transactions. It would be very, very modest if any impact to our revenue. So it will obviously impact the rate at which repo trades, but it's a deminimus impact.You know the good news about the business and the tri-party business and our management businesses is it continues to grow. So we've seen \u2013 you know we saw a significant growth in the past quarter. Some of that, less than about a third or so of that was from the conversions that we had from last year. But the rest of it is either new clients or additional growth with existing clients.Collateral management and repo, it is growing as the unclear margin rules grow and the demand for secured credit grows. So we like our position there and you know I can go on more about this, because we're \u2013 one of our biggest investments is in what we call the future of collateral management, in making our systems interoperable in a way that just makes it seamless for our clients to move collateral; that will have a huge benefit to them. So the key focus for us, but the disruption in the repo market had little if any impact. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just as a follow-up, you gave us good color on the sequential look into net interest revenue and what you know the forward curve is saying about future fed fund rate cuts. If you guys could paint us a picture for 2020, what would be an ideal interest rate environment for you to benefit from a net interest revenue standpoint? Again, I know it\u2019s \u2013 and I\u2019m not going to hold you to it, but just curious what would be that ideal environment. Todd Gibbons : I'll take it. I\u2019m looking at Mike here. You know a steeper yield curve and fewer uses; it really isn\u2019t a lot more complex than that. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. No, I appreciate that, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin [ph] Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Hey, good morning guys. I just have a couple of follow-ups on the NII front. Hey Mike, so can you talk a little bit about \u2013 it seems like you know if the balance sheet were to be flattish from here even, that the NIM obviously is still grinding down. Can you talk us through \u2013 you mentioned a little less competitiveness on the deposit side, but the dynamics of the asset portfolio re-pricing, that whole, you know the three-quarters aspect versus what you are seeing on the deposit betas. Can you give us some color on both sides of what you are seeing? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, and I\u2019ll start with the portfolio Ken. And you know obviously what you are seeing in the portfolio is you know yields continue to grind down as sort of rates have come down. It's really no more complicated I think than that, and about a third of our portfolio re-prices every quarter, either through you know securities maturing and getting reinvested or through the floating rate you know component of it; and in those cases you know the rates in the portfolio are moving ahead of when the Fed moves and so you are going to see a decline in the asset yields first and then when the Fed moves you are able to move deposit pricing down and so you are going to have that lag and so that rates are declining and it's negative \u2013 it has a negative impact you know during that period.I think on the pricing side, you know what I said was you know pricing remains competitive, although its stabilized over the last you know 90 days, 120 days or so and so we're seeing you know pretty consistent competition across a whole series of our competitors, but we're not seeing anything that\u2019s irrational you know across that set right now. Kenneth Usdin : Okay, and I guess as a follow-up then, so if we just play it forward and you look at your forward curve and you mention the October and the potentially early \u201920, at what point do you see the yields on the asset side starting to level up because of that three quarter roll through. Like do we get to a point in early next year where you just kind of have flushed everything down? How do we start to assess like when that bottoming point might happen? Mike Santomassimo : You know, I mean look, I think that's the question I think most people are thinking about and I think as you sort of look at it, it\u2019s really going to \u2013 it starts to stabilize when forwards start to stabilize, right, and I think when you look at forwards right now, it's still declining as you look out, and so I think when forwards start to stabilize you\u2019ll start to see the portfolio yield stabilize as well. Kenneth Usdin : Okay, thanks Mike. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great! Yeah, just two quick questions. I wanted you to mention that the promontory sales is going to close this quarter. Was that \u2013 I mean that gain could be used for addition share repurchase if you decided to do that or is that already included in the CCAR plan? Mike Santomassimo : It's something we'll consider as we look forward for our capital plan next year. Todd Gibbons : So no, it was not included in our CCAR plan for this year. So we couldn't \u2013 you know we could take that because it hadn\u2019t taken place. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, but you\u2019re not going to do additional share purchase this year? Todd Gibbons : We will \u2013 we\u2019ll consider it as part of the plan next year. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then just focusing on the investment management business, I mean you have negative operating leverage in there. Year-on-year, I mean what does it take to kind of generate the positive operating leverage in that segment again? Todd Gibbons : So if you look at our investment management businesses, a number of the businesses are doing pretty well. Our LDI business continues to grow. Our Altrin [ph] \u2013 credit business in Alcentra is doing pretty well and in fact our managers in the U.K. are doing reasonably well.Where we are challenged is in our business in the states and we've taken some steps to combine those businesses into what we now call Mellon, but until we see that stabilize, it's going to be \u2013 that\u2019s where the challenge really resides. So we need to see some improvement in the performance. We think by combining there are things that we can do operationally to continue to manage the cost, but that's our focus point. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great, thanks. Operator : And next we'll go to Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Great! Hey, good morning guys. A question around deposit growth this quarter, some pretty nice trends sequentially. I know there's been a strategic focus for you guys to get a larger share of kind of customers\u2019 wallets over time. So maybe talk a little bit about the sources of growth this quarter and sort of the attraction you\u2019re getting into the wallet share gain, thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, this is Mike. Yeah, as you highlighted, you know we\u2019ve been focused for the \u2013 you know the better part of a year or a little over that, sort of really driving more share of client deposits through a whole series of initiatives that I think you know I mentioned in my commentary around treasury services, which is a good example where you know deposits are up you know around 20% and I think that's a great example where you know it's not only about getting deposits.It also brings with it other activity and fees with it as we sort of go after that, those relationships. And I think that effort that we've got is really across every single one of our businesses, with the asset servicing, corporate trust, treasury services, wealth management, and I think at varying degrees we\u2019ve had success in growing our share of operating deposits across the different client segments. Todd Gibbons : Yeah, I would add to that Alex. This was not a focus of ours in years gone past, especially in zero rate environments and with leverage ratios and so forth, but today we\u2019ve established a couple of these campaigns and we've been pretty successful and you know we\u2019re a very attractive client or counterparty for depositors and we can connect it to the businesses. It makes a lot of sense. The more we can get to payments business, the more opportunity we've gotten to grow our deposit base. So it's largely just increased focused and targeted campaigns. Alexander Blostein : Got it, thanks. And then a more tactical question I guess. With the Fed being back in the market by T-bills, historically we\u2019ve kind of used the deposit rebates of the trust banks that are somewhat correlated with the level of excess reserves in the banking system. Would this create a similar dynamics \u2013 in other words if the Fed becomes again more aggressive in buying back our treasuries and T-bills, would that be an overall helper to the size of the balance sheet as we move forward? Todd Gibbons : You know, I think you know \u2013 I mean the deposits have been correlated you know in the past to excess reserves, but you sort of \u2013 you really need to look at it over a period of time and in any given quarter that may or may not be the case and we'll see how the most recent announcement and activity levels sort of play out and the Fed\u2019s just getting into the market now with this week. I think some of those you know trade settle later in the week for the first time, and so I think it\u2019s too early to know exactly what impact it's going to have and I think you really need to think about it over you know some period of time and quarter-to-quarter it may not play out exactly as the historical trend might indicate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great, great, thanks very much. A question for both Todd and Mike on the expenses. I think Mike, you mentioned \u2013 if I have wrote this down correctly, an estimate of $100 million to $200 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. If you can talk about the underlying expense that is projected to reduce, I guess going into next year, you know cognizant that you probably don\u2019t want to give guidance for next year yet, but just to get a sense of that.And then I guess bigger picture Todd, you talked for a long time about investing in a technology to increasingly automate the business and reduce that operational costs and you've done a lot over the last several years in making progress on that. So just trying to get a sense of as we move forward over the next day one to two years, is this \u2013 did we have a lot more runway and there is initiative to the extent that we can keep the expenses at least flat for the organization or even down. Todd Gibbons : Okay, Brian why don\u2019t I take the latter part of that and I\u2019ll hand it over to Mike for the earlier part of the question. We've got nearly 100 programs in place so we do continue to see significant opportunity to automate a lot more things like reconciliations. When we look at the accounting platforms and the NAV calculations, there are still many manual processes in there that we are targeting, so I kind of look at \u2013 and there are still you know locations that we can \u2013 that we need to manage where there's opportunity.And as we look out to 2020 and some of the things that we can accelerate, I'll call out you know a couple of items. Number one, I think around reconciliations we can increase the scalability of the plant. We've actually been applying machine learning and creating much much more automated reconciliation process. It doesn't seem like a lot, but if you think about what we do as a company, it is a massive undertaking with a huge amount of headcount dedicated to it.We\u2019re also investing in a client inquiry system where we\u2019ll digitize all of the clients\u2019 inquiries into us. That doesn't sound like a lot either, but if you can imagine the millions of transactions that we process. If we can automate how we capture inquiries around it, we're also automating our instruction capture and as I mentioned earlier, there's opportunity for us to do more around the accounting services and striking net asset values.So as I look out over the next two or three years, this is not a -- we're not stopping, there's a lot more that I think we can do here. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, and I think as you think about the charges, that investments we\u2019re making, we've got a very disciplined process to look at the ROI\u2019s and the payback periods for each of the investments and we do that for all of them, so you should assume we\u2019re doing that as we look at the investments we\u2019re making. Brian Bedell : Okay, that's all great color. And then just to follow up on the asset servicing. I think Todd you talked about increasing some of the servicing capabilities for alternative. Do you feel that your \u2013 the platform that you have for that right now is adequate to do that or are there potential significant enhancements to come either organically or through acquisition and I guess could you leverage BlackRock\u2019s eFront, with the recently acquired eFront platform. I know you\u2019ve got the relationship with Aladdin. Todd Gibbons : Yeah, I mean let me go to the beginning of that. When we look at the real estate servicing business, we're growing that quite rapidly from investments that we've made previously and that's just continuing to capture the market. So we see opportunity there without a whole lot of more investment. We\u2019ll have to obviously keep the platform firm.Where we are making some investments is more around private equity and credit platforms, so we've got a couple of potential wins there and we are not just looking at BlackRock, but at others for potential partnerships that we might be able to leverage as well. So yeah, we think in the wealth space, without a huge amount of investment we can continue to capture some growth and some market share. Brian Bedell : Got it. Great! Thanks very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Out next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Mike Carrier : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. May be first, just given some of the traction you're seeing in Pershing and Collateral Management, where is the firm today in terms of maybe market share and which strategies are you putting in place to drive additional organic growth and bring on additional clients? Todd Gibbons : Okay. Well, I'll start with Collateral Management first. So if you think about our Collateral Management business, it's primarily around tri-party repo, but there are also un-cleared margin rules that are going into effect where the buy side now has to collateralize it's derivative transactions. And those are phased in and so that market is actually growing, so we are benefiting from that.Where we are investing is to make it seamless for our clients to move collateral around the world on our platform, which will make them much more efficient, effectively what it does for them, it reduces the amount of liquidity and capital as they have to commit to their own business. So it generates real funding benefits to them, so they are quite excited about it.The other thing we're doing is we're investing in automation of the rule set. So if you think about the tri-party repo, two parties have that rules and we've automated that rather than making it a manual process which makes it much, much easier for them to initiate transactions. So that's number one.Number two, if you look at the worlds repo market, only about 25% of that uses tri-party today and as we provide these type of services and make it much more attractive for people that are doing things, what they call a bi-lateral repo, which is just doing it directly, so we think we can either use tri-party services or act as a custodian. So we think there is growth potential there, so that's one of the things that were driving for and that will be a two-year process and we're pretty excited about the prospects there. There is a lot of going on in this space.The other question was around Pershing. Yeah, Pershing is a little less impactful on the Collateral Management space. Pershing's really providing, clearance and custody for broker dealers investment advisers and to some extent there is some prime business there with hedge funds as well. And the beauty there is that market is growing, the advisory business is growing quite rapidly, we're on the corporate side of that. So there was some lost business due to consolidations. We\u2019ve now implemented enough new business to start to offset that. I think Mike had made that very clear on previous earnings calls and so we see the - we see ourselves in the potential to start showing growth there. Mike Carrier : Alright, that\u2019s helpful, and then just a quick clean up. Mike just on the reserve release did you fully exit the exposure on the utility and then same thing on the tax rate, just on the low end. Any update in terms of the guidance or the outlook? Mike Santomassimo : We did fully dispose of the exposure for the utility, so there is no more left. And on the tax rates, it's a little noisy just given the in\u2019s and out\u2019s this year, but we haven't given employer guidance, but what we said in the past was sort of 21-plus or minus. My guess is we'll be a little bit below that 21. Mike Carrier : Okay, thanks. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Rob Wildhack : Good morning guys. In the business can you give us some details or some thoughts on client attrition and how that has been performing recently versus prior years and what you're doing to maybe improve retention? Mike Santomassimo : Rob your phone like gave out there a little bit, on which business you were talking about. Which business was it? Rob Wildhack : The core business. Mike Santomassimo : The Asset Servicing business. Sure, I think Todd can add some color in there. You know I think as we as look at the things that we're doing to continue to improve the quality of the service we have, that is directly aimed at continuing to reduce attrition and improve the service level for our clients and I think where we have put focus on that with our largest clients, we are seeing really good traction and results. I think so when you look at the impact that client losses or attrition had in the quarter, it's pretty similar to what you would have seen over the last number of quarters or a couple of years. Rob Wildhack : Okay, thanks. And then Todd, you mentioned decision making around upcoming investment opportunities. It seems like we've talked about a few of them here, but maybe at a higher level can you talk about your priorities and any additional color on the opportunities you are most excited about? Thank you. Todd Gibbons : Yeah, I spelled out the priorities earlier and they really continue to basically be, continue with the change agenda that I've been part of over the past couple of years, and I look forward to continuing to drive that. So we are not going to revert to practices that we are weaker than where I think we are now, that's for sure.In terms of right now where I think we are seeing opportunities is in the wealth space around Pershing and our own wealth management business and we talked about the client business probably in too much detail and I gave you a lot of color there.But asset servicing still has quite a few opportunities, we talked a little bit about alts. But to Mike\u2019s earlier point around attrition, as long as our capabilities are as strong as they are and our service is as good as it is, the attrition rate will go down and I think that, I think we'll keep moving the needle on it. You're always going to have some clients leave for some reason or other. We've got to make it more and more difficult for them to leave. That's why we're pretty keen on these \u2013 on these partnerships that we've had.The one that we announced with Bloomberg in the quarter is another indication of that and by being able to make it much more convenient for them to do business with us, by a single sign on through Bloomberg to get all kinds of custody information makes, it more difficult to leave and that's what we want to do. Rob Wildhack : Got it, thank you. Todd Gibbons : Thank you, Rob. Mike Santomassimo : Alright, thanks everyone. We\u2019ll talk to you next time. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. A replay of this conference will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor relations Website at 2 :00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today. Have a good day!",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I will now turn the call over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon\u2019s Global Head, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Magda Palczynska : Good morning. Today, BNY Mellon released its results for the fourth quarter of 2019. The earnings press release and the financial highlights presentation to accompany this call are both available on our website at bnymellon.com. Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon\u2019s Interim CEO will lead the call. Then Mike Santomassino, our CFO, will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Mike\u2019s prepared remarks there will be a Q&A session. As a reminder, please limit yourself to two questions.Before we begin, please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC, all available on our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 16, 2020 and will not be updated.With that, I will hand over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thank you, Magda and good morning everyone. I will briefly highlight the fourth quarter and the full year financial results and then focus most of my comments highlighting the progress we made in 2019 as well as outlining our priorities for 2020. Mike will then go through the financials in much more detail.For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.52. This includes a positive impact of $0.50 per share from notable items, which Mike will discuss. For the full year, on an adjusted basis, EPS of $4.02 on revenues of $15.7 billion, full year expenses were down slightly as we identified and implemented efficiencies to more than offset the increase in technology investments. What that means is we actually delivered hundreds of millions dollars of real productivity and we had solid operating margins of approximately 32%. We generated over $5 billion of capital in 2019, returning more than 100% of earnings to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, while at the same time maintaining a strong capital position, investing for growth and achieving a solid return on tangible common equity of greater than 20%. This year was not without challenges however and notably those included interest rate cuts in the U.S. and while some equity markets hit new highs, client activity levels were constrained in many of our business.Despite the fees in investment services, we are resilient and we saw some modest organic revenue growth. We also delivered strong operating margins and capital returns for our shareholders. We built a solid foundation in 2019 including substantial investment in technology and talent, while operations executed a significant number of strategic programs in 2019 that will drive efficiency, reduce risk and enhance the client experience.Looking at our progress across our business portfolio, let\u2019s start with asset servicing. We are taking action to ensure we consistently provide excellent service quality, the pipeline is growing and we announced important new wins in 2019 across different geographies in both asset owner and asset manager segments. We created some exciting partnerships with leading front office system providers namely Aladdin, Bloomberg, and most recently, SimCorp and these will provide our clients with open architecture that gives them choice and flexibility. While still early, these partnerships are strengthening our offering and they are helping us win new business. We enhanced our capabilities and alternatives and ETFs, which have strong growth prospects and we are expanding new range of data and analytical applications available to our clients, where our strong position in data management, accounting, performance and distribution analytics position us to deepen our relationships.We made good progress in monitoring and measuring client relationships and improving the quality of work and services we provide day-in and day-out for our clients. This is already driving improved client satisfaction and lower attrition rates. In Pershing, we are seeing fee growth coming through and are excited about the future to this business. The industry is evolving and we are confident that our market leadership and strategy will position us well going forward. We ended the year with strongest pipeline in many years with both institutional broker dealers and in the RIA space. We continued to onboard these new clients each quarter and to build the future pipeline. Across the industry, consolidation is helping make Pershing\u2019s open architecture increasingly attractive to our clients. We are accelerating investments in the advisory segment, strengthening market leadership in the broker dealer\u2019s segment and continuing the development of front-end technology, including integration with third-party providers to deliver state-of-the-art experiences and analytics to advisers and investors. All of these are making us an even better partner to our clients.In clearance and collateral management where we are the clear leader, we delivered strong financial performance in 2019. We saw organic fee growth over the course of the year driven by existing clients and new business as well as clients on-boarded in 2018 they will increase their business with us.We see continued growth opportunity in this business from structural and regulatory changes that provision our services to bilateral repos and for modernizing our platform to give our clients the ability to seamlessly move their collateral globally. We are enhancing our platform to allow clients have access to more real-time data and self-service tools. We also continue to automate manual processes to reduce risk and improve operational efficiencies and we are improving the client experience by introducing new digitally enhanced capabilities.In issuer services, we are building out capabilities, which is broadening our relationships. We gained market share in corporate trust and drove new business across a number of our key products, such as structured and muni debt as well as insurance-linked securities. Our ongoing rollout of the new loan servicing platform is enabling us to be more responsive to our clients and deliver them more functionality. We are investing in automating capabilities and digitizing workforce tools to offer clients simplified access to services and data to help them minimize risk, increase control and gain efficiency.Our Treasury Service business has scale and reputation for excellent service and relationship coverage, which are the result of the investments we have made in talent and our product offering. With over $2 trillion of institutional payments per day, we are very meaningful partner to our clients. In 2019, we successfully refocused on higher margin businesses such as liquidity and payments. Our deposit initiative grew high-quality stable balances by around 18% in 2019. Our technology investments in Treasury Services have been centered on advancements in real-time solutions and operational efficiency to increase straight-through processing rates, both of which further enhance the client experience.In asset management, the financial results were negatively impacted by outflows over the last year. Performance, however, has been solid across many of the largest strategies, including equities and multi-asset classes. That combined with the investment in new products across the platform is helping to improve the pipeline. We have seen improved performance in Newton, Walter Scott and Alcentra and we continue to believe that there is an important role for active strategies, including LDI going forward. Our wealth management business will benefit over the long-term from our increased investments as well as strong leadership. We are expanding our sales force, strengthening our banking and investment product set and delivering digital tool to benefit both our advisers and clients and create a leading experience. So, overarching all of our business is our consistent investment in technology. Our technology priority is centered on improving quality, developing innovative products and services and enhancing efficiency for our clients, which in turn creates cost savings for us as well as for them.We are transforming our infrastructure, and expanding our data and analytics solutions and the use of APIs to continue to create an open platform. We are deploying artificial intelligence and machine learning to simplify processes and proactively deliver additional insights to clients, such as improved analytics to increased distribution of their own products. We are embracing partnerships in November. For example, we hosted a well received and inaugural Fintech Connect conference. We recently announced new collaborations with a number of fin-techs to expand our capabilities, including one this week, that will enable us to deliver a new suite of oversight and contingent net asset value calculations solutions for clients. This is just the beginning.In operations, we have numerous initiatives in play across the businesses that are already yielding efficiencies that we are able to reinvest to support new business initiatives and further efficiency and automation efforts. For example, in corporate action elections, increased automation has significantly reduced the number of transactions that we process manually while offering our clients best-in-class cut-off times. In the payment space, we continue to enhance our straight-through processing rate. We reached a record 97% in the month of December, that\u2019s up from 94% a year ago. And in fund accounting, we have deployed self service capabilities for reporting when we have automated over 2,000 client reports.One of the recently announced partnership enabling us to launch an AI-based reconciliation and data control solution into better serving our clients complex data needs. Other partnerships are helping us do things such as re-imagine the billing process and employ AI to resolve client inquiries faster. Across the company, we have been disciplined about the investments we are making and are focused on driving efficiency in our technology spend. As an example, we are simplifying our infrastructure and we are reducing the number of applications, which are now down 10% over the past 18 months or so, in the next 12 months will be reduced by another 10% plus. So, total reduction of 20% plus in applications over a 2 to 3-year period.So to summarize 2019, while we have more work to do, we are on the right path. We are beginning to see the benefits of the investments made over recent years and we will continue to invest and we made progress on a host of initiatives while maintaining strong operating margins and capital returns. As we look to 2020, our priorities are unchanged. They are centered on one, driving sustainable revenue growth through the strong performance culture, focused on improving service quality as well as faster innovation; two, improving every aspect that we can within our operations. Maintaining our investment in technology is key to this. Our overall technology spend for 2020 is expected to exceed the $3 billion we spent in 2019. Three, we are continuing to drive efficiency throughout the organization through automation as well as good expense discipline and four, ensuring we continue to deliver strong capital returns to shareholders.In closing, we are confident in our plans and our ability to execute on them while always looking for opportunities to improve. We have a great team and a great foundation, and we are excited about the future prospects for the firm. With that, I will turn it over to Mike to review the financial results in more detail. Mike Santomassino : Thanks, Todd and good morning everyone. Let me run through the details of the results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.Beginning on Page 4 of the financial highlights document, in the final quarter of 2019, net earnings of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.52 and both the current and prior year quarters included a number of notable items. The notable items in the fourth quarter of 2019 were costs related to severance, the relocation of our corporate headquarters and litigation expenses partially offset by some tax adjustments reducing our earnings by $0.16 per share. And in the fourth quarter of 2019, we benefited by $0.50 per share from the gain on sale of an equity investment partially offset by severance, net security losses and litigation expenses. Total revenue was $4.8 billion. Fee revenue increased 26% with nearly all of that from the gain on the sale of the equity investment. Underlying that, investment service fees were up, foreign exchange and other trading was down and most other line items were relatively flat. Net interest revenue declined 8% to $815 million. Expenses were down slightly, but excluding the notable items were up 2% with the increase driven by technology. We generated $1.4 billion in net income applicable to common shareholders or $931 million excluding the notable items. We continue to have a strong return on tangible common equity and maintained a solid pre-tax margin.In terms of shareholder capital returns, we repurchased approximately 22 million shares for just over $1 billion and paid $286 million dividend in the fourth quarter. We have reduced the number of shares outstanding by a little over 6% since the beginning of 2019. For the full year of 2019, we returned $4.4 billion to common shareholders, which is over 100% of earnings through $3.3 billion of share repurchases and approximately $1.1 billion in dividends.Moving now to capital and liquidity on Page 6, our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong. All of our key ratios were strengthened since the third quarter. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.5 billion at the end of the year and our CET1 ratio of 11.5% under the advanced approach. Our average LCR in the fourth quarter was 120% and our SLR was 6.1%. Including the impact of the recent change to the rule, our SLR would have been approximately 120 basis points higher.Turning to Page 7, my comments on the balance sheet will highlight the sequential changes. Net interest revenue was $815 million, up almost 2% versus the lease-adjusted net interest revenue in the third quarter. As we have mentioned previously, we have been focused on growing and optimizing our deposit base for the last 18 months or so. For example, we have been working with wealth management clients to convert their cash from off-balance sheet investments to on-balance sheet deposits. Our sales teams have been focused on attracting additional client deposits in other businesses and we have been targeting escrow and other opportunities while being disciplined about pricing. All of these initiatives and some of the macro factors contributed to the result. The activity that drove the outperformance versus our expectations came in the last few weeks of the year and some of it was episodic.Now as you look at the drivers, both non-interest bearing and interest-bearing deposits increased across our businesses. Some of the non-interest bearing and interest-bearing deposits related to some targeted activity that was including episodic corporate actions and other activities, which we do not expect to repeat in Q1. Margin and non-margin loans in our securities portfolio balance increased modestly. The loan balances were driven by increased client demand. The yield on interest earning assets continued to decline as expected due to the decline in short-term rates as the Fed cut rates at the end of the third quarter and again in October. The increase in intermediate and long-term interest rates is helpful, but the overall yields on the securities portfolio, loans, and other interest earning assets declined and short-term rates had a bigger impact sequentially. We also made minor adjustments to our securities portfolio that should modestly enhance the yield going forward. The reduction in asset yields was partially offset by lower deposit rates and other funding costs.Lastly, at the end of December, we did benefit modestly from higher spreads activity levels in our credit retail business and from the money we deployed in reverse repo at year end. Although repo rates over year-end ultimately normalized, we were able to lock in some trades and reverse repos were between 3% and 4%. We don\u2019t expect year aend pricing to repeat again in Q1. All of this activity resulted in our net interest margin remaining flat at 109 basis points versus the lease-adjusted NIM in the third quarter. As we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019re focused on driving higher net interest revenue and we will continue to take advantage of low risk opportunities even if they are not NIM accretive.Page 8 gives some more detail about the drivers of the net interest revenue increase versus the third quarter. You can see how the increased client deposit volumes, higher interest earning assets, and lower funding cost benefited our net interest revenue. This more than offset the decline in interest earning asset yields.Page 9 details our expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $3 billion were down slightly. The decrease is mostly due to the impact of expenses associated with the relocation of our headquarters in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower litigation. And excluding notable items, expenses were up 2% primarily reflecting the continued investments in technology.Turning to Page 10, total Investment Services revenue was down 2%. Assets under custody and administration increased 12% year-over-year to $37.1 trillion primarily reflecting higher market values and client inflows. Although the higher market levels were a bigger driver, we did see good organic AUCA growth throughout the course of the year. Within asset servicing, revenue was down 3% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue and volatility impacting foreign exchange revenue, partially offset by the impact of higher equity markets. Asset servicing fees in this business were up slightly. Foreign exchange and other trading revenue, was down 7% due to lower foreign exchange volatility and volumes. The pipeline continues to remain healthy. Dialog with clients remains active and we are not seeing an acceleration in pricing pressure.In Pershing, total revenue was up 2% to $570 million. Clearing fees were up 6% reflecting growth in client assets and accounts from new business on-boarded and from existing clients, which was partially offset by lower net interest revenue. Issuer services was down 6% to $450 million on lower depository receipt revenue which was partially offset by higher client activity in corporate trust. The decline in depository receipts revenue was due to the timing of fees and cross-border settlement activity, as well as lower net interest revenue. Treasury Services revenue was flat at $329 million as higher client activity and payment fees were offset by lower net interest revenue. Fees were up 6%. Sequentially, Treasury Services revenue was up 5% driven by higher net interest revenue. Clearance and Collateral Management revenues up 1% to $280 million, reflecting growth in collateral management and clearance volumes, which were mostly offset by lower net interest revenue. Average tri-party collateral management balances were up 12%.Page 11 summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our investment services business. Now turning to Page 12 for investment management, total investment management revenue was up 1%. Asset management revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $688 million, primarily reflecting higher market values and the impact of hedging activities, partially offset by the cumulative AUM outflows since the fourth quarter of 2018. Performance fees of $48 million were down from the fourth quarter of 2018, which was one of our stronger quarters in a while. We had outflows of $13 billion in the quarter and overall assets under management of $1.9 trillion were up 11% year-over-year due to higher markets and the favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar partially offset by net outflows. The sequential market impact is negative due to lower UK fixed income market values, which more than offset the impact of the increased equity market values of managed assets. Wealth management revenue was down 5% year-over-year to $287 million, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue partially offset by slightly higher fees that benefited from higher market values and client assets grew 11% year-on-year.Turning to our other segment on Page 13, total revenue increased, reflecting the previously referenced gain on sale of the equity investment, partially offset by the net security losses that were due to a small portfolio rebalancing. Now before we open it to questions, I will spend just a few minutes on how we are thinking about the first quarter in 2020. As I mentioned earlier, net interest revenue in the fourth quarter was better than expected in part due to some episodic balances. So at this point in the quarter, both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit volumes are lower than the elevated levels in December. We expect that the yields on our securities portfolio will continue going down with lower reinvestment yields, and therefore we expect net interest revenue to be down a little less than 5% sequentially in the first quarter.We expect that net interest revenue would stabilize later in the year if the forward curves remain stable and steepen a little and mix of deposits don\u2019t change significantly and as the impact of lower rates and the balance sheet become more fully incorporated into the results. And just a reminder that approximately 30% of the securities portfolio re-prices each quarter. We will continue to actively focus on growing deposits, optimizing the mix between on and off balance sheet offerings, and being disciplined about pricing. The Fed actions to increase excess reserves should be helpful as they\u2019ve been historically correlated to the level of our deposits, just to keep in mind that the relationship may not hold in the short run or in any given quarter. We would expect that investment and other income would be between $25 million to $35 million per quarter for the year. With regard to expenses, Todd spoke about the importance of consistently investing in technology. We expect that the level of technology investment will be up from 2019. We can calibrate the pace of that investment if we need to. This will lead our overall expenses for the full year of 2020 to increase by up to 2% year-on-year, excluding the notable items. Included is approximately 50 basis point impact from accounting related to higher pension expense.Now keep in mind that the charge we took in the fourth quarter for severance reflects the actions that will take place over the year, so we won\u2019t see the full run rate impact until 2021. And note that in the first quarter, staff expenses will be impacted by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense for the retirement-eligible employees, the impact of which will be similar to last year and will effect sequential expense growth. At this point, we currently expect the full-year 2020 effective tax rate will be approximately 21%. And lastly on the regulatory front, we are quickly entering this year\u2019s CCAR process and are awaiting next steps on the capital reform proposals. We continue to be encouraged by the direction of the proposals being discussed, but we will all see the final outcome and impact when they are complete.With that, operator, can you please open up the lines for questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe just back on the expenses real quick, if you \u2013 I didn\u2019t see it in the press release the bifurcation between severance and litigation in the fourth quarter. And then as we think about the expense trajectory into 2020 and even \u201821, can you just talk about the investments in technology and how you expect that to reduce the structural cost base over the next couple of years? Mike Santomassino : Yes. Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Mike. So, on the first piece we didn\u2019t disclose the exact number in the split between the two. I think you can get a pretty good sense of the magnitude of the severance by looking at the staff expense and the difference versus the third quarter. So that will probably give you a good sense of the magnitude there. The bigger piece by far was severance in the number. As you just sort of think about overall expenses, as both Todd and I mentioned, we would expect to invest even more this year than we did in 2019. And really it\u2019s across a range of items both continuing to build out the infrastructure that is important for operating our businesses. We are building new capabilities and you are seeing some of those get announced and released even over the last couple of weeks. And then there is a large chunk of it\u2019s going into sort of the efficiency agenda on the cost side as you have sort of suggested there. And I think working with Lester Owens, our Head of Operations, we have got a very long list of those programs that we are just clicking down the list and executing. And as you can imagine, benefits of those continue to come in the P&L over a period of time. So, we will get some of them in 2020 and we will get some of them as we sort of exit \u201820 into \u201821. And I will just sort of reinforce what Todd said in his remarks, you can see the benefits of those investments in efficiency agenda coming through the P&L already as we sort of increased the technology spend significantly in \u201819 and overall expenses are down and that\u2019s a result of that focus. Brian Bedell : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then on clearing, just on the actual clearing service fees of $421 million, just given the way the markets have moved in DARTS and the online brokerage industry at least have been pretty strong. If you want to just \u2013 I would have expected that line to be a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis. So, if there is anything that you can call out what maybe depressed that? And then maybe longer term you talked about within Pershing in the RIA strategy, maybe what are your expectations of potentially picking up market share given the industry consolidation that\u2019s upon us here? Todd Gibbons : Okay. I will take some of it. In terms of the \u2013 why don\u2019t I take the second piece? In terms of the industry consolidation and how we kind of look at that, I mean we are a little different, because Pershing is more B2B and we serve broker dealers and corporate RIAs. And we have also kind of differentiated ourselves, because we provided choice whether that\u2019s related to the open investment platform that we have got or the ability to integrate best-in-class kind of front office system. So our clients have the choice as far as that goes and I think that will in the long-term be the preference. Right now, the desire for choice seems to make it more of an opportunity. What I mean by that is just the consolidation. Probably as we look at it, it makes it more of an opportunity. There is a lot of interest in alternative providers and that just puts us in a better position. As to the revenue growth, I think we are seeing some pretty decent positive there as we have won some meaningful new business that we are implementing. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you have any... Mike Santomassino : Yes. And I am just \u2013 yes, Brian, on our revenue stream we are not a commission-based revenue stream. And so most of the revenue that we see come through the clearing services fee line is not based on the number of transactions that are getting executed. It\u2019s actually a very small piece of the puzzle there. So you won\u2019t see the same correlation between transaction activity, revenue stream as you might in some of the online brokers. Todd Gibbons : And we have got a pretty strong pipeline there. We continue to win new business. We are differentiated on the institutional side with some of our capabilities and we are investing on the advisor side both in the sales as well as the sales team, the branding as well as the technology that we are deploying. So, we feel pretty good about the business. Brian Bedell : Yes. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask a couple first on expenses. You guys guided to an expense growth of 2% or less. So, is the expectation that you are going to be able to deliver operating leverage and therefore you expect there to be a revenue growth picture that\u2019s going to be at least 2%, maybe a little greater. And can you help us understand why there is such a big delay on the severance benefit? Thanks. Todd Gibbons : Yes. Thanks Brennan. I will take the start of that and then Mike can provide a little more color. In terms of the environment delivering positive operating leverage is really going to be driven by revenue mix as much as anything right now as we continue to make investments in the technology that we think will have longer term benefits to us. So, I think it would be \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not impossible, but challenged in the very near term. I don\u2019t know if Mike had\u2026 Mike Santomassino : And I do think though Brennan, once we sort of get through the NIR stabilization, we feel very confident still sort of the model where little bit of revenue growth drives significant amount of earnings growth. And so we think that\u2019s still \u2013 we feel very confident that, that still holds. And once NIR stabilize which as I mentioned we think under, I mean, the assumptions that I sort of gave you, we think that happens later this year, then you should start to see some of that coming back into the picture. Brennan Hawken : Great. That\u2019s fair. And on that point, Mike, there were some encouraging signs here on the non-interest bearing deposits. Can you talk a little bit \u2013 give us a little more color on trends there in that line this quarter and how sustainable should we \u2013 I know you think you said that they are down from December levels, which is probably pretty seasonally typical? But like with the interest rates coming down in the market, is that \u2013 are those trends now like more durable, some stability there and maybe even some growth and do you have some deposit efforts specifically intended to help support growth in that line as well? Mike Santomassino : Yes. And I think I will start with the last piece and so trying to make sure I hit all of the points. But as I said in my script, we have been sort of focused on this for a while now and that includes going after opportunities where there is non-interest bearing deposits. And part of the episodic activity that we saw in the fourth quarter, was very targeted activity that we go after related to escrow as an example where there were some significant sort of transactions there. It\u2019s hard to predict when they are going to come and how they are going to come, but it\u2019s an intentional act on our parts to go out and target those opportunities. As you sort of think about the path forward, I think the macro environment certainly should be helpful and we are encouraged by sort of the level of dialog and the activity we are seeing. And we will have to let it play out a little bit longer to sort of call a sustainable trend, I think. Todd Gibbons : Yes. And you guys have picked up on the correlations that Fed\u2019s balance sheet and the impact is likely to have on us and that could be somewhat on the positive. And then the rest of it is going to be also rate-driven. So, if there is a change in the rate environment, it could potentially move in that category as well. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Todd Gibbons : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Todd, at the beginning you highlighted a variety of areas that should be able to deliver growth. I wondered if you could give us a sense as to what is the most important one or two areas that you are looking forward to deliver growth this year? And I am asking the question in part to understand the context for the investment spend and where it\u2019s most critical for you? Todd Gibbons : Okay. Well, I think the investment spend is kind of coming across the board. So, we are spending \u2013 I talked a little bit about just building stronger and stronger infrastructure for resiliency, which just provides an increase in the quality of our services. We are investing in integrating third-party capabilities, which I think is a bit of a differentiator. We are investing and improving operations and we are starting to see the positive feedback from that in the scorecards that our clients keep on us. The most important thing is to retain business and by providing great service and covering an increasingly better capabilities around that service. It\u2019s difficult for clients to leave. In terms of initiatives that might drive future revenues, there are really kind of three areas \u2013 three to four areas, where we are most focused. One is the things that we have talked about in the Clearing and Collateral Management. So we are building an interoperable tri-party system, which we think will make our clients much more effective in managing their collateral globally. And as a result, we can pickup some of the global market share and also provide some of those services to what have traditionally been in the bilat space. That\u2019s probably another year or two before I think that really \u2013 that kicks in but we are starting to see some of the benefits from that now. One of our other focus area is around data and analytics. And I think this is going to be an increasingly competitive advantage for us as we build. We currently with the \u2013 under Eagle have approximately $24 trillion of assets under management. Eagle is the old brand name of our data and analytics capability. As we have built on that platform and what we call a data vault, we think we have got an exciting capability where we will see growth this year and we will provide the ability to do \u2013 for our clients to do deep analysis around the structured data that\u2019s on our platform. We are investing in our wealth management platform, that\u2019s more long-term as well. And we have already talked a little bit about the investments that we are making at Pershing. So, I would say those four are in terms of business growth are where my key focus is. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Mike Santomassino : Yes, I think I\u2019d echo what Todd said on the bigger priorities, but I think the good part is that each of the \u2013 we really do feel that each of the businesses still have some opportunity to grow. Some of them require bigger investments. Some of them require smaller investment. And so I think we are focused really on each of them to make sure we take advantage of those opportunities. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. And then Mike for you specifically or Todd can chime in too, but on the capital you highlighted that the SLR under the new will be up I think to what 7.3% or 7.2% something like that. I know I have asked on this call many times about prefs and what your intentions are there. Now that we have the final rule set in, maybe you could speak to what opportunities you have to become a little bit more capital efficient there. And I am not sure if it has to wait until the CCAR given where the SLR came in? Mike Santomassino : Yes, look I think SLR, as you know, Betsy, is sort of one piece of the puzzle in terms of the rules that are sort of being discussed and contemplated. And so, I think we really do need to look at all of the rules that are still a work in process around stress capital buffer and all the related pieces of it before we have a complete picture on how we are going to optimize the capital stack. Betsy Graseck : Yes. And is it better to do a call of the pref or is it better to utilize the full capital stack you have in increasing the balance sheet size, for example, for sponsored repo? Mike Santomassino : Well, for sponsored repo, that doesn\u2019t have any impact on the size of our balance sheet. And so to take advantage of opportunities like that, we don\u2019t need capital to do that. So I think we are going to look at all of the options to figure out what our opportunity is on the revenue side to sort of grow and keep the balance sheet where it is to grow the balance sheet and we are going to look at sort of our opportunities given sort of the new capital rules. And I think you will hear more from us on that as the CCAR and stress capital stuff comes into focus hopefully over the next few months. Todd Gibbons : Yes, it\u2019s a little bit challenging, because we just don\u2019t know exactly what the rules are going to be, we hear lots of different things and we obviously follow discussions. But at this point, we just don\u2019t have enough precision to say what the actual impact is going to be to us. Betsy Graseck : Okay, alright. Do you think you are going to get that at CCAR rule set or you have to wait for June? Todd Gibbons : Who knows, I think that\u2019s the honest answer. I think we are all going to find out when the rules come out in CCAR, how much of it\u2019s clear and then we will see as they finalize the notice of rule \u2013 the NPRs that they have got out there, so\u2026 Mike Santomassino : They got lot to get on... Todd Gibbons : In a short period of time. Betsy Graseck : Okay, alright. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Good morning, everybody. So just a couple of follow-ups. So one I guess on expenses, Mike, let me just to clarify the base of what you guys are talking about 2020 expense growth is about $10.8 billion kind of the core number that you report in 2019? Mike Santomassino : Yes. Yes, it\u2019s what\u2019s in the press release on Page 3. Alex Blostein : Yes. And then when we talk about the tech spend, do you guys had $3 billion or so in 2019. I just want to make sure is that all running through the income statement and again it sounded like that was a 10% growth in 2019. How much of a growth rate do you guys expect to see there for 2020 basically just kind of trying to get a flavor for how much you need to reengineer in savings to keep the overall expenses below the 2% range? Mike Santomassino : Yes, I think \u2013 most of it\u2019s running through the P&L already, Alex. So look for 2019, so most of it\u2019s kind of through P&L. So I think we are not \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have given you the exact percentage increase that\u2019s going to go up, but we are continuing to deliver consistent sort of efficiency gains as we go. And as you and I and others have sort of talked about over time like we still think there is a long road ahead of efficiencies that we can generate through these investments we are making sure we feel pretty confident that we are going to get out those over the next couple of years. Alex Blostein : Alright. My second question around the asset management business, so when I look at the flow dynamics, fixed income LDI was a little light this quarter again despite what has been a really strong trend in the industry and then cash management also I think had some outflows. Can you provide a little bit of color kind of what\u2019s been driving that and then the market performance also sizably negative number which obviously surprising given what the market had done, so maybe kind of help flush out what\u2019s driven both the flows and the market delta in this quarter? Todd Gibbons : Yes, look and I know we are \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be a straight line sort of up as you sort of think about flows in that business. And there has been lot happening in through the UK pension market that sort of \u2013 people sort of make sure they were sort of thinking about sort of how to manage their liabilities in the right way and we feel really good still about the pipeline and the unfunded commitments that we have got in that business in the UK plus they have been continuing to invest in bringing their capabilities outside of their core market. So I think we still feel good about the LDI space. We feel good about what they are doing. Performance has been good. And so we don\u2019t really, we don\u2019t really have any concerns in the LDI space really at all. And as you know just more broadly about our asset management business, it\u2019s largely institutional set of clients. And so you are going to have some chunky flows from time-to-time for various reasons as you sort of look at any given quarter. And so there is nothing underneath the fixed income side, but obviously the point to that it\u2019s a core issue or core trend that we are concerned about. Mike Santomassino : Well, then you also had a question around market and I think one of the things to keep in mind, we have a fairly substantial exposure to the UK where they were \u2013 I mean, the currency impacts and the equity impacts are a little bit different than it would have been domestically. So that\u2019s one thing I would throw in there. In terms of the cash, I would say that\u2019s a little disappointing and I think we need to work to do a little better there. Alex Blostein : Got it. Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will next go to the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, good morning. Quick question on the deposit optimization that you talked about, just trying to get a sense of how far along you are in that process, it sounds like you did that over the course of 2019 or is it like there is still a long runway to deposit optimization from here? Todd Gibbons : I think, Brian, it\u2019s a \u2013 we are continuing to optimize. So, I think this is a dialog that, it\u2019s a very granular conversation with clients and it\u2019s a client-by-client sort of dialog. And so I think we have made some progress, but we have got more to go to continue to make sure that we are optimizing sort of the pricing and footprint we have got there so. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then separately, is there any way to kind of give an update on how the Aladdin offering is moving forward, still some concern across the industry, whether or not proprietary versus third-party solutions? That is the way it\u2019s moving. Do you have any update there? Thanks. Mike Santomassino : Sure. We have been building on a number of partnerships over the past 6 to 9 months. And I would say they are really coming in two flavors. The first it where it is one of the ones that you are referring to is where we have connected with some of the leading order management systems, Aladdin, Bloomberg and SimCorp. Many of our mutual clients already have signed up and many are in the process of signing up. So, we got a very high success rate where we have got common clients. The other thing to that is doing for us is opening doors for other conversations where we see our clients able to gain efficiencies because of this. So, I think it\u2019s got \u2013 right now the benefits that we are seeing is its initiating discussions, opening doors and giving us more opportunities to bid on new business. And secondly it\u2019s strengthening the relationships with the businesses that we have already got, because it is integrated, it is single sign-on, the client is able to look it down into their custody activities, it\u2019s near real-time, it\u2019s \u2013 I think there is the real benefit to our clients here that are paying off. And I mentioned that they are really as we think through the partnerships, they are really coming in two flavors. The other type is everything that we are doing with fin-techs. And so we have announced quite a few, just this week we announced one where we are working with the fin-tech to provide independent alternative NAVs for funds. So this provides both an oversight function as well as \u2013 and enhances the control and in addition it serves as a contingency if there were a problem in construction of the NAV. So we have partnered with them. Some of our clients have actually looked to use them, but they found the implementation would have been too difficult. And so by partnering with them, implementing we are gaining scale from doing that as well as it\u2019s providing as a service rather than just as a piece of software. So we are pretty excited that\u2019s already attracted quite a bit of attention this week. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Robert Wildhack : Good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask question on the balance sheet and the impact of \u2013you have said injecting reserves into the system. Are you seeing significant impact there and you know either way, how long until we can kind of see that quite how many numbers? Thanks. Todd Gibbons : Let me probably take that piece. It\u2019s so difficult, Robert, for us to be able to identify any single particular incident on a day-to-day basis or even. But if you just look back at historical trends and you look at the balance sheet and you look at the Fed\u2019s balance sheet and you look at our balance sheet related to deposits, you will see that there is a correlation, but depicting why that took place whether it was a money market fund that decided to leave a little extra cash into countering like that is very, very hard to determine. We are still out of it. Is there anything to add to that? Mike Santomassino : No. Robert Wildhack : Thanks. I think that\u2019s all I had. Todd Gibbons : Okay. Thanks, Robert. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Todd. Hi, Mike. Todd Gibbons : Good morning, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Two questions. Which businesses need the most catch up, if you can aim at talking from a business standpoint, I know you are spending into lot of different areas, lot of businesses, but where do you think you need to do so more either from a competitive standpoint or business need, can you give some sense of \u2013 because you have got obviously a lot of businesses? Todd Gibbons : Yes. I actually think we are in pretty good shape. What we are trying to do in the back is trying to get ahead of the game. And if you think about some of the things that we are going to just walk through the whole list of partnerships and kind of differentiating capabilities and this willingness to integrate with best-in-class. We are not always going to be able to deliver the best application and we would want to provide our clients flexibility. So that holds when we look at Pershing, it holds when we look at asset servicing, we made some very good investments in our corporate trust business and we are able \u2013 we are starting to gain back market share. We had lost a little market share over the years.We continue \u2013 I like where we are in wealth management, I think we can continue to do better there. So, I think we are \u2013 I think this is a matter of trying to breakout, non cash out. Vivek Juneja : Yes. Is there room to improve the efficiency of tech spend, what we are hearing from others is they are trying to flatten it, shift the mix of what they are spending on? We are hearing that from competitors and peers of yours, is there room for you to do that and if not, when can we start to see that flatten out? Mike Santomassino : Hey, Vivek, it\u2019s Mike. I think Todd highlighted a little bit about in his script where we are as focused about driving efficiency in our technology spend as we are anywhere else in the company and we reduced the number of apps by 10% and there is another 10% coming, so over 20% reduction of our apps. And as we sort of make these investments in the underlying infrastructure and application, it makes the next set of investments we want to make that much more efficient, cheaper, faster and so it\u2019s something you are already seeing in the spend that we are making. Vivek Juneja : So, do you have a range or something on operating margin where you think you can get to with all of this tech spend as we look out a year or two? Mike Santomassino : Yes. Look, we haven\u2019t given you a view on go-forward operating margins, Vivek. But as I said earlier, I think as we sort of get through the short-term \u2013 medium-term on net interest revenue we do feel confident that the model still holds where we will be able to deliver for a little bit of revenue growth, a pretty significant amount of earnings growth then and I think that implies expansion in operating margin at that point. So I think I would just sort of model that way. I think the guide we gave you a while ago now at Investor Day a couple of years ago is probably a good sense \u2013 still a good way to think about it still. Vivek Juneja : One last one for you, Mike, your reverse repo yields fell pretty sharply, the ones \u2013 the way you have it on the balance sheet, the lowest level we have seen in five quarters. How should we think about that, is that \u2013 that drop? Mike Santomassino : Yes. The Fed reduced rates and the September \u2013 the peak in reverse repo spreads in September didn\u2019t happen again, those two drivers. Todd Gibbons : I know you like to do the arithmetic there, Vivek, but we look at that since it\u2019s novated down, the size matters, the spread matters and then the overall rate matters, but ultimately we are generating a spread that\u2019s been [no way but] down. That spread has been reasonably consistent, but in the third quarter, we saw the spike with an unusual activity in the repo market. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. You mentioned retiring apps and you retired 10%, 10% more to go, what\u2019s the total number of apps that you have? And I don\u2019t think this is completely related, but what percent of apps on desktops are web-based versus having old versions of code support them? Todd Gibbons : I am going to turn this one over to Mike, Mike, but in terms of the \u2013 we don\u2019t disclose the total number of apps or I don\u2019t believe we have disclosed the total number of apps that we have got. But we have obviously got a pretty careful inventory of those actions. And part of what we are doing in our resiliency build-out in infrastructure investment is also making ourselves more efficient by really sun settling with some of those applications. And so I am pleased that we are down 10%, probably closer to 12% now and we have got another 10% or so that will probably kick out over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. So, I can\u2019t really get into the specifics of where those apps are in terms of what base. Mike Santomassino : Yes. Mike, I am not \u2013 I think that \u2013 I am not sure that\u2019s the right way to think about it, not all modern apps are web-based apps, but I think you should assume that many of the tools that our folks are using are continually \u2013 are always getting better and we are always investing in those and that gets \u2013 we have every weekend of the year, there is something that\u2019s being rolled out across our product suite to either internal folks or external folks and that improves the way they work. So, we have... Todd Gibbons : Yes. In terms of productivity tools, we are rolling out the most \u2013 the office \u2013 the cloud version of Microsoft\u2019s Office 365. One of the things that we are also doing is our operations. We get over 1 million client e-mail inquiries each year and we are developing AI around making that much more productive in responding to it. So, we are continuing to invest a lot in productivity and the infrastructure build that we are making I think will help us do that as well. Mike Mayo : And then just one follow-up, so just generally speaking, you said you are spending more in technology, it was at $3 billion going up to what number I am not sure if you said that if you are willing to do so? And when do you think that turns like if you think of it going down the J curve, when do you come up the other side with these investments? Is that like a year or 3 years or 5 years? Todd Gibbons : Let me make one comment and Mike might want to get through more of the detail. As we have really picked up the tech spend over the past 3 years, I would say the rate has come down slightly although the total amount continues to go up, because it\u2019s on a little bit of a bigger base, but the rate of growth has probably come down. I don\u2019t know, Mike, if you want to share where the J curve is meaning you think through how quickly we amortize infrastructure? Mike Santomassino : Yes. I mean, look Mike, I think the way we think about the tech spend is it\u2019s not we are shooting to spend a certain number. What we are doing each year is looking at how much can we actually execute, what are the business cases, how do we think about like the return we are going to get on them. And most importantly like can we successfully sort of execute it and we have people in place to do it. I think that\u2019s driving \u2013 and that\u2019s going to be the constraint that we have got in most years is making sure that we can execute it well. And I think right now we feel it\u2019s important to continue to make those investments, because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to differentiate us going forward. And keeping in mind that we have got to deliver bottom line \u2013 on the bottom line as well and so we are trying to find the balance there to make sure that we are doing the right thing by all of our stakeholders. And so that\u2019s the way we sort of go about how much we are going to spend in any given year. Todd Gibbons : Yes. So it\u2019s a really good point. So as we look out to next year, I don\u2019t want to predict this, because if it was not an ROI on the spend we will bring it down, but right now we believe there is. Mike Mayo : Alright. Thank you. Todd Gibbons : Thanks Mike. Mike Santomassino : Alright. It looks like that\u2019s the last question. Thank you everyone. We will talk to you next time. Todd Gibbons : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call webcast.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I will now turn the conference over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon\u2019s Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Magda Palczynska : Good morning. Today, BNY Mellon released its results for the first quarter of 2020. The earnings press release and the financial highlights presentation to accompany this call are both available on our website at bnymellon.com. Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon\u2019s CEO will lead the call. Then Mike Santomassino, our CFO will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Mike\u2019s prepared remarks there will be a Q&A session. As a reminder, please limit yourself to two questions.Before we begin, please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC, all available on our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 16, 2020 and will not be updated.With that, I will hand over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thank you, Magda and good morning everyone. Before getting into our results, I want to call out the heroic efforts of medical professionals and first responders in the U.S. and abroad. I have doctors in my immediate family, so I am acutely aware of the risks and what they are dealing with. We are also grateful for the extraordinary actions taken by central banks, regulators and governments to minimize the extent possible the financial fallout as we all face this unprecedented crisis.Now, let\u2019s shift to our financial results. I will briefly highlight our first quarter performance and then focus on how we are navigating the current realities, discuss what the immediate impact has been on our business, and then look at how we think about the potential impact going forward. Mike will then go through the financials in more details. For the first quarter, we reported earnings of $944 million and earnings per share of $1.05, that\u2019s up 12% over the first quarter of 2019, with revenue up 5% and expenses flat as we benefited from heightened levels of market activity and volatility partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. All of our investment services business showed solid growth.Clearly, we have entered an unprecedented environment where things are changing quickly and it\u2019s going to be a very challenging time for everyone. As the \u2013 the situation has evolved quickly, but from the start, our focus was on the health and well-being of our people and the continuity of service to our clients. We quickly transitioned the vast majority of our people to working from home, which opened up space for us to create social distancing for the small number of essential and office staff. Fewer than 5% of our global employees remain in the office. These essential in-office staff are primarily performing roles that cannot be done remotely.The investments we have made in our infrastructure, operating platforms and cyber information security have clearly benefited us enabling us to support this broad scale of remote working arrangement. All of the controls and security oversight that govern us when working inside the office are in full effect when we are working remotely. The response from our people has been exceptional. You couldn\u2019t ask for greater professionalism or dedication to our clients at a time when we are also dealing with unprecedented levels of market activity and personal challenges. Please note that while our people are caring for our clients we are caring for them.We have made available to them a host of health and well-being resources, including access to telehealth services, free testing for COVID-19 in the U.S. along with us covering all costs related to outpatient, urgent care or emergency room visits for the evaluation and treatment related to COVID-19. Recognizing the mental health challenges during these uncertain times, we made available the stress management program and emotional support services and resources to help our people cope and deal with the social isolation. And we are supporting our colleagues who are unwell or may have been exposed by guaranteeing full pay for absences for those who have tested positive or are self-quarantined. We are also providing paid time off to care for immediate family members with COVID-19 or COVID-19 like symptoms.Finally, to support our people we made the decision that we will not do any additional layoffs during 2020. It\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do at a time when the pandemic is creating so many personal uncertainties for our people. Since the crisis began, we have remained fully operational and opened for business and we have been there for our clients during this unprecedented period of market disruption. We engaged early with thousands of clients globally to discuss their own continuity plans and work with them to ensure minimal disruption to their operational processes and transaction settlements. We stood up client command centers for our operations and client-facing staff to centralize, escalate and quickly resolve client enquiries. We accelerated training on our digital tools to help clients reduce their physical and manual process footprint, minimizing their operational risk profile.We have also taken a series of humanitarian actions in an effort to and help those negatively affected by the virus. That has included making philanthropic commitments to important support organizations in regions where our employees live and work, including organizations working in the frontline in the U.S., EMEA and Mainland China and other affected areas in Asia and India announcing a twofold and matching program for employee donations. We have also donated hundreds of video capable tablets to public hospitals in New York to help patients and medical staff communicate with their loved ones and partnering with nonprofit organizations to provide aid to first responders healthcare transit and other first frontline workers as well as serve some of the most vulnerable populations in the provision of critical items such as meals, shelter, medical equipment, educational supplies and financial support as well as 50,000 face masks we donated to New York city hospitals dealing with shortages. We also continue to look for opportunities to do more.Lastly, we are focused on maintaining strength, liquidity and lower risk profile of our balance sheet, while using it to support our clients and markets. We have been in regular dialog with the regulators and key market participants to ensure we are coordinated and see how we can help bring stability to markets when the markets first came under pressure last month. The Federal Reserve activated a primary dealer credit facility to provide funding to primary dealers. They achieve that through our tri-party repo services. That\u2019s something we are uniquely positioned to do and it\u2019s been a privilege to help given our strong capital and liquidity position. We have used our balance sheet to support our clients. That means accommodating their elevated deposits and funding about $3 billion incremental gross on committed facilities. In March, we also purchased more than $3 billion in assets and money market funds, including our own to upgrade liquidity for fund holders and we have continued to do so in April.Looking ahead, we and our clients faced extreme market and economic uncertainty. While it is too early to predict the impact, we have a well diversified and financial resilient franchise that is relatively well positioned to withstand what\u2019s to come in terms of the immediate impact on our business. March had extremely high levels of volatility. In market stresses, we experienced much higher client volumes than normal and activity is up across all of our business lines.Let me just share a few data points that bear this out in foreign exchange. We saw higher volumes across all parts of our business, up approximately 50% in March and large spikes in volatility in U.S. dollar payments treasury service on average processed $2.5 trillion payments per day in March peeking one day at over $3 trillion in mid-March compared to $1.7 trillion in recent quarters. At times, Pershing saw elevated trading volumes 2.5x to 3x normal level. In clearance and collateral management, U.S. government securities clearance volumes in March were up more than 20% from February levels driven by the heavy U.S. treasury issuance coupled with increased market volatility and asset servicing.During March, we experienced an increased an increase in U.S. accounting trade volumes of more than 50% versus the first two months of 2020 and global security settlement times were up approximately 40% over the same period. We have also experienced substantial deposit inflows in asset management. We experienced net inflows driven by cash inflows of $43 billion and our performance fees were up due to solid performance across our largest strategies. As you think about company\u2019s performance over the rest of the year, I would caution against extrapolating these results for the full year.The full ramifications of the lower rates and the moves in the capital markets are not yet being fully felt. The decline in our capital ratios this quarter reflects large deposit inflows mostly due to the flight to safety for current market conditions and Fed balance sheet expansion share repurchases of $985 million were completed prior to deciding along with the other big banks to temporarily suspend further buybacks so that we can use our significant capital and liquidity you provide maximum support to our clients. We believe that we will have the ability and a wide range of scenarios to continue to pay our dividend and to support our clients.Looking ahead to the remainder of 2020, it is difficult to forecast the impact of the coronavirus on our results with certainty, because so much depends on how the health crisis evolves its impact to the economy and the actions taken by central banks and governments to support the economy. We have a lower risk fee-based business model that positions us relatively well in an environment like this. We performed stress test regularly as to our regulators. In CCAR, we consistently perform well. We have a highly diversified business model, with a conservative risk profile and fees in general are skewed towards recurring revenue streams. We should benefit from increased activity in clearance and collateral management from increased issuance of U.S. treasuries and U.S. tri-party collateral management although the latter somewhat depends in Federal Reserve Bank in New York operations.Monetary policy turns signs of uncertainty, tends to have a positive effect for us to lower \u2013 to higher deposit volumes and we will continue to mange our expenses tightly. All that having been said, the lower interest rate environment impacts us both through net interest revenue and through money-market fee waivers in Pershing, asset management and corporate trust as well as the market decline in certain industries being under pressure will have an impact. And Mike will cover those items in more detail later. Still we believe we have the capital and liquidity to withstand a multiple of scenarios, pay our dividends and continue to support our clients.Finally, I wanted to take a moment to convey how deeply honored I am to be CEO of this great company. While my near-term focus is on safeguarding the well-being of our employees supporting our clients through this period and maintaining our balance sheet, we are looking ahead to ways to build on our solid foundation with the strong business model and balance sheet to drive improved performance and capabilities across our company.With that, I will turn it over to Mike. Mike Santomassino : Thanks, Todd and good morning everyone. First, let me echo Todd\u2019s opening comments. There are an incredible number of people in our communities who are either out there on the frontlines or are providing essential services to help the rest of us and our families not to mention all the people and government in our industry who are working together to help the economy, help people pay their bills and ensure the smooth functioning of the global markets. We are thankful to all of them. With that said, let me run through the details of our results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.Beginning on Page 5 with the financial highlights document, in the first quarter of 2020, we had earnings of $944 million and earnings per share of $1.05, up 4% and 12% respectively. Comparisons versus the fourth quarter of 2019 are impacted by the notable items we incurred last quarter specifically the gain on sale of the equity investment, which was partially offset by severance and litigation expenses and net security losses. Total revenue was $4.1 billion or up 5%. Fee revenue increased 10% primarily driven by higher foreign exchange and other trading revenue, higher transaction volumes and increased activity from existing clients across investment services and higher performance fees in investment management which were partially offset by equity investment losses and losses from consolidated investment management firms.Net interest revenue declined 3% to $814 million year-over-year and was flat to the fourth quarter. We increased our provision for credit losses by $169 million in the quarter. This was driven by the macroeconomic outlook in conjunction with the application of the new CECL accounting standard. Our actual losses or net charge-offs were $1 million during the quarter. Expenses were essentially flat driven by continued investment in technology and the higher pension expenses we spoke about last quarter partially offset by lower staff expense and the favorable impact of stronger U.S. dollar.We had a solid return on intangible equity of 20% and maintained a pre-tax margin of 30%. In terms of shareholder capital returns, we repurchased 21.7 million shares for $985 million. The majority of the repurchases were completed in January and were all completed ahead of the March 15th announcement by the Financial Services Forum, member banks regarding the temporary suspension of repurchases. We also paid $282 million in common stock dividends in the first quarter.And moving to capital and liquidity on Page 6, our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above internal targets and regulatory minimums. The declines versus the prior quarter primarily reflect this quarter\u2019s very strong deposit growth that increased the size of the balance sheet. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.5 billion as of March 31st and our CET1 ratio was 11.4% under the advanced approach and 11.3% under the standardized approach. Our average LCR in the first quarter was 115% and our SLR was 5.6%. And a reminder that effective April 1, the revised rules will allow us to deduct central bank deposits and U.S. treasuries from the SLR denominator. Under the new rules, the SLR would have been approximately 7.6%.Turning to Page 7, my comments on net interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes. Net interest revenue was $814 million, flat to the fourth quarter. Despite lower rates in the quarter, the results were better than what we had expected driven by the elevated deposit levels, particularly in the last 3 weeks of March. We also benefited from higher securities and loan balances and the widening of LIBOR to Fed fund spreads. This was offset with the negative impact of hedging activities, which are mostly offset in trading and other revenue. The increase in loan balances in March was primarily driven by clients drawing approximately $3 billion from their committed credit facilities and elevated overdrafts. Higher overdrafts are normal when there is an increase in market volatility and the overdrafts are generally well secured. The net interest margin of 101 basis points was down 8 basis points versus the fourth quarter.Page 8 describes how deposit balances trended over the course of the quarter. Deposit balances were close to flat to the fourth quarter average through the first 2 months. And if you recall, we had some episodic activity last quarter, so balances were running a little ahead of where we modeled before the increased market volatility in March. In March, deposits increased to over $300 billion on average and $337 billion at March 31, which you can see in our supplement. All of the businesses saw increases with the largest dollar increase in asset servicing. Through the first two weeks of April, deposit balances are down from the March 31 levels, but remain elevated.Moving to Page 9, our average interest earning assets increased to $324 billion, approximately 41% of these assets are held in cash or reverse repos, while 42% are in our securities portfolio and 17% are in the loan portfolio. In addition to the funded loans in the page, we also have unfunded committed lines. The details can be found in our annual report and will be updated in the 10-Q. I will give you an overview of the funded loan exposures. 26% of the portfolio is related to high-quality mortgages and well secured investment credit lines provided to our high net worth wealth management and Pershing clients. To-date, we have received a limited number of forbearance requests related to the mortgage loans and are working through them with clients.The investment credit lines performed well during the market volatility. 21% of margin loans primarily in Pershing, these loans are well secured and have performed well during the recent volatility as well. 23% are to financial institutions and are composed primarily of short-term trade related loans through investment grade banks with tenures less than 1 year and secured loans to clients, including asset managers who often borrow against marketable securities held in custody. 10% of the portfolio was in commercial real estate. Approximately, 70% of the loans that are secured with moderate leverage and solid loan-to-value ratios, roughly 10% of this exposure is related to hotels and retail. There are predominantly \u2013 these are predominantly with clients with whom we have longstanding relationships, many over multi-generations. The remaining exposure is primarily to REITs, the majority of which are investment grade and are well diversified across the industries and the remaining 6% is commercial lending. These borrowers are primarily investment grade.Now, turning to the securities portfolio. We have a high-quality liquid portfolio. Much of it is in U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasuries and sovereign debt. The portfolio increased as we deployed more cash into securities, including the commercial paper and CDs we purchased from our affiliated and third-party money market funds. The $4 billion of CLOs are highly rated with 94% AAA and the remainder AA or better. 97% of the non-agency CMBS are AAA and have solid subordination. The rest of the ratings breakdown can be found in the supplement. Page 10 provides an overview on expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $2.7 billion were up slightly driven by higher technology expenses and pension costs offset by lower incentive expenses.Now, turning to Page 11, total investment services revenue was up 9%. Assets under custody and our administration increased 2% year-over-year to $35.2 trillion as higher client inflows were partially offset by lower market values and the unfavorable impact of a strong U.S. dollar. Within asset servicing, revenue was up 8% to $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting higher volatility and higher client driven volumes in our foreign exchange service, higher transaction activity, higher deposits and new business growth with existing clients.In Pershing, revenue was up 16% to $653 million, primarily reflecting higher clearance volumes, particularly in March. It was also driven by one-time breakage fee related to a potential client that will not affect the run-rate and higher client assets and accounts from new business on-boarded as well as existing clients. Issuer services, was up 6% to $419 million with growth in both corporate trust and depository receipts revenue. Depository receipts revenue was driven by cross-border settlement activity, while corporate trust reflected net new business in higher deposit volumes.Treasury services revenue was up 7% to $339 million driven by higher deposit balances and higher trading volumes. Deposit balances increased year-on-year by 22% reflecting the environment and our investments in new capabilities and the increased focus on deposit gathering. Clearance and collateral management revenue was up 9% to $300 million, reflecting elevated volumes and balances across clearance, tri-party repo and collateral management, global collateral management. Average tri-party collateral management balances in the U.S. and globally were up 15% and 11% respectively.Page 12 summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of the investment services businesses. Now turning to Page 13 for investment management, total investment management revenue was down 4%, asset management revenue was down 3% year-over-year to $620 million, primarily reflecting equity investment losses, including seed capital as well as unfavorable change in the mix of AUM since the first quarter of \u201819 partially offset by higher performance fees and positive market impact.Performance fees of $50 million were up from $31 million a year ago due to good performance in some of our international active equity portfolios. As a reminder, our performance fees tended to be the highest in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters. We had inflows of $38 billion in the quarter, most of which was in cash. Overall, assets under management of $1.8 trillion are down 2% year-over-year due to the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Wealth management revenue was down 6% year-over-year to $278 million, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue due to lower interest rates.Now turning to our other segment on Page 14, revenues were roughly flat year-over-year while expenses declined an $18 million primarily due to lower staff expense. Now, finally a few comments about the second quarter. I will walk you through number of variables that we are watching closely. Having said that, I will encourage you not to put too much emphasis on a point in time view as the variables are changing quickly. As for net interest revenue, as I mentioned, deposit balances continue to be elevated, but lower than the March 31st levels. We are expecting balances to stabilize above the February average, but set below the March 31st surge. We will see the full run-rate of lower interest rates on our funding cost and asset yields, including the securities portfolio. We would expect between 25% to 30% of securities portfolio to re-price in the second quarter. The forward curve for LIBOR Fed fund spreads shows a narrowing from today\u2019s levels and in the portfolio, we are monitoring prepayment fees of the mortgage-backed securities as they maybe volatile in the current environment.So using the forward market curves on our best estimates right now, we would expect net interest revenues to be down sequentially between 2% to 5%, changes to any of the variables mentioned to both positively or negatively impact the estimate. We also expect that the low interest rates will begin to impact money market fee waivers. This impact will be felt more in Pershing initially, but will also impact other parts of the firm. The total impact is difficult to estimate what could be between $50 million to $75 million in the second quarter net of lower distribution expense. Higher yields and short-term instruments may help reduce the impact in the second quarter.The first quarter foreign exchange and trading revenue was impacted by the significant increase in market volatility and associated client volumes, primarily in March. Levels have subsided somewhat in April, but still remain elevated compared to the recent historical lows in 2019. Additionally, the substantial increase in transactional activity in March across many of the businesses, which Todd noted was exceptional and not likely to recur. We will also see the full impact of lower equity markets although some have begun to recover.On expenses, we are continuing to focus on driving down discretionary expense, while protecting our most important investments and continue to reprioritize spending given the environment. We would now expect full year expenses to be approximately flat year-on-year, including the expected 50 basis point increase from the increase in expansion expense. Credit costs will be highly depended on individual credits and how the economic forecast change by the time we get to the end of the second quarter. And in terms of our tax rate, we would expect the full year 2020 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%.Now before we go to Q&A, I would just like to congratulate Todd on behalf of the management team on being named CEO. It\u2019s well deserved and really good news for us in the company. And with that operator, can you please open up the line for questions? Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Can you hear me? Todd Gibbons : We can, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Congratulations Todd on the new role, you certainly deserve this, so congratulations. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Can you give us a big picture answer? Obviously you guys are the chief plumbers of the financial system and we sort of as you pointed out extraordinary volumes in so many different areas. Can you give us a read from the inside how the system handled all the surge? It appears to have ended it well, but maybe you can give us some firsthand examples of how well the macro system worked to the surge in activity? Todd Gibbons : Yes, I will take that, Gerard. So it\u2019s Todd. I think it\u2019s impressive how well the system did handle the huge increases in activity and there were there are couple of glitches but not many and for example clearing in collateral management business we went to a 100% work from home very early on and all of that worked quite smoothly and so we saw volumes increased 50% overnight but we had the technology and the capacity to manage it so I think I am pretty impressed across the board where we saw resiliency and disaster recovery plans that had to change a bit to typically a disaster recovery plan where we focus on a region but this was obviously global and so they moved to work from home was wherever it can be executed was executed so a couple of occasional glitches constant conversations between the counter parties as well as our client\u2019s we had many thousands of conversations to make sure that we were connected that they knew how they could connect with us we although there was a lot of mobilization to the use of our portal and electronic means of communication which made things much simpler so I think it was an impressive reflection in the strength of our financial system and the infrastructure of it. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And then more specific question obviously CECL hit your provision for the quarter, similar to other banks two parts first what kind of economic assumptions we will use to come up with that provision that we put in to the first quarter results and then second if you could identify where most of that was allocated, was it to, you mentioned some hotel exposure or to financial customers would be helpful as well? Thank you. Todd Gibbons : Mike, you want to take that one? Mike Santomassino : Yes, sure Todd, I will take that. So I would say first as you sort of think about the reserve that we have built, a very small piece of it was due to individual either borrower downgrades or the incremental loans that we saw drawn and most of it was really reflective of the changing economic environments in the new accounting standard and as we sort of think about the outlook that was in there with the outlook takes into account multiple scenarios and we sort of use that changing environment sort of inform what we did and as you sort of look at it was a meaningful waiting towards a very prolong recessionary scenario that does not fully recover us until you get into 2021. So I think that\u2019s the way I would sort of think about it. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? Todd Gibbons : We can, Brennan. There is a little noise in the background. Brennan Hawken : Yes, sorry, it\u2019s another earnings call that\u2019s overlapping, but I am trying to have doing cell phone here, apologies. First off, Todd, congratulations on getting the role of CEO. They kept us in suspense for a while, but glad to see we got to the right place. Quick one on deposit cost trends, so they came in better than expected. It was probably helped by some of the timing of deposit growth, but is there way to help us think about that line in 2Q, maybe how much was averaging and then what you expect to continue to see as far as some relief on the deposit cost front will be great? Thanks. Todd Gibbons : Okay. Mike, you want to take that one as well? Mike Santomassino : Yes, sorry \u2013 sorry about that. Yes, so Brennan, as you sort of think about it, as you know, the Fed moves pretty substantially in the latter or middle of March I guess. And we adjusted our pricing there and so you only saw really a couple of weeks of that sort of embedded in the first quarter averages. And so as you sort of look at full run-rate impact of that, it\u2019s going be a pretty substantial increase down for the cost of interest bearing deposits. And so in the beta obviously changes as you sort of get close to zero, but I think you will see a pretty significant decline as you get down for the rest of the quarter. Brennan Hawken : Okay, alright. Thanks for that. And then when we think about servicing lines, I believe Mike that you talked about how there was some strength from volumes, which aided the line which you guys flagged during 1Q as well and early March and it was great to see it come through, but it seemed as though you sort of cautioned about that sustaining, is that because you have seen some of those volumes already subside and can you help us think about maybe how much of a contributing factor that was so we could maybe calibrate for how to adjust in our forecast? Thank you. Todd Gibbons : So Mike, you want to start and maybe I will add little color. Mike Santomassino : Yes, I think as you sort of think about what we saw as Todd mentioned in his script is the volumes we saw in the latter part of March were exceptional and they went from for lack of a better way to describe it sort of 0 to 100 overnight. And as we sort of look at what we are seeing post-quarter end, the volumes are still higher than they were before the search, but certainly off the peak that we have had in the latter part of March. And I think as you sort of look at the go forward expectation, it\u2019s really hard to predict with a high degree of certainty how long they will stay elevated and come down to back to normal. Todd Gibbons : Yes, I would add a little color, I mean in some of the businesses like clearing and collateral management. So as you think about our government clearing business that\u2019s continuing to sustain itself at very high level, because the government is issuing a lot of debt and there is a lot of trading going on around that. The collateral management business is probably a little bit off from where we saw it at the peak, but I think secured lending will become more and more will continue to be important in the industry and we are likely to see growth there. But the very high volumes, for example, that we would have seen in Pershing, the transaction volumes are going to fallback to what we think more normalized levels, which they begun, we have begun to do we are seeing that in asset servicing to certain extent as well. Brennan Hawken : Okay, alright. I will try and triangulate those factors. Thanks a lot for the color. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Brennan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Congratulations Todd. That\u2019s great news. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I had a question around the press, now that the rules are starting April 1 is the kick off date for the new rules. Could give us a sense as to how you are thinking about that capital stack and what you would do with the press here? Todd Gibbons : Okay. Mike, I will turn that one over to you. Mike Santomassino : Yes. Look, obviously, Betsy, as you know we are in the middle of CCAR. So we are not going to talk much about sort of what our capital plan looks like at this point. But as you sort of think about where given the increase in the balance sheet where we are most constrained right now is Tier 1 leverage. And I think as you sort of think about prospect that could be good depending on how long we have sort of remained constrained there that could be a good way to continue to \u2013 on that, I think we are going to continue to look at opportunities to either refi, press if that comes back into market and pricing comes back to where it was just 4, 5, 6 weeks ago. So, we are continuing to look at the capital stack and we will give you more once CCAR is done. Betsy Graseck : And then when I am thinking about the funding mix, there is room for your funding costs to come down obviously with not only deposits, but in looking at the long-term debt, is there some opportunity there as well in this environment to reduce the funding costs? Todd Gibbons : Mike? Mike Santomassino : To reduce long-term debt, is that what you are suggesting, Betsy? Betsy Graseck : Yes. Well, just looking at the yield on the long-term debt, is there room there to bring this down in addition to the deposits, cost of funds here over the long-term? Mike Santomassino : Yes. Well, I think lower rates are going to impact all of our funding costs overall, right. And I think you are going to see that come through in the second quarter. So I think you will see that. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next, we move to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mike, can you talk a little bit about more about just on helping us to understand because it\u2019s been a while now on the fee waiver side. So, the 50 to 75, can you just help us understand what that means when you say net of distribution expense, where it shows up in the income statement and then would there be logically just because rates are going down at bigger potential impact as you move past 2Q just on the direction of rates? Mike Santomassino : Yes. I think I will try to give you a little bit of the things that we are sort of thinking about related to that, but so first and foremost, if we can have an impact on government funds first, right, as you sort of think about where yields are. And one of the variables that makes it pretty hard to estimate right now is just where T bill yields are. So over the last 3 weeks they have gone from negative to 20 plus basis points back down a bit now over the last day or so and so that\u2019s going to be a big driver of when they start \u2013 when fee waiver start to kick in and that\u2019s of them as well. So you sort of have to keep that in mind. And as you sort of think about the funds in our asset management business that may get impacted by it that maybe distributed through other parts of the company, some of those fee waivers would be offset by lower distribution expenses in those businesses. So you will see the fee waivers come through the fee line. And then you see distribution expenses lower as they start to impact those funds. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Todd Gibbons : And Ken, I will add a little bit to that. It\u2019s important to note the difference between prime and government funds. So, the yield in prime funds is can certainly support the fees. Initially, there was avoidance of client funds. And we are starting to see some investors come back to them. So that could have an impact that would neutralize some of it. And Mike\u2019s point is there is going to be enough yield in assets and government funds to generate the fees and the huge amount of issuance in T-bills has kind of surprised just a little bit and put a little bit of yield into that, but that can\u2019t be certain that could come down again. Ken Usdin : Got it. And just to follow-up on the cost side obviously you are adjusting to try to keep costs flat in this environment, can you just talk a little bit more about what do you shift, is it \u2013 do you push out some investment spend, is it incentive comp adjustment, what are the ins and outs of your ability to hold the line there that you are tempting to do? Thanks guys and best of luck, Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thank you. Mike, you want to take that? Mike Santomassino : Yes. We haven\u2019t seen \u2013 so first, we haven\u2019t really seen any impact on our most important investment. As you sort of look at the investment portfolio and you get deeper into the list, there is always opportunity to sort of reprioritize the timing of some of those things. And so we are doing that. You are going to see update the obvious, but you are going to see lower travel and business development costs that will be part of it. Although Todd said we are not going to have any restructuring or layoffs through the rest of the year. We were also putting a lot of discipline around new hires that we are bringing in during this environment so I think it is a multitude of factors that you highlighted that help us have the confidence to get there. Ken Usdin : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. We will next move to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning and also congrats Todd. Good to see you get the new role to start with maybe Todd. Thanks Mike for giving us pretty good outlook for the activity levels bringing into the second quarter but Todd may be you can give us some prospective on what you can see for the rest of the year obviously extremely difficult to predict but with the government intervention and we uncertainty though to have to the path to recovery how are you seeing that potentially impact some of the key business lines in activity and also comments on the back step on the Fed on prime money funds, to the extent you can get much more confidence in people investing in prime funds transition government? Mike Santomassino : Yes. Well first of all as I mentioned we are seeing a little of that so we are seeing a little bit of positive flows into the prime funds. But if you look at activity levels we would expect them to obviously come down from the surge that we saw towards the end of March but probably be elevated and again anything we see there is just so much uncertainty the environment and situation that we faced and it is really hard for us to look out long term until we get on the other side of this of the health crisis but that being said we wouldn\u2019t expect to stay at the extraordinary high levels that we saw in March we see exception perhaps of our clearing and collateral management business just because there is going to be so much debt issuance but in the rest of our businesses the transaction volumes component of Pershing business the same thing in asset servicing we would expect that to moderate just about under any circumstances unless we just saw another couple of blips and more of what I call a see-saw activity that could take place over the remainder of the year. Brian Bedell : And then the organic growth efforts that you're doing as well, like in deposit gathering and in collateral management is that on track or is that sort of suspended in this environment? Mike Santomassino : Yes I would say if you look at the organic growth especially around the deposits I mean we had we have seen some positive there obviously there were surge deposits that are just going to be associated with this interest rate environment and this financial environment but when we look at other businesses we have room to gain some market share I think we have done that in our payments business we had some good wins in the first quarter and our asset servicing business I would expect under this environment people are probably going to slow down making a whole lot of transitions we have got a healthy pipeline both in our asset servicing and Pershing business I am not sure a lot of people are going to make a whole lot of change we are seeing some new point complexes come on we were also seeing some being differed. Brian Bedell : Great. That's helpful. And then Mike, just real quick on NII outlook into the second quarter, does that exclude FX hedging activity? Mike Santomassino : Yes I mean not affected but the hedging activity is hard to predict because it's at a point of time at the end of the quarter so we are not making assumption in a way on that at this point Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks so much taking the questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will next go to the line of Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. Good morning. Congrats, Todd. Quick question on Pershing kind of what you've been seeing with all of the changes going on in the industry and kind of what that means for the pipeline form that business does it help or is it too early to say at this point of time? Todd Gibbons : Yes I will make a couple of comments and Mike can add some color. First of all, I think it\u2019s a little early to say Pershing has a different model and I think clients are quite interested in seeing a more open architected approach to what some of the competitors are doing so I think the conversations are quite healthy there. I think the pipeline continues to be strong. They have come out with a very competitive subscription price alternative to meet whatever the demand of that client base is. We are continuing to invest in our advisory services business. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is any significant impact that we are seeing from some of the consolidation elsewhere in the business other than it\u2019s making us a little bit more of a differentiated alternative. I would also mention that Pershing did quite well through the crisis, so I was able to keep its technology up and running and accommodate the surge in the growth which in some instances we point out was 3x to 4x. I don\u2019t know Mike do you have anything to add to that? Mike Santomassino : And then I would just say probably more broadly outside of just Pershing, I think we are seeing the benefits of lot of the investments we have been making over the last couple of years. And I think clients are seeing that as well and though anecdotally we heard from a client that just we brought on to our middle office service late last year saying I am not sure how I could have done this without you and couldn\u2019t have dealt with all of the increase in the volatility on my own. And so I think we are seeing that sentiment really across \u2013 more broadly across the client base. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then just a separate question on those deposits that you saw come in, in surge in March, they are rolling off the balance sheet now, are those going more so into your own liquidity products and that\u2019s been factored into the few waivers that you gave in the second quarter, are they just rolling off completely? Todd Gibbons : Well, I take that one and then Mike can jump in. If you think about what happened in the ecosystem so when there was a lot of draws for example under these commitments around the country, a lot of that cash had to go somewhere, some of it was deposited back at banks, lot of it went into government funds. Initially, government funds had nowhere to invest. So, a lot of that ended up in the money-market funds where we were the custodians and we saw that big spike perhaps now as lot of that spike has normalized itself out as there are other alternative investments for those government funds. Some of those were our own money market funds and some of them were competitor money market funds. I think that\u2019s the biggest most volatile component of the cash that we saw move. Brian Kleinhanzl : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question goes to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. So, I guess you are positioning 169x your level of charge-offs. I only bring that up because what sort of economic scenario are you assuming in taking those provisions? Todd Gibbons : Mike? Mike Santomassino : Yes. Mike, I as said earlier, we are using multiple, many scenarios to sort of go in sort of thinking about what the ultimate reserving looks like, but it\u2019s a scenario where you don\u2019t see a meaningful sort of uplift or doesn\u2019t fully recover until you are into the middle of next year. So you start a recovery in the latter part of the year and it doesn\u2019t fully recover until later in 2021. As I said earlier as well, only a small portion of the reserve is related to either actual borrower downgrades or the increase in the loan portfolio, the remainder of it is related to the changing economic environment and the way that flows through the new accounting standard. Mike Mayo : I guess so what I am getting to is its not just unique to you, it\u2019s the industry. So it seems like you are planning for kind of a U recovery, but you have an infrastructure for a V recovery like here, you are retaining your employees, your expenses should be kind of flat this year. I am going to guess you are not changing tech spending, but I am not sure if that\u2019s correct. So help me reconcile keeping an infrastructure for a V recovery while your underlying premise is for a V recovery? Todd Gibbons : You want to take that, Mike? You only take it. Mike Santomassino : You go ahead and start. Todd Gibbons : Okay. Yes, well why don\u2019t I start? So, we did give guidance and might give guidance and we do expect expenses might be lower than they otherwise would have been. We think that having the human resources here is the right thing to do not only for them but also to position ourselves well to service our client\u2019s through this kind of an environment trying to make any significant changes just wouldn\u2019t be particularly prudent on our part that being said we are controlling other components of our costs we want to continue to make the investments in technology that can I am sure some of that will be delayed and could be somewhat different prioritization but we are going to keep it very close eye on our expenses we think we can do a little bit better than the guidance that we had previously given for a number of reasons and we are talking about a U shape type of recovery which means you do need those resources to continue to support our people in this kind of an environment. Mike Mayo : And just last follow-up then, just on the tech spending so you expect some delay or like what was your tech spending going to be what would be now or how should we think about that part? Todd Gibbons : Yes we are committed to continue with the spend that we have gotten and that\u2019s what we have indicated I am certain that a couple of things might end of being delayed a bit but I am not going to pull that out of our plans at this point time by any means. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will next go to Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Great, thanks. Thanks for taking the question and to echo everybody\u2019s comments, congratulations to Todd. Question for you guys with respect to just broader a liquidity in the system clearly there has been a tremendous amount of cash flows coming through the side lines and that supposed to that's both the Fed action as well as the general risk call backdrop how should we think about BK\u2019s ability to sort of absorb these deposits so changes to spot SLR definitely help but there is lots of other considerations so kind of help us think through the ramifications of this a little bit longer term and how the balance sheet could ultimately be in terms of size beyond the first quarter? Todd Gibbons : Okay Mike you want to take that? Mike Santomassino : Yes I think the SLR change is sort of helpful that is out there but I think as you sort of look at our constrains balance sheets its been on Tier 1 leverage based on the overall size of the balance sheet and I think we have been able to sort of work through that with our client\u2019s pretty effectively so far and as Todd said the environment normalizes a bit for the money funds and the rate environments sort of settle down we have seen those real surge balances come off and so our expectation as they normalize more is that the balance sheet will either sort of hold steady or sort of come down from where we are right now and so we feel like we can sort of walk through that pretty effectively with the current capital that we got. Alexander Blostein : Got it. Thanks for that. And then just a couple of cleanups around NIR, can you help quantify the hedging benefits in the quarter I know it hits an IR and shows up in FX. So just to clean that up so any sense of new money yield on the fixed portion on the securities portfolio as that matures and gets reinvested just trying to get a sense of the headwind to NIR beyond the second quarter on that fixed sale of the portfolio? Thanks. Todd Gibbons : Sure. I think the first piece on the heading benefit so this is kind of really sort of simple we have interest rates swaps in the portfolio in the way they are valued every day sort of creates some basis risk between OIS and LIBOR. And really, all we're doing is sort of hedging that basic risk that\u2019s created from the interest rate swaps and that impact for the quarter is based on where it all ends up on the day one day at the end of the quarter so there is really nothing else sort of happening there and you can kind of see the relative impact on the slide in the presentation so it is a hard thing to sort of predict in terms of where it is going to end up at the end of the quarter. As we sort of think about the securities portfolio I mean you can kind of see where rates are right now as you sort of think about both the fixed rate and the floating rate piece of the portfolio. And I think as we sort of look at our investments strategy going forward we are doing whatever we can try to get some yield out of it. And I think the reinvestment rates are down from what you saw obviously in the second quarter. But just a reminder, the overall duration of the portfolio just a couple of years, right, so we are not buying a lot of 30-year treasuries as we sort of think about this portfolio. And I think we are doing our best to try to keep that spread up as best as we can within the risk appetite we are in. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks very much. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Thank you. And gentlemen, we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Todd Gibbons for any additional or closing remarks. Todd Gibbons : Okay. Thanks, Derrick and thanks everybody for your interest in our company and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s conference call webcast. A replay of this conference call webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 o\u2019clock p.m. Eastern Standard Time today. Thank you. Have a good day.",

Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon\u2019s Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Magda Palczynska : Good morning. Today, BNY Mellon released its results for the second quarter of 2020. The earnings press release and the financial highlights presentation to accompany this call are both available on our website at bnymellon.com. Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon\u2019s CEO will lead the call. Then Mike Santomassimo, our CFO, will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Mike\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session. As a reminder, please limit yourself to two questions. Before we begin, please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC, all available on our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July 15, 2020 and will not be updated. With that, I will hand over to Todd. Thomas Gibbons : Thank you, Magda, and good morning, everyone. Before diving into the numbers, let me share a few thoughts on how our business has been performing as we\u2019ve adapted to a new normal during the second quarter. Volumes and volatility normalized somewhat across our businesses from the extreme first quarter disruption. And conversations with clients have shifted from dealing with the crisis to how we can help support their business in this new environment. But much uncertainty remains over the timing and shape of the global economic recovery. In addition, the low interest rate policy is a significant headwind for us that is unlikely to change in the near-term. Operationally, we continue to navigate the repercussions of the pandemic. Around 95% of our employees continue to work remotely, doing a phenomenal job delivering excellent service to our clients. Our operating platforms and infrastructures are supporting the current market working model well with record volumes in certain areas, all of which has put us in a good position as we discuss new business opportunities with our clients. Turning to our second quarter financial results. We reported solid pre-tax income of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.01. As a reminder, we did not buy back shares in the second quarter in line with other big banks. We accreted capital and ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.6%, up around 120 basis points from the last quarter. Our average balance sheet increased year-over-year to $415 billion, mainly driven by strong deposit inflows and associated growth in the securities portfolio. Revenue was up 2% despite the impact of lower interest rates and related money market fee waivers. All of our Investment Service businesses showed resilient performance. Asset Servicing, in particular, is showing nice pockets of growth, and our focus on service quality is paying off. The challenges that asset managers are dealing with are driving more of them to outsource, and our unique capabilities in fund accounting and transfer agencies, as well as investments we\u2019ve made in building out our digital and data capabilities positions us well. Last month, more than 800 attendees, representing over 160 client firms and 25 consulting firms and vendors that we work closely with participated in our virtual ENGAGE20 event. ENGAGE, which has long been the premier data and technology conference for buy-side investment managers, highlights next-generation cloud-first business applications. During the event, we announced the launch of our new data and analytics offerings and expanded relationship with Microsoft to provide these solutions on the Microsoft Azure Public Cloud. We are pleased to have clients such as Charles Schwab and Nuveen share case studies on how the businesses will benefit from our newest offerings. Those include a new cloud-based data vault that supports the rapid onboarding of data, whether public markets data, private proprietary or unstructured data to offer greater flexibility and accelerate client innovation and discovery. We also released our new ESG application, which supports the creation of investment portfolios customized to individual clients\u2019 environmental, social and governance preferences and provide crowdsourced guidance around the preferred ESG factors and priorities. And our distribution analytics application, which builds upon our intermediary analytics service, leveraging data from broker dealers and RIAs to predict the drivers of demand for mutual funds and ETFs, so they can identify how to successfully gain market share. And across all our businesses, there are opportunities to capture greater market share within products, services, target client segments and markets. Much of this is the outcome of consistently investing in technology and talent. There has been an acceleration this year in the adoption of digital solutions by our clients who continue to review opportunities to automate. The progress we\u2019re making in digitizing our business positions us well on this front, and we\u2019re increasing our investment spend on technology-driven automation initiatives in 2020. In March through June alone, we migrated over 100 clients to digital solutions and are accelerating our plans to do the same across all of our asset servicing clients. We are now accepting digital signatures on many tax-related forms to support remote processing. Digitizing these processes will help thousands of clients and reduce the millions of physical documents we deal with each year. We also developed a new API enabled FX solution jointly with Deutsche Bank that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging market currency trades to provide front office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency. So we\u2019ve accelerated our progress on the digital front, and there are dozens of other examples. I\u2019m proud that we\u2019ve been working with the regulators and the industry to bring our capabilities in supporting the markets. Since the last quarter, we\u2019ve been administering the primary dealer credit facility which facilitate dealers\u2019 inventory financing. Our Corporate Trust business has also been mandated as the term asset-backed securities loan facility administrator, and we\u2019re also servicing CALF [ph] funds in Asset Servicing. Additionally, we\u2019re playing an important role in the Fed support of liquidity in the municipal markets via the municipal liquidity facility. This one is a demonstration of the power of our uniquely broad range of solutions. We\u2019re able to bring together the expertise from Asset Servicing, Corporate Trust, Investment Management and Capital Markets to create a complex solution to support the facility. Looking ahead to the second-half of 2020, we are confident that our business model, expense control and conservative credit risk profile will serve us well. Our efforts with clients are yielding results with higher win ratios, better revenue retention at a good pipeline in Pershing and Asset Servicing, in particular. We are pleased with the momentum we are seeing across all of our businesses. The low interest rate environment will present a significant challenge, both through net interest revenue and money market fee waivers in Pershing and Investment Management and to a lesser extent, other Investment Services businesses. But at the same time, we will benefit from increases in transaction volumes, FX volatility, stronger market levels and activity in our clearance and collateral management business. The recent DFAST and CCAR results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model. We had the lowest peak to trough reduction in CET1 capital under the Fed\u2019s model relative to other U.S.-based G-SIB\u2019s at just 20 basis points. Now that\u2019s well below the minimum SCB requirement. Looking ahead at our capital returns, we expect to maintain our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.31 and we will not buy back shares during the third quarter. We have a very strong capital position and low-risk model that should allow us to reform well under a wide range of scenarios. We will commence buybacks as soon as possible, depending on the economic and regulatory environment, our outlook for the business and outcome of the resubmitted capital plans based on new scenarios we expect to receive later this year. In the second quarter, we opportunistically issued $1 billion in preferred stock, and we think this gives us opportunity to restack our capital down the road. Longer-term, our growth is not dependent on increasing risk-weighted assets, which gives us the ability to return at least 100% of capital to shareholders and we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue returning attractive levels of capital. And while the outlook for the economy remains uncertain for the foreseeable future, I know that we will continue to navigate this environment well by deepening our client engagement as demand for our service grows, benefiting from improving quality and improving efficiency of our operations. Last week, we announced that with the upcoming retirement of Mitchell Harris, we\u2019ve elevated Hanneke Smits to CEO of Investment Management effective October 1. Hanneke has been leading Newton Investment Management since 2016 and has spearheaded Newton\u2019s business momentum and client-centric culture. Under Mitchell\u2019s leadership, we made great progress in building a diversified Investment Management business, and we thank him for that. As we move forward, Hanneke is ideally suited to build on the strong foundation to continue to drive performance and innovation across our investment products. Catherine Keating will continue in her role as CEO of BNY Mellon Wealth Management, and both Catherine and Hanneke will report directly to me. Mitchell has cultivated a strong bench of leaders, including Hanneke and Catherine, who will continue to drive the execution of our strategic priorities to deliver leading investment solutions to our clients, underpinned by exceptional investment performance. Now before I hand it over to Mike, let me address how we\u2019ve been responding to recent events that have drawn attention to the very real racial and societal issues in our communities. Our Board and our Executive Committee are passionate about using our voices and being positive change agents. As a company, we take great pride in all of our differences and our diversity of experiences and perspectives leads to better business outcome. That starts with the diversity of our Board, which is 30% African/American, 40% minorities and 30% female. We are challenging ourselves to do more. We\u2019re supporting activities that create sustainable change, including philanthropy targeted at creating opportunity, matching employee donations to nonprofits that support and strengthen the well-being of underrepresented communities, encouraging community volunteerism, doing pro bono legal work to advance minority businesses, raising cultural awareness and strengthening our commitment to attract, develop and retain a diverse workforce. We are holding more open forums that foster meaningful dialog and that we hope will bring us closer together during these challenging times. We\u2019re learning from each other, building empathy and strengthening inclusive leadership skills that will serve us well and continuing to drive a high-performance culture. We are expanding support for the well-being and emotional resilience of our people and their families with additional employer services, resources and coaches who have cultural confidence. We know these efforts, like all the other components of our corporate social responsibility strategy, are making us a stronger company. Last week, we released our 2019 CSR report, which introduces our new strategy pillars with associated goals and key performance indicators for the next five years. They include increasing senior leadership positions held by women and ethnically and racially diverse employees. While we\u2019re proud that for the sixth consecutive year we\u2019ve been named to the Dow Jones Sustainable World Index, we\u2019re going to continue to challenge ourselves to do more. In the long run, we firmly believe that doing what\u2019s right for the community, our employees and our clients is in the best interest of our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Let me run through the details of our results for the quarter. And all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless I specify otherwise. Beginning on Page 3 of the financial highlights document. In the second quarter of 2020, we reported earnings of $901 million, down 7%, while earnings per share was flat at $1.01. Total revenue was $4 billion, up 2% even as we felt the impact of lower interest rates through money market fee waivers and in our net interest income. Fee revenue increased 2%, primarily reflecting higher fees in Pershing and Asset Servicing, partially offset by money market fee waivers, lower Investment Management fees and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Fee waivers negatively impacted growth by approximately 3%. Net interest revenue declined 3% year-over-year to $780 million and was down 4% versus the prior quarter. Our provision for credit losses was $143 million in the quarter, and this was primarily driven by ratings downgrades, particularly across our commercial real estate book and the continuation of a challenging macroeconomic outlook. We had no actual charge-offs during the quarter. Expenses were up approximately 1%, as we continue to balance our ongoing expense discipline with our technology investments and we still expect full-year expenses to be flat to last year. We had a solid return on tangible equity of 19% and maintained a pre-tax margin of over 29%. Now moving to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above internal targets and regulatory minimums. In terms of shareholder capital returns, in the second quarter, we suspended share repurchases, along with other financial services for our member banks, and we\u2019ll do so again in the third quarter in line with federal reserve requirements. We continue to pay our quarterly cash dividend, which totaled $278 million in the second quarter and believe we have ample capacity to continue to pay the dividend in a variety of economic scenarios. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $20 billion at June 30 and our CET1 ratio was 12.6% under the advanced approach and 12.7% under the standardized approach. Under the new stress capital buffer rules that will become effective October 1, we will need to maintain a CET1 ratio of 8.5%, including a 2.5% stress capital buffer, which is the minimum and a 1.5% G-SIB surcharge. Now, as we think about our binding capital ratio constraint going forward, Tier 1 leverage can be more binding than CET1 due to the buffers we need to hold for potential growth in deposits, which are more volatile than RWA during times of market volatility, very much like what we\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters. As always, we will continue to optimize our capital ratios across all the constraints. Our average LCR in the second quarter was 112%. Now turning to Page 5. My comments on interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes. Net interest revenue was $780 million, down 4%. While client-driven deposit growth drove the increase in our average balance sheet, this benefit was more than offset by a full quarter impact of lower interest rates. Hedging activity added modestly to the linked-quarter comparison, as you can see in the bar chart, and is primarily offset in foreign exchange and other trading fees. Average deposit balances were up $25 billion versus the first quarter averages and are up $62 billion, or 28% versus last year. This growth is across all of our businesses, some increasing from the monetary reserves in the system, clients like to cash in some internal deposit initiatives that are linked to operational and fee-generating activities. As we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we generate and manage significant amounts of cash across our franchise. This is a key client differentiator for us, particularly in volatile markets. We provide cash management services that have led to good growth in deposits in our balance sheet, growth in money market funds in our open architecture money market investment platform and through drive this cash products. We\u2019ve passed along the Fed rate cuts, as interest-bearing deposit rates declined to minus 3 basis points in the second quarter. This was the result of a combination of very low rates paid in the U.S., plus negative rates on euro-denominated deposits. As a reminder, approximately 25% of our deposits are non-U.S. dollar. On average, the securities portfolio increased approximately $19 billion versus the first quarter and around $32 billion from the last year, as we have deployed the growing deposit base. The net interest margin of 88 basis points was down 13 basis points versus the first quarter, driven by the increase in deposits and lower yielding, low-risk interest-earning assets. We continue to focus on optimizing net interest revenue rather than just net interest margin. Now moving to Page 6, which provides some color on our asset mix. Our average interest earning assets increased to $358 billion. Approximately 40% of these assets are held in cash or reverse repos, while 43% are in our securities portfolio and 16% in our loan portfolio. In addition to the funded loan shown on the page, we also have unfunded committed lines, the details of which can be found in the 10-Q. During the quarter, we saw about $1 billion of the $3 billion of borrowings drawn down from revolving credit facilities repaid, and we\u2019re closely monitoring the portfolio, particularly the commercial real estate exposure and other sectors more acutely impacted by the current environment. The impact of credits, including commercial real estate, are performing well, but may see additional downgrades depending on the shape and speed of the recovery. Turning to the securities portfolio. We have a high-quality liquid portfolio, much of it is in U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasuries and sovereign debt. The portfolio increased as we deployed more cash in the securities, including the commercial paper and CDs repurchased from our affiliated and third-party money market funds. The $4 billion of CLOs are highly rated with 99% AAA or AA, 100% of the non-agency CMBS are AAA and have solid subordination. The rest of the ratings breakdown can be found in the supplement. Page 7 provides an overview on expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $2.7 billion were up around 1%, driven by higher technology expenses and pension costs, offset by lower business development expenses, namely travel and marketing, and the favorable impact of stronger U.S. dollar. Distribution expenses were only slightly impacted by money market fee waivers in Investment Management, as the bulk of the impact from money market fee waivers in \u2013 was in Pershing and from third-party funds. Turning to Page 8. Total Investment Services revenue was up 3%. Assets under custody and administration increased 5% year-over-year to $37.3 trillion, primarily reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of stronger U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange and other trading revenue in the segment increased 16% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher volatility, as well as organic volume growth and foreign exchange even as industry volumes were down slightly. Within Asset Servicing, revenue was up 5% to $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting higher FX, higher client volumes across securities lending, liquidity services and transaction volumes, as well as a one-time fee. Securities lending revenues were higher on improved spreads and a strong demand for U.S. government bonds. In Pershing, revenue was up 1% to $578 million, despite the impact of money market fee waivers, reflecting much higher money market fund balances, which were up 40% and higher transaction volumes, but down from the exceptional volumes we experienced in the first quarter. The net impact of money market fee waivers, partially offset by higher money market fund balances negatively impacted Pershing\u2019s revenue growth by 3%. Issuer Services revenue decreased 3% to $431 million, reflecting declines in both Corporate Trust and Depository Receipts revenue. Depository Receipts revenue was primarily impacted by lower corporate action volumes, while in Corporate Trust, new business and deposit growth was offset by lower volumes in some products and interest rates. Treasury Services revenue was up 7% to $340 million, driven by higher liquidity balances and related fees, offset by lower payment volumes correlated to lower economic activity. Deposit balances increased year-on-year by 40%, as investments in new capabilities and increased focus on deposit gathering were critical to retaining most of the growth from earlier in the year. Clearance and Collateral Management revenues were up 4% to $295 million from higher clearance volumes, mostly from non-U.S. clients, as well as fees and deposit balances. Average tri-party collateral management balances were up 4% in the U.S. and 9% outside the U.S. Page 9 summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our Investment Services businesses. Now turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 10. Total investment in Wealth Management revenue was down 3%. Investment Management revenue was roughly flat to $621 million, reflecting the unfavorable change in the mix of assets under management since the second quarter of 2019 and the impact of money market fee waivers, partially offset by equity investment gains net of hedges, including seed capital. Please note the gains from seed capital include results from unconsolidated and consolidated investment management funds, both of which can be lumpy in any given quarter depending on market conditions. Details can be found in the supplement. On the consolidated income statement, the gains are either in investment and other income or income from consolidated investment management funds, while the negative impact from their hedging were approximately $30 million as recorded in other trading. We had inflows of $20 billion in the quarter, reflecting continued cash inflows, as well as long-term flows into index funds and fixed income. Overall, assets under management of just under $2 trillion are up 6% year-over-year, primarily due to higher markets and cash inflows. Wealth Management revenue was down 9% year-over-year to $265 million, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue due to lower interest rates and client migration to lower fee fixed income and cash products. Now a few comments about the third quarter. First, I would caution you as we did last quarter that the environment remains fluid and variables are changing quickly. Looking ahead at net interest revenue, we will have a full quarter of lower rates in the third quarter, especially short-term LIBOR rates, which declined throughout the second quarter. We have also seen some pickup in prepayments fees in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio, given current and expected refinancing volumes. Significant excess liquidity in the system continues to drive elevated deposit levels versus 2019, but the exit rate from Q2 is just a little lower than the average for the quarter. And as a result, we currently expect net interest revenue to decline 8% to 11% sequentially. However, based on current market conditions, we would expect net interest revenue to begin to stabilize in the third quarter. Now on money market fee waivers, the pre-tax impact in the second quarter was $18 million net of distribution expense, with the biggest impact in Pershing. It\u2019s important to note that the big \u2013 that approximately $50 million of this impact has been offset by a substantial increase in money market fund balances, resulting in a net impact of approximately $30 million in the second quarter. We expect the impact from fee waivers to increase in the third quarter by about $30 million to $45 million net of lower distribution expenses. This additional impact in the third quarter would also be reduced if money market fund balances continue to grow. A little over half of that impact will be in Pershing, with the rest of the Investment Management and Asset Servicing. We currently expect that we will incur an incremental $25 million in the fourth quarter and will be at a full run rate impact from fee waivers of about $135 million to $150 million, offset by the incremental money market fund balance growth that we\u2019ve seen in the second quarter for a net impact of about $85 million to $100 million per quarter by year-end. This quarterly impact could be reduced if money market fund balances continue to grow further. Current equity market levels should be a modest positive if they hold. We saw transactional activity in FX continue to normalize over the course of the second quarter, assuming this continues it will be modest headwind sequentially, although, we expect the related dues will be higher than in the prior year. If we see some volatility in the equity markets, transactional activity could pick up. On expenses, we will expect them to be flat versus 2019, excluding notable items. This includes the 50 basis point full year-over-year impact from higher pension expenses. Credit costs will be highly dependent upon individual credits, the future path of the health crisis and how the economic forecasts change by the time we get to the end of the third quarter. In terms of our effective tax rate, while it was a little lower this quarter, we expect it to be approximately 20% for the full-year versus prior guidance of 20% to 21%. With that, operator, can we please open the lines up for questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time this morning. A couple of questions. One, Todd, you mentioned the virtual presentation that you gave or the virtual conference that you gave. And I wanted to understand how important that is for generating new client activity? And if you think that, that virtual kind of format and forum can deliver the same kind of client activity growth that you\u2019ve seen in prior years once face-to-face? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. First of all, in terms of engaging with our clients, it\u2019s been pretty effective. I think, initially, I think, there was a little reticence as we moved into the crisis, but now we basically see this as our BAU. And so both clients and I think ourselves have gotten quite a bit better at managing the technology to actually communicate and connect and share with what we\u2019re doing. So this particular conference, where we had about 1,000 clients and vendors come into it was \u2013 we also posted on our website a whole series of detailed analysis of some of the new capabilities that are out there and available to them. And the hits against that have been very high. So I think it\u2019s been pretty effective. We\u2019ve actually seen the pipeline grow. We\u2019ve also seen retention high and actually sales are up in the first-half of the year over where we were last year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then, Mike, on the guidance, could we just dig in a little bit on the NII commentary that you gave? I think, you said NII down 8% to 11%, maybe just give us some color on the drivers there? And is it \u2013 and why do you see it ameliorating as you go into 3Q and 4Q? And if you could give us a sense of the differences in the drivers between deposit growth and yield compression, that would be helpful? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, sure. Thanks, Betsy. So I think when you look at the third quarter, it\u2019s really all about low rates coming down and getting the full impact of that for the full quarter, that\u2019s really the primary driver. And there\u2019s a series of actions that, I think, you can see that we\u2019re taking in the results, both in increasing the securities portfolio and optimizing sort of how we\u2019re investing there. And so I think, as you sort of look out past the third quarter, and you look at all the actions we\u2019re taking, plus you look at where the forward curves are, that gives us some confidence that it begins to stabilize in the third quarter as we look forward. And obviously, the forward view on deposits will sort of have some impact on that, but the marginal dollar gets a little less impactful with rates where they are, so. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the rate impact. We used to think an anchor might be the 2015 NIM low, but I guess, I appreciate the long end has come down more than it was then. You mentioned focusing on NII over net interest margin, so I guess, there could be more down there. So my quickie is, deposits sticking around despite the interest-bearing deposit rate being minus 3 basis points. I\u2019m curious to hear any color on client conversations there. And if that\u2019s now at its resting point, or is there more room on the negative sides as clients park and have no other alternative? Thomas Gibbons : Mike, why don\u2019t I start that one and then you can probably give a little bit of color? I think that we\u2019re, again, the mix of deposits makes a big impact, Glenn, on that rate. So there are a fair amount of foreign deposits and European deposits that are actually carrying a negative rate, and we pass that through to the clients. In the U.S. with the IOER around 10 basis points, that seems to be anchoring somewhat around that rate unless we see changes going on in the money markets, which we haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of noise yet. So I think, most of the downside pass-through has already been made. I don\u2019t know, Mike, if you have anything to add to that? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. No, I think that\u2019s right. I mean, I think, the negative is really driven by euros, as Todd said, Glenn. And when you look at the U.S. dollar deposits, it\u2019s a low single-digit sort of interest rate paid now on the book. And so there\u2019s not a lot of room to continue to bring that down. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. One qualifier on the provision. Obviously, we\u2019re riding to a worse economic backdrop, but you also mentioned the impact that downgrades have. So I \u2013 my question is, if we move forward and the economic scenarios don\u2019t change, in other words, we feel like we\u2019re kind of where we\u2019re at. Will further downgrades keep \u2013 continue to be the gift that keeps giving on the provision? We\u2019re just trying to dimensionalize how much to bake in if the economic scenarios doesn\u2019t change? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I think that\u2019s a\u2026 Thomas Gibbons : Okay. Mike, can you take that? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Sure, Todd. So, Glenn, it\u2019s a tough question to ask, right? And so if things don\u2019t get worse from what is being projected now in the scenarios, then you would expect that the issuer downgrades should be somewhat limited from here, but there will be idiosyncratic issues that may change some of that. So I think, obviously, these \u2013 the downgrades and the scenarios are somewhat inter \u2013 interrelated as we sort of look at both of them. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Mike, just a follow-up on the fee waiver commentary. Just wanted to make sure that we\u2019re talking about it the right way in terms of the total number versus the growth. So are you saying that you\u2019d expect that growth to continue when you gave us the two sets of numbers, so just the cadence going forward? I guess, maybe if you can just help us understand the net trajectory from here would be the better way, I think, to help us think through that? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. No, no, sure. I know \u2013 and I can appreciate, it\u2019s probably a little complicated. But \u2013 so as you sort of look at the net impact of $80 million to $100 million by the time we get to year-end, underpinning that assumes that balances hold to about where they are. So it does not assume that there\u2019s additional growth there. And so, I think, if we do continue to see growth in the balances, we will see that can offset a bit as we look towards the end of the year. Ken Usdin : Okay. So right, that net number, the $80 million to $100 million minus the $50 million from growth that assumes the balances are flat from here. Okay. Geographically, a couple of quick things. Could you just help us understand the size of the one-time gain in Asset Servicing? And then just can you talk through the just the income statement line Asset Servicing just what\u2019s happening underneath the surface there in terms of core servicing collateral and broker dealer services? Thanks, Mike. Thomas Gibbons : Mike, why don\u2019t you take that one? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, sure. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. So the one-time fee, Ken, is actually in other income, it\u2019s not in the Asset Servicing fee line. It\u2019s not something we have disclosed exactly what it is. It\u2019s not super meaningful, but it does show up in the other income lines. So it does impact your fee \u2013 your Asset Servicing fees at all. As you sort of look at what\u2019s underneath Asset Servicing and the fee line, I think, you\u2019re seeing growth in both the Clearance & Collateral Management business and the Asset Servicing business, as sort of Todd pointed out, the different drivers there that are sort of impacting that line. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Can you just go through one more on the fee waivers? Can we track the level of money market fund balances? I appreciate, obviously, there\u2019s assets funds in Asset Management business, but it\u2019s also a number of third-party funds on the Pershing platform. So I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got that disclosed for the level of those balances, and if it\u2019s something that we can track given the Pershing side, I don\u2019t think we can see? Thomas Gibbons : Mike, can you take that one? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, sure. And, Brian, there\u2019s actually a couple of drivers underneath the fund balances. One, we\u2019re obviously seeing in Pershing, that\u2019s not something that we disclose. And two, we\u2019re also seeing it growth in Asset Servicing as well, where we sweep money into money market funds through our open architecture platforms there [indiscernible] are, but also a bunch of other complexes. Those two numbers are not something that we disclose. So we\u2019ve seen growth across the platform. We\u2019ve seen growth really in all channels. Brian Bedell : Right. So you could have an organic growth dynamic in this, that\u2019s different than the money market fund industry at large that could keep that \u2013 the fee waivers closer or even less than $85 million to $100 million. Is that a feasible conclusion? Michael Santomassimo : Potentially. Yes, potentially. Brian Bedell : Okay. And then just \u2013 maybe just to talk on the new business and asset servicing. Todd, you mentioned a lot of initiatives, partly from the tech investments on the data bulk and also the distribution analytic system. Anyway to frame what type of or what level of new business do you think you\u2019re getting from these initiatives in, say, in the next or what you expect in the next six months or so? And any kind of revenue impact or growth impact to asset servicing you think as a result of these initiatives? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. I think, first of all, some of these are very new and some of the applications that we\u2019ve just put out there, we\u2019ve just gone live in the past month or so. Brian Bedell : Okay. Thomas Gibbons : So our estimates is that, we could see some meaningful growth driven by the data and the digital and data analytics that we \u2013 that we\u2019re offering that we talked about. So it\u2019s just now gathering momentum. There is a lot of discussions and \u2013 but it\u2019s early. We\u2019ve got a couple of beta clients on it that we described and they actually participated in the ENGAGE Conference, both Charles Schwab and Nuveen. But I think underlying that, if you look at the \u2013 if you look at our pipeline, if you look at the growth rates that we\u2019ve demonstrated, we are seeing a little bit of organic growth for the first time in a while. Brian Bedell : Okay. Okay, great. I\u2019ll get back in the queue for another question. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So a couple of quick follow-ups, I guess. First one is around NIR. So you guys talked about optimizing NIR off of sort of 3Q trough levels, which makes sense. Can you walk us through sort of the opportunities that you see to invest some of the excess cash that kind of compiled in the balance sheet into securities portfolio. So anything specifically you can point to in terms of how much could ultimately be moved to securities over time and sort of the yields you guys expect to earn on that? And then anything you guys could do on the liability side as well. So deposit costs will be kind of what they are with the market. But curious, if there\u2019s an opportunity to further restack long-term debt, so you guys do a little bit of that in the quarter? Thomas Gibbons : Mike? Michael Santomassimo : Sure. Yes, I\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019ll try to get all of those pieces, Alex, or remind me if I don\u2019t. So as you sort of \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll start with the last one first. So if you look at the liability side, we\u2019re always looking for ways to sort of optimize. As you said, deposit costs are probably near where they\u2019re going to bottom in the U.S., but on the margin, there may be a little bit here and there with particular clients. On the long-term debt side, we are looking at optimizing that more. I think, you\u2019ll see us kind of bring that down maybe just a little bit, as we sort of look forward over the next quarter. But I think, obviously, we need to keep enough long-term debt to meet a bunch of different constraints that we\u2019ve got, but we\u2019re \u2013 but I do think there\u2019s a little bit of opportunity to optimize that as we look forward. On the security side, you can see the increases over there sequentially and year-on-year are pretty significant in terms of what we\u2019ve been able to redeploy. The majority of that has gone into sort of highly liquid assets sort of HQLA as sort of the term goes, right? And I think, you\u2019ll see us continue to put more into HQLA assets, as well as look for opportunities where we can get the right risk profile and the right return for some less liquid assets as we sort of look forward. And as we sort of get more experience with the deposit base, and we\u2019ve been talking about this now for a couple of quarters. As we sort of see the behavior of the deposits come on to the balance sheet, each month every 30, 60, 90 days, you get a better sense of what the operational nature and the duration of those deposits are going to look like. And so you can sort of keep \u2013 you can keep optimizing how much you\u2019re going to deploy each month and each quarter as you look forward. And so we\u2019re doing that. So we still think there\u2019s some opportunity to continue to deploy more. Alexander Blostein : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then my second question is around the expense outlook. I think early in the quarter, you guys spoke at a conference and the outlook for expenses for 2020, I believe it was flat to down, and it sounds like it\u2019s flat now. So what\u2019s changed or could expenses still decline this year? And maybe just a quick reminder in terms of how much incremental tech spend is running through P&L in 2020, which part of that, I guess, is supposed to phase out into 2021? Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Okay. Mike, why don\u2019t I start with this and maybe you can add some additional color? I think we\u2019ve guided for a while that we\u2019ll be flat or around flat for the rest of the year. And I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll do that at least or better. And as we look out to next year, I think, we\u2019ve got significant opportunities around our efficiency programs, especially in operations. And the increased spend that we\u2019ve made over the past couple of years in tech will begin to abate, as the investments in infrastructure and resiliency will be largely behind us. So we think we\u2019ve got more that we can do here are looking out over the next year or two. Mike, you want to give a little more color around the tech spend? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Look, I think, as we\u2019ve talked about now in the last couple of years, we\u2019ve \u2013 as Todd said, we\u2019ve been making those investments in the operating platforms, as well as other capabilities, like we talked about, but with data and analytics and other new products across the different businesses. And I think the \u2013 while the growth rate has been slowing over the last year, I think, as Todd said, we\u2019ve got much more flexibility to sort of look at that as we sort of exit the year. The only other thing I\u2019d add is, we\u2019re seeing the benefit of the efficiencies come through. We\u2019re spending less in operations this year than we did last year. We\u2019re going to spend less next year than we did this year. And we feel very confident that we\u2019ve got line of sight to continue to execute on the efficiency agenda, as Todd mentioned. Alexander Blostein : Great. Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : And I think in 2020, Alex, I\u2019ll add to that, I think, we probably made the biggest spend that we\u2019ve made in tech in increasing efficiencies across the \u2013 operating efficiencies across the company. Alexander Blostein : Great. That makes sense. Thanks, again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Well, first, actually, I\u2019d like to just start with the request. The fee waiver dynamic is, there\u2019s a \u2013 it seems like there\u2019s a lot of moving parts just something to consider for coming quarters, maybe a little enhanced disclosure or maybe a memo disclosure. So we could try to consider how to model some of these components, given that there\u2019s balance movement and all this other stuff. I know it\u2019s probably tricky, but it might help. But taking a step back widening back the lens a little, we\u2019re clearly in a rate environment that\u2019s a lot more challenging for your business model. The idea that monetary policy, low rates as a monetary policy tool, this certainly seems to be now the new normal and it\u2019s not really a temporary thing that we\u2019re all dealing with here. Are you starting to think about different ways in which you can engage with your customer base different ways in which you can structure your relationships in the deposit dynamics, so you can have more confidence in the duration of the deposits? How are you making adjustments or how are you thinking about making adjustments to sort of the fundamental ways in which you engage with your customers, so you can ensure that you can monetize the components of the \u2013 of all these relationships in the most effective way, given low rates are going to be around for probably sometime? Thomas Gibbons : So, Mike, why don\u2019t I take that, and then I think you can add some color to it? So first of all, Brennan, the comments around the fee waivers, we\u2019ll take that to heart. But I want to make sure something is clear, because there might be a little confusion here. What we\u2019ve indicated is that, we think that the full impact of interest rates to our net interest income will begin to stabilize in the third quarter. And then \u2013 which is basically saying that we\u2019re coming out with approximately that run rate as we go forward. And that\u2019s taking into consideration what we know today with the shape of the yield curve. So we see some stability here as we reset around the very low interest rate environment as we fully reset around it. That same impact is going to be fully reset through fee waivers by the end of the year. And if you look at the disclosures that Mike had given you, it\u2019s very specific to what that is. We don\u2019t know what the actual balances are going to be. So if the balances grow, then that impact can be quite a bit less, because there\u2019ll be additional income related to money market balances. So I wanted to make that clear. In terms of how we\u2019re working with our clients and pricing, whether it\u2019s around \u2013 whether it\u2019s directly around deposit activity or Treasury Services, they\u2019re certainly taking the interest rate environment into consideration. And anytime we put together more of our platform business like an asset servicing, we take that into the pricing discussion, taking whatever market conditions would be a likely implication to our margins and that type of activity. So that \u2013 so we\u2019re doing that on a day-to-day basis. Mike, you have anything to add to that? Michael Santomassimo : No, I think, that\u2019s right. And we\u2019re continuing to have pretty close dialogue with a lot of the clients that have large or medium-sized sort of balances with us. And I think in part as you look at a business like Treasury Services, it\u2019s ensuring that we get our fair share of the payments business and the fee revenue that comes along with having these balances. And so I think, it\u2019s not only about optimizing sort of the reinvestment side of the balance sheet, it\u2019s also about making sure that we\u2019re monetizing the fee relationship with these clients as well. And that\u2019s as much a focus for us and our client and sales folks, as is the balance sheet side of it. Brennan Hawken : Yes. No, I appreciate that. And that\u2019s all very, very fair. When we think about capital, you flagged the strong showing of Bank of New York through the DFAST process. Can you talk about, like, clearly, you have a low-risk models clearly showcase during the DFAST. But because you\u2019re categorized as a G-SIB, you are now continue \u2013 you\u2019re constrained in the ability to return capital. And so even though you\u2019re pretty far above a lot of your requirements, you cannot manage the capital basis as much as you will. How are the engage \u2013 how\u2019s the engagement with the regulators as far as trying to point that out, are there \u2013 is there going to be a staggered start based upon risk \u2013 inherent risk in the business model, where the G-SIB\u2019s that are lower-risk should be able to start returning capital sooner? Or is this going to be one of these things that all the G-SIB\u2019s are lumped together? And therefore, firms that have really, really minimal credit risk profiles like BK end up at the same starting line as some of the big investment banks and commercial banks? Thomas Gibbons : So, Mike, I\u2019ll start with this one, too. So, I mean, as you know, the stress test is a idiosyncratic test for us. And so, as we go through it, we have performed quite well. We have submitted our capital action plans, and we have indicated that we will look \u2013 and we performed quite well. And now, there\u2019s going to be reevaluation using some new scenarios that were sometimes at the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarter. And so we\u2019ll go through that process. That being said, we expect to perform quite well, and just given the resiliency, as you pointed out, of our balance sheet and our business model. But one of the things that comes out of the news stress capital buffer, the SCB model is that, as you get a little more flexibility around buybacks, you don\u2019t have to \u2013 you\u2019re not limited on a quarterly basis, you just need to stay within your SCB. So there could be a timing difference based on whatever regulatory considerations or the environment might look like. But ultimately, as we accrete capital, that just puts us in a stronger position to buy it back when that \u2013 when the opportunity arises. So I like where we \u2013 I like the way we are accreting capital. And I think it puts us in a position to buy back a considerable amount of stock as soon as possible. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mike Carrier : Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. So first, I just want to try to understand the activity that has been COVID impacted and could normalize ahead. So any color on how much the deposit balance growth has been driven by some of the policy response we could normalize? And then you guys noted if new business wins, and that\u2019s an area that would have expected to be a bit more challenging just in this environment? And so have you seen much impact? And do you see like a pipeline forming up sequentially, start to normalize as we get back? Thomas Gibbons : So, Mike, can you clarify the first part of that question? I didn\u2019t quite catch it. Mike Carrier : Yes, sure. So, the first part was\u2026 Thomas Gibbons : [Multiple Speakers] Mike Carrier : Yes, sure. The first part was just on the growth and deposit balances. Yes, I know it\u2019s hard to determine exactly what drives some of those balances. But some firms have tried to quantify what\u2019s been kind of impacted by the the coronavirus and some of the policy responses versus what\u2019s more sort of core business operations? So that is the first part. And then the second part was just on the new business wins, what it expected that to be a little bit more challenging environment. But it seems like you continue to have some wins there. So just wanted to try to gauge how has that been impacted by this environment in terms of the pipeline? Thomas Gibbons : Okay. Mike, you want to take the deposit component of the question? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Sure, Mike. So as you sort of look at what\u2019s happened since the middle of March, what you saw was this massive increase. And if you recall what our spot balance was at the end of the first quarter was $337 billion in terms of deposits. And so that, that huge volatile piece of the deposit balance has come off already. And as you can see where we were for the quarter in the 280s in terms of the average. And so you\u2019ve already seen that sort of massive spike retreat. And so while it\u2019s \u2013 in hindsight, you\u2019ll have better view in terms of what\u2019s driven the increase from the February balances of around 230 to where we are today. But I think it\u2019s hard to ignore that the environment that\u2019s been caused \u2013 the economic environment that\u2019s been caused by the pandemic is a big driver of the pace at which those deposits have increased from the February levels. But as we look forward, while we\u2019re in this environment, for sure, and it feels like we\u2019re in this environment for longer. It\u2019s hard to see given all of the the response, the policy \u2013 monetary policy response from the Fed and others that the balances would retreat much more from where they are. Thomas Gibbons : And I can take the second component of your question, Mike, which was around the new business wins. I mean, the clients are still making servicer decisions. And relative to last year, we\u2019ve probably seen we\u2019ve been winning and retaining more deals and higher value deals, which is important. I think, we\u2019ve learned how to work from home. We\u2019ve ramped out our focus on \u2013 we\u2019ve ramped up our focus on client management over that time. And we\u2019re actually seeing an increase in activity with reviews and presentations being done virtually. And we\u2019ve got some nice wins around ETFs around our mid-office space, and we continue to implement at a rapid pace against the mid-office. We\u2019ve got the TALF servicing-related wins as well. So the pipeline remains strong. I think we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re getting used to this as being the current normal. Mike Carrier : Got it. Okay. And then, Mike, you said a quick cleanup, there were just a few positive items in the quarter, I think some that investment gains in funds. And then you mentioned that other investment in income that asset servicing fee. Away from that, yes, I\u2019m assuming that most of it was just market-related, just given what we saw in the quarter. But were there any other factors in today\u2019s line items, I\u2019m assuming we just expect that to normalize lower ahead, but just any color if there were any other nuances there? Michael Santomassimo : No, I think it\u2019s pretty straightforward on those investment and other income. You can kind of see the breakdown of that in the supplement the thing that\u2019ll be in the other income line that will be volatile, obviously, seed capital and how the market sort of moves within the quarter. And then the other trading line, you\u2019ll have some impact there as well from the same moves. Mike Carrier : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargos \u2013 excuse me, Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile a couple of thoughts on. Todd, you had some really positive comments with your introductory remarks, and maybe you can elaborate some on your work with the government and what kind of fees you get from that and how sustainable those fees are? But then, Mike, you certainly commented about the impact of lower interest rates, and you\u2019re certainly not sugarcoating that. So that\u2019s kind of connect those two different thoughts? And the other two different thoughts I have is, you guys are certainly service more fixed income assets than your peers. So you should be benefiting from that quite a bit. And I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s showing up as much as you might expect with the increased fixed income activity? Thank you. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. Mike, thanks. So in terms of \u2013 there are a number of government programs that we\u2019re participating or that we are supporting or administering, some of them are showing some growth. For example, the PDCF is where we use our tri-party repo system. So it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s reflected in the amount of tri-party repo activity, which we did see go up in the first quarter and sustain itself until a certain extent although it\u2019s starting to come off a little bit in the second and third quarter. But we are seeing good activity on the global side of the tri-party book. And it\u2019s really going to \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a matter of how much those programs are taken off before we see any revenue. I think the more important is the other component of our revenue growth across our Investment Services business. In terms of the fixed income \u2013 excuse me, fixed income activity, where you\u2019re seeing in clearing and collateral management, you are seeing increased clearing volumes on our clearing platform and we are benefiting to a certain extent from that. And I think that was reflected. If you looked at the Investment Services uptick and the highlights, you could see that. And I think we\u2019ve been very directive where we are with the interest rates. I think the important thing to know is that, we are \u2013 we see ourselves reaching the bottom here in a very short period of time. Mike Mayo : So when you add it all together, do you think \u2013 you said flat expenses for the year, revenues, any guidance for the year for that sort of relative to those expenses? Thomas Gibbons : Well, I think that the headwinds for revenues, we disclose to you. And that\u2019s all interest rate-related. Mike Mayo : Okay. And so do you think you can get flat operating revenue this year or positive or negative or you just don\u2019t want to make a call on that? Thomas Gibbons : Right now, I wouldn\u2019t make a call on that just given the uncertainty around some of those elements. Mike Mayo : Okay. Lastly, you are \u2013 but you are investing in technology, so that \u2013 you said that\u2019s elevated this year, and that should fall off some next year. So that\u2019s your \u2013 you\u2019re not going to sacrifice those investments for the long-term? Thomas Gibbons : That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s correct, Mike. I mean, in fact, the investments we made in operating efficiencies that we\u2019ll see the benefit over the next couple of years is the highest we\u2019ve ever made \u2013 will be the highest we\u2019ve ever made in 2020. Mike Mayo : Got it. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll next go to Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Robert Wildhack : Good morning, guys. There has been some headlines with some of your peers are rolling out what seems to be a similar integration to the partnership you\u2019ve struck with Aladdin and BlackRock? Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing on that front, maybe highlight what you think differentiates your integration there versus some of the other options? Thomas Gibbons : Mike, you want to do that one? Or you want me to take it? Why don\u2019t you take it, Mike? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, sure. Rob, the \u2013 look, I think, as you would expect, BlackRock works with a whole series of providers, and those providers would use Aladdin in some form or fashion. And I think that\u2019s kind of to be expected and was happening already. I think the good news is, we\u2019re the only provider that has our capabilities embedded inside of Aladdin. And so the widgets or the capabilities of the functionality that we\u2019ve built are actually accessible through Aladdin, and we\u2019re the only ones that you can do that. So I think, we\u2019ve got a really strong relationship with BlackRock on the servicing side and the partnership side, and we look forward to continuing to build new capabilities with them that continue to differentiate what our common clients can do versus others, but we do think there\u2019s some differences there. Robert Wildhack : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Todd. Good morning, Mike. The question has to do with the credit quality. Clearly, you guys are not a credit-centric bank, like some of the universal banks. But can you give us some color on the provision that you put up? What \u2013 you broke out your portfolio. When is that provision allocated to that portfolio? And is it just general allocations or were there some specific reserves that you put against specific ones? Thomas Gibbons : Mike, you want to take it? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, Gerard. So I would say, generally, the build was related to commercial real estate portion of the portfolio. That\u2019s certainly where the biggest piece of it was. It\u2019s not a general sort of allocation. Obviously, it\u2019s a very detailed sort of name by name, and then you apply all the modeling that goes around with it. But as you sort of look at the bill, the biggest portion of it would be related to the commercial real estate portion. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then coming back to the deposit rates, you saw about, I guess, 11% or 12% increase in your foreign office deposits, and the average rage went from the first quarter, repaying 20 basis points, I think, or 29 basis points, down to negative 12 basis points. What interest rates should we be watching overseas for the negative rates? And you had the growth even though you went to negative rates. I think deposits essentially inelastic, meaning, is there a point where you would be concerned that people would move money out at the negative rates went too negative? Thomas Gibbons : Mike, you want to take that? It was 29 to 12, yes. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. And, Gerard, when you look at the disclosure there domestic versus foreign offices, that doesn\u2019t necessarily denote currency denomination, a good chunk of the deposits in the foreign offices are actually U.S. dollar deposits. And so I think you really sort of need to look at the rate in aggregate when you think about what\u2019s happened over the quarter. I think, when you look at the \u2013 and so as you sort of look at that rate coming down, the biggest driver of the rate coming down in the foreign offices is actually us paying lower amounts on U.S. dollars, not increased negative rates outside the U.S. But obviously, the biggest driver for us other than U.S. dollar is going to be our euro deposits when you think about negative rates and that\u2019s something we\u2019re focused on. I think, when you think about our deposits inelastic, I think, there\u2019s a portion of the deposits that are very much tied to the underlying operational activity. And so, I think that there is \u2013 we have \u2013 we do \u2013 when we charge clients for negative rates, there are spreads attached to those negative rates, and we haven\u2019t seen much movement as a result of the pricing and the spreads that we\u2019ve applied to those deposits. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great. Thanks. Just a real quick question first on that tax rate guide, I mean, you gave it for the full-year this year, but is that also a good number to use on a go-forward basis, the 20%? Thomas Gibbons : Mike? Michael Santomassimo : I would probably think 20% to 21% and you sort of look forward based on what we know today. But I think for this year, it\u2019s definitely closer to 20%. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the expenses. I heard the flat expense guide this year, but obviously, there\u2019s a lot of kind of one-timers and unique nature going on, given the current situation. So is it the right way to think about expenses as we look forward to 2021? And that there should be a natural downward progression to expenses just as these one-timers go away and then the rest of it guys think about expenses is really going to be driven by revenue growth for the next year, so that there is some kind of downward bias on expenses to start with for 2021? Michael Santomassimo : Well, we \u2013 what I had indicated, there are a couple of good things. Number one is, I think, the efficiencies that we\u2019ve invested in will continue to register themselves next year and over the next couple of years, and we\u2019re not slowing down on that. There\u2019s a lot more automation, a lot of additional things that we can do to make ourselves more efficient and actually improve the client experience at the same time. And on top of that, we have been growing our tech expense quite a bit over the past three years. A lot of that was infrastructure resiliency, as well as some of the efficiency investments and some of the product capabilities. We think a fair amount of the infrastructure component of that will be behind us, which should give us a bit of a tailwind as we look out over the next couple of years. Brian Kleinhanzl : Very good. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next in queue, we have a follow-up question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : All right, great. Thanks so much for taking my follow-up. Mike, just \u2013 maybe just to dive in a little bit more on the balance sheet. Deposit levels, I think, at period-end were up, I think, 305 versus the 283 average. So maybe just some commentary on whether you think that was the typical quarter-end spike? Or do you think those levels are in the period levels of deposits are sustainable as you see it right now in 3Q? And then just on the securities mix that you talked about moving more short-term shifting the balance sheet composition towards security as you get confidence in those durability of the deposits. What type of level do you think that mix could go up to you from the 43%, because I guess you could potentially get some NIM expansion after this bottoms in 3Q if you do that? Thomas Gibbons : Sure. I\u2019ll start with the first one. Brian, I think the \u2013 you can\u2019t read much into one day\u2019s worth of deposit balances. And so I would sort of put that in the bucket of a typical quarter-end spot number. And so sometimes, that\u2019ll be higher, sometimes it\u2019ll be lower. And there was one deposit that sort of drove that up a little bit for particular client. But \u2013 so I think the guidance I gave around the current levels are slightly below where the average was, is probably a good way to sort of think about where we are right now. I think once you sort of think about how much we can deploy into the securities portfolio, I think, that\u2019s something that\u2019s dynamic based on sort of how we feel about the stability and the longevity of those deposits. You\u2019ll see us continue to optimize as we go into the quarter. It\u2019s not something we\u2019ll give you a specific percentage on, because obviously there are other drivers of that, but we do think there\u2019s continued opportunity there. Brian Bedell : Okay, fair enough. And then just on the deposits and money market fund balances, are you agnostic mostly between that client usage as that cash moves around between third-party money market balances and drive this, of course, as well versus deposits on the balance sheet in those programs? Or I guess, the question there, are you agnostic as to where that lands? Or are you trying to favor one area or over the other in terms of revenue generation capabilities, I guess, on the fee versus the balance sheet side? Michael Santomassimo : You may take that, Todd? Thomas Gibbons : Yes, Mike, let me start. The \u2013 I think the answer is it depends, Brian. I think, when you think about short-term balances that we know won\u2019t be around for very long. I think, we are relatively agnostic with IOER at 10 basis points of where they go whether it\u2019s in a money market fund or on the balance sheet, I think, we\u2019ll learn about the same. I think, as you sort of think about operational deposits going, we are \u2013 over time, we\u2019ll make more money with them being on the balance sheet. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thanks very much for taking my follow-up. Thomas Gibbons : I\u2019ll be very specific with clients, but thanks for the question. Brian Bedell : Okay. Yes. Okay, thanks for taking the follow-up. Operator : We also do have a follow-up question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein : Hey, thanks for the follow-up, guys. Sorry for the mid-tech, but back to this money market fund dynamic real quick. So, Mike, I think on the last update, you guys had said, you expect the pre-tax impact on a quarterly basis for money market fee waivers to be about $50 million to $75 million and talk about that\u2019d be probably at the higher-end of that range in the second quarter. Now you guys got into $80 million to $100 million by the end of the year. So I just want to make sure that these two numbers are kind of comparable. And essentially, we\u2019re just talking about $20 million more and sort of incremental pre-tax income from fee waivers? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. It\u2019s a good question, Alex. I think, the \u2013 when you look at the $50 million to $75 million, at that point, it was unclear what was going to happen with money fund balances. And so I think the $50 million to $75 million was the gross impact. And as we sort of look at the $85 million to $100 million, that\u2019s the net impact of now is accounting for the fact that we think the balance growth that we saw is going to stick with us for a while. So if you look at what I gave in my script, I said by the fourth quarter, the gross impact will be $135 million to $150 million, which is a bit \u2013 which is equivalent to that $50 million to $75 million, but it\u2019ll be offset by the fact that we think the balances will stick around. So that\u2019s how you get them $75 million to $100 million. Alexander Blostein : Great. That\u2019s clear. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And it does appear we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Todd Gibbons for any additional or closing remarks. Thomas Gibbons : Okay. Thank you, everybody, for your questions. And obviously, you can reach out to Magda, Investor Relations, for any further follow-up. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call webcast. A replay of this conference call webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 :00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon\u2019s Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Magda Palczynska : Good morning. Welcome to BNY Mellon\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our financial highlights presentation available on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon\u2019s CEO will lead the call. Then Emily Portney, our CFO, will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Emily's prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 16, 2020, and will not be updated. With that, I will hand over to Todd. Thomas Gibbons : Thank you, Magda, and good morning, everyone. First of all, I want to welcome Emily to her first results call as CFO. Most of you are just getting to know Emily, and as you spend more time with her, I think you'll agree that having been in a number of business leadership roles, as well as having had experience in the finance function, Emily brings a perspective that positions her exceptionally well for this role. So welcome, Emily. Great to have you here. Before handing it over to her to review the financials in more detail, let me touch on some highlights in terms of our performance and other developments. For the third quarter, we reported revenue of $3.85 billion, earnings per share of $0.98 and a solid return on tangible common equity of 17%. Our operating margin was resilient at 30%, despite the impact of low interest rates in the related money market fee waivers. And with our share repurchases suspended now for two consecutive quarters, we accreted significant capital increasing our common equity Tier 1 ratio to 13%. During the third quarter, volumes and volatilities continue to normalize. At the same time, interest rates trended a bit lower. As we look into next year, I believe the underlying strength of our franchise will become more apparent, as we expect to have most of the run rate impact of lower rates and associated money market fee waivers in our earnings. At that point, we can start to more clearly demonstrate the progress we're making around our key priorities of driving organic growth, optimizing the balance sheet and executing on our efficiency priorities. And notwithstanding, the challenging current environment, our business model continues to generate significant excess capital. We look forward to recommencing share buybacks as soon as regulators and market conditions allow, which we expect to be meaningfully accretive to EPS. Now, there are many opportunities across our business to differentiate ourselves with clients, while addressing a broader set of their needs. The crisis has increased the frequency and the intensity of my conversations with clients, as we've helped them navigate related issues. They're adapting to a rapidly changing environment. As they're assessing what they do across their operations, they want to know how we can help them and optimize their data, and how to be more efficient and effective in what they do on a day-to-day basis. In Asset Servicing, we are winning and retaining more deals and our pipeline is stronger than it was at this time last year. And I think that's a reflection of the quality of our service, as well as the unique set of capabilities that we can deliver for the front, middle and back office. This is, of course, in addition to providing more custody and securities lending. Versus a year ago, we are seeing positive trends and win and retention rates and in our pipeline. Deals are becoming more complex across products and solutions based. For example, we have recently been selected to provide a range of services by iA Financial Group, that's one of Canada's largest insurance and wealth management groups, with CAD175 billion in assets under management. The mandate encompasses fund accounting and administration, custody, foreign exchange and a full data and analytics suite of solutions, incorporating the data vault and data studio, performance measurement and reporting and middle office services. We're continuing to invest in building out our cloud based data and analytics offerings, and have integrated this into our Asset Servicing core business. Clients trust us with 30 trillion dollars of data assets on our software, including trillions where Asset Servicing is elsewhere. And over 20% of our pipeline deals now include data and analytics products. Just one example which I mentioned last quarter, is our new ESG app, that allows portfolio managers to create investment portfolios, customized to individual ESG preferences, using multiple data sources to support from cloud sourced guidance around preferred ESG factors and priorities. We're seeing real momentum with this app. We have a dozen clients in active trials, and we're in discussions with over 100 more. We're also thinking about how we can integrate capabilities like this when developing holistic solutions for our clients. In Pershing, the bulk of money market fee waivers is being absorbed by this business, masking its underlying good performance as the core of long-term drivers remain intact. The pipeline is robust and the underlying performance of the business is strong. Firms are critically assessing their business model and their cost structures. This is particularly true with self-clearing capital markets firms that are increasingly looking to reduce costs and free up capital by outsourcing their trade settlement and clearing and turning it to us as a result of that. Year-to-date, new assets on an annualized basis are strong at over 4%. Our pipeline is further improved with an increase of almost 50% in newly signed business from RIAs, who increasingly value our B2B platform, especially as the custodian industry consolidates. We have traditionally served larger RIA practices and are now expanding our addressable market to grow this client base. And we're maintaining our leading market share in the broker dealer segment. In clearance and collateral management, we serve as $3.4 trillion in Tri-party assets globally. Our ongoing digital enhancements should continue to drive revenue growth from our existing client base, as well as from new clients that are entering the platform, as they accelerate their needs to automate operations, access real time data, and focus on process optimization and digitization in this challenging operating environment. Our offerings which include collateral optimization and advanced analytic solutions, allow clients to move from manual to automated straight through processes, while optimizing their global securities inventory, which is proven for them to reduce funding and operating costs and enhance their available liquidity. We also expect more clients to convert balances from the bilateral repo and securities lending markets to our tri-party platform, as demand rate remains high for global asset mobility and operational efficiencies that they get on tri-parties. Investments and Wealth Management had solid revenue growth, positive long-term flows, and good performance this quarter. Across the 30 top strategies by revenue, which accounts for about 60% of IN's long-term annualized revenue, 74% of those have pure rankings that are in the top two quartile on a three year basis. Hanneke Smits is now officially started in their role as CEO of Investment Management, and we also recently appointed John DeSimone as CEO of Alcentra, one of the world's largest managers of private credit. I'm excited to work with him to accelerate our growth by leveraging Alcentra's strengths in Europe, and increasing their market position in the U.S. There's an opportunity to grow this manager quite a bit faster. Across investment management, we're also investing in technology and in developing offerings and ETFs, ESG and alternatives to align our investment capabilities to an evolving client demands. And I think it's going to nicely complement our leading positions in for example, LDI, active fixed income, global somatic equity, as well as private credit. In wealth management, client acquisition has started to pick up again with the resumption of socially distance in-person meetings. We're investing in talent initiatives, such as strengthening our family office offering and technology and digital tools to support advisors and their clients. We often speak about the importance of controlling expenses. This is especially critical in this low rate environment. We continue to identify opportunities to improve automation through operational enhancements. Our approach in deciding between reinvesting expense savings and allowing them to fall to the bottom line is based on a rigorous analysis, including investment and prioritizing them, the ones with the most attractive ROIs, as well as taking a careful look at their payback periods. We're also assessing the long-term structural opportunities from this current work environment. There's no question we're going to have a meaningful impact and how we work on the future and we'll need to be agile. We expect it will impact our real estate footprint, our location strategy, the need for contingency sites, marketing and business development, and acceleration of our digitization efforts with our clients. Now, building a scalable and resilient operating model is a core part of our strategy. It will enable us to optimize and streamline the interactions across our businesses, technology and operations, all in the interest of serving clients and driving growth. Now to drive and advance our agenda more rapidly, we recently made the decision to bring operations and technology together under Bridget leadership, by more directly connecting operations and technology into a single operating model, we're taking a holistic approach to bring together the best of both functions. And I think it's going to give us the ability to share enterprise capabilities, prioritize investments, reengineer and digitize processes more quickly to drive scale and agility, as well as to embed innovation and automation across end-to-end client journeys and create more agile, client centric teams. Now we turn to capital returns. On September 17, the Federal Reserve released scenarios for a second round of banks stress tests, and that was followed by a September 30, announcement, the share buyback and dividend increase restrictions have been extended for the fourth quarter. We are now working through the analysis and the modeling as we're given 45 days from the date of receipt of the scenarios to submit our plan. We continue to believe that our low risk and highly capital generative model positions us very well through this test. We will commence buybacks as soon as possible with the decision to be informed by an economic and regulatory environment time, as well as the outcome of the resubmitted capital plans based on the new scenarios. In the meantime, we continue to accrete significant amounts of capital. The stress capital buffer, I'll just remind you, gives us flexibility in terms of capital return timing, and so it is a matter of when and not a matter of if. As a reminder, we also opportunistically issued $1 billion in preferred stock during the second quarter, and that will provide us with the opportunity to restack our capital once we can recommence buybacks. We are committed to attractive levels of shareholder returns and we continue to aim to return at least 100% of earnings to shareholders over time. Before I conclude my comments, I want to welcome Robin Vince, who has just joined us as Vice Chairman of BNY Mellon and CEO of Global Market Infrastructure, with oversight of clearance and collateral management, treasury services, markets and Pershing. Bringing these complementary businesses together under his experience leadership will better position us to become the central facilitator in our client's capital markets ecosystems, across markets, asset classes and geographies. I'm excited to have Robin with us. He's an accomplished and respected leader in the industry, which held a number of leadership positions at Goldman Sachs, including serving as their Chief Risk Officer, Treasurer, Head of Operations, Head of Global Money Markets and CEO of the International Bank. I'm also very pleased with how the leadership team has come together. It's a highly talented energized and diverse group that is willing to truly challenge each other to make us all stronger. To wrap up, while uncertainty certainly lies in terms of how the pandemic evolves and its impact on the global economy, we have also significant uncertainty about the size and form of future stimulus programs, as well as political developments. But given that, I am certain that the team we have in place will continue to navigate these challenges by executing on our strategic priorities. I am also proud that our employees across the company have worked diligently throughout this unprecedented time to provide great client service. We entered this crisis from a position of strength and have an unwavering focus on building ever greater value for our stakeholders going forward. So with that, I'll turn it over to Emily. Emily Portney : Thank you, Todd, for the kind introduction, and good morning, everyone. Let me run through the details of our results for the quarter. All comparison will be on a year-over-year basis, unless I specify otherwise. Beginning on Page 2 of the financial highlight document, in the third quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $3.85 billion, down less than 1% and EPS of $0.98. As expected, revenues were negatively impacted by low interest rates and associated money market fee waivers, excluding these market driven factors, underlying fees would have been up, reflecting good momentum across many of our businesses. Expenses were up 4%. However, it is important to note that 3% of the increase was driven by the tax-related reserve release in the third quarter of 2019. Pre-tax margin was 30% and we posted ROTCE of 16.7% and ROE of 8.7%. Provisions for credit losses was $9 million. We continue to accrete substantial excess capital and are in a good position to resume buybacks when regulators and market conditions allow. Quarter-over-quarter, both our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios improved meaningfully by 40 and 30 basis points, respectively. Page 3 sets out a trend analysis of the main drivers of the quarterly results. Investment services revenue was $2.9 billion down 4%. Net interest revenue was down 11%, while fees were down 2%, including the impact of money market fee waivers. We saw healthy underlying revenue across Asset Servicing, Pershing, Treasury Services and Corporate Trust, which I will discuss later. Investment and wealth management revenue increased 3%, largely driven by higher market value, and we also continue to see strong investment performance in our largest strategies with positive long-term flows this quarter. The impact of money market fee waivers and our consolidated fee revenue net of distribution and servicing expense was $101 million in the quarter, slightly better than the $110 million to $125 million that we previously guided to, and an increase of $22 million quarter-on-quarter. We provided you detail of the impact by business and the expense in the appendix of the highlight deck. Finally, despite the contraction in high margin revenue this year from lower interest rate and more recently the absence of share buyback, pre-tax income, margins, and EPS are healthy, although down versus a year ago. Slide 4 summarizes the P&L and notable items in the year ago period. There were two largely offsetting items but relevant as we look at various components of the P&L. One of the least impairment negatively impacting NIR in the third quarter of 2019, and the other is a net reduction of reserves that benefited I'm expense in the prior year quarter. Turning to Slide 5, our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong and well above internal targets and regulatory minimum. Common equity Tier 1 capital totalled just over $21 billion at September 30, and our CET1 ratio was 13% under the advanced approach and 13.5% under the standardized approach. As a reminder, under the new stress capital buffer rule that became effective October 1, we are required to maintain a standardized CET1 ratio of 8.5%, including the 2.5% stress capital buffer floor, and a 1.5% G-SIB surcharge. Tier 1 leverage is currently our binding constraint due to the buffers we need to hold for potential growth and our deposit base driven balance sheet. We're comfortable operating at a ratio of around 5.5% to 6% versus the 4% regulatory minimum. At 6.5%, our current Tier 1 leverage ratio is well above our target and we expect to accrete more capital in the fourth quarter. Finally, our average LCR in the third quarter was 111%. In terms of shareholder capital return, in the third quarter, we continued our suspension of share repurchases and will do so again in the fourth quarter in line with Federal Reserve restrictions for CCAR banks. We continue to pay our quarterly cash dividends which totalled $279 million in the third quarter, and believe we have ample capacity to continue to pay dividends under a variety of economic scenarios. Turning to Page 6, my comments on net interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes. Net interest revenue of $703 million was down 10%. This was within the range we provided in the second quarter results, despite rates coming in a little lower than was implied by the forward curve at the time. We offset some of this impact through implementation of balance sheet optimization strategies. A full quarter of lower LIBOR, as well as lower rates in general reduce the yield on a securities portfolio loans and other interest earning assets. For example, average one and three months LIBOR levels were down 20 and 36 bps, respectively. The lower asset yield impact was partially offset by the related benefits of lower funding costs. The rating environment also drove MBS prepayment activity slightly higher than expected for the quarter. As I said, we were able to offset some of the rate headwinds through the deployment of cash into our larger security portfolio, as more of our deposit balances seasoned. Additionally, we benefited from a decline in long-term debt outstanding. Turning to Slide 7, which summarizes deposits and securities trends. Average deposit balances remain strong at $279 billion, up 23% versus the third quarter of 2019. Deposit growth reflects the success of our deposit initiatives linked to fee generating transaction activities that we've had in place for a year now across Treasury Services, Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. It is also partly attributable to central bank balance sheet expansion, which results in excess liquidity in the system. The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits declined very modestly to negative 5 basis points during the quarter, and reflected some pricing optimization in a few businesses. At this point, we generally feel that we've now reached the low point for deposit pricing. Recall that the negative rate peak reflects our business mix. Approximately 25% of our deposits are non-U.S. dollar, and we charge negative rates on euro-denominated deposits. Turning to the securities portfolio. On average, the portfolio increased approximately $9 billion versus the second quarter and was around $37 billion over the prior year, or nearly 30% higher as we deployed the growing deposit base. Average non-HQLA securities, including trading assets was $33 billion in the third quarter, up from $22 billion a year ago, and we've been buying some incremental non-HQLA securities to increase yield, while maintaining our conservative risk profile. Moving to Page 8, which provides some color on our asset mix and our loan portfolio. Our average interest earning assets were relatively stable at $358 billion, but as I mentioned, we did redeploy some cash into investment securities this quarter. The loan portfolio represents just 15% of our interest earning assets. We continue to feel good about our credit exposures and the portfolio continues to perform well. Still at zero net charge-offs this year, we will continue to closely monitor the portfolio, particularly the commercial real estate exposure and other sectors more acutely impacted by the current environment. Provision for credit losses reflected a fairly consistent macroeconomic outlook versus the prior quarter, and a modest net uptick in reserves primarily related to our CRE portfolio. Page 9 provides an overview of expenses. Expenses of $2.7 billion were up 4%. 3% of the increase was driven by the tax-related reserve reduction last year in investment management. The remainder of the increase was the result of continued investments in technology and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower staff and business development expenses, namely travel and marketing. Turning to Page 10, total investment services revenue declined 4%, as almost all business revenue growth rates were impacted by year-over-year lower net interest revenue. Assets under custody and administration increased 8% year-over-year to $38.6 trillion. And we continue to see organic growth with new and existing clients, as well as the benefit from higher market values and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. As I move to the business line discussion, I will focus my comment on fees. Within Assets Servicing, overall fees increased slightly, primarily on organic growth with existing clients and higher market levels. These increases were partially offset by lower securities lending revenue due to tighter spreads, as well as marginally lower foreign exchange revenue on the back of lower industry volumes, despite higher volatility in FX market. Other trading revenue is down, driven by fixed income trading activities, which is offset in NIR. Encouraging, fee revenue decreased as the impact of fee waivers more than offset good organic growth. Transaction volume, clearing accounts, mutual fund assets and suite balances all increased, and net new assets were $12 billion in the quarter. Year-to-date, our pipeline has further improved as the business continues to gain momentum. Issuer Services fees revenue decreased by 9%, driven by depository receipts based on a slowdown in cross-border settlements, as well as seasonal dividend and other COVID action activities due to macro uncertainty. Trends in masked good underlying momentum in corporate trust, as demonstrated by new business wins and client deposit growth and corporate trust fees were modestly higher. Treasury services fee revenue was up 9% despite the tough macroeconomic environment and lower overall payment activity, primarily due to higher liquidity balances, which grew over 45% year-over-year, net new business and an improvement in product mix. Clearance and collateral management fees were impacted by lower revenue of $12 million, driven by the divestiture of an equity investment in the fourth quarter of last year, as well as subdued activity in the U.S. treasury market despite higher issuance levels and secondary trading, and therefore for settlement activity was lower. These headwinds were partially offset by higher non-U.S. dollar collateral management fees. Page 11 summarizes the drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our investment services businesses. Turning to Investment and wealth management on Page 12, total investment and wealth management revenue was up 3%. Overall assets under management of $2 trillion or up 9% year-over-year, primarily due to higher markets, the impact of the U.S. dollar weakening and cash inflows from earlier this year. We had net outflows of $5 billion in the quarter, though long-term strategies had net inflows of $5 billion, including significant LDI inflows from targeted clients. Investment management revenue was up 5% driven mainly by higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and uptick in performance fees and the absence of the impact of hedging activity that occurred a year ago. This offset higher money market fee waivers. Wealth Management revenue was down 1% year-over-year, while fees were flat as higher market levels were offset by net outflows, partially due to client tax payments, and the shift by clients to lower fee investment products. In the quarter there were $21 million of fee capital hedging losses that were more than offset by gains on fee capital. The net of these items is reflected in other fee revenue within the segment. As a reminder, in the consolidated financial statements the results of the fee capital hedges are in foreign exchange and other trading, and the fee capital gains are reflected in income from consolidated investment management funds and investment in other income. In the third quarter last year, there was also a revenue hedge in one of the investment management boutiques, which has since been eliminated. Now turning to our other segments on Page 13. The year-over-year revenue comparison was primarily impacted by the lease-related impairment of $70 million recorded in the third quarter of last year, while expenses declined primarily due to lower staff expense. And now a few comments about the fourth quarter. First, I would note that the macroeconomic environment remains fluid. Although we are expecting higher volatility in the fourth quarter around the election, it is difficult to predict whether it will translate into higher transaction volumes or whether it will be a risk off environment. Looking ahead at net interest revenue, we expect NIR to decline sequentially by 3% to 5%. As we look into next year, we expect the quarterly NIR run-rate to be slightly less than the fourth quarter level. This is based on a few factors. First, the forward curve indicates a fairly stable rate environment from here, implying that the work should be behind us. Second, we continue to take action and optimize the securities and loan portfolio as deposit season, generating marginally higher yield. Third, the unrealized gains associated with the higher yielding long-term securities will take some time to roll off. Fourth, we do not expect further deleveraging. And additionally, our deposit balances remain strong and are slightly higher than the third quarter average. We expect them to remain at these levels. In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect money markets fee waivers net of distribution expense benefits to be in the original range indicated of $135 million to $150 million. As we look into the next year, we expect waivers to be fully incorporate into our run-rate at the higher end of that range. Waivers will also start to impact investment services businesses aside from Pershing to a greater extent. And our full year expenses excluding notable items, we expect it to remain essentially flat versus 2019, including the 15 basis points full year-over-year impact from higher pension expense. We maybe up slightly, if there is a weakening of the U.S. dollar, but this of course would be largely offset on the revenue line which would benefit from a weakening U.S. dollar. Credit costs will be highly dependent upon individual credit and other macroeconomic developments. In terms of our effective tax rate, we still expect it to be approximately 20% for the full year, although it was lower this quarter. With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Great. Good morning. Thanks, Todd. And welcome, Emily. So, first question for you guys. I was hoping to go back to opening comments around how the challenging rate backdrop and obviously market challenges in the beginning of the year, perhaps I'm asking some of the growth initiatives that are taking place underneath. It sounds like Todd, you're little bit more optimistic about that into next year. So can you help us conceptualize which specific initiatives from a topline perspective you expect to be the most material contributors to set the top line growth into '21? And over time again, given numerous things you mentioned, what do you see the reasonable organic fee growth for the firm excluding sort of the market dynamics? Thomas Gibbons : Sure Alex. Good morning, good to hear from you. I think probably the most impactful one is around Pershing. And we did call out the details around Pershing. So as we've been investing in the advisory space and we are seeing some good growth and some good wins there, yet we saw on a year-over-year basis a decline in fees. But there's about $73 million of fee waivers that are reflected there, so if you adjust for that, that was actually a pretty healthy growth. So we continue to see that as a potential upside. And it'll be good to get these fee waivers behind us because the masking of what's lying underneath it will go away. I think secondly, in Asset Servicing we're seeing the same effect, where we're starting to see a little bit of fee waivers, obviously we're seeing a lot of net interest income impact and there's a little bit of other noise and we had divested of an asset that was driving that fee line a year ago. We took a big gain in the fourth quarter but there was some income related to that that we would have enjoyed in the third quarter that's no longer there. But when we look at what we see going on there, we do see some traction around our data and analytics space. And also one of the important things there and one of our key strategies is quality of service. And the quality of our service and the feedback that we're getting from clients continues to improve. It helps not only the retention of business, but new business especially with existing clients and we're starting to see that come through the line instead of that is masked. On the clearing a collateral management space we\u2019re making significant investments in what we're calling the future of collateral, which will make that business much more interoperable and beneficial to our clients. We see some growth opportunities. This particular quarter was pretty soft for that, I mean, again we had divested of an asset that was reflected in that line. We also -- and this is kind of surprising just the clearing volumes in the treasury market despite the massive increases in issuance by the U.S. government, they were down. It was kind of quiet quarter when it came to the clearing part of management business and the clearing business in particular. We saw a very modest increase in global collateral, but domestic collateral management was down a little bit as we saw some deleveraging. So there are a number of things masking that. I think we'll be able to pick up market share in the future, and I think will also be able to pick up the movement from bilateral to tri-party, because of the efficiencies that they're going to get on our platform. So, I think those are a couple of the key points. Alex Blostein : Got it. And I guess just putting it all together and not to pinpoint \u201921 or \u201922. As you think about the collection of businesses that you guys have, what do you think is the reasonable organic fee growth that we should anticipate from BNY Mellon over time? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. I don't think I want to put down on our guidance at this point, but when we look to this year there's a modest amount 1% or 2% underlying kind of organic fee growth, a lot of it masked by all those things I just described. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning, Todd and Emily. Thomas Gibbons : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Todd, you mentioned the buyback when the gates are lifted from the Fed and I just wanted to understand how quickly you would be willing to buy back the stock down to the Tier 1 leverage ratio of what I think it's 6% that you're using as you were self-imposed minimum there? Thomas Gibbons : Well, first of all, I would like to get started as obviously as soon as we can. The guidance that Emily gave is as a target and right now our constraint is the Tier 1 leverage ratio as we go through the stress test, that\u2019s historically what it\u2019s been. And we gave guidance that we think we should target somewhere between the 5.5% and 6%, and we're currently at 6.5% and growing. That being said, the reason we give guidance in that range is right now as you know our balance sheet is a bit loaded, because of all of the liquidity that the Fed has put in place. So in this kind of environment where we've already felt the sharp increase in deposits that come with the market environment, we wouldn't expect another course of that, so we'd probably be willing to move toward the middle or lower end of that target. So that being said, we\u2019ll have to look at market conditions at the time when the Fed lifts the restrictions, what the economy is doing, what we think is going to be going on with the balance sheet and we'd absolutely be willing to start moving aggressively. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So if there was another fiscal plan that came through that doesn't really impact your deposits, obviously as much as the Fed increasing the size of the balance sheet, so another round of fiscal stimulus doesn't really drive up your deposits. You don't have to worry about that too much. Is that one of the takeaways there? Thomas Gibbons : I think that's right. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. And then the follow-up question just on how we're thinking about reinvesting the cash you have on the balance sheet, maybe I only can speak to how you're thinking about redeploying that into securities. You talked about having NIM next year or I should say next year will be running at a little bit less than the 4Q run rate. So I'm expecting that some of that cash redeployment will be occurring. Maybe if you give us some color as to how you're thinking about that, the pace and how much of your cash you're willing to redeploy into securities? Emily Portney : Sure, good to hear from you, Betsy. Ultimately, as we've been talking about for some time, we have been looking to redeploy the excess cash that we have. And of course, as deposits do begin to season, we have an ability to do that. We have been increasing the amount of high quality non-HQLA in the portfolio marginally quarter-on-quarter and actually year-over-year. That's up about $10 billion. So it's a mixture of growing the portfolio, investing in growing the non-HQLA around the edges, extending duration. And the only other thing I would say is, it's not just about the securities portfolio, but it's also about the loan portfolio. So we are redeploying some of our deposits into our loan portfolio, which of course also helps with client service and in client relationships. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Just to follow-up on the capital and Todd we've talked about this a little bit in the past. But I get it, you got tons and you keep making more and the buyback awfully enticing an accretive. I'm curious on how you guys balance that with the potential to deploy capital into something else that could accelerate growth and/or improve the overall mix of the company? Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. Okay, Glenn, thanks for the question. We're constantly looking at what opportunities lie out there for us. And when I say, Glenn, as we take a very careful look at it and I think a very disciplined approach to how we would look at something inorganic. We're certainly not opposed to it. From time to time, we see certain types of actions and lift out that might make some sense to us. But frankly, we compare them to a capital return and they should be able to beat the long-term EPS growth that we'd otherwise kept buying back our shares. So we hold ourselves very strictly to that to that discipline. There may be and we did things through the financial crisis. There may be opportunities here to do something. We've got a team that's constantly evaluating whether it's in the Fintech space, whether it\u2019s extending a market, whether it's doing something and adjacency to what we\u2019re currently looking at. So, we\u2019re absolutely willing to consider things, but they have to make sense for the long-term growth of the company. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate that. Maybe just one quickly on issuer services, which I know it's hard with the crystal ball. But we've had a big surge in debt issuance this year. I'm curious on how you think about just the overall business growth going into next year? What you see is pulled forward versus just a still good issuing environment? Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Sure. So in our issuer services, we've actually got two businesses in that segment. We've got the corporate trust business which we're referring to, but we also have the DR, the Depositary Receipt business. The DR business, as you might expect was quite a bit softer, a lot of that is international, it related to international equities, obviously. And the volume and dividends and the action there was down. So we generated a lot of revenue off of the corporate actions in the third quarters, typically a pretty good quarter. It was still up sequentially, but it was down substantially year-over-year. So that kind of masks the underlying performance of corporate trust. We think corporate trust continues to -- we've picked up a little bit of market share in some of the core businesses. Frankly, we'd lost our Mojo a couple of years ago, and I think we've gotten it back and we're seeing some growth there. And the opportunities and the issuance that has taken place has been significant. It's not the highest yielding type of issuance, but as we start to see some more of the structured product and the credit product come back, we think we're well-positioned to capture that growth. There's a little -- this is another one of the businesses that is impacted by fee waivers. So a little bit of that will be masked by fee waivers over the next quarter or two. And that's why, in my opening remarks, I said looking forward to getting that reset done having the fee waivers fully priced into the run-rate, as well as the lower interest rates and our net interest income. And we expect to see that probably sometime early next year. Glenn Schorr : Thanks, Todd. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Mike Carrier : Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First, just given the nature of new waiver pressures, just curious if there's any other efficiency initiatives possible to reduce expenses heading into '21, despite some of the investments that you guys have talked about making to the business to drive growth? Emily Portney : I'll take that. So, yes, we do have many efficiency initiatives that are actually ongoing. And ultimately, whether it is -- and I think we've talked in previous forums, whether it's investments that we've made in terms of automating client increase, hands free NAV, and various other initiatives, those are all things that are coming. What we do expect they already are coming through our cost line the benefit and they will continue to come through the cost line. The other thing I would just say is that in this year, we probably -- not probably, we reached our peak of investments in resiliency that doesn't mean we're going to stop investing. We will continue to invest in resiliency, but we reached the peak investment. So that will abate a bit and give us some room. And likewise, we have ultimately various different initiatives across the business from a structural perspective, as we're looking at the potential permanent impact of COVID on real estate footprint, as well as sales and marketing expenses and other digitization efforts that are accelerating with our clients. Thomas Gibbons : Yes, Mike. If I could add to that, one of the things that we did in the quarter is I named Bridget Engle, Head of Tech and Ops, she was previously Head of Technology. And by bringing tech and ops together and ops covers most of the operations of the company, I think the opportunity to automate to work more closely together to really target where we're going to invest in our automation processes. There's still lots of fruit on that -- low lying fruit of that tree, because we still do it, unfortunately, I have a lot of manual processes things that we can do more efficiently. So by putting tech and ops together and Bridget Engle working with our Head of Operations and that much more closely, I think we'll be able to identify and execute more quickly on some of these efficiencies. And we've been moving pretty well. It's basically funded the increase in our -- the significant increase in our technology expenses over the last few years. We do think those increases are going to abate they're not going to be at the same rates, that\u2019s probably been 10% compounded annual growth rate for a number of years here. And so, that puts us in a position to keep riding through it. Mike Carrier : All right, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up, just given some of the noise with the waivers and even volatility levels throughout the year. Just curious how the pricing has been trending in Asset Servicing over the past year six or so months? And then you can turn to going forward, any expected changes or any expected kind of surges in contract negotiations that could move it one way or another? Emily Portney : Sure Mike, I'll take that. We'd obviously -- Asset Servicing is a pretty mature business so repricing is just a continual headwind, although it's pretty modest. And we have not seen a change in the amount really from a percentage basis, an impact on revenues for several years. So it's not any worse than it has been. As you do rightly pointed out though, it is lumpy and as bigger contracts do come up for renewal that can be lumpy. Mike Carrier : But the pipeline is very strong. Thomas Gibbons : But the pipeline is very strong. Yes, the pipeline is strong and when we look at the pipeline, a very high percentage of amount I think over 20% of it is looking at our data and analytics offerings. So we\u2019re really starting to see that pick up. And when you -- if you look at, I mean, I think the best way to evaluate the business is from the operating margins. And the operating margins aren't under pressure because of the pricing. They\u2019re under pressure because of the cyclical nature of interest rates in that business. Mike Carrier : Got it, thanks a lot. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. Well, I guess there's some factors you have difficulty controlling, some factors that you can\u2019t control. You mentioned once interest rates settle down, we'll see some more of the benefits. You guided for lower NII ahead, though. So the first question is, when do you think that you'll see the full negative impact of interest rates in the run rate so that we can see the underlying progress come through? And then I'll ask a second question. Emily Portney : Sure. Thomas Gibbons : Okay. Go ahead. Emily Portney : Sure. Mike good to hear from you. So look I'm not going to try to call the market or the timing on the truck in rates, but as we did just guide in our prepared remarks, we think that the fourth quarter NII will probably be anywhere from 3% to 5% down from this quarter. And ultimately, we do think it's probably a pretty good estimate to use slightly lower than what the fourth quarters meant to be or what we expected to be to project out the rest of next year. Thomas Gibbons : So basically we're saying Mike, that something slightly under the fourth quarter run rate, but that's making the assumption that the forward yield curve is reflected in what actually happens. Emily Portney : And just to add to that\u2026 Thomas Gibbons : So no improvement in rates, it just reflects where the market is. Emily Portney : Exactly. Mike Mayo : Okay. There's always so much you can do about that I guess. But the other question, assets under custody are up 8% year-over-year and your Investment Servicing revenues are down 4% year-over-year. And this is not a new issue for you or any of these trust banks. But how can you grow the Investment Servicing business while also growing Investment Servicing revenues? You mentioned Todd you gained share in the trust business but there seems to be a disconnect between AUC growth and the revenues related to that. Is that just competition and couldn\u2019t change your fee model or how you charge your customers? It seems like your customers are getting the better end of the arrangement. Thomas Gibbons : Yes, sometimes it feels that way. There's a little bit of noise Mike in that line. And when we look at the Asset Servicing fees in the corporate line rather than in the segment, that reflects the clearing and collateral management business as well. And the clearing and collateral management business in the third quarter didn't have a very good quarter. I think there was a divestiture that took place and lost a significant amount of revenue there, but the activity was actually pretty depressed in the quarter. We were just kind of surprised because even though the U.S. government is issuing a significant amount of additional treasuries, the actual trading around that was a little bit less than we would have anticipated, then there were some other impacts there. The other thing in that line is securities lending. And securities lending again, volumes were up, that's another interest rates and market related issue. The reinvestment rates are significantly down so the spreads are down. And we didn't see many things in the way of specials so there is a little bit of deleveraging. So if you adjust for that, we don't see anything substantially different in the pricing or the underlying operating margins, except for some of the cyclical effects that I just pointed out. That being said, it puts us in a position, should we price to assume that those cyclical pressures are going to remain forever or should we price, maintaining the optionality that we're going to have on the upside. And competition will help us drive that, but we're going to do what we think will be in the long-term interest with those clients. Mike Mayo : Okay. And I guess that leads to why you're putting so much effort on the efficiency. I mean, we don't have the earnings from Investment Servicing, you don't break it out to that detail. But we still get even after adjusting for securities lending and these other factors, there's still, AUC is growing faster than the revenues from it. And so that's why you're trying to improve efficiency. Anything about the earnings related to that business? Is it keeping pace, because again, we don't have it at that level? And that's a core function of what you guys do. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. No, I think it's a meaningful contributor to overall performance of the company. I think we are continuing to get more efficient. But we've also have some other investments that we think we can expand the revenue stream as we provide more capabilities around data management for example. We're starting to see a little bit of traction there some of the applications I described. I described one in my earlier remarks where we got an ESG app that I think is really starting to gain some traction. We've got 12 clients now operating on it, we've got maybe 100 demos that we've given very good take up on that. We have another app on distribution analytics, which I think can really help our clients increase their distribution. And that's how you really build out relationships. So there's things that we're trying to generate more revenues, as we take on more of the operational burden from our clients. But at the same time, the throughput is going up without significant increases in costs. So yes, we are driving down our per unit cost meaningfully. Mike Mayo : Great, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow-up on NII. You, Emily, thank you for providing -- taking a stab at 2021. And I appreciate that you're using the forward curve. So just was curious about what assumptions are also embedded for MBS prepayment activity in that? It seems so more recently, that was a bit of a surprise versus some of maybe what the third party data sources had been expecting. Are you expecting that that'll continue to accelerate? And then when you talk about the lending, and some balance sheet optimization into lending, is that on the margin loan side? Or is that elsewhere, because it looks like the margin loan yield is holding up better than the prior period? So curious if that's sustainable? Is that some mix or some color on that front? Thank you. Emily Portney : Sure. I'll try to take both of those. In terms of MBS pre payments, just for what it's worth. They accelerated about 5% more than we originally expected and that is part of the headwind on NII at least in the third quarter. In terms of and as we think about as we go through next year, we do expect it to slow modestly. So that's in our projection. And then I guess, in terms of your question with regard to lending. We actually -- I think our lending portfolio is relatively flat at $55 billion, you'll see probably growth in that as we get into next year again, more on marginally. We don't need with lending. It's certainly something that we do to strengthen relationships that we have with our clients. And the places where we really see a lot of or some opportunities in the '40 Act lending space, well, basically mortgages in wealth and also supply trade finance in Treasury Services. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. And I would add to that, Brennan that, interestingly in the big draw downs that we have on the corporate committed facilities, 70% of those have been paid back. So we have seen that part of the loan portfolio go down. So I think that\u2019s kind of the noise associated with that that\u2019s been stabilize. But we would like to continue to grow and we\u2019ll do it prudently. The margin lending business, it\u2019s a very low risk, it\u2019s a decent return. We\u2019d like to see some more '40 Act lending which is something that looks like akin to that as well as the supply chain and mortgages and wealth that we talked about. Brennan Hawken : Alright, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks for that color. And then, I think like taking a step back here rates are tough and clearly more environmental than something that specifically you guys are doing. But, being part of your economic model is embedded within rates because of the deposit spreads embedded within your returns that you generate from your clients. And so, this year period feels sort of different than when we went into the last one. The last one was viewed as temporary, just something we need to get through and then we\u2019re going to come out on the other side and we\u2019ll return to \"normal environment.\" And that\u2019s a position come under pretty significant question. So I guess what I would say is, what are you -- how are you thinking about making adjustments to the pricing model? How you\u2019re thinking about reconsidering some of the economic considerations and when you assess clients? And what are your assumptions for where deposit spreads would return to just to ensure that the new business that you win, the assessment of existing relationships remains reasonably calibrated to what is the likely environment, unfortunately we\u2019re going to be until we want to. I know it\u2019s a tough one, but just curious your thoughts. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. So, I think that the general feeling and ours as well as the rates are lower for longer. By the way, the last cycle they were low for fairly substantial period of time. That being said, we see the light at the end of the tunnel for the fully baked-in impact of interest rates today, and it's from there that we\u2019ll grow. So we will take into consideration what the market implies in interest rates, as we price activity going forward and that\u2019s reflected in all of our pricing assumptions. And we have also got a whole series of initiatives that we think will give us deeper relationships and add revenue streams as we look there. Also we do see the potential for some margin expansion, we see the potential for some revenue growth, we see the benefits of our operator efficiencies. It really just points back to our key priorities, there is a handful of organic growth initiatives that we have got in place, that\u2019s not all going to pay off, but of some of them will. And the activity levels are still high. What we do is important and it\u2019s growing. I mean if you look at the Pershing marketplace, the advisory business is growing rapidly, and we think we can capture more of that. There has been a consolidation amongst custodians. That\u2019s an interesting opportunity for us. So, it's not always us. We understand we\u2019ve got an interest headwind. We want to get it behind us and move off a bit and grow the company from there. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : We will take our next question from Brian Bedell, with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi, great. Thanks, good morning folks. First of all thanks to the extra disclosure on the money market fee waivers. And Emily, on the balance sheet strategies, definitely very helpful. Maybe going into Pershing picking of starting with that last with your last answer Todd, within that opportunity, within the RIA custody and space. First of all, I missed one number you have quoted earlier, I don\u2019t know if it was $12 billion of net new assets in that business, but if it's something different, if you could repeat that. And then the question really is, is more of the opportunity going forward on that. I get the timeline of that. Have you benefited from that significantly already? Or do you think that\u2019s we\u2019re in an early innings of the RIA market share gain there? And are you doing anything differently than you had in the past in that business to try to win that business from the other custodian? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. No, your number was correct. And yes, we are investing more significantly in the business. We're investing more in both sales, marketing, as well as the platform that supports the advisory business. And we've got plans to do more and to continue capturing market share. We're doing -- the pipeline is strong. There's another space that I really didn't even mention, and that is institutional clearing is something that we're uniquely positioned to do. And we're seeing more and more as even their broker dealers look to outsource trying to reduce some of the capital requirements and balance sheet requirements as well as just gaining efficiencies. And the connectivity that Pershing has to our own clearing and collateral tri-party business is a unique offering. So we see opportunities there as well. Brian Bedell : Is there some confidence that you can out waive the fee waivers in that segment over the next few quarters potentially from the organic growth? Thomas Gibbons : It's going to be difficult in the short-term, that's why I want to get them behind us. As I just indicated, Brian, on a year-over-year basis, that fee waiver was $74 million in the quarter -- $73 million in the quarter for Pershing. Once we get absolutely, once we get that set, then we're working back to recover it. Brian Bedell : That makes sense. And then your comments on the data offering 20% of the pipeline. Can you just talk about the role of Aladdin within that? I know you've integrated that into some of the service process. And you also mentioned the ESG that's obviously starting still in the early phase. But maybe if you can talk about what you're doing there? Is that aggregating data from the other ESG services? Or are you actually putting a proprietary analytical engine army on the ESG that might generate some additional growth? And are you beginning to charge for that yet? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. So Brian, let me focus on the ESG first. So it's a little bit of both. So basically, the client brings the license to us. So we have integrated or will connect to as many as 100 different ESG data providers. And we built the whole -- we'll use the United Nation factors, or we'll also kind of customize factors that are most frequently used. And so you can run your own analytics against those factors, probably the neatest thing that we've done against as we built a cloud sourcing app as well. So there's a sharing of which factors which data suppliers appear to be the most trusted. And then it also shows you how much data there is on each of the factors that you're looking at, so whether you can even trust the back factor or not. And when there's a lack of information, or the quality of information is challenged by the crowd, or feeding that information back to the data provider so they can constantly improve it. So we think it's pretty innovative. And we're agnostic to where the data is. They can feed it to us. If we're the custodian, we can flip the switch and turn it on for them. So that's that particular app. And do you have anything to add Emily? Emily Portney : Yes, I think the [Indiscernible]. Thomas Gibbons : Okay, go ahead. Emily Portney : So we've actually seen very nice uptick in terms of our take up, I should say, in terms of our partnerships with the various doing methods. And by the way, just as a reminder, it's not just Aladdin, but we have a partnership with Bloomberg, SimCorp, CRD, as well as SS&C. So we're really about open architecture. And we think that our integration is more robust. We truly have integrated use single sign on and the data feeds, also across for asset classes. And ultimately, it's not only beneficial to us, but it's also beneficial to those service providers. And the last thing I would just mention about open architecture, it's not just about the front end, it's actually about throughout the entire lifecycle, the investment lifecycle. So we've got also agreements and partnerships with Fintechs, ESOPs, Milestone, Kingfield and others. Brian Bedell : Great, that's very helpful. Thank you. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Brian. Operator : We will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Todd, you mentioned earlier that a couple of the businesses were just kind of quiet this quarter. I wanted to ask you just a bigger question, when you think across the businesses the activity driven businesses versus the really strong first quarter things have kind of settled down? Do you get a sense that we kind of are now at normal levels of activity when you think across the more transactional parts of the company? Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. Hey, Ken. So I'd say the answer to that is yes. And I'd also say the third quarter was -- I mean typically, it's a little bit of a seasonal quarter to slow down and so vacations. We actually saw that this quarter. And versus a year ago, where we had a blip in the repo markets and some unusual things and some unusual revenues related to that. We didn't see -- this looked more like the seasonality that we would typically see in the quarter. So it feels at least for the time being that there is a level of normalcy around volumes and activity. Ken Usdin : Okay. And a follow-up on the buyback, Todd. A loud and clear that you're ready to go. Would there be anything -- if the Fed were to lift the buyback restriction after 4Q is it just onto your own decisioning from theirs? Or is there anything either politically or regulatory that could get in the way of you guys just ready to claw back into the buyback? And related, how would you start to think about if you were able to get back in? Do you go right back to buying back 100% total capital return? Or do you have to kind of leg in? Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. One of the benefits of the new regime, once it gets fully implemented, the stress capital buffer, it's no longer a program where we submit a plan with ex amount of buybacks by period, and if we vary from that plan, we have to make an adjustment or resubmission. It is we have to maintain our stress capital buffer. So we're not restricted by timing and the implications of that. So we think it's a very logical approach, and we look forward to operating within it, because I think it gives us more of the agility that you're pointing to there, Ken. Now, in terms of level consequences or what -- I mean, that's really outside of our control. The Fed is meant to be a political institution. And I think they will go through the stress test. They'll make their assessments. And they will determine what actions they are going to permit. Ken Usdin : Got it. And just one final cleanup, just on that. Any change in your outlook for the tax rate, or can you just help us understand what that outlook is? Thanks. Emily Portney : It's still -- I think we guided already. It's still 20% for the full year. Ken Usdin : Great, thank you. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Ken. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question on capital. Emily, I appreciate you drawing a line in the sand, outlining the roughly 50 to 100 bps of excess Tier 1 leverage you have today. Now admittedly, like when we start to run the various scenarios in terms of significant deposit uplift and if there is like a negative market shock that we ultimately experienced. That 5.5% to 6% target, it still feels quite conservative. And just wanted to get some context as to why you feel that the appropriate level that you need to manage to? And now could that potentially evolve over time, if you find that the deposits proved to be stickier and the balance sheet volatility ultimately proves to be less as the COVID pressure start to abate? Emily Portney : Sure, I can take that and Todd you can add if you want. In terms of -- and just worth mentioning from a deposit perspective, our deposits are trending about 3% up from where they were in the second quarter. So that just -- Thomas Gibbons : I think it's the third quarter. Emily Portney : I'm sorry in the third quarter. Todd, apologies, in the third quarter. They're currently around 3% up. And ultimately, when it comes to just thinking about the Tier 1 leverage, you are correct, it is our binding constraint. Having said that, we have done very well on all of our stress tests, which have taken into account very severe market shocks. And we do feel that the buffer that we've talked about is certainly sufficient. And you are correct, that we're running above that. And as a result, have excess, certainly excess capital to the extent there is an additional surge in deposits. Thomas Gibbons : Yes, I'd add to that, Steven. When you look at your capital ratios, you have to look at them kind of BAU and current operating conditions. So yes, we've got a massive excess relative to that. And if you and to your point, is it more stable? We've already gotten a significant uptick due to the activities coming out of the Fed. And fiscal is probably not going to have anything like that to the underlying deposit base, so we're really positioned to handle growth. But we also have to run it through the stress test. So it's not just normal business conditions, but through stress that that Tier 1 leverage ratio could be a constraint. And that's what we're pointing out. So the buffer reflects both what could be an increase in the deposits for any particular sharp outturn, as well as what we need just to meet to run a traditional stress test. Steven Chubak : Thanks for all that color. And just one follow-up for me regarding some of the discussion regarding some of the organic fee green shoots that were cited earlier. And over the last couple of years PPNR has contracted. It's almost been exclusively driven by NII and interest rate pressures. Of course, these have been running flattish, expenses have also been running flattish and you've tried to maintain discipline there. As we think about a scenario where, say in 12 months, if some of those organic fee green shoots that were cited, if we're still running at flattish fee income, just want to get a sense as to how you're thinking philosophically about how you want to manage the expense base. And if we're not seeing that pickup in organic fee growth, how your philosophy around that might evolve? Thomas Gibbons : Okay. I'll make a couple of comments. When you look at that fee growth, it's also absorbing. And we pointed to $150 million fee waivers per quarter. So that's an enormous number. So underneath that, there has to be some growth in order to sustain where we are. And we think we're going to be able to continue that. Obviously, based on conditions and what actually happens to revenues, we will take harder and harder look at expenses. We've been able to make the investments in technology, resiliency, automation, cyber, everything that we've done to make ourselves a stronger company. I got to admit it, it actually is more and more important having gone through this last crisis, these clients see the benefit of resiliency of our global operating model and was able to meet huge increases in volumes. And so, if anything, I think we'll probably see more as a result of that. So we've been able to do all of that and manage the expenses, and we'll drop more of the bottom line based on what happens to the revenue picture. Steven Chubak : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Steven. Operator : We will take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great. Thanks, good morning. Just a quick question on the asset management business, I know there was a restructuring there in the past and combining some of the boutiques that you had standalone. But now what we've seen across the asset management space is certainly more interest in consolidation. So I guess can you maybe address that from both sides of it, like what the opportunity to one do acquisitions? And what's the appetite as well to maybe get rid of the potentially divest some of these businesses within asset management? Thomas Gibbons : Sure, Brian. It's been kind of interesting as you start to see a little more action. I think as you think about that business there are kind of really three drivers of success. And that's probably now and that's probably what's moving some of the action. And I think it comes down to scale, integrated distribution, if you have it, and obviously performance. And so if you look at we are a $2 trillion of AUM so we have meaningful scale. Our performance has actually been pretty darn good. One of the things I cited in my opening remarks is that our service, our 30 largest funds, where there are indices for them to follow and they make up about 60% of our revenues are performing in the top one or first or second quartile. So that's been -- they've been there over the last three years. So I think we're well-positioned and it's reflective. We've got some pretty interesting assets underneath, the liability driven investment and it's been growing. And it's a business that we think we can -- it's primarily in the UK and Europe. It's something I think we can import into the U.S. We've got one of the world's largest credit managers. We just put a new CEO in place there. This is primarily a European credit manager. And I think there's a significant opportunity for it to grow, probably underperformed in the past couple of years. It's done fine, but I think it missed opportunities to grow faster. And if you think about our distribution, we're pretty interesting too, because we have a wealth manager, it's open architected but it delivers some of our manufacturing capabilities. And Pershing is also a very powerful platform, again open architected. But it's a platform where there's real estate for some of our product and probably more potential there. So we've got a number of components. So, we're watching very carefully what's going on in the industry and that's something made sense on our platform, but we have to give it hard consideration. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then just a second question. I mean, last earnings call you talked about the potential cost saves opportunity from how you rethink workforce or workplace. In the future, as the stemming from work from home in the pandemic how far along are you rethinking the workforce or workplace of the future? And when you could actually see some cost saves come through from that? Thomas Gibbons : Yes, so as we think about it, it's going to impact real estate. It's going to impact things like disaster recovery sites, because we've created a new amazing disaster recovery capability here. It will certainly impact longer-term, what we think business development, travel, entertainment, those types of costs. So there's a number of areas throughout the organization. We're starting to do a pretty deep analysis on who needs to be in the office all the time, who doesn't need to be in the office any other time and who should be in the office some of the time. And my view is there continues to be a compelling argument for aggregating at least innovation, at least a building really the performance culture that you want to inculcate into the company difficult not to do it without some in present meetings. I do think travel and seeing clients is still critical. I think it'll change a little bit. And use of some of the technology now will be much more frequent. We've all gotten pretty, pretty astute at it as well even me. And so I think that'll all change. So we're kind of laying out where we could go and what the implication to our real estate is. But that's going to -- before that to factor into the P&L will take some time. And ultimately, as much as we might think it should go one way or the other, the market is also going to dictate a bit too, because we have a lot of technologists and if the market starts to lean to more work from home we'll adjust to that. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great. Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Todd. Good morning, Emily. Emily Portney : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Todd, you mentioned, obviously, the dynamic constraints for your capital leverage ratio. And when you look at your balance sheet, I think you said it's related today, you have about 15% from a year ago. Can you share with us what do you think it should be under normal conditions? And how long would it take to get there? And what would we need to see in the macro environment for you guys to actually reach a more normalized size of the balance sheet? Thomas Gibbons : Yes, I think the balance sheet probably will grow traditionally with the growth in the underlying businesses, which if you think about the AUC and there's a relationship to that, if you think about what's going on with Pershing payables, there's a relationship to that. The treasury services business for example Gerard, we went on a campaign. We said we probably were too shy in taking on deposits and there was an opportunity or a great counterparty and our clients wanted us to grow deposits. So I feel, some of that was core growth underneath it. It's hard for me to really estimate exactly what is excess versus what would have been the traditional growth over that period and what would have grown based on our own internal efforts. But I would expect that there certainly is some excess in it. And I would expect if there is a change in interest rates and we don't see that in the near-term, that would contract it a bit, obviously, it made a lot more profitable but contracted a bit. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then coming back to something you said earlier in the call about organic growth. If you turn back the clock and you look at your organic growth of your assets really in maybe five years, how do you frame it out between existing customers giving you more business versus new customers owning new business that drives that organic growth? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. First of all, existing customers are great customers, because they don't have the implementation costs and everything else about it is less. So if the client opens up a new fund, and they've got multiple custodians, and we're the ones winning the new funds, that's organic growth and it's very important to our organic growth. And it demonstrate the quality of our services and the capabilities that we've got. And that's where we're seeing meaningful improvements. So we would include that as well as new, new customers. They're only -- in the asset management space there are only so many new, new customers to be had. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Gerard. Operator : We will take our last question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just a big picture question on expenses. Todd, it seems like the biggest challenge and opportunity both is just sort of standardizing and automating the client interface. Just how do you think about that opportunity set? Where are you? And can that be sort of a longer-term tailwind that's material for expenses? Thomas Gibbons : Emily, do you want to take that? Emily Portney : Sure. Ultimately, many of our investments are all about improving the customer experience and making it much more seamless. That's part and parcel of the open architecture that we've been talking about. And it's all about data integration. And that's going to take a while, that's a journey. But every client looks and feels slightly different. So, we are kind of solving for many different outcomes. But ultimately, that's part of the open architecture strategy and that we want to offer best in breed and as much flexibility and optionality to our clients as we can. Thomas Gibbons : And the other thing that I would add is that, when we look at our technology, there's still a lot of legacy technology debt. And one of the commitments -- when you look at where we're actually being forced to invest it's in a lot of older systems. And we could run those systems much more efficiently. Of course, they're effective, they run, they're industrial like a lot of banks, and just about all banks have this the same issues. As we cloud enable and make our underlying applications more and more efficient, there will be opportunity, there will be long-term opportunity to get rid of a lot of that legacy technology debt. So we don't see this as a one or two year effort. I think it is just -- and as just making the commitment to constantly reinvest to actually get it done, because it does take investment to make that transition. So, we're trying to incorporate that into our investment activities, so that we get to renew that stack. So it's a combination of both what's going on in the operations, how efficiently we can be operating our corporate functions, as well as how efficiently we can operate our technology. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Jim. So I believe operator, that was our last question. Operator : Yes, and I would like to turn the conference back to Todd Gibbons for any additional or closing remarks. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, everybody for your call. Please reach out to Magda and our Investor Relations team if you have any follow-up questions. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 :00 P.M. Eastern Time today. Have a good day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I will now turn the call over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Magda Palczynska : Good morning. Welcome to BNY Mellon\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today, we will reference our financial highlights presentation available on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon\u2019s CEO will lead the call. Then, Emily Portney, our CFO, will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Emily's prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 20, 2021, and will not be updated. With that, I will hand over to Todd. Thomas Gibbons : Thank you, Magda. Good morning, everyone. Let me start with a brief summary of the fourth quarter financial results, which Emily will then review in more detail, and then I\u2019ll come back with some thoughts on our franchise and our outlook for 2021. Starting on Slide 2, in terms of the fourth quarter, we reported revenue of $3.8 billion and earnings per share of $0.79 or $0.96 after excluding notable items, which Emily will cover in a few minutes. Turning to the full year 2020 financial results on Slide 3, and I\u2019m referring to them on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share of $4.01 were flat to the prior year on revenues of $15.9 billion. Fee revenue increased over 5%, excluding notable items and almost $370 million impact of fee waivers in 2020. Expenses were flat as our cost discipline and productivity gains essentially offset incremental investment, and the operating margin was solid at 30%. Now, we have a lower risk fee-based business model that positioned us well for this environment. We had no net charge-offs. We also delivered strong results from the two rounds of Federal Reserve stress tests announced in June and December. Our model is highly capital-generative, and our Common Equity Tier-1 ratio increased to 13.1% from 11.5%. When I shared my 2020 priorities with you a year ago, of course, no one expected that the world would change so rapidly and dramatically. Throughout the pandemic, we have supported employees, clients and our communities and we are proud to provide the infrastructure for several critical government programs for COVID relief, including the term asset-backed securities loan facility, the municipal liquidity facility, the primary dealer credit facility and the payment protection program. Now, while navigating the extraordinary environment, we continue to advance our long-term growth in net agenda across all of our businesses. Emily Portney : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. I will walk you through the details of our results for the quarter and briefly review the full year as well. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless I specify otherwise. Beginning on Page 4 of the financial highlights document, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $3.8 billion and EPS of $0.79. Both the current and prior year quarters included a number of notable items. The fourth quarter 2020 results included an unfavorable $0.18 per share impact from charges related to litigation, severance expenses, losses on two non-core business sales and lease exits and real estate sales. Thomas Gibbons : Thank you, Emily. Before opening up for questions, let me share some final observations, speaking to Slide 17 and 18, our franchise is powered by a wide breadth of services and capabilities. This differentiates us and certainly makes us unique amongst our closest peers. We are a top three provider across asset servicing, issuer service, clearance and collateral management as well as Pershing and we rank among the leading players in more fragmented businesses, such as Wealth Management, Investment Management and Treasury Services. This gives us a strong platform and scale, both of which are crucial for success. We are responding to the evolving needs of our clients and actively connecting different parts of the company to drive growth. While significant pandemic-related challenges remain, we are entering 2021 with confidence and momentum in our core franchise, at the same time, overall revenues year-over-year will be impacted by the full effect of low interest rates, money market fee waivers and the absence of COVID-related transaction activity. For the full year, we expect to deliver modest organic fee growth similar to 2020, which we expect to accelerate beyond 2021, as our growth initiatives gain traction. As we look out to 2021, I have three overarching priorities for the company. One, execute our growth initiatives; two, scaling and digitizing our operating model; and three, fostering a high-performance culture that is focused on delivering excellent client service in new and innovative ways. While focusing on these priorities, we will continue to vigilantly manage operating expenses, which we expect to be flat for 2021 on a constant currency basis. Between 2018 and 2021, we\u2019ve funded approximately $1.1 billion in new investments by generating internal efficiencies with no increase in expense. We will continue to invest in technology, although with profiles that is more focused on initiatives to grow and make the business more efficient. Turning to capital returns, we are pleased that we can resume share repurchases in the first quarter. We remain committed to returning at least 100% of our earnings to shareholders over time, including the excess capital we have built since the second quarter of 2020. We have the capacity to drive meaningful EPS growth through buybacks. In conclusion, we have navigated an extremely challenging year of wealth. Our capital generative and low-risk models delivered what it is supposed to do in terms of stability and capital generation. I am proud of the leadership team and the dedication and hard work of our employees during unprecedented and challenging times. And with that, operator, can you please open the line for questions? Operator :  And we\u2019ll take our first question from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Todd, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Emily, there was a lot of walk through there on the revenue guide. So I just wanted to make sure I heard that correctly and understand where I should index. You guys provide a lot of disclosure on Slide 22. Is the right starting point that we use, the fee revenue ex fee waivers and notable items for 2020 which is the 13.1? And then we layer in the difference in various impacts that you laid out and then take the new runrate for fee waivers expected in 1Q and then kind of annualize that. Is that the right way to think about it? And how does the strengthening of the dollar play into that? Sorry. Emily Portney : Sure. So, just \u2013 I guess, just to, I will break that each and every piece, but ultimately if you look at our full year 2020, if you actually take into account and try to spell as, as best as possible the impact of waivers likewise, we are expecting an increase in our market appreciation, as well as we are going to have some favorability in terms of the weakening dollar, if you put all of that together, year-on-year revenues will be essentially flat and up 3% ex fee waivers. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Okay. Thomas Gibbons : That\u2019s fee revenue, Brennan. Emily Portney : That\u2019s fee, yes \u2013 alright. That\u2019s fee revenue, yes. Thomas Gibbons : And that is assuming \u2013 who knows where the dollar is going to be, but we just, we\u2019ve used spot dollar at year end. Brennan Hawken : Fair enough. So, that 12.77 is the number we should focus on to be flat basically, ex all those puts and takes? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. And then, expenses flat, which is in line with what you gave in December on a constant currency, but we\u2019ve seen the weakening dollar. And so, when we think about the expense line, if the dollar remains unchanged from where we are now and of course we can calibrate that through the year depending on the different trackers, we\u2019ll see a roughly 1.5% uplift on the operating expense line from the 2020 level. Is that fair? Emily Portney : Correct. Correct. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Okay. Excellent. Thanks. I just wanted to try to clarify some of that. And when we think about the deposits dropping from the 4Q average level, are we \u2013 is it fair to assume that we\u2019ll probably shake out at a level that\u2019s above the third quarter? Or are you guys thinking that we might actually even revert to down to that level or below? Is there any help you can provide in trying to think about how to gauge the magnitude of that normalization in the deposit side? Emily Portney : Sure. So, ultimately, we are projecting deposit to be relatively flat from here or potentially to decline a bit. Now in turn, as we could see excess liquidity in the system, but of course, we are monitoring our capital ratios and we have to optimize the returns to shareholders so we will be actively very proactively managing the size of the balance sheet. So that\u2019s what we \u2013 that\u2019s ultimately, roughly track from here, or slightly lower. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Great. Great. Thanks very much for clarifying. Operator : And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Emily, just a follow-up on the organic growth outlook. Just wondering if you could help us put in context like just what that measures, right? Is it\u2019s not necessarily a stock measure, just a revenue growth. So like you say, it\u2019s taking the core building blocks of the segments and just kind of measuring the unit growth and how do you put that 1.5 into context with the overall fee guide, right? Can you \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you can maybe just walk us through that. Thanks. Emily Portney : Sure. So, when we think about organic growth, we define it as pretty much growth excluding market appreciation or depreciation excluding currency impact and excluding waivers. So, I mean, that\u2019s generally how we think about it. I think Todd had mentioned that we \u2013 in \u2013 over the course of 2020, it was around between 1% and 2%. We are expecting it to remain pretty much stable at that \u2013 at those levels. So that\u2019s embedded into the fee forecast that I\u2019ve just given. Ken Usdin : Right. Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. And then, just a specific question on Asset Servicing fees that on the income statement side, seeing that there was a little bit of a \u2013 there was an increase in fee waivers in that 11.38 number, but even if you exclude that, Asset Servicing was down. The press release mentioned something about some repricing. I am just wondering if you can walk through just what happened pushes and pulls there? Why the core was down sequentially? Whether it be organic growth repricing activity, et cetera? Thank you. Emily Portney : Sure. So, we had \u2013 in Asset Servicing in the fourth quarter, we had higher \u2013 we were helped by higher market levels, higher FX and other trading and higher liquidity balances. But that was offset by waivers. Sec lending was down a bit. And yes, you are correct. There was a bit of some lumpy repricing in the quarter. Ultimately, we don\u2019t control actually the timing obviously of repricing we happen to have had two or three large relationships repriced on the back of renewal. So we ultimately retained the business, but that was a modest headwind as well. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then, I guess, just as a quick follow-up to that, is that probably rebates? Does it kind of build off of here? Or how do you think about those repricing versus renewals as you think forward? Thanks. Emily Portney : Sure. Sure. So, as you all know, repricing is very lumpy. You will see the full impact of those repricings throughout the year. But it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve seen anything structural or underlying \u2013 an underlying change in the trend of repricing. It\u2019s always been a modest headwind that we\u2019ve offset with greater efficiency and net new business. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, can you hear me? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. Morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Okay. So, first question just on I think the deposit commentary. Wanted to get a better understanding as to why you think deposits aren\u2019t going to be continuing to increase as much as they have been? I mean, I think the Fed is still increasing the size of the balance sheet, I expect that you would get some benefits from that? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. I think, I can start and I am sure Emily will join in on this. I would expect that the Fed is going to continue to buy securities which kind of adds to the deposit base and there is still some question exactly how the very large balances that sit at the U.S. treasury at the Fed was going to align those down. So the two of them could increase the overall reserves and deposits in the system. That being said, we can manage some of that and now that we are back \u2013 and we did that a number of years ago. So, we targeted some of the less valuable balances and once we are able to use our capital, that\u2019s not how we are going to use it, because it\u2019s not lumpy \u2013 it won\u2019t be particularly efficient. So, we\u2019ve demonstrated that we can do that and of course, any valuable deposits we will take on. But if they are just short-term with very little benefit to them, we\u2019ll discourage that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. That three year pricing, or what have you? I guess, the other question, Todd is, you mentioned, one of the strategies here that you are going to be executing on this year is to increase the efficiency and the delivery of the products and services. I wanted to understand how you are thinking about that with regard to some of the OCC rules that have been out there recently regarding stable coin? I am just wondering, how much does the block chain initiatives that you\u2019ve got underway drive that efficiency improvement? Or is that more of a hobby and does it matter that the OCC has approved banks for stable coin? Does that factor into your strategy? Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. I think, it clarifies things a bit. And there is a fair amount of activity and by the way we have appointed somebody in front of \u2013 what I would call the token invasion efforts. They are really across three fronts and they are seeing some acceleration around tokenized assets, tokenized fee up currencies and ultimately also cryptocurrencies. So we are seeing a lot more interest in cryptocurrencies and customizing in other services associated with it. We\u2019ve done a little bit there. We have a custodian for a futures contract and it\u2019s kind of getting a start. In terms of tokenized currency, I believe that a number of utilities sell and there is an optionality from this and investor and a persistent development from the beginning and we do see that having meaningful applications. And we are also involved in tokenizing assets and we are looking at what we might be able to do to tokenize into Tri-party repo committed to make it more \u2013 even more efficient. So, I think it\u2019s going to be an important element here and we are investing. Not hugely underwrite now. It\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t see a lot of independent revenues but it\u2019s something that we will definitely be on that before we got time. Betsy, are you still there? Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Yes, appreciate that. Operator : And we\u2019ll move to our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Hi. Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Emily, just a quick one on the net interest revenue outlook. The \u2013 I think you were trying it after a 3% drop in 1Q versus 4Q would be the guidance would be stable for 2Q, 3Q, 4Q. Just wondering what the headwinds are if we are \u2013 if we get out the steeper yield curve, I guess, what you ensure is the forward curve your assumption was that? And then, what would be the headwinds that would keep that stabile if we were to see a steepening yield curve and lower prepaid fee doesn\u2019t happen here? Emily Portney : Sure. Hi, Brian. So, you got that spot on. Our guidance is, take the fourth quarter runrate. This came about, call it about 3% and that\u2019s a good proxy not only for the first quarter but when you think through the average runrate for the rest \u2013 for the year, based on what we know now, we don\u2019t try to get queued. We just use the forward curve and despite a steepening of the curve, we are still very sensitive to short end rates which have actually come down. Also, when you think about where we play the duration of our investments, that part of the curve is actually not up as much as the longer end. And I guess, the last thing I would just point out about prepayments fees that you\u2019ve mentioned is that, despite a steepening of the curve, we really haven\u2019t seen mortgage rates increase that much. So we are not expecting those at the moment anyway to really decline much. So, that\u2019s really all of this of course is subject to change based on the rate environment. But that\u2019s how we are projecting. Brian Bedell : Okay. That\u2019s clear. And then, I think\u2026 Thomas Gibbons : Hey, Brian, I just add it to make sure it perfectly clear. I mean, when you think about the steepness of the yield curve, we\u2019ve seen that. But we\u2019ve also seen short-term rates come on in a little bit and that\u2019s meaningful. So, if we do continue to see it and we continue to \u2013 and that starts to slowdown prepayments fees or even more it\u2019s \u2013 than we would expect prepayments fees. So that, but all we do is we use the current markets expected future rates really the forward curve. So that\u2019s what you saw. It\u2019s actually in that estimate. Brian Bedell : Yes. Okay. That really makes sense. And then \u2013 and maybe, Todd, just going back to some of the initiatives you mentioned in the early part of the call, and trying to just triangulate that with the organic growth rate. So the 1.5% organic growth rate, I think that implies 10%, sort of $15 million organic revenue expectations for 2021, and then you mentioned, five different initiatives, the front to back mandates, the Data Vault, ESG investment analytics, the collateral management, money market, on track how do you repo solutions and the commercial payments of your current payment, that\u2019s something as well. Are those more \u2013 just to get a flavor, are those contributing more to \u2013 I guess, you know what? If we could sort of frame what portion of the organic revenue growth in 2021 may be attributable to that? Or is it really more for in 2022 continue potentially the organic growth rate improving in 2022, that\u2019s the result of these initiatives? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. I mean, a little bit of both. So, part of the \u2013 with very strong sales in the fourth quarter, but most of those won\u2019t be implemented right, until the end of \u2013 towards the end of the year. So we can have de minimis impact on the revenues for this year. But they\u2019ll go into next year. Some of those are because of the \u2013 of what we\u2019ve done around the Data Analytics, the Data Vault and with Janus Henderson, they are the early adopters. So, that will take some time to implement. And then, we think we are gaining some additional traction. When we look at some of the applications, we\u2019ve had many, many, many demonstrations and many users on a trial basis, for example on our ESG. So that\u2019s starting to build some momentum. The Collateral Management program that we are investing and we don\u2019t expect \u2013 we expect to start seeing some of the benefits of that toward the end of the year. So, there is a little benefit in the organic growth rate this year. And we would expect that to accelerate a bit next year. Brian Bedell : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator :  And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Thomas Gibbons : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hello. Emily Portney : Hello. Mike Mayo : A question on positive trend and one maybe negative trend. But on the negative trend, you said you had elevated transaction volumes in Pershing and they should moderate. Have they moderated already? And we\u2019ll kind of see through the \u2013 how the market situation if those transaction volumes are moderating and on the positive side, you said Asset Servicing had the best sales in ten quarters in the fourth quarter and that should help that in about a year. How you will close these deals in the pandemic environment? I mean, are you closing deals that have resumed? Are these existing relationships as I keep hearing, right, getting new relationships, it\u2019s tough. So, just wanted some color behind both of those trends. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. We \u2013 one of the big transactions that we are closing with entirely in virtual, that was with a very large \u2013 and a lot of these have been entirely virtual. And we\u2019ve built a very good relationship with that particular organizations, large European asset manager, in fact and we are right before the pandemic, right at the time, I was going to travel to see them and unfortunately wasn\u2019t able to do it. So, there have been from soup to nuts, things slowed down for a while. But it\u2019s getting a little more normalized on the institutional front. I\u2019d say, on the wealth front, within the digital, that\u2019s a little bit more challenging, Mike. But on the institutional front, it\u2019s certainly not on a deal. But we\u2019ve had many instances of where we\u2019ve been able to handle that. In terms of your question around Pershing, I mean, we are only a couple of weeks into the New Year and volumes generally have stayed pretty strong relative to the fourth quarter. I just think it\u2019s a little bit too early to call. Our estimate is certainly \u2013 we\u2019ve normalized a bit. Maybe they won\u2019t, maybe we\u2019ll stay up here. But that\u2019s our best guess at this point.  You had a third question in there and I don\u2019t recall what it was, Mike. But I\u2019ll try to take it. Mike Mayo : We\u2019ll just really read through the capital markets when you think things settle down. But it sounds like they haven\u2019t settled down yet based on what you are saying with Pershing? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. I think that\u2019s right. I mean, you are seeing more retail activity than you\u2019ve historically seen. Mike Mayo : Great. Alright. Thank you. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Mike. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Great. Good morning, Todd. Good morning, Emily. Just a follow-up around the organic growth target that you guys put out there of 1.5%. Can you talk a little bit about what you are assuming for pricing dynamics within that across sort of your various businesses? Obviously it sounds like Q4 maybe was a bit of an anomaly of several large accounts just going to happen to reprice at the same time, but maybe give us a sense kind of what that unit repricing looks like? Is it 1%, 2%, kind of what that is? And how did you incorporate that into your guidance? Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. Emily, why don\u2019t you take that? Do you want to take it? Emily Portney : Sure, I\u2019ll start and we\u2019d see that. So, I mean, repricing pressure is just the norm in our businesses. So, it\u2019s always a headwind, but a very modest headwind. And we routinely and always offset that more than offset that with greater efficiency and net new business. So, look, there has been some lumpy repricing, but we don\u2019t see any underlying structural change or trend. So, from that perspective it\u2019s not hugely material. Thomas Gibbons : And part of our pricing schedules too are graduated. So the value of the assets increase, the pricing does reflect that volume. So, - but this is specific to repricing for existing clients and they benefit from some of the operating efficiencies and the growth in their own business. And typically, it\u2019s fairly \u2013 it\u2019s been fairly stable for a number of years. The down draft on that and it\u2019s just a little lumpy this year. We see it going back to normal. But that lumpiness will have a little bit of an impact on 2021. Alex Blostein : Got it. Understood. And then, just a clarification around NIR. It sounds like you guys are assuming MBS prepayments will remain at current levels for 2021. Can you just remind us what premium amortization was in the fourth quarter? And any sort of sensitivity you guys can provide around that with respect to prepayment fees? Emily Portney : Sure. Thomas Gibbons : As you have it. Emily Portney : I am afraid of getting this close. But I think, let\u2019s follow-up with IRS on it. Alex Blostein : Okay. Sounds great. Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Alex. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Rajiv Bhatia from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Rajiv Bhatia : Hey. Good morning. Just a quick question on the Pershing LOB. Within Pershing, how does your revenue growth compare independent broker/dealer clearing channel versus RA subsidy? And how big of a headwind the consolidation within the independent broker/dealer space what\u2019s helped clearing firms, with LPO? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. And so, we are growing faster in the registered advisory firms and then the broker/dealer side of business. But the broker/dealer size of business is a still meaningful and it\u2019s a large component of it. And so, as we look into next year, some of the consolidations, the self-clearing decisions at last had very strong growth that we\u2019ve seen. So, that\u2019s going to be a little bit of a drag for Pershing for this year. It\u2019s basically offsetting that the pipeline continues to be very strong especially in the advisory space. Rajiv Bhatia : Got it. Thanks. Emily Portney : Just, Todd, just going back about, it\u2019s still on the causes \u2013 just I didn\u2019t have it on my fingertips. MBS prepayment fees or MBS prepayments were about a headwind of $173 million in the quarter. And yes, you are correct, we just are expecting despite a steepening yield curve at the moment for that to remain stable. Thomas Gibbons : Rajiv, do you have a follow-up question? Rajiv Bhatia : No. Thank you. Thomas Gibbons : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just \u2013 Todd, just want to circle back on the front to back mandate that you are going to \u2013 the largest ones that you\u2019ve been servicing. But just wanted to get a flavor of how many others that you are dealing given that you are integrated with virtually all of the providers? Is that a sizable set of mandate for you if we consider other contracts and maybe then just if they are with some joint uses there? Thomas Gibbons : Okay. Sure. So, I mean, we\u2019ve integrated now with six platforms, partnerships with Bloomberg, Aladdin and so forth and through that, we are offering custodian size information around liquidity and it\u2019s kind of a unique capability that we are able to do transactions holdings and so forth. And I think what it does is very much enriches the experience of doing business with us. So I think it\u2019s helped us to retain relationships. I think it\u2019s helped us to grow a couple of relationships that I just indicated. So we are starting to get some traction with it.  Moving on to the data business, which we\u2019ve been in for some time. But now we\u2019ve cloud enabled it and made it much richer capability. We\u2019ve had a number of large data clients that have operating it \u2013 we are now starting to convert some of them. So, I think it\u2019s not just what they can do with us, but for the first time now, we are starting to see some meaningful wins that I would attribute, maybe not entirely to it, but certainly that was a helpful driver. Brian Bedell : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just as \u2013 can consolidation in the RA space, can you have some benefit from that or is that \u2013 do you\u2019ve seen this sort of providers going to the self-clearing option? Thomas Gibbons : Yes. As we look back historically, more often, we are winners to it. But there are \u2013 there can be different locks. And so, the acquirer had a \u2013 I think it was self-clearing or had some other approach - and so, or some other provider. So, typically, we\u2019ve found that we\u2019ve won more recently. We had a couple losses. Brian Bedell : Thank you. Fair. That\u2019s all. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Brian. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great. Thanks. One of you just kind of walk through again the Tier-1 leverage comments that you made. I guess, this quarter where it was at 6.3%, but then you gave that your target was 5.5% to 6%, but then you said, you felt you are well above where you needed to be. It seems like you are just above kind of what you are targets are. How does that impact your aspirations of capital returns? Emily Portney : Sure. And so, Tier-1 leverage is 6.3%. I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear that we are comfortable running more the rate between 5.5% to 6%. So that does imply that we have significant excess capital. And you can assume that we are going to look to return that to shareholders over the course of the year. We are committed to do so. Thomas Gibbons : Brian, the other thing that I would add to that, Brian, is that we have excess deposits right now. And so, since we are not able to do anything with our capital, we did \u2013 we are not really pushing them away or managing on this as carefully as we could. Once we get back into a normal capital management cycle, deposits that aren\u2019t worth anything we are not going to keep them here. Brian Kleinhanzl : And so, when you talk about the deposits, how does that play into the money market fee waiver that you are anticipating pushing those off into the money market funds, which has been the driver of the fee waivers or if that were to happen that could be an incremental negative to the fee waiver guidance? Emily Portney : Sure. I can take that. So, I mean, the fee waiver guidance and the increase in that is really tied to what we are seeing in the short end and tepo rates and repo rates have actually come down since we originally projected and that\u2019s really what the 175 now that I mentioned. You are correct. There is a lot of excess reserves if that all ends up in money markets, that could ultimately put more pressure. So, that is a potential risk. The one thing also just what were on waivers that I would just would highlight is that, Pershing did hit its full runrate in terms of waivers in the fourth quarter. So, you will start to see those waivers increasing in other lines of business. So, Asset Servicing, Issuer Services, high end Treasury Services, for example. Thomas Gibbons : But Brian, if money market mutual funds increase as the balances increase, we will certainly waive more fees. But net-net, we have more fees. And so, it\u2019s just that we wouldn\u2019t get the 100% of the component that we get. So they\u2019ve basically been relatively stable. So when we do these comparisons, the lines have been relatively flat. So that has increased any noise. So if money is moved into money market funds, there probably will be even much less fees than they typically would have been, but there are probably still some dips on fees. Brian Kleinhanzl : Got it. Thank you. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Brian. Okay that was our last question operator? Operator : That concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Todd for any additional or closing remarks. Thomas Gibbons : No. Thanks for your interest and obviously if you can \u2013 you can call IR to follow-up on any clarifications. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 o'clock P.M. Eastern Time today.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I will now turn the call over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Magda Palczynska : Good morning. Welcome to BNY Mellon\u2019s First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today, we will reference our financial highlights presentation available on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon\u2019s CEO will lead the call. Then, Emily Portney, our CFO, will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Emily's prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 16, 2021, and will not be updated. With that, I will hand over to Todd. Thomas Gibbons : Thank you, Magda, and good morning, everyone. I will touch on a few financial performance highlights and some other business developments and hand it over to Emily to review the results in more detail. But first, I wanted to spend a minute discussing the environment in which we're all operating. As I reflect on the past year, the word that keeps coming to mind for me is resilience. Resilience of our business model, our global financial infrastructure, and of course, our clients and our employees. Indeed, we saw the resilience of the financial system itself. These are the lessons learned from the previous financial crisis and to the quick and decisive action of governments and regulators. And now we're moving from a period of resilience to a period that we're all optimistic will be one of recovery and growth. While we all remain clear eyed about the challenges that still exist, I'm one of many business leaders who see many reasons to be positive in the period ahead when we move past the COVID cloud. The optimism stems from the confluence of several factors, including the deployment of the vaccine, potential strength from consumers. Now in the U.S., households have been saving at extraordinary levels. Currently, the savings rate is running about 14% and that's more than twice the 30-year average. The amount and held in cash and household and available for spending is around 15% of GDP, which is way above normal fund. In addition, monetary stimulus and further U.S. government spending plans are likely to accelerate GDP growth. So we expect significant GDP growth going forward assuming the pandemic is managed as expected, a strong economy is likely to keep activity and assets level high and expectations for stronger growth is beginning to be reflected in the steepening yield curve. Emily Portney : Thank you, Todd. And good morning, everyone. I will walk you through the details of our results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.  Beginning on Page 3 of the financial highlights document. In the first quarter of 2021, we reported revenue of $3.9 billion and EPS of $0.97. This includes the impact of the reserve release of about $0.08 per share, partially offset by $39 million renewable energy investment impairments of about $0.04 per share. Revenue was down 5% and EPS was down 8%. As expected, results were negatively impacted by continued low interest rates and associated money market fee waivers and the absence of share repurchase activities for most of 2020.  Fee revenue excluding fee waivers grew 6%, driven by market levels, good organic growth and the positive impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. While client activity was down slightly versus the exceptional COVID-driven volumes and balances experienced year ago, it was stronger than we had anticipated. As a reminder, last quarter, we got into about 1.5% organic growth for the year and this quarter organic growth of greater than 2%. Operator : Of course, thank you.  And our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to ask actually, Emily, about some of those comments on capital and Fed, returning to the SCB approach, in the capital returns. The Tier 1 leverage ratio now inside your guided band, with the buffer of 5.5 to 6 I believe. You all have referenced that you have levers to pull, which might help on that front? So could you maybe walk us through some of those dynamics? And then also, how rigid is that buffer that you've applied? It seems to be a bit above peers. And so, would you -- are you in a position where you could allow yourself to go underneath that buffer for a period of time given the unusual growth in the past? Emily Portney : Sure. Thanks for the question. So we are very \u2013 managing our deposits very closely. Having said that, we will absolutely continue to support our clients with our balance sheet. And we're comfortable with where deposits are now. But of course, it goes without saying that, over the course of the last 12 months, there have been a lot of additional reserves in the system, liquidity in the system. And so, we've seen a surge in those deposits. A large portion of that search is excess, so it's non-operational. We've been very successfully working with our clients to basically explore and move some of those non-operational deposits to off-balance sheet vehicles. Thankfully, we have a good platform and liquidity direct to that has lots of alternatives. It's an open platform. So that has been very effective. You are correct in pointing out, as I did mention in my prepared remarks, that given the unprecedented liquidity in the system, we would feel comfortable dipping into our chairman leverage buffer. We do hold a very significant buffer in excess of 150 basis points over Reg minimums. We size that very carefully.  It's basically to both absorb any impact to OCI, given rate changes, as well as also the \u2013 any surge in balances. And given that's really what we've seen, and the buffer is really there for this particular kind of unprecedented environment. Ultimately, we would feel comfortable dipping below the 5.5% for a period of time, of course, running certainly above the regulatory minimum. Brennan Hawken : Right. Okay. That helps. That's a great to hear. And then one other question on the balance sheet. It seemed as though the interest-bearing asset growth lagged deposit growth this quarter on an average basis just looking at the off-balance sheet. Was that because some of those deposits may be temporary? Maybe you all were in the process of encouraging some folks to consider off-balance sheet options that you referenced? And therefore, when we gauge balance sheet growth here this quarter, we should more pay attention. Which one should we pay attention to more? Which one is more effective? Is it the interest-bearing asset growth or is it deposit growth? And or is it just that you'll be putting more money to work and therefore the interest-bearing asset growth will catch up? I just wondered, it seemed a big gap. So I wasn't sure about that. Thank you. Emily Portney : Yeah. I mean, - sure. So, certainly, and I think I just mentioned, a significant portion of the deposit growth that we've seen, we do think is excess and so non-operational. So it's very hard to really redeploy that into the securities portfolio or the loan portfolio for any real duration. So as a result, a lot of that is just sitting at the Fed earning 10 basis points, which obviously is dilutive to NIM, but of course, it is overall accretive to NIR just obviously marginally so.  So when we think about just NIR in general, we really just use the forward curve to project. And despite, of course, the steepening of the long end of the curve, we did see the short end grind lower. And also the duration of the curb where we invest is, is more in the two to five-year mark and that didn't go up as much as the long end. But of course, to the extent the curve does continue to steepen and/or shift upwards, that will be extraordinarily helpful. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for the color. Operator : And we'll take our next question from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Can you hear me? Thomas Gibbons : Yes, Brian. We can hear you. Brian Bedell : Great to hear you. Thanks. Just one more on the rate sensitive and net interest revenue and fee waivers is down just the cadence as we move through the year, really into the second quarter. And back a little bit to that deposit strategy with the excess deposits, is there an ability to put a little bit more in the securities portfolio, as we move into the second quarter? So what I'm trying to get at is, are we \u2013 given your full-year guidance or are we at sort of stability, as you see it coming into the second quarter on NIR, is it \u2013 maybe it depend before we go up?  And then similar to that on the fee waivers, I think, you said $220 million for the second quarter, but then I'm not sure if I got this correct, that you thought that was going to include in the back half and that was based on balances. Can you clarify that? Thomas Gibbons : Emily? Emily Portney : Sure. So in terms of NIR, we don't really give ultimately quarter-by-quarter balances and so much of it is dependent upon -- or quarter-by-quarter projections and so much of it is dependent upon obviously the rate curve deposit levels, and as prepayment and other factors, all of which are baked into our projections. And what I would say as I just reconfirmed is that our full-year projection for NIR is still the same as the original guidance given which is 11% or 12% down year-on-year. So that hasn't changed fully. In terms of waivers. So waivers are a function of two things. Basically, short term rates, so that's specifically three months and six months to those as well as repo rates, also a function of money market funds balances. And actually, what we saw this quarter is actually both rates grind lower, balances go higher. As a result, waivers overall were a bit higher than originally anticipated at $188 million. They were -- that the total impact however was slightly positive to revenues.  And again, just reuse the forward curve to also project waivers. Looking at the forward curve, also the historical relationship between rates and money market balances, et cetera, we think that waivers -- the size of waivers overall will peak in the second quarter at about $220 million. And then -- and by the way, that would be probably at the fees we're talking about that most CEOs are talking about probably slightly negative to revenues. But then we would expect the second-half of the year to be more in line with the first quarter.  And look, I always like to remind people, albeit it's probably not till 2020 -- the latter half of 2022 or 2023. But if \u2013 when Fed funds eventually hit 2025, when the Fed moves, we will recover in excess of 50% of those waivers and hit 1%. It's very close to 100% of those waivers. Brian Bedell : Definitely. That's a good color. And then the second question is on organic growth, you said it could pick up to 2% this quarter. Maybe could you just talk about the drivers of that? And Todd, you mentioned you have very good demand for data analytics with the Data Vault. Sounds like a contract not in -- at the beginning you mentioned is not in the run-rate yet. But maybe if you could just talk about that momentum in the organic growth rate and drivers of that. Thomas Gibbons : Sure. So thanks for the question, Brian. So the first quarter, we got the benefit obviously a lot of activity. Hard to project exactly where that activity is going to go. But the guidance, I think that Emily provided to you, is probably not sustainable at this level. But we did get some nice movement which is -- which really is reflected in that. Pershing volumes were particularly high, very good flows and a number of their accounts. So we're seeing a lot of good growth with existing clients as well with balances there.  We do expect them as I said, to moderate somewhat. And I also did point out that on the previous call that we had some lost business in purging that'll impact us later this year. So purging is got pretty strong underlying organic growth to it, but it's going to be masked a bit by both the interest rates as well as that lost business that will impact in the second half. But we are seeing sustained momentum across just about all of our businesses, strong pipelines.  And so as we've taken that as converted the pipeline to sales, we continue to build the pipeline. We have another pretty big quarter for sales, a higher win-loss ratio -- with our win loss ratios are improving, and retention has continued to be to be good. I mentioned, the Data Vault and we have a number of clients in Data. We've now signed a very significant one and building deeper relationships with that client. A lot of interest in our -- some of our analytics and applications that we've described to before. We're actually seeing recovery and payment flows. So it's Treasury Services, which is largely commercial payments. A lot of its global. We're seeing good recovery back on economic recovery.  And we're also picking up some market share. We've got some pretty interesting opportunities there. As we look forward, we're pretty excited what we might be able to do in the real time payments space. Asset Wealth Management had positive flows. We're seeing meaningful improvement in wealth. And we've been talking about the investments that we're making across the businesses, both in -- even in the core custody, our middle office functions, the payment system. Clearing and collateral management. It was off of an extraordinary good quarter last year. But we continue to pick up global assets. The fact that we built up this Bond Connect capability and China's is an exciting, innovative service that we're providing to clients. And we're confident that that's going to continue to grow. So, good underlying momentum helped by very strong activity in the first quarter. Brian Bedell : That's great. All right. Thank you. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question that comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Thomas Gibbons : Hi, Betsy. Emily Portney : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Okay. A couple of questions, a little bit on the technical side on the build out that you're doing around the digital assets, the cryptocurrencies and that kind of thing. Could you remind us the kind of pace that you're anticipating being able to roll this out? And are you going to be -- are you going to be custodying the physicals? Just wanted to understand what the -- how wide the aperture is on this opportunity side? Thomas Gibbons : Okay. Sure, Betsy. I'll take it. It's Todd. So when we talk about our digital asset efforts, what we're talking about is digitizing traditional securities so that they're more easily mobilized. Things like you can digitize them, you can digitize the money market fund and make it an eligible asset to put into repo, which couldn't do in the past and we can make it much, much more efficient.  We think there's going to be quite a bit of that activity, as well as smart contracts and what that might be able to do for the corporate trust and other businesses. So that's one element of it.  The other thing that we're going to see is we think there'll be digitization of currencies. We're already involved in a consortium with the finality, which is a central bank currency, which could trade 24/7 in digital form, and is really just developing regulatory approvals for it now. So we do think there'll be -- and there are already existing digital currencies, fiat currencies. And wherever it is the thing that gets the highest is really around the cryptocurrencies, but we will be digitizing them -- and excuse me, we would be customizing those as well.  So we have been working on a prototype, and we expect to be offering capabilities across all three of those by the end of the year, as we're building things out with clients that have shown institutional interest. So yes, we would actually have the wallet if you will, or that be the custodian for the underlying cryptocurrency or any one of those particular digitized assets. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So you would actually be custodying the physicals, you're not going to be sub-custodying that out somebody else? Thomas Gibbons : That is not our intent at this point. Betsy Graseck : And then, what's the timeframe for getting to market? Is that a 2021 or '22 timeframe? Thomas Gibbons : We expect that you'll be hearing some things out -- towards the end of 2021. But it may be a little bit earlier for some elements of it. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then the other thing I want to just touch base on was around the climate comment that you had in your prepared remarks, Todd. I mean, part of it is asking the question, what can you do? Is this about your own footprint? Or is this also about working with your clients? And if it's working with your clients, how do you anticipate you will help them get more climate-friendly so to speak? Thomas Gibbons : Yeah. So there's really two elements to it, Betsy. One is what we're doing as an enterprise, our own carbon footprint, for example. And we've been very active. We published recently -- in February, we published a Considering Climate at BNY Mellon report, which gave very specific examples of what we've done around carbon waste, and other environmental-related activities. And we are carbon-neutral.  We have them for an extended period of time. And we've been named as by the CDP, really is one of five financial institutions that have been given an A-rating on climate. And we've been -- we're the only financial institution that have gotten that rating over the past eight-years. So that's what we're doing as a firm and managing paper and carbon footprint. In terms of what we're also doing is we're providing services to clients. For example, we're the largest trustee on Green bonds. And we can certainly help clients establish the trustee function that goes along with that. But in addition, in the asset servicing space, one of the things that have come out of our data and analytics capability is a very interesting application on ESG and allowing our clients to customize reviews of their own portfolios. And we use a cloud-sourcing techniques that you need. And we offer a cloud-based solution.  The client basically brings the license from what data providers. We are connected to 100 data providers. We got 2.5 million securities in that application. And then there's kind of a constant feedback loop to the to the data providers so they're constantly enhancing the amount of information that they might have on a particular security. So we're excited about that. We have quite a few clients on it now. And we're just contracting them as for permanent usage.  And in addition to that, in our Investment Management space, we're building quite a few ESG products. And in the servicing space, we know we were just awarded an attractive ETF that was based on ESG. So it's really goes in those two forms. One is the commercial element that we can help our businesses. The number two is just doing the right thing for our own company. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thank you. Appreciate that color. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning, Todd and Emily. Hope you guys are doing well. Maybe another question around capital. So I heard you guys, obviously targeting over 100% payout, that's something that you guys have targeted for a little while as well. Can you help us kind of calibrate that against the significant buyback you have authorized currently?  Obviously, there'll be some probably technical restrictions that you could ultimately get done in the third quarter given just the volume threshold. But maybe help us think through that relative to your comments and willingness to kind of go below the 5.5% Tier 1 leverage. So just kind of trying to think through how much you could ultimately get done. Emily Portney : Sure. So, ultimately, you are correct in mentioning that we had approval. I just want to remind folks, the Board approval was given in the fourth quarter of last year to do buybacks up to $4.4 billion through the third quarter of this year. Given the Fed's limitations on buybacks actually through the second quarter, it's probably going to be pretty unlikely that we could execute the entirety of the $4.4 billion just literally in terms of ADB et cetera. But we will do as much as we are allowed. And assuming that the Fed does return to or implemented I should say, the SCB framework, which does allow for much more flexibility, we wouldn't tend to certainly execute in excess of 100% of return -- I should say, in excess of 100% of earnings in the third quarter, as much as we could do. And anything that we couldn't do, we would hope to catch up in the fourth quarter in that program. Alex Blostein : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe we can unpack some of the NIR dynamics a little bit more. So two questions there. I guess one, deposit clause, I think we're roughly flattish I guess the question really just in terms of what you guys are targeting. Is there room for that to grind a little bit lower as you're trying to optimize the balance sheet, or there's not a whole lot you guys can do in terms of pushing pricing on deposits to clients?  And then I wanted to clarify your comments around premium amortization. I don't know if I missed it, but what was it in the quarter and your full year NIR guidance, what does it assume for premium am for the rest of the year? Emily Portney : Sure. So just talking about first deposit. You are right, that the deposit rates are relatively flat. And remember, that's an average across to non-U.S. dollar as well as U.S. dollar. We are charging in -- for example, euros and for Japanese yen. We're not of course charging for the in the US.  I mean, look, there -- I don't know if this is the trough, but this is probably pretty much close to ultimately I guess the rate that we get to. Of course, if rates actually went negative in the U.S., we could start charging for deposits. We certainly don't feel or unhappy about that that is necessary. And ironically, if you if you do start charging for deposits, then you start to earn money, earn more in NIR. So, but that isn't the intention at the moment. In terms of your -- Thomas Gibbons : Let me just ask something to that. So I think maybe on the Fed guidance, Alex, that they've provided. They really have talked about that being mean to them to limit any possibility of negative rates for any sustainable time. And we've seen repo rates go negative a little bit. So we do think that there are probably policy actions if that were to dip down.  But as we go through the -- as we scrub through the nature of the deposits that we've gotten, and obviously very limited value to them. Now we've got to hold capital against them. We are we winding them down, but there's not a whole lot more to grind down. Alex Blostein : Yep. Thomas Gibbons : And then certainly, Emily second one? Emily Portney : Sure. On the MBS prepayments space, just in our NIR projections, we've already taken into account a trajectory of MBS prepayment slowing down just based upon the rising in rates. So just to think about it in terms of sizing, we would expect the MBS prepayment speeds to slow down by about probably 15% to 20% by year-end. Alex Blostein : Great. Thank you very much. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. You had some good fee growth in servicing that you talked about through the volumes that should moderate. Is that kind of expectations around purging? And what are you seeing purging or retail behavior? You have a window into that world like that? Thomas Gibbons : Yeah, Mike. I'll take that. So it's a -- I think it's a combination of things. So we've seen a lot of activity in the trading space. We've seen a -- we have seen retail activity that was very high as you know. And purging does see some of that. But it's been in the institutional side as well as the retail side. And we would expect that to subside somewhat from the elevated levels that we saw in the first quarter. But what's interesting is the institutional business is probably a little more active in March, and the retail business was probably a little more active in January and February. Mike Mayo : Okay. So you're seeing a slowdown in retail trading as the quarter went on? I mean, as people return back to work, do you think they trade less or anything related to that? Thomas Gibbons : We think their supervisors keep an eye on what they're doing at their desks a little bit more? I'm not sure I agree that. But it's very hard to say, Mike, because what you got to remember is there is a massive amount of cash sloshing around the system. And it's got to go somewhere. One of the things that I pointed out the savings rate doubled with the national average. We've got 15% -- and households are holding 15% of GDP in cash. They're either going to spend it investment or just let it lose value sitting in cash. So our guess is that we're probably going to see lower activity, but it's -- my guess is as good as yours. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then, just one last question on the fee waivers. Your customers must love you. I mean, can this is -- I mean, this is $220 million fee waivers in the second quarter coming up. I mean, hopefully, you're building long-term goodwill, but shareholders don't benefit from that. So I mean, certainly not going to charge for deposits, or any other options there or just you just have to  it and hope you get long-term goodwill. Thomas Gibbons : Let me start Emily and you can follow up on it. So, a lot of the excess balances is ending up in cash or even ending up in money market funds. So we considered -- we continue to see this cash build. So even though it's $220 million of fee waivers, it's awesome. A lot of that's just driven by excess balances that we don't think are going to be there when interest rates recover. Just like we think the excess reserves in the system will obviously can contract.  That being said, we do think it provides a lot of upside when the market turns around which we've reflected in the last time we went through this cycle. And we can earn a little bit on it still. And a little bit of good news is that the Fed speak recently has been pointing to the possibility to firm things up on the short end of the curve. And we've actually seen the forward rates kind of improved a little bit recently.  So we're making the assumption that using the forward curve from a few days ago, when we gave that guidance that fee waivers will be acted by like they did during the first quarter. That being said it is a significant hit to earnings. We think we'll recover it. We still ran a 29% operating margin, even with that environment. And the other thing that we've done is between NIR and fee waivers, we think we are now at or very close to the trough. And it could obviously worsen with interest rates even got a little bit lower. But we think we are close to the trough. And so the business model is now going to start to grow off of this level. Mike Mayo : Great. Thank you. Emily Portney : Mike, the only thing I just want to add to that is, just remember that a large portion of those waivers are really just funds that we distribute. So it's where the kind of the recipient of just lower fees versus competitive waivers that we're actually offering in Asset Management. Mike Mayo : Great, thank you for that. Operator : And our next question that comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jeffries. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Just had a follow up on the Asset Services fee line. It was nice to see the 5% improvement sequentially. And I just wondered, last quarter you had mentioned some of that bulkier repricing and kind of onetime things. This quarter, you mentioned that there's a little bit of elevated activity. Just wondering from an outlook perspective, anything we should know, just about -- kind of the trajectory of onboarding new wins and we kind of do have a clear line of sight on any expected meaningful repricing this year? Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Emily, do you want to take it. Emily Portney : Sure. So, we did see a nice uptick in terms of assets servicing fees. They were up 5%, actually sequentially. And just, 50% of that is due to asset base -- asset levels and the remaining 50% is based on transaction volumes. And transaction volumes across asset servicing -- all of our businesses and asset servicing was up significantly, double digits in some cases quarter-on-quarter. As Todd alluded to, we do expect that volumes to moderate a bit in the second half. Having said that, we also feel that there's very strong fundamentals across the business, our pipeline is strong, the average size deals in the pipeline are bigger. Retention stats are very strong, and we're also making significant investments in the business that are resonating with clients.  In terms of the repricing. There's nothing really structural that that we observed repricing. The repricing that we did experience last quarter that was a bit lumpy was really -- totally tied to just a few large clients that happened to be going RFP at the same time. It's always been a pretty modest headwind for the business that we've been able to offset with new business retention, growth with our existing clients and further efficiency. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thanks for that, Emily. And then just one more balance sheet question. In terms of Fed accommodation, the incremental deposits that flowed in and certainly seem to lend on your balance sheet? How are you just anticipating changes as we go forward with potential end to QE? And how do you think your balance sheet would act versus the more traditional regional banks in terms of the retention of the deposits that have flowed in? Thank you. Emily Portney : Sure. So, ultimately, we think when -- we basically -- as the Fed increases reserves, we think roughly about 2% or so ends up on our balance sheet. It's actually hard to tell and depends very much on the economic backdrop. As I did mention, we do think, a large portion of the deposits that we've seen, and the growth in those deposits, especially in the last two quarters is excess, so non-operating. And we do think that that would recede pretty quickly when interest rates start to normalize, and monetary policy starts to normalize. I don't know, Todd, if you have anything to add to that. Thomas Gibbons : Yeah. I think if you go back to previously the COVID event, which really led to a spike. We've seen something close to $100 million of balance increases. Some of that was intentional, as we built relationships and comes naturally with the growth in our businesses. But a significant amount of that was what we call fit into that excess definition.  So we'd have imagined probably, somewhere between $25 billion to $50 billion of that 100 billion increase would roll off. Ken Usdin : Got it? Okay. Thank you. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks Ken. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just, if I think about your guidance on NII, it does seem like the implication is that NII sort of stabilizing here. And I assume, that implies sort of securities yields are going to kind of hold in at current levels. So if we kind of assume a static balance sheet going forward, and I know that's not necessarily. But when I think about it, but if we assumed try to isolate what could be the inflection point? What level of rates -- I think you've indicated two to five-years\u2019 important. You're not going to go further out than that. And we've had the five-year now at 83 basis points moving higher. Do we need to see that translate into the two to three-year? I mean, what level of rate structure should we start to see maybe yields going the other way? Thomas Gibbons : Why don't I start Emily and then you can add? So I think really two key elements to it, Jim. Number one is the short end of the curve. So we've got a significant number of assets that are pricing off of LIBOR or short-term indices. And once again, this quarter, we saw for example, one-month LIBOR was down three basis points from its average in the fourth quarter and 2 basis points for three-months LIBOR. So we got a -- that offset the benefit of the move on the longer part of the curve. But the steepening up to five-years and then we keep the duration around two and a half years so that that would mean there's going to be significant assets out there that roll off and get reinvestment is helpful, and it will slowly come into it. But it's basically been offset -- that benefit has been offset by what we saw on the short end of the curve. Jim Mitchell : That make sense. I was just trying to think through, assuming short rates are pretty stable from here. What kind it gets -- what at the longer end really starts to help you? Thomas Gibbons : Yeah. I mean five and 10 years, because what that does is it extends the duration of the mortgage-backed securities. So their yields pick up because the amortization of premium declines. And stuff -- and we're constantly reinvesting and stuff gets reinvested to maintain the duration that currently exists in the portfolio. It would go into higher level. So it would be helpful here. Emily Portney : And Jim, we disclosed in the Q, just some sensitivities that might be helpful for you to realize that. Jim Mitchell : I got it. I just trying to get a sense of what level of rates in the middle of the curve would be helpful, but we can talk about that offline. Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Jim. Operator : And our next question that comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Michael Anagnostakis : Hey, good morning. This is Michael Anagnostakis on for Steven. Just following up on the NII guide. And you gave us detail around where you're deploying some of that excess liquidity from here. And I appreciate the color on premium am as well. Maybe you can just provide some color around how much of that deployment is contemplated in the NII guide for the securities portfolio? Emily Portney : Sure. I mean our securities portfolio is basically flat to last quarter. And we are marginally increasing our non-HQLA within the quarter. But, when I talked about the NIR guidance for the full year still being about 11% to 12%, where the rate curve -- it's just based on the forward curve, deposits basically remaining pretty much where they are if not coming down a bit and MBS prepayment speeds going down. So those are the key assumptions. Michael Anagnostakis : Thank you for taking my questions. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Steven. Operator : Our next question that comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Todd. Good morning. Emily. Can you frame out for us when you think about your new year's event in New York, the number of new products that Bank of New York has introduced over the years? I think of like custody of non-traditional assets as one. When you think about the opportunities for this digital digitalization and the cryptocurrencies that you guys are working on, that you've already talked about. How big can this be? And again, comparing it to other new ventures that you've been involved with over the years at Bank of New York if you compare that? Thomas Gibbons : Yeah. I think it's early to tell. I mean, if you think of all the noise that Bitcoin got, so it's still only about 10% of gold and gold is a custodized asset is not that important, frankly. So it's getting a lot of hype. I do think decentralized finance is coming. I do think fintechs are going to be an important players and I do think that we can position ourselves well and work with fintechs to build opportunities. I think you're going to see it in payments. I think you're going to see it -- you are going to see it in custody. It's hard for me to say just how big of an opportunity that is at this point. It will grow. I think the more important thing is that we need to give investors choice. And so if they do want to mobilize assets faster, we need to be able to help them to do that. If they do want to be able to hold to non-traditional assets, just as they went into alternatives and other things, we need to be able to help them to do that in a way that eliminates a lot of the counterparty risk that currently exists, which is high. And also enables them to get reporting on a consolidated basis, and valuations and so forth, which is also critically important.  And so there are a number of ETFs coming out, that are crypto-related. There is obviously good underlying growth on a very, very small base. We think it's an important part of the full product capability. How big it ultimately comes, I think they become, I think it's just little early for me to really speculate. Gerard Cassidy : I see. Okay, thank you. And the second you guys touched -- go ahead Emily. Emily Portney : Yeah. I was just going to add one little thing, which is it's as much about retention as it also is about new business. Our clients are demanding integrated capabilities across digital assets, as well as traditional securities and currencies. Gerard Cassidy : Got it. Thank you. You guys have always told us and you talked about it again today, the leverage ratio is the binding constraint, not the CET1 ratio. You pointed Emily that they may dip down below 5.5%, but still well above the regulatory minimums, we understand that. At what point would the leverage ratio actually come into play where you would have to back away from your buybacks? Even though you have the CET1 ratio, not a problem. But at what point, do you say, we've got to slow it down, because the leverage ratio is falling too far down?  And as part of that, is the leverage ratio really linked to the QE, meaning that deposit growth? And should we get a tapering, then we should get some relief on your balance sheet growth, which maybe would help a leverage ratio as well? Thomas Gibbons : So yeah. Let me start Emily, and then you can add. If you think about it, we've put a buffer on the leverage ratio for business as usual. Now this isn't for interest I think but for business as usual. And that buffer really reflects the potential for a spike in interest -- excuse me, a spike in deposits or a decline due to other comprehensive interest income based on the mark-to-market in the securities portfolio?  And so, frankly, to our routinely spike in deposits, and could it go up a little bit higher? Yeah, it may. But our view now is part of the reason for the buffer has already taken place. And as I indicated on one of the earlier questions, when things start to normalize, we probably have $50 billion of runoff in deposits. So that's an enormous amount, enormous impact on that ratio. And also the coverage from the OCI that has to be that high. So given the fact that we've already made this bike, it makes sense for us to go ahead and dip into our buffers. And then we said, you're going to a 5% probably is not an unreasonable thing in this environment.  If we are in an environment where we were a year ago, I'm not sure, I would say that. Emily Portney : The only thing I might add is just, even if we were going in -- like it's hard to certainly be comfortable going towards 5%. But even there, you would need a considerable increase in deposits there from where we are today. We've got plenty of room. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks Gerard. Operator :  And our next question comes from the line of Robert Wildhack from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Robert Wildhack : Good morning, guys. If we could go back to the cryptocurrency and digital asset space for a second. You're clearly taking a few steps forward there with the announcements you made this quarter. Is that because we think we've hit some kind of inflection point in that part of the market or is it just more of a natural evolution of your service? Thomas Gibbons : Yeah. Rob, I would say it's more of a natural evolution. We're having deep discussions, working with clients in the institutional side. And we started to see this toward the end of last year and the beginning of this year. The institutional side was getting more and more interested in digital assets. And so, we started working with them for solutions across a broad part of our business. Robert Wildhack : Okay, thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Okay, Rob. Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yep. Thanks. Two questions here. One on the assets held security exhibit on how the underlying pricing is with 50% for asset levels and 50% for transaction volume. Where do you want to take those percentages? So longer term, you have the mix that you're at? And this would be steady state from here? Are you trying to get more transaction volume basis as we think how pricing turns them off here? Emily Portney : Do you want me to take that, Todd? Thomas Gibbons : Sure. Emily Portney : So I mean, the 50-50 split is just the nature of the business. So it's not like we are trying to move that in any direction. And for pretty much years, that's just really the dynamics of how we're price and asset servicing. About 50% of the revenue stream is based on asset levels, and about 50% or so is based on transaction costs. So it's pretty much the norm. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. The second question, I mean, we looked at issuer services and clearing services and revenue drivers both been impacted by interest rates above and beyond. The money market fee waivers, is there any way to allocate what part of those revenues are kind of driven by interest rates as we think about asset sensitivity on a go forward basis? Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Sure. So both of those businesses are significant deposit taking businesses or either we take it on balance sheet or off balance sheet and through sweeps into money market funds. And so the interest rate impact. It's a meaningful contribution to both of them. I don't think we broken out exactly what the split is, but it is a -- and it's a meaningful contribution obviously to the operating margins, because there's no expense associated with the NIR. What we've seen in Treasury Services is an intentional build in deposits over the past year as we build out those relationships. And it's very much related to the activity in the accounts, because it needs to be cash and accounts to make payments. And there's some frictional cash that tends to come with that.  Money market fee waivers a little less important there. But if you think about the corporate trust business, what issuers will do is they'll put cash a day or two in advance of payments that need to be made on issues that were the trustee and the paying agent. And typically, that's value that where we get a little of that value, or we sweep it into a money market fund. And so that's a meaningful contributor to that business. And that's where we're now seeing the kind of late stages impact of fee waivers. And that's why the issuer services business was down sequentially and year over year. But we don't break out to very specific numbers Brian. Operator, go ahead. Operator : With that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Todd with any additional or closing remarks. Thomas Gibbons : No. Thanks for all of your interest. And of course, any follow up questions you may reach out to Magda and our Investor Relations team. And look forward to talking to you all soon. Take care. Emily Portney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 o'clock PM Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the 2021 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Marius Merz : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the BNY Mellon's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our financial highlights presentation available on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. Thomas Gibbons : Thank you, Marius, and good morning, everyone. Now, I'm going to touch on a few of the highlights before I hand it over to Emily, and she'll review our second quarter financial results and the outlook for the second half of the year in more detail. So if we refer to Slide 2 of the financial highlights presentation, we reported EPS of $1.13, that's on $4 billion of revenue, and we generated a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Fee revenue was up 4% year-over-year, and it was up 10%, excluding the impact of money market fee waivers. Average deposits were down 1% quarter-over-quarter. This, together with strong capital generation, drove an approximately 20 basis point increase in our Tier 1 leverage ratio. And we are pleased with the results of this year's supervisory stress tests, which once again demonstrated the resilience of our business model and the strength of our balance sheet, even under severe stress. And we also welcomed the Fed's decision to lift the recent restrictions on common stock dividends and share repurchases at the end of June. Now, taking a step back for a look at the broader operating environment. We continue to be impacted by the significant amount of excess cash in the system. We welcomed the Fed's decision to raise the IOER and the overnight reverse repo rate by 5 basis points last month. That provided a bit of support to short-term rates, although they continue to be exceptionally low by historical standards. Money market funds take up of the Fed's reverse repo facility increased from approximately $500 billion prior to the Fed's action to north of $750 billion, and they actually spiked to almost $1 trillion at quarter end. This means that somewhere between 15% and 20% of total U.S. money market fund assets are being parked at the Fed, earning 5 basis points. Now given the significant amount of excess cash in the system and the expectation for further Fed balance sheet expansion, bank balance sheets will continue to be under pressure, but money market funds may provide some relief. Emily Portney : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of our results for the quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless I specify otherwise. Beginning on Page 3. Total revenue was lower by 1% due to lower net interest revenue and higher money market fee waivers, partially offset by strong fee growth. Fee revenue grew 4%, or 10% excluding the impact of fee waivers. This reflects the positive impact of higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher client activity. Other revenue was $91 million and included approximately $30 million of investment disposal and other income gains. Net interest revenue was down 17%. Expenses increased 3% with about two-thirds driven by the weaker U.S. dollar. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $86 million, driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast. EPS was $1.13, and pretax margin was 32%. Moving to page 4, which shows a trend analysis of the main drivers of our quarterly results. Investment Services revenue was $3 billion, down 4% year-on-year, mainly driven by lower net interest revenue and higher fee waivers. Excluding fee waivers, Investment Services fee and other revenue was up 5%, reflecting increased client activity and organic growth in assets from existing clients, higher liquidity balances and market levels and the benefit of the weaker U.S. dollar. Investment and Wealth Management revenue of $1 million increased 13% as higher market values and the benefit of the weaker U.S. dollar more than offset the impact of fee waivers. Excluding fee waivers, fee and other revenue was up 21%. Money market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense were $252 million in the quarter, up $64 million from the prior quarter, which impacted pretax income by approximately $40 million, sequentially. Higher waivers were driven by lower key bill and repo rates as well as higher average balances. Turning to page 5. Our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong and well above internal targets and regulatory minimums. Our CET1 ratio was 12.6%, flat to Q1 under the standardized approach. And our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is our binding capital constraint was 6%, up approximately 20 basis points sequentially due to net capital generation and a 2% quarter-over-quarter decrease in average assets. Average deposit balances declined by 1% as we've been successful at curtailing deposit growth by working with our clients to move excess deposits to off balance sheet vehicles, namely money market funds, which were up roughly 9% sequentially, outpacing the industry. Finally, our LCR was 110% flat to the prior quarter. Operator :  Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : And thanks for taking away like 17 of my questions with that outlook. That was helpful. Can I get a follow-up on the expense question? So if you look at year-on-year, it was up 3%, I heard your guide. It was - expenses were down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Can we talk about the growth opportunity piece you mentioned? What growth opportunities are you investing in? And what kind of payback can we expect? How do you think about that given your huge excess capital? I'm just - my real question is why not invest more? So that's where I'm going with it. Emily Portney : It's a great question, Glenn. Thank you. So, as you have rightfully pointed out, we have been extraordinarily disciplined on expenses, and we've actually held them flat over the course of the last four years. Everything that we're talking about here are investments in growth and efficiency, and just to name a few. So certainly, digital assets and all the things we've talked about around digital assets, data and analytics, advisory services in Pershing as well as the managed account space. I'd highlight also electronic payment and collection services and Treasury Services. And then the remainder would be modernizing and automating our - both our risk management and our operations infrastructure. And really, as you alluded to, we had a very strong half. We have a very strong capital-generative model. There are interesting opportunities. All of these have been properly vetted and truly will drive incremental growth and efficiency. So we feel now it's an important time to invest. Thomas Gibbons : Glenn, you're still there? I think we lost you. Glenn Schorr : Yes. Sorry about that. I appreciate all that, Emily. Maybe just a quick follow-up on Pershing. So in past, you spoke about some - maybe some headwinds in the second half. Are you able to quantify that? Just give us that heads up on what to expect in the second half? And maybe at the high level, talk about the competitive backdrop there, because it seems like some - yet another competitor is poking their nose in and trying to get involved on the high rate clear\u2026 Emily Portney : Sure. I can start and I'm sure Todd can add. Just in terms of the impact of the lost business that we had, talked about in the past, it's going to be about $20 million per quarter going forward. And that is, by the way, Glenn, baked into the forecast. So that is embedded in there. And yes, it is a competitive space. And actually, that particular piece of business that we're talking about was really - were just on the wrong side of some M&A activity. So we do - although, we see a lot of growth and a lot of opportunity, there's certainly further consolidation as well. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. And I would add the consolidation that we've seen is actually a positive for us. So we've got a very robust pipeline. We continue to add a significant number of accounts over the course of the quarter, and as well as seeing significant growth in funds. And we think there's opportunity to actually invest more. So what we did this quarter is we actually separated the businesses into two. One is the institutional side, where we have some unique capabilities with some very large clients and we've got some pretty good leads there that we're excited about. But also on the advisory and the broker-dealer side, we think we can invest there and garner some more of what's a very fast-growing industry. There is some competition there. But the consolidation has also provided some opportunity for us. So we do get - every now and then, you get a lumpy loss due to an M&A. We've looked at over history that really - it hasn't changed. We probably won more than we've lost. But we have pointed out that will have an impact in the third quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Can you speak to your efforts on deposits? It seems like you had some success keeping deposits flat to down. Is that deliberate efforts on your part, with less demand for your balance sheet? Maybe you could just speak to the deposit growth in the quarter and how you think about it going forward? Emily Portney : Sure. I'll take that. So you're right, we have been proactively managing deposits and very successfully. We've been working with our clients, and you can see that in our trends. So despite the Fed and - continuing to pump access liquidity into the system, ultimately, we have managed our deposits, and they're down 1% sequentially. This has been very much a coordinated effort with our salespeople and our clients and in terms of looking at what's excess on our balance sheet, we probably think we have about $25 billion to $50 billion that still excess. But what we have been doing is looking at what is excess and actually working with our clients to move it to off balance sheet vehicles such as money market funds. That's partially why you see a 9% growth in our money market fund balances that were driving waivers. And we're fortunate, too, in that we have a very robust liquidity solutions business. We offer both in-house as well as third-party solutions. And that has been certainly very attractive to our clients as we've endeavored to the balance sheet. And look, going forward, we will continue to do that. It's - we're comfortable where we are. But certainly, we will continue to do that considering there still likely be more liquidity coming into the system. Thomas Gibbons : Jim, it's a very disciplined process that Emily leads along with the salespeople, treasury function. And we look at it client by client. And the good news is we've been able to capture most of that in our money market funds or our liquidity direct offerings. So we are gaining market share there. And we've got a little bit of benefit when the Fed did increase the interest rate on excess reserves and the reverse repo that have made that alternative. They provided a bit of an outlet. So, we think even though the Fed will probably continue to provide liquidity and build their balance sheet that we should be able to manage it. Jim Mitchell : Right. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up to that, if you think, you've had success on the leverage ratio, when we think about the buyback that you're targeting over the next 18 months, can you front-load that? How do we think about the cadence of buybacks? Thomas Gibbons : Sure, Emily? Emily Portney : Sure. So certainly, the cadence of buybacks is going to be determined by lots of different factors. Our capital position, our forward outlook for earnings, et cetera. But you can definitely assume that considering we have about $2 billion of excess capital now, and that's just against our binding constraint of Tier 1 leverage, frankly, we have more excess capital when you actually think about what the - a normalized balance sheet size probably is and when some of those excess deposits received. So assuming - taking that into account, taking into account the fact that we've also committed to our shareholders that we will return 100% of earnings over time, it's safe to assume that we'll probably front-load that $6 billion of authorization that we received from the Board. Operator : Next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : So maybe just starting with the NIR guide for the back half, it looks like the amount continues to kind of grind lower a little bit and maybe given what the forward curve has done relative to last quarter, not particularly surprising, but curious if you guys feel like the most of the pain is now in the run rate. Is this the right sort of jumping off point to think about as we sort of start to pencil out into 2022? Emily Portney : Sure. So I hesitate to call a trough because every time we do it, it's not accurate. But in terms of just our forward - our outlook, we just use the forward curve when we project NIR. We don't try to get cute. Short-term rates are a bit lower in the forward curve than they were a couple of months ago. Likewise, as you all have seen, the long end has come down and the curve is flattening. And likewise, in terms of prepayment fees, they have been elevated. And although we do expect them to slow down by the end of the year, they're probably going to still be more elevated than we had originally anticipated. So all of those things are just baked into the 14% down year-on-year. Thomas Gibbons : Yes, a couple of things. I mean, one of the key drivers is short-term rates when you look at LIBOR\u2019s and obviously, when you look at - if the Fed funds rate or the IOER. So the fact that that has stabilized, and it stabilized a bit in the forward curve, at least out the next six months or so. So the downside drag to that from where we are is probably not likely to be much, unless something else were to change. And then we're going to have to look at the impact of term rates as we do re-price assets as they come out of the investment portfolio. But our best guess right now is we're pretty close to the trough. And as we think through money market fee waivers, it does feel like the support in the reverse repo program has probably bottomed that out. Emily Portney : Yes. Alex Blostein : I was hoping to dig through a couple of business line items as well. Maybe just focusing on Asset Servicing in for a second, it seems like the business is seeing pretty decent momentum here when I, sort of, back out money market fee waivers from the Asset Servicing line. And it looks like it was up 2% quarter-on-quarter, 7% year-over-year, so despite obviously moderating industry volumes backdrop. Can you help us bridge maybe what sort of the source of growth here are sequentially? And as we're thinking ahead over the next 12 to 18 months, what do you expect to be the bigger contributors to growth here? I know there's a bunch of things that go in there, right? There's a custody and admin business, but then there's also tri-party repo and a couple of other things. Thomas Gibbons : Yes. So let me start with the more traditional custody business. I think we are having quite a bit of success there when we've got - we won a couple of very nice mandates this year. Our sales growth is ahead of where it's been. The ETF business is growing very nicely. We captured - it's up significantly on a year-over-year basis. Our capabilities there are quite good. In our venture with CIBC Mellon, we've actually won 11 of the 16 ETFs that have been listed on the TSE. And so we're seeing healthy growth there. We've got about 100 opportunities in our digital asset space. So that is getting some traction. And we've got really good flows across a number of our existing organic flows with our existing clients. So it's a combination of all of that, Alex. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to start with the balance sheet. You touched on the estimate of excess deposits that was really helpful. Thanks for that, Emily. Curious about what drove though on the funding cost side, the improvement quarter-over-quarter. Was there any noise in that? Or do you think that's sustainable? And then when we think about squaring the guide for balances, what are you assuming for deposit growth from here for the rest of the year? Thanks. Emily Portney : Sure. So just on the funding side, really, there was a benefit of also lower rates there. So that was what was driving it, nothing else really notable. Thomas Gibbons : Yes, a lot of our debt is swapped to floating. So as we saw lower LIBOR, we saw through that as well. Emily Portney : Exactly. And then I think the other question was the - what was the second part of the question? Todd Gibbons : Balance sheet growth. Emily Portney : Oh, balance sheet, yes. We - as similar to what I had alluded to before, we will continue to monitor and proactively manage the balance sheet. We do have room should deposits go up further. But of course, like I said, based on the excess that we have, we'd like to kind of stay where we are and frankly, manage it down further. Brennan Hawken : And then when we think about servicing - the servicing revenue, and Alex touched on this a little, what was the contribution of activity this quarter? What was the benefit of new business? Was there some - did that come in late in the quarter from a - I know we - it's an imperfect way to model, but the way we all model this, it looks that the fee rate got hit this quarter. So, what were some of the dynamics there? And how should we be thinking about that going forward? Emily Portney : I mean, if you're talking about like Asset Servicing versus AUCA, which I think is kind of what you're alluding to, AUCA was up 8% sequentially. It's about - one-third of that was market and currency driven, and the remainder was really organic growth. So some really good signs of organic growth. When you look at that, though, against Asset Servicing fees and revenues, like when we think about it, it's generally helpful rather than look at the 8% to probably look at the thought - sorry, rather than look at the spot to look at the average growth in AUCA, which was about 5%. And then when you look at the Asset Servicing fee line, it was flat, but ex-waivers was up 2%. And actually, as we've kind of reminded folks in the past, when we look Asset Servicing fees, only 50% or so are truly driven by asset levels. The remainder are driven by account-based fees and transaction fees. So hopefully, that helps. Todd Gibbons : Yes. When you get under it all, if you look at really what is the organic growth rate underneath - across the businesses, especially in the Investment Services business, when we look at fees only, if you exclude market appreciation or depreciation and the currency impact, waivers and some of the extraordinary volumes that we had in the second quarter of last year due to the COVID, that's - if you net that out and net the fee waivers out, we're seeing probably something like 2% or slightly better than 2% in the core organic growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Emily, on the fee side, ex-waivers, you talked about the improvement on your outlook to plus seven, eight, plus three. And I'm just wondering how much of that was just a pull-through of the first half, as you mentioned? And - or if you are actually more confident in what you're seeing in some of the core businesses following on the last few questions about the underlying growth that you are seeing in other fee areas? Emily Portney : Sure. So ultimately, the 78% is fees, ex-waiver growth over the course of will be year-on-year. So, if you have some of the numbers to do the math. In the first half, we had about 8% growth. In the second half, it will still be very, very healthy, but probably closer to 7%. Ken Usdin : So it was more of just how good it's been and then stays is the way to think about it? Emily Portney : Exactly. Ken Usdin : And just coming back to - you laid out a lot of new product insurers you've been talking about this for a while. I guess, the challenge for us is to understand how these product intros turn into revenues and the time frame by which they do convert. And you've talked about the organic growth improving directionally over time, but how do - how quickly can we start to see some of these improvements and new intros really starting to roll into the income statement? And are there other ones that you can give examples of, which - where they're live and now starting to be meaningful contributors? Thanks. Emily Portney : Sure, Ken. So as we described in the past, if you looked at our organic growth over the past few years before last year, it was basically flat. And so now we are starting to see - we're starting to get some traction as we've improved a number of our services, invested in our data and analytics capabilities, and we've talked about our digital assets capability. So we're already starting to see some benefit in these numbers, not that we\u2019re seeing an underlying growth rate more like 2%. We're already starting to see some benefit, to things like our custody and ETF servicing business around some of the digital assets. Our investments in the ETF business is starting to come through and show up in the numbers a bit. Some of the longer-term investments that we're looking to make, like Pershing, where we're really investing in the platform, we don't expect that to really turn into revenues for as long as two years. So it's - some of these are very - are longer-term and some of them are coming through as we talk about them. On the Treasury Services side, where you see us gaining some market share, and we've had pretty healthy organic growth there, the multi-currency sweeps, it's caught a lot of attention when we announced that. We have clients in it today, and we think that will gain some traction over the next year or so. And I would say the same thing with what we're doing with real-time payments and collections. So we've mapped it out. It's kind of all over the board. Some of them are as far as two or three years out. Some of the investments that we're making in custody, we would expect to have a return maybe a year out. And some of them are starting to bump into and help us generate a positive organic growth rate of the 2% that we're seeing today. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Just want to come back to the AUCA, up to $45 trillion from the $41.7 trillion. You mentioned about two-thirds of that was organic. Can you parse that out a bit between organic from the client base in terms of net inflows at your clients? It seems like $2 trillion is a large number. So I just wanted to sort of understand new business won by BNY Mellon versus the underlying client growth. And then if you can also comment on the demand for cryptocurrency servicing. Obviously, the Grayscale mandate, which is great. Are you seeing an increase in that demand in the second quarter versus what - I know that began to spike up in the first quarter? Thomas Gibbons : Okay. So Brian, when you look at our flows and the growth on a year-over-year basis, about half of it is flows that would include net new, new business, and it would also include any lost business and any organic flows from existing clients. So hooking on some winners they do - as they generate new funds that would be a new business for us. And then the combination - it's a little more than half is market and currency and the rest of it is coming from the client flows. Brian Bedell : I'm sorry, I mean, on a sequential basis from $41.7 trillion to the $45 trillion. Emily Portney : On a\u2026 Thomas Gibbons : Okay. On a sequential basis, that number is - it's pretty similar. It's probably\u2026 Emily Portney : Actually, a bit more. On the sequential basis, it's about - more of it is based on net new business and currency and markets than it was a year-on-year. Thomas Gibbons : Yes, it's about 50-50. Not\u2026 Brian Bedell : Okay. Thomas Gibbons : And then you asked a question around demand for Bitcoin Services. And what we have mentioned earlier, we have initiated quite a few ETFs in Canada where they can be traded on the TFC. So we've got 11 of the 16 ETFs that exist there and there is activity there. And Grayscale, which is the largest asset manager of digital currencies, we've teamed up and partnered with them, both to help them with the existing trust and when and if they get approval from the SEC to list the ETFs, they'll take down our TA and other capabilities there as well. So we are seeing some interest. And then we're also seeing some interest in - on the - what I'd say, the high net worth side. So there is some retail interest that we're hearing through, some of the Pershing clients as well as other Wealth Management players. Emily Portney : And so just adding to that - that we have - we have been mandated on the 6 of the 13 filings for the\u2026 Thomas Gibbons : For the U.S. Emily Portney : Yes, in the U.S. and in kind of the SEC. Brian Bedell : And then just a quick follow-up on the assumptions for NIR and the money market fund fee waivers just you mentioned trying to move more of those excess deposits into money market funds. Just in the assumptions of the guidance that you gave, are you assuming some of that transfer from those excess deposits in terms of both the fee waivers moving down, which would be good, if you were expecting an increase in money microphone balances? And then same with the balance sheet side as we move into year-end, given that guidance, is there an assumption of conversion of deposits to market fund balances within that guidance? Emily Portney : Sure. I'll take both, and I'm sure Todd will chime in. On the waiver side, really, we're just using the forward curve, and we're just assuming balances stay flat. As we just - as we talked about earlier before, the Fed actually taking some action with technical rates and raising the repo rate by - reverse repo rate by five basis points has been extraordinarily helpful and that has put a bit of a floor in terms of gross fund yield. And so that is largely what's driving the improvement that we expect in the second quarter from a run rate of about 200 - what was $250 million this quarter to about $225 million. So in terms of going forward, of course, as we start to recoup some of that, it's very dependent upon, obviously, it will be very dependent upon balance levels, but that's going to be some time in the future. From a deposit perspective, where, as I mentioned before, we have a material amount of excess still on the balance sheet, we're fine in terms of where we are. But yes, we'd like to manage that down a bit. Thomas Gibbons : So Brian, what I would add to that is - so yes, we're projecting that those balances are going to come down a little bit in the number for NIR. And you got to remember, when we had all this excess capital and there was nothing we can do about it. It wasn't particularly in our interest to - to push those balances away, because they did make up - even though it was modest, they did make a little bit of an incremental income, but the return on capital was very poor. So now that we have the flexibility to manage our capital base through the - through the new regime, we very much want to be much more efficient with the use of - with the usage of the balance sheet. Now, we didn't try to marry that with how much of the balance sheet comes down, how much of that is going to pour - is going to come into fee waivers. And if - remember, if we are growing the money market funds, we're waiving a pile of the fees as well. So a fee waivers go up a little bit, even though there is some net benefit to us from that. We didn't try to solve that in the guidance that we gave you. We just made it simple, but it's not going to be material in - a material number. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Rob Wildhack : Just wanted to follow up on a couple of the business lines you called out, particularly noticed that Issuer Services and Treasury Services performed well. You mentioned some of the drivers, particularly the new product in Treasury Services. But wondering how sustainable you think the growth rate seen in this quarter are going forward? Todd Gibbons : Yes. I think we continue to see, as we continue to invest in our payments platform and volumes are moving nicely and we're capturing a little bit of market share, as we look out, we think it's sustainable that we can see some decent growth, and we're introducing some new products that are getting some take-up. So our - the real-time payments for collections is going to be a very interesting product, and we've got a pretty robust pipeline for that, and we look forward to announcing something in the not-too-distant future around opportunities there. And so, I think, the team has done a good job of capturing that high-margin business. I think the sales effort globally has been strong. And I think we're well positioned to be a provider of services around the globe. We've got great relationships, and I think we're benefiting from that. So I think there's a little bit of room for continued growth there. When you look at issuer - when we look at Issuer Services, that includes corporate trust as well as the DR business. Corporate Trust, we've made good inroads in the CLO business. Frankly, a few years ago, we lost a little market share. We're capturing that. We've rebuilt our platform there. And then, very good growth in kind of the conventional debt servicing. And DRs, they were very much impacted by COVID. And so now that we're seeing some of these global companies paying dividends, again, we're seeing a little more activity there. And so I think there's room to sustain where we are and grow a bit off of it. Emily Portney : And just two quick things I'd add on the Treasury Services space, it's a very fragmented market. So it's ultimately - even a little bit of share gain actually moves the needle considerably. And in DR, as Todd alluded to, just the third quarter tends to be seasonally our best quarter. We had a very strong second quarter as again, as alluded to, with the resumption of dividends and certainly issuance activity. So the step up will probably be a little bit less in the third quarter. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Rajiv Bhatia : Just a quick question on your margins. So your Investment Servicing margin was 34%. Curious if you can provide any color on the pre-tax margins of your - of the various LOBs within there? So, for example, I think several years ago, you spoke about Issuer Services and Treasury Services being higher margin. Thomas Gibbons : Okay. Rajiv, we don't disclose the operating margins across the various businesses. And we did benefit in that margin, obviously, from the reserve release because a lot of that is related to it, but we did see a little bit of underlying margin improvement. But the operating margins of the various businesses, most of them are similar to what we see across the total that - for example, clearance and collateral a bit higher. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Todd with any additional or closing remarks. Thomas Gibbons : Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. I know it's a very busy day, so we appreciate the engagement and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 :00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day.",

Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 19, 2021 and will not be updated. With that. I will turn it over to Todd. Thomas Gibbons : Thank you. Marius. And good morning, everyone. I will touch on a few. Highlights before I hand it over to Emily to review our third quarter financial results. And she will give you the outlook for the remainder of the year in more detail as well. Our financial performance this quarter reflects healthy and broad-based organic growth across our businesses, as well as supportive global markets backdrop. Now if you refer to slide 2 of our financial highlight\u2019s presentation, we reported EPS of $1.04 and generated a return on tangible common equity of 17%. Revenue was $4 billion up 5% year-over-year and fee revenue was up 6% year-over-year. And that would have been 11% if you excluded the impact of money market fee waivers. This fee growth included almost 3% of organic growth across our franchise.  During the quarter, we returned roughly $2.3 billion of capital to our shareholders, including almost 300 million of common dividends and 2 billion of buybacks. Our continued focus on innovation has led us to announce several groundbreaking new solutions this quarter that will meaningfully improve the client experience and represent exciting growth opportunities for us. Let me start with Asset Servicing. In the third quarter, we continue to see strong sales momentum. Year-to-date wins were up almost 40% versus a year ago and we are winning larger, more complex deals that expand our product offering. as clients increasingly see the value, we can provide across the value chain.  We had a number of exciting business with this quarter. But one example I would like to highlight is the work we're doing for Oakhill Advisors, a leading alternatives investment firm. Oak Hill was receiving fund admin services from one of our competitors in performing middle office functions in-house. Due to our deep expertise and our ability to offer them a seamless solution across multiple services. We were able to win both mandates.  This mandate is a real testament to our differentiated capabilities and the strength of our Asset Servicing platform, which has seen very nice fee growth this year of 10% plus. And we remain excited about our ability to scale this business and the growth opportunity for us ahead of us. We also continue to see good momentum in ETF Servicing where year-to-date, we have already helped clients launch more funds than during all of 2020 And then in our data and analytics business, our capabilities continued to resonate with our clients. This quarter, we signed two additional large asset manager clients to our next-generation data management platform or what we call the data .  And another large global asset manager went live bringing the total number of clients signed up or mandated to the bulb to 6. And we're also thrilled about an extension of our partnership with the Florida State Board of Administration. As they look to leverage our ESG data analytics app into their full investment cycle for 30-plus funds, spanning about $250 billion in assets under management. Now moving onto markets and . Pershing had another good quarter and it was on the back of continued organic growth in accounts and new client assets. Over the last 12 months, Pershing generated over $100 billion of new assets. despite the headwind of the few clients\u2019 loss to consolidation that we previously mentioned.  To give you just 1 example of our differentiated capabilities, in the power of our broader, interconnected franchise, multi-billion-dollar wealth management client recently approached Pershing, for strategic partner that can provide a broad set of integrated solutions. In a collaboration between our investment management, our wealth management and Pershing businesses, we designed a series of risk-based models and turn-key investment solutions that are more cost effective, tax efficient, and portable for the end investors. This innovation solution -- innovative solution combined with our leading custodial services and technology, made Pershing the provider of choice. But we're not resting there.  This past week we announced the launch of a new business unit within Pershing, which we're calling Pershing X. This unit will deliver the industry's leading end-to-end platform in the wealth advisory space, offering a comprehensive set of advisory capabilities. And helping financial services firms solve the challenge of managing multiple and disconnected technology tools and data sense for their advisors. Fueling our clients and therefore, our growth. Today we are already the leading provider of custody (ph) and clearing services.  And by adding front-end capabilities, Pershing will become uniquely well-positioned with RIAs and the broader wealth tech segment to capture share in one of the fastest growing segments in financial services. I'm also thrilled to welcome Simmons to BNY Mellon who will lead this effort for us. Ainsley has been a transformative leader in the advisory space for 20 years. She has extensive experience across wealth management and digital, and she has helped launched several successful fintechs. Now Pershing X is 1 of our most ambitious, multi-year projects today. The combination of our planned investments and the talent that we've recruited, combined with the leading platform that we already have, will meaningfully enhance Pershing's future growth profile. In treasury services, we continue to see healthy growth in payment volumes on the back of an improving global economy and net new business. In September, we announced that Verizon has become the first corporate client to roll out BNY Mellon's innovative real-time  and payments functionality to its customers.  Now, we've spoken about this a few times about the capability in the past. And we're just incredibly excited about its future. We see enormous opportunity across our client roster as more retail banks enable their customers to receive and pay the bills via the real-time payments network. As some of you have seen, CEO s from 23 the largest banks in the country, including myself, signed a letter committing to bring these capabilities to the market. And we expect that 40% of digitally-enabled U.S. consumer accounts will eventually have this functionality by year-end. With over 15 billion bills paid annually within the U.S., many of which are still paper-based.  This ecosystem is right for disruption, which are innovative, innovative capability is built to address it scale. And we are uniquely positioned in the market as we don't compete with other banks in consumer banking or card issuing. As a result of our leadership in the space, we were recently recognized by the banker as the best transaction bank in payments. It's a real honor, and we think is just the beginning, so a lot more to come in this space. Turning to clearing and collateral management, the business continues to benefit from the higher collateral management balances.  In fact, they reached a record, $5 trillion at one point this quarter. Outside the U.S., we're seeing growth as clients continue to migrate from bilateral to tri -party. And domestically, recent growth has been driven by the elevated utilization of the Fed's reverse repo facility, where we are the sole clearer. Globally, we continue to implement new capabilities that allow clients to more efficiently mobilized collateral, interoperability between our U.S. and international platforms and vice versa, as part of our future of collateral program. Additionally, this quarter, we were the first bank to add agency MBS as collateral on overnight  transactions.  And these are done via the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation's new and general collateral sponsored repo program. This new capability expands the universe of clients that now can indirectly transact with central counterparties, as well as the scope of eligible collateral. And by sponsoring these transactions we help our clients reduce costs and free up capital that could not otherwise be available on a bilateral basis. Last but not least, the recent deadlines for the Phase 5 of non-cleared margin really differentiated us in the market.  It validated the multiyear investments we've been making in automation and client experience. While many across the industry really struggled and we're ultimately unable to re-paper all their counter-party relationships in time to go to meet these GoLive deadlines at the end of September, BNY Mellon was lauded for having a more streamlined process, for client on-boarding experience. And we're having digitized and automated, a collateral scheduled negotiation and amendment process. Once again, our automation has enabled our clients to do things better, faster and cheaper.  In markets, client volumes remained very strong on the back of continued organic growth, offsetting the headwind of lower volatility. This quarter we also rolled out several enhancements to our liquidity Direct platform that gives clients additional short-term investment options. Clients can now seamlessly invest their cash and commercial paper and ultra-short-duration fixed income ETFs. And also, now have the ability to select money market funds based on their ESG investing criteria and preferences leveraging our ESG data analytics app. While it's still early days, client feedback so far has been extremely positive.  Pivoting to our investment in wealth management business. In Investment Management, we saw our sixth consecutive quarter of net inflows into long-term products. And our initial suite of 8 Index ETFs, including the industry's first true zero-fee ETFs in the largest equity and fixed income ETF categories now exceeds $1 billion of AUM and it's growing quickly. And we recently launched our first active ETF, the BNY Mellon Ultra Short Income ETF sub-advised by drivers. On the first of September, we successfully completed the transition of almost $200 billion  and over 2 thousand client mandates and , as well as the integration of Mellon's cash capabilities with  to drive further investment specialization at scale.  This realignment positions us to better meet client's needs, it creates greater scale, and it enhances the differentiation in the value proposition of our investment firms. Not only are we pleased with the timely completion of this project, but the feedback from clients and consultants has been very encouraging. And we have experienced virtually no client  during this transition. And finally, in wealth management, the business continues to execute on its clear three-pronged strategy to focus on client acquisition, expand the investment in banking offering, and invest in technology to drive efficiency.  Year-to-date, we've acquired about 40% more clients and over the same time period last year and the average size of our new clients is up by over 20%. The business saw another strong quarter of net inflows and continued growth across lending and deposit products and our investment performance remains strong. And so, in summary, we are intensely focused on driving innovation. across the franchise. In fact, we were recently named among fast companies 100 best workplaces for innovators. A testament to our forward-thinking culture and our continued investments in our people, technology, efficiency and growth. We're clearly pleased with the continued pickup in organic growth and we're continuing to make the investments necessary to drive further growth and efficiency. So, with that, I'll hand it over to Emily. Emily Portney : Thank you, Todd,  and good morning, everyone. As they walk you through the details of our results for the quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless I specify otherwise. , provide 5% reflecting higher fee revenue, partially offset by lower net interest revenue and higher money market fee waivers. Fee revenue grew by 6% or 11% excluding the impact of fee waivers. This affects the positive impact of higher market values, strong organic growth, and a favorable impact from ABC, U.S. dollar. Money market fee labors distribution, and servicing expenses for 233 million in the quarter, an improvement of 19 million compared to the prior quarter, driven by slightly higher average short-term in history. Other revenue was a 129 million and included roughly 55 million of valuation gains on strategic equity, investment. And interest revenue was down 9%. Expenses increased 9% or 6%, excluding the impact of higher litigation reserves. A notable item this quarter, the impact in which you can see at the bottom of the slide. Provision for credit losses for the benefit of 45 million primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic forecast, including an expectation for a continued recovery of commercial real estate prices. EPS was a $1.04, higher litigation reserves negatively impact EPS by $0.06 and provision benefit had a $0.04  heading impact this quarter. Pretax margin was 29%. On page four, we see the trend across a few key metrics over time. On the capital and liquidity on page five. Our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above regulatory minimums and above our internal targets.  Our chairman leverage ratio, which is our binding constraint, was 5.7% down approximately 30 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by the return of 2.3 billion in capital to our shareholders, partially offset by earnings and 1% quarter-over-quarter reductions in average. We ended the quarter with  ratio of 11.7% down 90 basis points compared to the second quarter. Finally, our LCR was a 111%, roughly flat compared to the prior quarter. Turn to page 6 on further details on net interest revenue. NIR for the third quarter was 641 million, down less than 1% The impact of lower interest earning assets and continued pressure on reinvestment yield was partially offset by lower premium amortizations, the benefit of a full quarter of higher IOER and lower deposit and funding. Turning to page 7 for some color on our balance sheet. Average deposit balances declined by 2% or approximately 6 billion sequentially.  continue to work with our clients to pursue off balance sheet alternatives for their excess cash.  The decrease in deposits drove an approximately equal size reduction of our average held -- average cash held at central banks. The size of our securities portfolio remains flat quarter-over-quarter. Average loans increased by about 1% sequentially, and 14% year-over-year will grows primarily driven by margin loan, secured loans, Chief global financial institutions, collateralized loans and wealth management, and growth in capital called financing.  Turning to page eight, as I mentioned earlier, expenses of 2.9 billion were up 9% year-on-year, excluding the impact of notable item that I also mentioned earlier, expenses were up 8%. Almost two-thirds of this increase was attributable to revenue related expenses, and the remainder was evenly split between incremental investments and the unfavorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Onto page 9 for a closer look at our businesses. Investment Services reported total revenue of 3 billion up 3% year-on-year on higher fees, partially offset by lower net interest revenue and higher fee waivers.  Excluding the impact of fee waivers, fee and other revenue was up 10%. Assets under custody and our administration increased by 17% to 45.3 trillion, roughly half driven by growth from new and existing clients, and half driven by higher market value. And then if that's the individual investments, service, and businesses, I'll focus my comments on the fee revenue for each business. In Asset Servicing, we saw strong growth despite the impact of fee waivers. That's on the back of higher market values and client activity, as well as higher FX revenue.  Fee waivers impacted growth by roughly 418 points. Encouraging, fees were also up nicely reflecting higher market values and continued underlying without a growth, offsetting the impact of lost business and waivers. Waivers impacted fee growth by approximately 500 basis points. Encouraging Clearing accounts were up 4% and mutual fund assets were up 23%. Net new assets in the quarter were up 7 billion, excluding the impact of the deconversion of client\u2019s loss consolidation that we have discussed previously, net new assets in the quarter would have been roughly in line with the Second Quarter.  In issuer services, fees were down included a roughly 600 basis points impact on fee growth, and waivers. The resumption of issuance activity, and seasonally higher dividend payments in VR or offset by a decline in Corporate Trust fees. In Treasury Services, healthy fee growth on the back of improved economic activity and net new business resulting in higher payment volumes was offset by approximately 700 basis points from fee waivers. Lastly, clearance and collateral management fees were up primarily driven by growth in non-U.S. collateral management balances and higher clearance volumes partially offset our lower intraday  FX revenue across all investment services increased by 17% driven by higher client volumes, as we're winning new business and growing with existing clients.  This is partially offset by lower volatility in spring. Page 10 summarizes the key drivers underneath in year-over-year revenue story for each of our investment services businesses. Now turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 11. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of 1 billion of 12% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher market values, valuation gains on strategic equity investments, and benefit of the weaker U.S. dollar, and increased performance fees, all partially offset by higher fee labors.  Excluding in  of fee labors, fees and other revenue was up 15%. Assets under management grew to 2.3 trillion of 13% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, high inflows, and the favorable impact of the weaker US dollar  versus the British pound. In the third quarter, net influence totaled 14 million driven by LDI and cash strategy. As Todd highlighted, the business has now seen 6 consecutive quarter of net inflows into long-term products. Investment and Wealth Management revenue grew 13%, primarily driven by higher market values, equity income, and gains and strategic equity investments and benefit of the weaker U.S. dollar and higher performance fee. Celator's negatively impacted revenue growth by 650 basis points.  Wealth Management grew by 10%, primarily driven by higher market value. Assets reached 307 billion of 16% year-on-year.  shows the results of the other segments. I will conclude with a few remarks about the outlook for the remainder of the year. Our guidance on NIR based on the current forward curve remains down 14% compared to 2020. Also, using the forward curve, we expect fee waivers in the fourth quarter to be roughly in line with the third quarter. With regard to fees excluding waivers, given growth in the third quarter exceeded our expectations, and given the continued momentum across the franchise, we now expect fees ex-labors for the full year to be up closer to 8.5%.  On expenses, we continue to expect the full year to be up about 5%, excluding notable items. And we also expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 19% (ph). And then lastly, with regards to buybacks, given we ended the quarter of 20 basis points above or management target from Cherilyn leverage. The fact that we continue to have excess deposits that we expect to recede you over time, and based on our expectation for continued strong capital generation, we intend to once again return capital well in excess of 100% of earnings to our shareholders in the fourth quarter. With that, Operator, can you please open the line for questions. Operator : Yes.  As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up question. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning, Todd. Good morning, Emily. Emily Portney : Good morning. Steven Chubak : Wanted to start things off with just a question on the NIR guidance, Emily, that you just shared. I was hoping just to unpack the guide for 4Q, specifically, what you're assuming in terms of deposit, balance sheet growth, liquidity, redeployment, and I guess less and certainly not least, premium amortization. Emily Portney : Sure. So just why don't we first just start with the third quarter. And the third quarter NIR was down very, very modestly. That was off the back of lower reinvestment yields, also lower interest earning assets as we worked with our clients to actually manage, managed especially excess deposits. We were able to offset that with some tweaks in the securities portfolio. And also, we did see a benefit from premium amortization coming down that was both a mixture of us reducing the size of our MVX portfolio as well as the fact that prepayment speeds did slow down quarter-to-quarter. Your (ph) full-year guidance, you just rightfully pointed out remains that down 14% for the full year in terms of kind of what's baked into the fourth-quarter , I think we have more or less hit the trough. What's baked in there. Certainly, we'll still have the impact of lower reinvestment yields as a headwind. We are expecting a further reduction in interest earning assets because we will continue to work with our clients in terms of managing excess deposits. So perhaps, we expect them to go down by about 5 to 10 billion. With respect to premium amortization, it's likely our expectation forecasts based on rates is that it will be pretty much flat fourth quarter to third quarter. And look, there's probably some upside. I mean, certainly based on what we're seeing in terms of volatility and rates, and EBITDA movements by, for example, the Bank of England, etc. So, there could be some upside. Steven Chubak : That's great color, Emily. And just for a follow-up on expenses, I was hoping you could speak to the expense growth outlook. We've seen a number of upward revisions to the expense guidance over the course of the year. I just want to gauge whether the current level of expense it's about 2.85 billion  litigation cost is the right jumping off point for 4Q and maybe just longer term, what level of expense inflation we should be underwriting on a more normal basis just given the continued investments you cited in the business. Emily Portney : Sure. So, within the quarter -- so yes, expenses overall up 6%, We're still guiding for the full-year expenses to be up 5% versus last year, obviously . When you  the third quarter, about  is attributable to what we call revenue related expenses, inclusive of an uptick in higher incentives. We obviously want to pay our people competitively and for the strong organic growth that we are seeing. About a third of that is split evenly between the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar as well as the incremental investment that we have pulled forward. So those are the investments in both -- in growth, in infrastructure as well as efficiency. Well, also, it's worth mentioning that in the third quarter, we are starting to see an impact of a tighter labor market, both in terms of competition and in terms of cost. And also in the third quarter, there was an impact of merit increase which took effect in June. As we kind of look out, it's certainly too early to really comment on 2022, where in the middle of the planning process, what I would say is that, yes, the uptick you're seeing in the Second Half of the year is really the jumping off point for next year. And ultimately, there are other headwinds as well, inflation as I just mentioned, look, we're seeing.  It's a good thing, but return to more normalized travel rates. So CNI (ph) is likely to go up. We're when as we reopen and the offices and return to -- return to the office will be some additional expenses associated with that. Of course, we will continue to also achieve and identify efficiencies. We're working through the investment spend as we speak, going through the proverbial food fight. Because as always, there's lots that we want to do, but what I would say is we are intensely focused on expense management. We will continue to be focused on expense management, but we're also going to invest through the cycle. And if I were to just give some color, I would just say that expenses in 2022, if I'm standing here today, will be modestly up from 2021. Steven Chubak : Very helpful , Emily. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, good timing. I wanted to follow up on the food fight, investment spend discussion. Software costs were up 8% year-over-year. And Todd, you started off talking about some FinTech like initiatives. And so, I'm just wondering if maybe next year you want to spend more money. There's it's tough trade-off that you have in delivering results and investing for what you think could be a good effort. I didn't fully understand when you're talking about purging and the transaction banking payments. So maybe if you could just describe the total addressable market for that, how much you have and where you think you're getting or some color around that. And then what type of spending that's going to involve. Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Okay. So, Pershing X is, I think an exciting opportunity for us. And so, if you think about the registered investment advisor business, so if you think about Pershing, we're really the largest correspondent clearer. So, we're a third-party clearer for broker-dealers in the retail space. And now registered investment advisor. And that business is actually growing, but it's not growing nearly as fast as the advisory space is growing. And so, we are the custodian, we , we are providing a lot of the backend services for that business.  But we think there is the opportunity for us to be an integrator in that business. So, and it's -- it's been gradually  at the numbers recently, but it's been growing in the ballpark of 15%. So, we think that, we've got a relatively small market share, part of it, Mike, so we think there's an opportunity for us to pick up market share in a fast-growing segment. So that's why it's so exciting for us. In terms of the challenge that Pershing X will solve, if you think about it, Pershing have these multiple technology tools, a bunch of different data sets that they're trying to, trying to integrate or trying to look at oftentimes are logging into multiple systems and they are really reducing the advisory productivity.  And that would be across things like financial planning, investment modeling, even some banking activities. And we have the ability to integrate our own private bank. So, there's really no solution out there today that can tie that all together. And so that's what we mean, it'll be an open architected, but an end-to-end solution. And so, we'll be integrating best in class services in amongst some of our own. And it'll -- it will provide a digital capability and real good retail experience both to the advisor, as well as to the Investor itself. So that's our target for Pershing.  I think your other question was around the e-payments. So, in e-payments, this is -- we -- this is using the clearing houses real-time payment system. And we were the first to actually connect. And now this is a request for payment from a client. Exhibiting (ph) our clients so a Verizon to their customer, and they send to come across your -- they'll come across your phone that your bill is ready. Here is your bill, press this and make the payment in real time. Or you can even set a time when you want to make that payment to make sure that you've got funds in your account.  That will connect as more and more banks connect to the real-time payment system, that broadens the capability of covering a very large percentage of the market. Currently, there are about 15 billion payments made in the U.S. So, it's an enormous market and we've got some, we've got about 100 prospects showing significant interest in the capability we designed. Mike Mayo : Okay. So, e-payments, big initiative, big opportunity, Pershing X, if I heard you correctly, big market, big opportunity. So, in terms of funding these initiatives, as far as investing in these areas specifically are more generally, I know you've done a lot of overhauls in the back-office, lot of overhauls with your tech talent. What sort of spending will this take and should you be going faster or slower or how do you decide that? Thomas Gibbons : Yeah. We -- certainly as you (ph), no, we've been increasing our tech spend over the past few years. A lot of that, as you pointed out, was in infrastructure and resiliency and dawdling of sounder infrastructure to support the growth that we're looking to drive today. And so , the kind of the piece dividend from that, we are reinvesting in a number of the software and the AppDev that we've -- that we've talked about it. So, I kind of categorize it into three areas. One, is we've talked about our initiatives? We just talked on two, Pershing and Treasury, but we've got some very deep things going on in our Data and Analytics capability.  We're digitizing things across the bank. The Wealth Platform we continue to invest in for our own wealth management activity, Corporate Trust we're using smart contracts in developing a digital network for our clients to operate on in Investment Management. So just about to cross our businesses, we continue to invest in technology. There is also ongoing infrastructure and risk management. I mean, our cyber defenses are not cheap and we need to continue to invest in them. We're doing a significant number of Cloud conversions as I think through out across the Company. Regulatory reporting requirements continue to go up. There a lot of liquidity requirements as well as complying with the  requirements. And we will always be focused on data and resiliency. And then on the efficiency side, there's -- we -- we've actually inventory the number of things that we do manually, and we're looking to knock them out for automating when it's when it's -- what it can increase some significant efficiencies and risk reduction. And we're also looking to modernize some of our core app. So even our Treasury Services, we're putting -- we're putting a very modern payments app or engine underneath all of this. So, there are a lot of the --- the good news is there are a lot of opportunities, but it will come with some costs. And our intent is to increase our technology spend next year. Mike Mayo : Alright, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, John. Good morning, Emily. Thomas Gibbons : Morning, Gerard. Emily Portney : Hi. Gerard Cassidy : Todd, can you -- or Emily? When I go back to the year-end, 2019 pre -pandemic size of your balance sheet, you guys had assets about 382 billion and deposits of 259, let's call it, and then you had deposits of definitive 95 billion. Obviously today, it's considerably higher when the  finishes quantitative easing, assuming it's finished by next summer, can you kind of frame out for us what you think your balance sheet might look like as we go forward. Our customers going to be pulling deposits out, do you think you'll shrink down? Not that you'll ever get to that year-end 19 level. But should we start to think about continued falling of the size of the balance sheet? Emily Portney : I'm happy to take that and Todd certainly, can chime in. So, the way we think about other levels now, we probably still have around 10% to 15% of our deposits are excess and they will eventually receive in a more normalized rate environment. But actually, core deposits overall are also up just given the growth in  etc. I think the core deposits are also up. But the excess is about 10% to 15%. And the way we've been looking at it is certainly we've been managing the growth in those deposits and very successfully.  So, a very targeted way, looking at what we deem to be excess and working with our clients to pursue off balance sheet alternatives for those particular balances. And if the Fed begins to taper when we all think they will or speaking to taper soon, I think that does help in terms of putting all led to a degree on the growth of deposits from here in terms of what we expect of 2023 and beyond Yes, I think you're at the stage where the Fed actually hikes on multiple occasions, it's only at that point that we would probably see a decline in deposits. But the core itself is higher than it was in the fourth quarter of 2019. Thomas Gibbons : And , I think if my memory serves me right  that date was you're picking an end date. It was actually the averages were a little bit lower than that. So, there is a significant amount of excess. It will start to -- and that's why we're sitting on so much cash at Central Banks. And we will probably see a little less pressure, certainly for deposit growth when the Fed starts to, starts to taper. But to Emily 's point, the excess coming off as probably sometime thereafter? Gerard Cassidy : Correct, Todd. They were a period than numbers. Good memory. The follow-up question, you guys had a very robust share repurchase amount this quarter, as Emily pointed out, of $2 billion and just guidance for the fourth quarter, the question is, if I recall correctly, you have $6 billion program that I think expires at the end of next year. If you reach the $6 billion prior to the termination, would you consider re-upping -- assuming, of course, your capital ratio is permitted, would you consider re-upping the buyback if you use it all up before that termination date. Thomas Gibbons : The answer, Gerard, if you think about the stress capital buffer regime has actually made things a little more flexible for us. And so certainly the board recognizes that if we continue to produce the capital that we're likely to, and we buy back the excess capital that we've accumulated will be in a position to come back to them and ask for more. So, the answer is yes. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just one on issuer service fees. They were flat sequentially and typically you'd have some seasonality. I think you mentioned some weakness on the corporate side, Corporate Trust side. Is that just pushed out? Should we expect some rebound in 4Q? Just how do we think about the trajectory in that business and any more detail on the quarter would be great. Emily Portney : Sure.  issuer services, you really do have two businesses, Depository Receipt and Corporate Trust as you point out. Within the , we definitely saw a resumption in both issuance and dividend activity, and that was really even on top of the normal uptick that we see in the third quarter. In Corporate Trust, the underlying business actually is performing really well. Volumes in structured products are up actually meaningfully, slightly offsetting a small decline in activity in units.  But the third quarter for Corporate Trust, there were really two things that also impacted revenues. One was a decline in reimbursable expenses. We've got reimbursable expenses, our adjusted pass-through. And ultimately so that impacts revenue does not have any impact whatsoever on PTI. And also, there was a discontinuation of a public sector mandate that started in this quarter. And we'll see the full effect of that in the next -- in the Fourth Quarter, probably be another 10 million or so decline. Jim Mitchell : Okay. But no, nothing got pushed into 4Q? It's just those issues. Emily Portney : Yeah. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Just maybe on the payments business. I think it's an interesting push. You've already had some growth in Treasury Services. So maybe you could just talk a little bit of what's been driving the accelerating growth of late. I think it's a little too early to be expecting anything from these new initiatives. And then I guess as we think about the newish initiatives, like this Verizon deal and others potentially is that a first mover advantage type thing? I guess, how do you defend being the intermediary between the merchants and the banks? Is it just simply being the first mover advantage? And what you think the possibility from a revenue standpoint could be from that business? Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : Yeah. This is -- so it's a couple of things there. Effectively what we're doing is we're digitizing their collection experience. We've been in the lockbox business and now we're converting that to electronic through these requests for payments. And it is faster and cheaper for the provider. So, the cost actually for the utility in this case, so the cost to them on a per unit basis is down dramatically. And you also reduce your float and other items. So, we think it's usually to their advantage. So, we happen to have the collection relationship and we can continue . Paper's not going away. That's going to be a component of it, so we can provide the complete solution.  So, we just thought we happened to be in a very nice position to do this, and we're not -- we're not in the card or retail payments business to speak of. In between it so, we happen to be very well-positioned and we got a little bit of a first-mover advantage by being into declaring houses real-time payments system, right way. In terms of how big can this grow? It could possibly move the deal a little bit, add a little something to our organic growth. I think it's a little too early to tell. We are excited about the relationship that we've got with Verizon. We're excited that they certainly stirred up a lot of interest. And we've got a pretty reasonable pipeline, but I just prefer at this point not to speculate on what that could be Jim Mitchell : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Would like to explore that really robust core fee revenue growth that you guys have seen here. Todd, you made reference to nearly 3% organic growth rate in the quarter, which is really quite good. So is it possible to break down the year-to-date or your expectations for 2021 in the different components, how much of it came. Do you think from organic? How much activity and volume-related? I seem to recall that in the past you've said that half of your Servicing business is market-sensitive. So, is that still the right way to calibrate when we think about the market impact or pricing dynamics? Is it possible to give some color on the composition? Thomas Gibbons : Sure, Brian. So, I think first of all, we should probably help you understand what we're describing as organic. So, we do try to take the market impact out for interest rates and the equity markets. We also try to adjust, for example, for some of the unusual activity that came of it, for example, right now money market funds are very large because of all this excess cash. Deposits are very large because of this excess cash. So, we tried to knock that growth out of the calculation.  And when we get -- when we knock all of that out -- because if you look at us growing, our revenue growth minus fee waivers is significantly higher than what we're talking about in terms of our organic growth because that's getting the benefit of some of the market consideration. So, our -- once you knock all of that out the numbers get to something like 2.5% or so for this for this year, which is much stronger than what we've seen in years past. And frankly, 3-years ago was probably 0, maybe even slightly negative. And but you want to march through some of the areas where we're actually we're actually seeing it. Emily Portney :   And just to really break it down very clearly. So, the 11% in  growth ex waivers, we saw this quarter year-on-year, 3% was organic growth is as , about 6% of that was just market, was market impact and the remainder was just impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. In terms of the organic growth in that 3%, it was really broad based. So, when you look at purging, I think we talked a bit about continued growth in clearing accounts, mutual fund balances, and net new assets. In terms of Treasury Services, and we saw good growth in terms of payment activity.  And on the back of both stronger economic, a stronger macroeconomic backdrop, but also net new business, and also within Treasury Services, we've really shifted the product mix to be higher margin in that business. In Asset Servicing, wins are up 40% year-to-date versus what they were last year. So that too is just speaking to the organic growth in that business. In FX, volumes were up significantly in some of that market, but a lot of that too is just based on investments in the FX platform that we've made. So, it's really broad-based and strong. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. Thank you for all that color. And Emily, I'd like to explore some of your -- I know it's very early to talk about 2022, but the expectation around expenses next year, a few questions on that. Would that modest growth be on a constant currency basis? And when we calibrate, I think you also had said that the back half of '21 is a decent base in which to build off of. Is that excluding the litigation that you guys had? And if so, could you size that for us? And when we think about modest, is there any way to calibrate that? Like, would you consider the 2021 expense growth to be modest or is it a bit more significant than that? Thanks. Emily Portney : So, in terms of -- its a bit early to really comment on 2022. We're obviously going through the entire planning process as we speak. As I did mention earlier, the uplift and expenses that you're seeing in the second half of this year on the back of the investments that we are making is structural. So that those -- those are permanent and that really will be baked into next year. As I also mentioned, there are some headwinds. We're starting to see a bit of inflationary pressure. Like I said, we're going to return to more normalized, we think travel and so  will likely go up. A bit of extra expense associated with return to the office. So, there are headwinds that of course we're going to be looking to off-sale in offset with efficiencies. So, I wouldn't want to put an actual number on it. But at this moment, I would say expenses for the full year next year will be modestly up. And that's just on top line basis. They will be modestly up versus this year. Thomas Gibbons : And Brennan, we would adjust for the litigation reserves. Emily Portney : Yeah. Thomas Gibbons : So, we wouldn't consider that part of the base. Emily Portney : Yeah, on a non-operating basis. I should've said that, sorry. Brennan Hawken : Got it. And I know FX -- should FX be a tailwind for you guys next year, just to follow up on that. Because I know it was a headwind this year. Thomas Gibbons : It depends on where we're -- Emily Portney : It depends. Thomas Gibbons : Right now, the dollar is showing a little bit of strength, which would create an expense tailwind but it would be neutral to our pretax. Brennan Hawken : Right. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning. Wanted to start by just asking you to talk a little bit more about Asset Servicing. It really good underlying growth if we just keep sec lending aside and fee waivers aside and the deck mentions transaction activity and higher market levels. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand like, how did the collateral business act versus how did the core Asset Servicing act and what type of net new wins quarter did you see on both sides? Thanks. Thomas Gibbons : What -- Emily, why don't I take the clearing and the collateral management business and you can take the rest of the Asset Servicing space. So, we saw good growth in the clarity and collateral management business as we have for a while now. In fact, one of the points I made in my remarks. For the first time we saw the collateral management numbers, our tri -party numbers exceed $5 trillion in the quarter. So, we continue to see good growth there. And the profitability on the global collateral management continues to be strong. we've got innovation that is paying -- paying off there.  That attributed a bit to the growth. The other thing that we're doing and we do this out of our Markets business, but it's really a collateral management business. Is the requirement to be margining and over-the-counter for over-the-counter derivatives transactions to meet margin requirements and we're in phase five of six of that. And our teams did an excellent job of seamlessly onboarding a significant number of players. And that's starting to add a little bit of revenue to the line there. So overall, that business continues to look pretty healthy and continues to show underlying organic growth. You want to comment on the rest of Asset Servicing? Emily Portney : Sure. As you think about Asset Servicing and just thinking about just the growth in our in our fees or at, or sorry. Our AUC Assets Under Custody they're up about 17% year-on-year on a spot basis. About half of that was driven by market and the other half truly driven by growth both from growth from existing clients, as well as new clients probably split about 50-50. And when just thinking through where we're seeing a lot of that growth. About 30% of it is from investment managers. Another 30% or so it's from broker-dealers and banks. And then the remainder is really split between both the alternative space and the asset owner\u2019s space. So that's where we're seeing a nice uptake and the pipeline is stronger than it was at this period last year. Ken Usdin : Great. Thank you. And my follow-up is just coming back on the Clearing Business last quarter. you had said that you were to expected about a $20 million impact from the deconsolidation that you discussed. Can you just help us understand how much of that was already out in the third quarter and how much more you still expect, if any? Emily Portney : Sure. Encouraging the -- we had originally expected about a 20 million impact of the lost business due to just being on the wrong side of M&A that is due to timing that was a lot less. So, I would think about it as the uptick will be about 15 million between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. We'll see the full impact. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. Understood. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Good morning, folks. Most of my questions have been asked, but maybe just to follow on a couple. Just going back onto the organic growth, obviously this is really, really tracking well, going from zero - ish to now, close to 3%. So maybe just the thought, 2022 too early. But given these initiatives that you have and how you think about the revenue following through, do you -- do -- are you optimistic that you can continue to improve upon that -- that 3% number? And then just one on Pershing X. Technically, just into the -- into -- in that aggregator system. Does that require you to disintermediate that current custodian? So are you becoming the custodian in that process or rather would you sit on top of the current custodian and make it -- have a seamless aggregation of their technology services. Thomas Gibbons : Okay. So why don't I take the Pershing question and then, Emily, I think you can probably handle the other. But the Pershing project X will be multi-custodial. So will be actually be  of course, we'd love to have a custodial business, but we'll be able to provide these capabilities regardless of who the custodian is. And we were working on that capability right now. And I must -- I have to say, this is going to -- the Pershing particular -- in particular is probably the longest term of our investment. So, this, we're really investing for the future and I think before we really start to see the revenues that we expect in that business, that's probably two or three years out. Most of the other ones that we've been talking about are a little more near-term. Do you want to --? Emily Portney : Sure. Again, we're in the middle of planning process so it's probably too soon to really comment on the expectations specifically for organic growth next year. But certainly, we're really pleased with the momentum that we've seen this year and we would hope to certainly achieve roughly the same amount of organic growth next year. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. And then just quickly on net interest revenue on that 14% down guide, not sure if I had the right base here, but it does that imply a slight downtick in NIR in 4Q versus 3Q. I knew and Emily, you said you talked about the trough and I wasn't sure if you're referring to 3Q or 4Q as they're likely  NIR Emily Portney : Yeah. If you do the math, it would imply a very -- a slight down tick about 1% to 2% in the fourth quarter. But of course, rates are moving all the time. Like I said, we're seeing potential upside from some Central Banks even moving earlier than originally thought. So that's based on the last forecast, it's slightly down, but we think there is potentially some upside and hopefully, it will be flat. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Rob Wildhack : Good morning, guys. One more on organic growth if I can. How much of that is coming from competitive wins versus say, more greenfield type opportunities? Thomas Gibbons : You want to take that? Emily Portney : That makes sense. Thomas Gibbons : Competitive wins versus Greenfield. Emily Portney : So when -- certainly, when we look at the entirety of our wins were both new wind of what we call new business. It can be new business from completely new clients, as well as new business from existing clients. So as clients obviously launch new funds, et cetera, that's still new business, but it's new business with existing clients. And of course, we're always very, very focused on retention. So, we're being, having the business already and still it's competitive, it's competitive out there. So, making sure that we're retaining as we're retaining those deals that we already -- that we're already incumbent. When you look at it about, it's about 50-50 in terms of the breakdown from like new versus just retention of existing business. Thomas Gibbons : As we're -- and I think to your point, we're definitely winning against the competition and a couple of the ones that you've been called out today. One of the alternatives spaces that was a different service provider, we had a broader set of capabilities in addition to the ability to do the administration. So, we won that business. We want a couple of large businesses over the last takeaways, over the last couple of quarters. So occasionally we lose them, but right now our win-loss ratio versus the competition is leaning toward our side and we think that's because of the capabilities that we've got as well as the quality of the service that we've been delivering. Rob Wildhack : Okay, thanks. And just to stay on retention, how -- how's the retention rates in trending? and then what kind of opportunities or things can you do to continue to improve the retention rate? Emily Portney : Our retention rates have been trending upwards and we don't really disclose, but certainly there are trending upward and they're very high so well in excess of 70-75%. So, in terms of how the first thing I would say is, this -- the first and foremost is just client service and basically performing -- performing well day in and day out. And that's what kind of gives you the even, the right to actually -- to bid until ultimately retains. So, we're intensely focused on that. And then, of course, it's about talking to our clients, understanding their strategy. More and more, we're really working in a consultative manner with our clients, looking at their issues, their challenges, and how we can bring the solutions of our -- the entirety of the firm to bear, to help them with their operating model and to get more efficient and to create . So, it's both just being good at the day-to-day and also ensuring that our capabilities and our -- both our capabilities and our products are not only competitive, but leading edge and then working with the client -- working with our clients and on a very, in the consultative and in a strategic manner. Rob Wildhack : Okay. Thank you. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks Robert. Operator :  keypad. Our next question comes from Michael Brown with KBW. Michael Brown : All right. Thank you, operator. Not sure if you guys gave this, but Emily, I was just -- given most of your comments were on a year-over-year basis, I was just curious given that the move in the dollar and the strengthening that we recently saw, what was the sequential impact to revenues and expenses in the third quarter versus the second quarter from the move in the dollar. Emily Portney : Oh, gosh. Off the top of my head, I can't really -- I don't have it off the top of my head, but, I mean, the good news is that actually we're pretty equally match. So, any -- any benefit you have in revenues or any headwinds you have in expenses is pretty much equally offset in revenues from -- so from a PPI perspective, are incredibly well hedged. Michael Brown : Right. Okay. Thomas Gibbons : But it's going to be in the ballpark of 1% to 2% of the expense base. Emily Portney : Yeah. Of the expense base, yeah. Michael Brown : Okay. And then just on the loan book, It's up 14% year-over-year. The average (ph) loans, but just 1% sequentially, and that's the lowest growth rate we've seen in the last three quarters. Any particular reason there was a bit of a slowdown this quarter. And what's the expectation there going forward? Emily Portney : So, I mean, just point out. Our loan book has grown by 14% year-on-year. So there has been very healthy growth in the loan portfolio over time. Of course, growth in any one quarter can be lumpy. We did see some healthy growth loans on a spot basis are actually up, more than -- they're up to 64 billion. Some of the growth we're seeing is a growth in margin loans, growth in cloud collateralized lending in wealth.  We're seeing growth in our term loans in terms of securities financing and also more demand in terms of capital cost facility. And what we do think we have, certainly, we're proactively looking to grow the loan portfolio and we're very -- we feel that it's certainly an area that's in focus and we've got capacity certainly to do so. Michael Brown : Great. Thanks for that clarification. Thanks for taking my questions. Thomas Gibbons : Thanks, Michael. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Todd with any additional or closing remarks. Thomas Gibbons : No. Thank you, everyone for your interest and obviously, you can reach out to Marius in the IR team for any follow-ups. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 :00 PM Eastern Standard Time today.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Marius Merz : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Today, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. Todd Gibbons, our Chief Executive Officer, will open with his remarks. Then, Emily Portney, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the earnings presentation. Following their remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 18, 2022, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Marius. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Emily will review our fourth quarter results and spend some time on our 2022 outlook in a moment. But before that, I'd like to touch on a few financial performance highlights for the full year and talk about the progress the firm has made across a number of dimensions in 2021. Last year was, in many regards, remarkable for BNY Mellon. And I couldn't be prouder of the resilience, dedication and innovative mindset of our management team and our exceptional colleagues around the world. As I reflected on the year, there were three broad themes that really stood out to me. One was our outstanding sales performance and improved organic growth. The second one was the number of new and innovative solutions that we are working on and, in many cases, have already brought to the market. And the third was our improved effectiveness in harnessing our unique One BNY Mellon culture and the capabilities that we have by delivering more comprehensive and differentiated solutions to our clients. Now I'll expand a little bit on each of these points in a moment. Together with the supportive market backdrop in a benign credit environment, our meaningfully improved organic growth has allowed us to more than offset the stiff headwind that we had from lower interest rates and deliver a solid and improved financial performance in 2021. Referring to slide two of our financial highlights presentation, we reported EPS of $4.14 for the full year of 2021, that's up 8% year-over-year. Revenue of $15.9 billion was up slightly year-over-year as 2-plus percent organic growth and the benefit of higher market levels offset lower net interest revenue and higher fee waivers. Fee revenue was up 4% year-over-year and about 9% excluding the impact of money market fee waivers. And expenses were up 5% year-over-year, reflecting our investments, as well as the quality of revenue that we generated. Our pretax margin of 29%, as well as our return on tangible common equity of 17% were roughly in line with the prior year. And we returned $5.7 billion of capital or 160% of earnings to our shareholders through common dividends and $4.6 billion of share repurchases. As I said earlier, 2021 was marked by outstanding sales performance and a meaningful increase in organic growth. In fact, organic growth was the highest that we've seen in a number of years. In Asset Servicing, wins were up almost 50% compared to 2020, which has produced a meaningful pipeline of AUC/A. Our average deal size was up as we won larger and more complex businesses. And just as importantly, our retention rates also continued to improve. We believe this success is a testament to our service quality, and it's also a reflection of our broader capabilities, as well as our open architecture framework, which is resonating with our clients and is differentiating us in the marketplace. I'd also like to call out our ETF business, which has delivered substantial growth and gained market share. Our ETF AUC/A grew by roughly 30%, which outpaced the broader market, and that doesn't yet include our recent win of approximately $350 billion of BlackRock's iShares. Issuer Services delivered meaningful organic growth on the back of the resumption of depository receipt issuance and dividend activity following what had been a COVID-related slowdown in 2020 and a continued strong sales performance. Pershing gathered record new assets of about $160 billion and continue to grow active clearing accounts in the mid-single digits despite the headwind of de-converting a couple of large clients in the second half of the year. Growth has been notably broad-based across broker-dealers and registered investment advisers. Clients have told us numerous times that our ability to bring broker-dealer and RIA solutions together as one is a real differentiator, and we continue to benefit from our uniquely un-conflicted role in the marketplace as we don't compete with our clients. Treasury Services delivered strong organic growth on the back of payment volumes recovering to above pre-COVID levels. And we improved the average price per payment transaction by about 5% as we continue to shift the product mix towards higher value-added channels. Clearance and Collateral Management is now running at a record $5 trillion of collateral management balances. Balanced growth has benefited from our unique role as the primary clearer of US government securities, and we've also seen continued growth in international balances. Our Markets business has offset the impact of lower volatility and tighter spreads compared to the prior year, with strong broad-based organic growth across FX and securities lending. Investment Management saw the highest net inflows into long-term products since 2017, driven by our LDI and fixed income strategies, but also including strong net inflows into our responsible investment funds, as well as strength in our initial suite of index ETFs. $70 billion of net inflows in cash products were the highest in over a decade. We optimized our money market fund line-up to provide a more competitive and scalable offering. And with our new CIO in place, we're thrilled to see strong flows and improving market share. And finally, our Wealth Management business acquired significantly more new clients in 2021 than in 2020. And I'm pleased to see how the team is executing against the strategic plan that we put in place a few years ago. We continue to gain further traction in the larger, faster growing client segments. And our expanded banking offering, both on the lending, as well as the deposit side, has driven a meaningful uptick in the percent of wealth - percentage of Wealth Management clients who also bank with us. The second theme I mentioned earlier was innovation. And in some cases, it's been outright disruption. This is probably the area that is most exciting for us. I cannot recall in my tenure at the company a year in which we launched or rolled out more innovative products and services than we did over the last 12-months. I'll call out just a few. Digital assets. While still early days and recognizing that the regulatory landscape of this space is still evolving, our investments in building an industry-first, integrated digital and traditional assets offering are clearly showing positive initial results following the launch of our digital assets unit at the beginning of last year. We solidified our leadership in servicing crypto funds with the announcement of our partnership with Grayscale Investments over the summer, we've contracted with almost half of the pending funds in the US and serviced most of the crypto funds in Canada. As I said, it's still early days, but we're excited about the disruptive potential of tokenization as well as smart contracts and the associated opportunities both on the revenue as well as the efficiency side. In terms of real-time payments, this is an area that we embraced early on, and we continue to lead with innovative solutions to drive the proliferation of real-time payments in the US. You may remember that we were the first bank to originate a payment on The Clearing House's realtime payments network several years ago. In late last year, we were the first to launch a real-time bill pay solution for billers and their customers. We're pleased by the initial uptake. We've already onboarded additional clients, and the long list of interested prospects continues to grow. As you know, the market for treasury services is large and it's growing, but it's still very fragmented and ripe for disruption. So we're excited about the market leadership coming out of our Treasury Services business. It really goes far beyond just real-time payments and include examples like being able to leverage the cloud for wire payments and having been the first bank to complete a trade finance deal using SOFR. The third item is the Future of Collateral. As the world's largest global collateral manager, we continue to lead the charge in driving towards global collateral mobility and optimization by connecting distinct platforms, expanding the scope of eligible collateral and implementing new capabilities. For example, last year, we introduced Chinese bonds as eligible collateral on a global tri-party platform. And we were the first bank to add agency mortgage-backed securities as collateral on overnight cleared repo transactions. And another first, we started offering our clients the ability to accept collateral based on their ESG criteria through our digital platform. And finally, I'd be remiss not to mention the launch of Pershing X, which we introduced last quarter. Pershing X will design and build innovative solutions for the advisory industry, including a leading end-to-end wealth advisory platform that will help firms and their advisers solve the challenge of managing multiple and disconnected technology and data sets. While certainly a multiyear project, the team has hit the ground running. In this past quarter, we acquired Optimal Asset Management, which is not only an important step in our build-out of Pershing X in that it will allow us to offer direct indexing capabilities to our advisory clients within Pershing, but it will also benefit our Investment Management business as well. The third and last theme is what we call One BNY Mellon. Now I've always been proud of our collaborative culture here at BNY Mellon. And as you know, our broader portfolio of businesses differentiates us from our competitors. Over the years, we've emphasized the interconnectivity of these businesses and the meaningful operational synergies between many of them. But we can still do a better job at delivering the whole firm to our clients. And so last year, we conducted a thorough review of the opportunities and further enhanced our setup for cross business collaboration. Now I've been highlighting some of the most notable cross-business client wins, such as Amundi, Lockheed Martin and Oak Hill, on our earnings calls over the last couple of quarters. Our ability to seamlessly deliver a much broader set of capabilities from across our Security Services, our Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth Management businesses is a unique value proposition for our clients, and our intensified collaboration effort is already driving higher revenues. In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made over the last 12 months. And while we certainly have more work to do, I'm confident that the company is on the right path for sustainably higher organic growth. As we look to 2022 and beyond, we expect double-digit earnings per share growth as we are determined to continue delivering consistent organic growth, which, together with the current expectation for higher rates, should enable us to generate positive operating leverage while at the same time continue investing in the growth and efficiency of our businesses. With that, I'll turn it over to Emily. Emily Portney : Thank you, Todd. And good morning, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I would like to spend a moment highlighting our new financial disclosures. Last month, we announced that starting with the fourth quarter, we're going to report Investment Services, which was our largest segment, as two new business segments, Security Services, which includes Asset Servicing and Issuer Services, and Market and Wealth Services, which includes Pershing, Treasury Services, and Clearance and Collateral Management. Our third segment, Investment and Wealth Management, remains unchanged. We made this change to increase the visibility of some of our most differentiated businesses to better align our reporting with how we already manage the firm and to provide additional granularity for all of our stakeholders to better track our performance against our strategy. With that, I will turn to page three and our results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was up 4%. Fee revenue also grew by 4% or 8% excluding the impact of fee waivers. This reflects the benefit of higher market values and continued healthy organic growth. While not on the page, firm-wide AUC/A of $46.7 trillion increased by 14%, with roughly 60% of the increase driven by growth from new and existing business and 40% driven by higher market value. And the AUM of $2.4 trillion increased by 10%, reflecting higher market values and full year net inflows. Money market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense, were $243 million in the quarter, an increase of $10 million compared to the prior quarter, entirely driven by higher money market fund balances with no meaningful impact on pretax income. Investment and other revenue was $107 million and included a roughly $40 million valuation gain on a strategic equity investment. Our investments continue to pay off both strategically as well as in the form of higher valuation. Net interest revenue was flat. Expenses were up 1% or 6% excluding notable items. Our provision for credit losses was a benefit of $17 million, primarily driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast. EPS was $1.01. This includes a $0.04 negative impact of litigation reserves and severance expense, as well as a $0.02 positive impact of the provision benefit. Pretax margin was 27%, and our return on tangible common equity was 17%. Quickly for the full year, which Todd summarized earlier, on Page 4. Total revenue grew by 1%, reflecting higher fee revenue, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. Fee revenue grew by 4% or 9% excluding the impact of fee waivers. Investment and other revenue was $336 million, a strong year with meaningful gains on our strategic equities portfolio, and net interest revenue was down 12%. Expenses were up 5%, both on a reported basis as well as excluding notable items. Excluding the impact of notable items, nearly half of the increase was driven by higher net incremental investments and the remainder was roughly evenly split between revenue-related expenses and the unfavorable impact of the weaker US dollar. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $231 million. EPS was $4.14. Our pretax margin of 29%, as well as our return on tangible common equity of 17% were roughly in line with the prior year. On to capital and liquidity on page five. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is our binding capital constraint, was 5.5%, down approximately 20 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by the return of $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders in the quarter, including $1.2 billion of buybacks, partially offset by earnings. And we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.1%, down approximately 60 basis points compared to the end of the prior quarter. Finally, our LCR was 109%, slightly lower than in the prior quarter. Turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on page six, which I will talk about in sequential terms. Net interest revenue was $677 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% sequentially. This increase was driven by the impact of higher short-term rates on floating rate securities in our investment portfolio, disciplined deposits and liability pricing and higher loan and securities balances in the interest earning asset mix. Average deposit balances increased slightly by 1% sequentially. And while interest earning assets were roughly flat, average loans increased by about 6%, with growth primarily driven by margin loans, collateralized loans in wealth management and growth in capital cost financing. We also deployed some additional cash in HQLA securities, resulting in a quarter-over-quarter increase of the overall average investment securities portfolio of 2%. Moving on to expenses on page seven. Expenses for the quarter were $3 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of notable items, expenses were up 6%, just over half of which was driven by incremental investments net of efficiency savings and the remainder by higher revenue-related expenses, including higher staff expenses. A few additional details regarding noteworthy quarter-over-quarter expense variances. Staff expense was up 3%, driven by severance expense and incentive compensation. Net occupancy expense was up 11%, driven by expenses associated with exiting leased space as we continue to optimize our real estate footprint and some expenses related to return to the office. Business development expense increased, driven by higher marketing expenses as well as G&A. Other expenses was down due to lower litigation reserves. On to page eight for a closer look at our new business segment. Securities Services reported total revenue of $1.8 billion or up 5%. Let me just describe a little about what makes up this 5% increase. Fee revenue was up 6% and up 10% excluding the impact of fee waivers. Investment in other revenue benefited from a gain on a strategic equity investment. And net interest revenue was down 3%, driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by higher loan and deposit balances. As I discuss the lines of business within our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, I will focus my comments on the investment services fees, and each of them you can find in our financial supplement. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 10%. Excluding the impact of fee waivers, investment services fees were up 12%, primarily driven by higher activity from existing clients, higher market values and net new business. Our strong performance last year came on the back of already healthy sales in 2020, and we gained further sales momentum in 2021 as our continued investments in innovation are paying off. In Issuer Services, investment services fees were down 3%. But excluding the impact of fee waivers, investment services fees were up 1%. Healthy growth in Depositary Receipts was largely offset by the impact of the previously disclosed discontinued public sector mandate in Corporate Trust. FX revenue in our Securities Services segment increased by 6%, and solid volume growth from existing and new clients more than offset the impact of lower volatility. Next, onto Market and Wealth Services on page nine. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.2 billion, up 1%, primarily driven by higher net interest revenue and fees. Fee revenue was up 1% and up 4% excluding the impact of fee waivers. Net interest revenue was up 2% on the back of higher loan balances, partially offset by lower interest rates. In Pershing, investment services fees were down 2%. However, excluding the impact of fee waivers, investment services fees were up 3% as the impact of clients lost earlier in the year was more than offset by growth on the back of higher market values, client balances and activity from existing clients. The business continued to see good underlying growth. Net new assets in the quarter were $69 billion, and clearing house were up 5% year-over-year. In Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 4%. Excluding the impact of fee waivers, the investment services fees were up 8%, primarily driven by higher payment volume. And in Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 7%, reflecting broad-based growth on the back of higher tri-party collateral management balances and clearance volumes both in the US and internationally. Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on page 10. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $1 billion, up 3%. Fee revenue was up 4% and 9% excluding the impact of fee waivers. Net interest revenue was up 2% on the back of higher loan balances, partially offset by lower interest rates. Assets under management grew to $2.4 trillion, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and full year net inflows into both long term, specifically LDI and fixed income and cash products. For the quarter, we saw $31 billion of net inflows into cash and $4 billion of outflows from long-term products. Investment Management revenue was down 1%. However, excluding the impact of fee waivers, revenue was up 6%, primarily driven by higher market value and full year net inflows, partially offset by lower seed capital gains and performance fees. Wealth Management revenue grew by 13%, driven by higher market values, the absence of the loss on a business sale in the fourth quarter of the prior year and higher net interest revenue on the back of healthy loan growth as we continue to deepen client relationships into banking. Client assets continue to grow at a steady pace and were $321 billion, up 12% year-on-year. Page 11 shows the results of the Other segment. I will close with our outlook for 2022 on page 12. I'll start with a reminder that our outlook is based on the current forward curve. With that in mind, we currently expect NIR to increase by approximately 10% in 2022, primarily driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix, partially offset by an expectation for lower deposit balances. Our expectation for continued organic growth and lower fee waivers result in total fee growth of approximately 7% in 2022. More specifically, we expect roughly 4% up to 7% increase to be driven by the recovery of money market fee waivers based on the current forward curve and assuming some runoff in money market fund balances from current levels. We expect roughly 2% to be driven by organic growth and approximately 1% by market driven factors. And as a reminder, we generally expect a quarterly run rate of around $60 million for investments in other revenue. But as you know, this line can be lumpy due to seed capital gains through these strategic equity investments and other components. For expenses, ex notable items, we expect an increase of approximately 5.5% year-over-year. Roughly 60% of the increase is expected to be driven by higher revenue-related expenses, which include higher distribution and servicing expenses associated with fee waivers and the impact of inflationary pressures. The remainder is driven by investments, roughly half of which is just the annualization of incremental investment in the second half of last year. Specific to the first quarter, I'd like to remind you that staff expenses are typically elevated due to long-term incentive compensation expense for retiring eligible employees. As a result, we expect first quarter expenses, ex notables, to be up approximately 6% year-over-year. With regards to capital management, we expect to return roughly 100% of earnings, subject to changes in AOCI and deposit balances. And for the sake of completeness, we continue to expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 19%. To sum up and as Todd alluded to earlier, we expect to generate positive operating leverage on the back of continued organic growth and higher rates translating into higher NIR and lower fee waivers, while continuing to invest in the future growth and efficiency of our businesses. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Yes.  Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. I wonder if you could unpack the net interest revenue comment outlook of around 10%, maybe just trajectory wise, meaning I'm assuming you're assuming the forward curve. And so just talk about the timing as that comes in, and you can combine that with how quickly the fee waiver recapture happens along that forward curve. Thanks. Todd Gibbons : Emily? Emily Portney : Sure. Good morning, Glenn, and happy New Year. I'm actually really glad you kicked off with NIR because it's the first time in a long time we've got something positive to say. So NIR, as we mentioned, is expected to be up about 10% year-on-year. To give you color, just specific to the questions you asked, yes, we just use the forward curve and, as you know, at the moment, anticipate the three rate hikes, 3 25  basis point rate hikes, the first being in March. Although, of course, there's talk about the first one being a bit more and we can talk about the sensitivity there. Deposit betas obviously come back into play. The expectation in our outlook is that betas will largely retrace what we saw in the last cycle. They could be a little bit higher just given the change in our deposit mix. So for example, Treasury Services, the deposit base there is about twice as big as it was in 2015, and obviously, that business has higher betas. We expect our securities portfolio to be roughly flat. Most of the reduction on the asset side will be coming from cash held at central banks and lower-yielding HQLA. We do continue to be cautious on duration. In fact, over the last six weeks, we've brought duration in a bit, and we've actually moved some HQLA into HTM to preserve capital. Also, we are expecting some healthy loan growth and for premium amortization to reduce a bit. The one - just, Glenn, one thing I do want to just point out is that for the first quarter, just given that the first rate hike is not until March, also it's just worth mentioning we've already seen deposits come down a bit from the fourth quarter average where they were really at elevated levels due to kind of market dynamics. So you won't see much of that benefit sequentially in Q1. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Got a lot there. Thank you. And maybe just one other big picture. I think I heard you say in the prepared, 2% organic growth in '22-ish, which would be in line with '21 and obviously better than '20 and '19. So I guess the question is, when you look at investments you're making and combined with your fee outlook. I'm just curious how you can contextualize what's there related to markets that have already gone up, business that has already been won to be implemented versus follow-through and revenues related to new investments - the investments that you make in new businesses? Thanks. Todd Gibbons : So Emily, maybe I'll take that one. So a lot in that one, but couple of things. When I look at collateral management, that's one where we have been investing for quite a while. And we invest in what we call the Future of Collateral, which was really making collateral interoperable around the world, which we thought would lead to growth in our - especially in our international assets, which is exactly what it has done. Also benefiting from some of those capabilities is the unclear - the responsibility now for derivative players to have collateral against their uncleared margins. We have - now we're now going through phase 6 of that. So we are picking up significant assets as a result of that. And we've also added certain innovations to our capabilities. For example, the ability to have ESG criteria established in a repo and what you'll accept on repo. So that's something that's shown some pretty interesting growth. So that's something where we have been gaining and have shown up in the numbers and we continue to expect to continue to gain. I mean, one of the other interesting things that we've brought up is what we're doing in our treasury services and payments business. And I think we've reinvigorated that business with some meaningful investment. We were the first, as you know, to do an RTP, real time payments, through the New York Clearing House. That was done essentially to test it, but now we are actually putting practical product in place. So we announced late last year a request for payment service that we're providing to utilities. That operation, we have multiple players on that platform. And we see opportunity, whether it's brokerage firms, insurance companies, corporates or white labeling it for midsized banks there. So I think some of the innovation that we're seeing in the Treasury Services, we have not seen that drop to the bottom line yet. We've picked up, we've captured a little bit of market share and a little bit of a better price itself coming into this. We've talked a fair amount about Pershing X, which is a significant multiyear investment that we are making in our Pershing platform, specifically on the advisers, to simplify and make the advisory function much more productive for our clients. We made an acquisition of a direct indexing firm in the quarter. We decided to buy rather than build for speed to the market. And that group is going to be able to tailor portfolios and provide tax optimization down to the individual level. That hasn't started yet. So that will start probably by the end of this year, and we'll be continuing to invest. So we see that not as a 2022 event, but a 2023 and 2024. Nice growth in our Wealth Management business. And here, we've invested in some of the technology. And we've won some recognition for the quality of some of the advice path and kind of the wealth management tools that we put in place for our clients there. On the Asset Servicing side, we've talked about the digital assets unit that we put in place. It is garnering assets quite rapidly as we've gotten most of the pending ETF crypto assets that are coming in the US and just in a very high percentage offshore, especially in Canada. We've also got the - we developed an ESG app where we're starting to see some revenues flow on that. And we're investing just in the basics of custody because we think we can capture more of the developing markets custody. So it's kind of a mix. Still some on to come, but some of it embedded in our run rate today. Glenn Schorr : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Happy New Year. If can - if I actually start off on fee revenue outlook assumptions, really just start on the fee waivers and just the trajectory of that, Emily. Just to clarify, I think you said three rate hikes. And the forward curve, I think the guidance was as of December 31. So I'm not sure if that forward curve sort of... Emily Portney : Correct. Brian Bedell : Right. It's like advancement of the curve expectations, so getting a little bit more aggressive in the market for Fed hikes impact. So maybe if you could just walk through the money market fee waiver trajectory through the year and really circling back to the portion that gets released after the first hike and then maybe after the second hike. And then just on the equity market assumption - equity market return assumptions within that market, that 1% market impact? Emily Portney : Sure. So a bunch there. So let me take the waiver outlook first. So remember, waivers are a function of both balances also and rates. And you're correct, we are just looking at the full - and our guidance is baked in the forward curve with three rate hikes. We have pointed out in the past that with the first 25 basis point hike, we would expect to recoup about 50% of the waivers. Having said that, we do also expect that balances to begin to decline a bit, especially by, call it, the third or fourth hike. So we do see -- expect some runoff in balances. So when you put it all together, we would expect money market fund waivers to be a little less than half of what they actually were in 2021. Having said that, it's very important to note that as waivers dissipate, we also do see a rise in distribution expense, and that's been captured in the expense outlook. To give you an idea just - sorry. To answer the second question, which was more about sensitivity, just I think something that would probably be helpful. If we size the impact of both waivers and, frankly, NIR, if we had, say, a 50 basis point hike in March versus a 25 basis point hike, that would be about $100 million more in recouping waivers than what's in our guidance. And it'd probably be about $50 million more in NIR. So a total - if the March hike was 50, not 25, it'd be about another $150 million more in terms of revenues versus what I've guided. And then I think you had one more part, but... Brian Bedell : The equity market return assumptions within that 1% of fee contribution from sort of markets. Emily Portney : Sure. So just to step back, total fees - total fee revenue up 7%, roughly 4% driven by the reduction of waivers, roughly 2% organic growth and then 1% from market-driven factors. Market appreciation is kind of a little over 2%, but it's offset by lower fund fees and some currency headwinds just based on the average for FX rates over the course of 2021. Brian Bedell : Got it. Got it. And then if I could just circle back on the NIR deposit runoff assumptions in terms of the magnitude that you're expecting and then also just the assumptions for global short-term rates, I guess, particularly in the UK and how that might influence the NIR assumption. Emily Portney : Sure. So ultimately, from a deposit perspective, we don't really expect much runoff in deposits from here until kind of, again, third or fourth rate hike or the Fed starts to actually tighten. So it's - ultimately, balances, as I mentioned, have already come down a bit from average fourth quarter levels. And in terms of betas, in particular, just speaking specifically about betas, which is what I think you're probably getting at, we do think they'll be largely in line with the past. Like I said before, maybe a little bit higher, Treasury Services deposit balances are higher. Also just always keep in mind that our deposit base is largely institutional. Also in the '15, '16 period, we were trying to come into compliance with SLR, so we were pushing some deposits off balance sheet. But all of that is baked into the NIR guide that we gave. Brian Bedell : And then just the global rate, like the Bank of England assumptions for... Emily Portney : Yes, it's all the forward curve. It's all the forward curve. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Okay, thank you so much. Operator : We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Todd Gibbons : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I wanted to follow up on that discussion we just had and ask about how you're thinking about the impact of QT, quantitative tightening, on deposits with the Fed expected to shrink the balance sheet potentially starting as early as March? Todd Gibbons : I'll take it. Yes, thanks, Betsy. This is Todd. I'll take this one. We - right now, it depends on when they actually start to actually shrink the balance sheet. The guidance that we've heard is that's probably not an event until the second half. And so that's the estimates that we have put in to both our - the betas and the size of the balances, whether it be money market balances because it will certainly impact them or it is deposit balances. But assuming that they don't start really letting stuff run off until the second half of the year, we don't see an enormous drawdown in the combination of money market balances because the Fed's balance sheet just isn't going to contract that much in 2022. We might see that a little more rapidly in 2023, unless they were to do something even more aggressive like selling. So we took the basic assumptions - market assumptions that we've seen and kind of that's implied in all of the guidance that Emily just gave you, which is a little bit of runoff of balance sheet - of the Fed balance sheet in the second half, which starts to impact both deposits and money market balances as well. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So you're basically looking for the Fed to stop buying but not actively shrink.? Todd Gibbons : I don't think they'll actively - our estimate is that they won't actively sell, but they will actively let maturities run off. That's... Betsy Graseck : Yes, okay. All right. And then the follow-up question I had on the expense discussion, just thinking about how to model the expense ratios by the new segments that you've got. Obviously, the new segments are really helpful, really appreciate you breaking out the wealth piece. Can you give us some sense as to how we should think about modeling that expense ratio in the various segments as we go through '22? Todd Gibbons : Emily, do you want to take that? You may want to start with that one. Emily Portney : Sure, sure. So I mean I'll just - taking a step back first, just the overall expenses, 5.5%. And just to be clear, about 30% or 170 basis points are really revenue-related. And think volume-related, compensation, as well as, as I mentioned, the distribution expenses that we will see an uptick in from money market funds as the waivers come back or as we get the dissipation, I should say, of waivers. About another 30% or 170 basis points again is merit, the normalization of business expenses and some also expenses just related to occupancy as we return to the office, and baked in there too is inflation, which is not insignificant. And then the remaining 40% or 200% is due to higher investment spend. But just to be clear, half of that is annualizing investments that we have made in the second half of this year. As you all know, we had an uptick of investments in the second half of this year. I would think of it as - we're not breaking it down too much. I would say that it's a bit higher in, ultimately, in Market and Wealth Services given some of the investments that we're making, especially in Pershing X, as Todd alluded to, but we are making investments across the firm. So I would say a bit higher there and - but the rest kind of in and around the average. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. So not that much differential outside of the call-out on Pershing? Todd Gibbons : Yes. But I do think, Betsy, we will see the operating margins in our Securities Servicing business. Those are depressed right now, and I do think you'll see those expand, both combination of greater efficiency and revenue mix. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Q2 rate is also a little higher there? Todd Gibbons : Yes. Exactly. Emily Portney : Yes. We do - I mean just further to Todd's point, Securities Services, the margins there are depressed. They're in a little over 20 - 21% for the year. And we do expect, and I talked about this at the last conference I was at, we do expect that to grow in excess of 30 plus percent over the medium term. And as Todd alluded to, part of that is certainly profitable growth and, of course, efficiency. And the other part of that is obviously just more normalized rates. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks so much Todd and Emily. Appreciate it. Todd Gibbons : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on the expense question, I guess this is about the second year in a row close to 6% growth. Just how do you - and I understand all the inflationary and other moving pieces. But how do we think about longer term, if you're doing 2% organic growth, hopefully doing better. Is the notion that you can get expense growth down to similar to the organic growth and then sort of market and other things drive sort of operating leverage? Or how do we think about the long-term trajectory of expenses relative to revenues? Emily Portney : Sure. So I think you're getting at operating leverage, and we're always incredibly focused, obviously, on operating leverage and delivering positive operating leverage. And next year, we are expecting, just based on my guidance, to grow revenues more than we're growing expenses, so that's good. And when we think about the future and just the expense spend, we do see that ultimately moderating in 2023 and 2024. So you'll see that coming down a bit in 2023 and 2024. And of course, we have - we'll continue to see an uptick in rates, and higher NIR will recoup probably the remainder of our waivers. That, plus, the additional organic growth that we also will be delivering, we feel pretty confident that we'll be delivering even higher operating leverage in 2023, 2024. But we are delivering positive operating leverage in 2022. Todd Gibbons : And let me add something to that. We're doing something that's a bit unusual for us. For example, with Pershing X, we're making a very significant investment here that's probably got a 2 year payback. We've also been continuously investing in resiliency, and I think we're getting - we're starting to get in front of that. And the inflationary pressures, hopefully, this is just a onetime kind of step-up. But those will have to - the market will have to play itself out. So we do think that we're spending a little faster than we would in a more normal environment. And we do expect that we will get more leverage out of our business model as we just continue to make it more scalable. Jim Mitchell : Right. Okay. That's all very helpful. And just as a follow-up, if you're expecting deposits in the balance sheet to shrink as the Fed raises rates, why the need to issue preferred, just flexibility? I'm just trying to understand the preferred issuance. Emily Portney : Sure. Yeah, just more flexibility. We were also just opportunistic in terms of rates. And ultimately, too, you have to prepare for, if rates rise, there obviously will be a corresponding impact on OCI, so all of those factors. Jim Mitchell : Okay, thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, can you hear me? Emily Portney : Yeah\u2026 Mike Mayo : Is that better? Todd Gibbons : Yeah. Mike Mayo : Okay. I'm going to just give what I think I heard you say, then I'll let you correct me. What I think I heard you say is that this year is an investing year, that you are guiding for 2% organic fee growth or 3% with markets versus expense growth of 5.5%. So it looks like you're spending about half of the benefits of the money market fee waivers to invest. I'm not saying a call is in effect, but that's the way the math works. You said 40% of that increase in spending relates to accelerated investments. And then after this investing year, 2023 and 2024, that moderates and then we should see more of those benefits. So am I hearing that correctly? And am I also interpreting that you're taking a portion of these benefits to reinvest back in the business, especially in 2022? Todd Gibbons : Emily, do you want to take it? Emily Portney : Sure, Mike. I'll take - yeah, I'll take a stab at that. I think what you're asking very specifically is what portion of the uptick from rates, both in NIR and recouping waivers, are we kind of reinvesting. I mean I think that's what you're getting at. And I mean, just to be clear, and you can do the math, I gave you the math, that the higher rate environment, both from an NIR perspective and from a waiver perspective, is a bit over, call it, $700 million in revenues for the year with this forward curve, et cetera. The way I think about the expenses and what we're kind of reinvesting of that and based upon the expense guide I gave, you can also do the math that, call it, $100 million to $150 million of the expense growth is related to incremental investments net of efficiencies. So call it 20% or so of that is being reinvested. Mike Mayo : Okay. I guess I'm just trying to reconcile when you said 2% organic fee growth with 5.5% expense growth, some of that is just for factors outside of investing, as you said, inflation, occupancy, merit, revenue related. So it's just the cost of doing business. The other question is, why wouldn't the NII guide be higher assuming that the securities portfolio will remain flattish? Emily Portney : I mean, ultimately, there is many factors that go into our NIR guidance. So it's a mix of - I suppose probably the main reason is deposits coming off a bit. That would probably be the largest reason. Mike Mayo : And are you being conservative? Todd Gibbons : Mike, we do anticipate contraction of the balance sheet. So it's going to come from more shorter term cash that's paying a little bit lower yields. So - and I think your follow-up question is, are we being conservative? We're trying to reflect what exactly the market is indicating through forward curves. We're not trying -- we're not -- the guidance that we've given you isn't speculation. It's our -- it's only speculation in the sense it's the best estimate for betas and for what's going to happen to the yield curve using the forward yield curve as the guidance for it. Mike Mayo : Yes. Last one, just the contraction of the balance sheet, like by how much? And I mean there's not much history for this, right, going to this phase of the rate situation. So are you thinking 1/10? 1/5? Or just roughly, in broad terms, how much contraction of the balance sheet and why? Todd Gibbons : Emily, I'll take it... Emily Portney : Sure... Todd Gibbons : Are you going to take it? Oh, go ahead, Emily. Emily Portney : I can take it. Yes, ultimately, to be clear, we did see -- just a reminder, we did see balances already come down from fourth quarter averages. We don't really attribute that to kind of run off obviously from rates -- from rate rises. It's more about just elevated levels and market dynamics in the fourth quarter. And then from here, the way I kind of think about it is we probably won't see much more runoff until the second half. But like I said, it's really after the Fed really hikes a few times. And I'd say kind of single-digit reduction in this year, yes. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Emily Portney : In this year, yeah. Mike Mayo : Right, thank you. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Mike. Operator : We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Todd, good morning Emily. Todd Gibbons : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : I want to come back to something you said in your prepared remarks that your new business wins, I think you said are up 50% from 2019. Is that - it seems like a very strong number. How does that compare to a prior 2-year - from 2016 to 2019 maybe? And second, what were the main drivers? Was it better products? Better pricing? Your people are just hitting it harder? Can you give us some color on what drove that strong number? Todd Gibbons : Sure. So we had run for a couple of years there, Gerard, we were literally running negative organic growth. And so maybe 4 years ago, I would be - I would say some of the service levels weren't up to par, and we turned that around. So we made a very significant investment in the quality of the service that we're delivering. We did make some - we did provide some innovation whether it's around our whole bundle, what we can deliver, some of the connectivity that we made to some of the OMS providers, our data and analytics capability and, most importantly, the quality of our service in the asset servicing space, and that became noticeable. And both the combination of investing in technology and the quality of service that we delivered, we started picking up some market share. And so I would say that was the primary driver, and it's been a mantra here. And in fact, when Emily was back on the Asset Servicing side, she did a great job of putting together real analytics to support and understand exactly what was going on with our clients and adjust accordingly. So I think it's a combination of the two. Clients are going to be with you. They expect that you're going to be investing for the long term, that you've committed to it, and we've demonstrated that. And number two, you got to provide - you've got to do the basics, the meat and potato stuff for them as well. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And as a follow-up, you guys gave, obviously, the outlook for 2022, which is much appreciated. In that outlook, you talked about the share repurchase or the total payout ratio approximating 100% and is subject to changes in the AOCI or maybe deposit balances. On the AOCI, if I saw it correctly, I may have not seen it correctly, but it looked like it was a negative $2.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Can you share with us what drives that number and how it could affect the total payout ratio as the year progresses? Todd Gibbons : Yes, Emily, you have the data... Emily Portney : Sure. So... Todd Gibbons : Yes, go ahead, Emily. Emily Portney : Well, I guess - so thinking about just the payout, and we can talk about AOCI, I'm not sure I recognize the number that you're talking about, the $2 billion. But in any event, the - our - we were fortunate, obviously, this year, or 2021, I should say, to be able to pay out 160%, obviously helped by the fact that we had excess capital, limited by a lot of what we could do in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. The guidance that we're going to pay out around 100% of earnings is baked into that our AOCI assumptions, et cetera. So it's all there. Basically, our capacity and the pace of the buyback is you're going to depend certainly on future earnings, the economic outlook, the size of the deposit base in any given quarter and what we're expecting and, you're right, the trajectory of OCI. But all of that is baked into the guidance. And the thing that's, frankly, that's nice is that for these days, in terms of capital management, we're now under the SCB framework so we certainly can be much more dynamic and flexible. Gerard Cassidy : I see. And just on the AOCI, Emily, would - what rate - what part of the yield curve has the biggest effect on your AOCI? The short end or the long end? The middle? Emily Portney : The short end. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, great. appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just want a follow-up on balance sheet positioning to Gerard's question. So you're at the lower end of that Tier 1 leverage ratio zone, 5.5% to 6% that you've talked about. And I just want to understand a little bit deeper that flexibility with regards to changes in OCI versus press. Are you solving for 5.5% at this point? Like how do you look at like where you want to be in that range? And to your point about SCB, how important does maintaining the buyback be versus just staying in a right zone of capital? Thanks. Emily Portney : Sure. So I can take that, and Todd, you can add. So Tier 1 leverage this quarter, as you guys can see, the fourth quarter was 5.5%. If you really do the math, which you all have the - all of the factors to be able to do it yourself, it was 5.46%. So we did dip into the buffer just a bit. We always talked about the fact that, that would be entirely appropriate given the excess liquidity in the system and the growth in our deposits. So going forward, we're going to be managing to 5.5%. And we're optimizing around a lot of different things, including OCI. So baked into our guidance is the - certainly, our expectation that we'll be above 5.5%. Ken Usdin : Okay. So we consider all of those factors, perhaps OCI, balance sheet size and you kind of sit somewhere in that zone? Emily Portney : You got it. Ken Usdin : Okay. All right. And then second question, just on that related point. If I back out premium amortization, it looks like the securities portfolio yield is kind of getting to a flat point and it looks like the mid-140s. Can you talk about just what you're finding in terms of front book versus back book? And again, does that OCI risk change your view of how you're investing in the securities portfolio from here? Thanks again, Emily. Emily Portney : Okay. So a couple of different things there. So look, the talking about reinvestment yields, we don't really disclose front book versus back book. What I would say is that - and this probably answers a bit of Mike's question earlier, which I hadn't thought about, but reinvestment yields will still continue to be a bit of a headwind over the course of 2022. So the yield that we're investing in now is still lower than ultimately the yield of maturity - securities that are maturing. I think we would expect that to probably be a lot better matched or equally matched almost by the fourth quarter. It's really in the fourth quarter. So that will still be a headwind. And look, we're thinking about and certainly paying attention to OCI. And as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we did even move some HQLA to HTM exactly for that reason, to preserve capital. Ken Usdin : Understood. Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I had a follow-up. So Emily, I think it seems like from your comments, when you backed into the components of expense growth, something like roughly 1 percentage point of the 5.5% is from the distribution side of the fee waivers. Number one, if you could confirm that that's correct. And then number two, if we - that means if we adjust for waivers, because we all got very much used to adjusting for waivers from last year when you guys were talking about the revenue ex waivers and then wanting to drive more investment, it looks like ex waivers, we're looking at negative operating leverage here because you back out the 4% benefit from fee revenue. You've got - that gets you to a 3% fee revenue growth ex waivers. If I'm right on the 1%, you're at 4.5% on expenses ex waivers. And so it's negative fee operating leverage. Given that last year, we were adjusting for the waivers and backing them out to consider where the fee operating leverage was, why not maintain that same discipline now? And what's the major issue with holding back that fee operating leverage? Thanks. Emily Portney : Sure. So I'll take that, and Todd, if you want to add. So you're thinking about the expense, the distribution expected largely in the right way. And look, your question about operating leverage is that our level of investment is not planned by nor dictated by operating leverage. It's based upon the investments that we see and the future growth of the company. In terms of what you call fee operating leverage, yes, you're right, in 2022, it will be negative. But we're not going to be apologetic about investing in the future of the company, and we've continued to do that over the course of the cycle. Todd Gibbons : I have nothing to add to that. Brennan Hawken : Okay. There we go. All right. And then the assumptions around the single digit decline in deposits, are excess deposits still at 10% to 15%? And when we start to cross the 75 basis points of 2, 3 hikes, where you start to see an acceleration of deposit runoff, wouldn't that 10% to 15% of excess deposits burn off pretty quickly? Or do you have a different view? Or have the excess deposit levels changed? Maybe if you could add a little color around some of those assumptions to help us square that circle would be helpful. Todd Gibbons : Sure. So I think your estimate of excess deposits is probably pretty close to what we're currently thinking. But you got to remember, underneath it, there is some organic growth as well. So if you take the 10% to 15% and then you're growing 2% to 4% organically, and then you don't look to see the Fed really contracting their balance sheet very aggressively until later in this year, we don't see a huge impact on this year. It's really going to depend around the betas. So you might see money bouncing around based on what we and others are willing to actually pay for it. So that's what's factored into it. But ultimately, I think those excess deposits will come down with mitigated somewhat by just normal growth. Brennan Hawken : Okay, got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : We'll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Good morning, everybody. Just a couple of questions at this point. The - I heard the discussion around deposit betas perhaps being slightly higher this time around because  is on the Treasury Services side of the business. Is there a way you can flush that out a little bit more, just to give us a sense of what you expect for deposit betas in this cycle versus the prior cycle? Emily Portney : Yeah. I'm not going to break it out by line of business. But in the last cycle, I think the first 25 - with the first 25 basis point hike, it was about - betas were about 25%. And in this, we're kind of expecting closer to like, I guess, 35 to 40-ish percent, and that's overall on average across all of our businesses. Alex Blostein : Got it. Okay. That probably explains some of the deltas people are asking about on NII. So that helps. My follow-up, just around capital management. Again, thanks for the color around AOCI. Sorry if I missed the dividend versus buyback expectations. So as you're thinking forward within a 100% payout ratio, what are you guys thinking in terms of dividend growth versus the buyback and the preference there? Todd Gibbons : Yes, I'll go ahead. We've been pretty consistent in targeting dividends around 30%, Alex. So I think probably you will see the adjustment come in the form of a buyback, if there is one. Alex Blostein : Got it, okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Emily I just want - I know you spoke about deposit beta assumptions underpinning the NII guidance. You gave some color on deposit runoff. I was hoping you could just provide some color specifically on what you're assuming in terms of non-interest-bearing deposit declines and some deposit remixing over the course of the year. Emily Portney : Sure. So when we think about NID, if you will, what we call non-interest-bearing deposits, we probably think we still have anywhere - well, actually, sorry, when you think about it, and it's actually disclosed, so actually I can talk about real numbers, I think net interest deposits are close to $90 o -so billion. What you'll see as deposits, as rate hike, what generally will happen is that they will - some will roll off, for sure, but others will actually just kind of migrate into interest-bearing deposits, so all of that is baked into our guidance. Steven Chubak : And do you have any specific assumptions you can provide just in terms of the absolute level of contraction you're contemplating? Todd Gibbons : Well, we've seen - I'll add a little color there. What we've seen historically through these cycles is we're operating somewhere around 30% of our total balance is non-interest-bearing. We've - and it's a little bit tricky to pick up because of the US versus non-US. But that is definitely very high because of the level of interest rates. We'd expect that to drop into the low 20s, something like that. Steven Chubak : Got it. That's helpful color. And then just for my follow-up, I might be jumping the gun here, but I wanted to see if you guys have done any preliminary work or analysis around Basel IV and how that might impact minimum capital requirements. I know you guys are constrained by leverage today. There's some speculation that under the new capital regime, the inclusion of operational risk and standardized, in particular, just given that's such a big piece of your overall RWA today, could have a meaningful impact on overall capital requirements. I know you don't have the proposal yet from the Fed, but even any preliminary thoughts around how you're handicapping that potential risk would be really helpful. Emily Portney : Sure. I mean we're obviously very involved with the conversation with regulators. And you're correct that the inclusion of operating risk will be a bit of a headwind in terms of capital, but there are other factors that are coming off. So net-net, we think it's going to be relatively - will be relatively neutral. Steven Chubak : Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Todd Gibbons : Thank you, Steven. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Todd with any additional or closing remarks. Todd Gibbons : Nothing to add. Thank you very much for your interest in the firm, and you can follow up with Marius and the team afterwards if there are any further questions. Thank you very much. And have a good day. Emily Portney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 :00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today. Have a good day.+",

Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I will now hand the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Marius Merz : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Today, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. I am joined by Todd Gibbons, our Chief Executive Officer; Robin Vince, President and CEO Elect; and Emily Portney, our Chief Financial Officer. Todd will provide introductory remarks and then Emily will take you through the earnings presentation. Following their remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplements and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 18, 2022 and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thank you, Marius and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Referring to Slide 2 of our financial highlights presentation, we continue to see healthy underlying momentum across most of our businesses and reported revenue of $3.9 billion, which was roughly flat year-over-year and it was up 2% if you exclude the impact of government sanctions and the additional actions that were taken related to Russia. Now we are in an increasingly uncertain environment, including the war in Ukraine, volatile markets and persistently higher inflation, which will require more meaningful monetary policy adjustments. It is in times like these that our strong, lower risk balance sheet and the resiliency of our business model, differentiates us. In the face of the tragic events occurring in Ukraine, we ceased new banking business in Russia and suspended investment management purchases of Russian securities. Since the beginning of the war, we stepped up our humanitarian efforts as well as the support for our employees and the members of our community who have been impacted. And we continue working for our multinational clients that depend on our custody and recordkeeping services to manage their exposures. The expenses of $3 billion were up 5.5% as we continue to invest in further growth and efficiency initiatives. And we reported EPS of $0.86 and that included an $0.08 impact related to Russia. We continued to generate a significant amount of capital and returned close to 60% of earnings to our shareholders, primarily through common dividends. Throughout the quarter, we took actions in the investment securities portfolio to temper the immediate impact to capital from higher interest rates. And we expect higher rates to be both a positive for fees and net interest revenue going forward. Emily will discuss the details for the quarter shortly, but let me briefly touch on a few business highlights. In Asset Servicing, we managed to keep the strong sales momentum with which we entered the year. Wins and win rates improved off of what had been a healthy quarter a year ago. One in mandated AUCA is up meaningfully both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, producing a strong pipeline of AUCA to be installed in 2022 and beyond. And our retention rate was an exceptional 97%. Our ETF business continues to stand out, having increased the number of funds serviced by 4% since the beginning of the year and we were recognized as best ETF custodian at the ETF Express European Awards last month. We also continued building momentum as a leader in digital assets, having been selected by Circle as primary custodian for the USD coin reserves. And late last week, we announced an exciting data and digital collaboration with Aon. Together, we will focus on supporting the ESG needs of clients globally, leveraging our collective data and analytics capabilities and unique datasets to help clients make better, more informed investment strategy decisions by providing enhanced datasets, advanced analytics and actionable insights into ESG portfolio level exposures. In Pershing, year-over-year comparisons continue to be impacted by the previously disclosed lost business in the second half of last year. And remember, the first quarter of last year was exceptionally strong on the back of elevated transaction activity. Now, while there are puts and takes here that can impact the amount of organic growth in any given quarter, we remain extremely excited about Pershing\u2019s prospects. Our clients are doing well and as they capture new assets, we are growing with them. And we are well positioned to benefit from a number of secular growth trends, such as the rapid growth in number of Breakaway Advisors and digitally-oriented wealth firms. Of course, consolidation in the sector can leave us on either side of any particular transaction. But over time, we find that our clients were typically the largest and most complex players in the industry are more often than not on the acquiring side. And in Pershing X, we continue to make solid progress since announcing the initiative back in October. Following on last quarter\u2019s acquisition of Optimal Asset Management, this quarter we made several key hires, which completed the filling out of our leadership team. And we folded Albridge\u2019s wealth reporting and data aggregation tool under the Pershing X umbrella. This alignment strengthens Pershing X\u2019s data offering, allows it to draw on Albridge\u2019s engineers to accelerate development of the platform, and provides clients with access to a broader suite of technology solutions. Shifting to Clearance and Collateral Management, there we delivered a strong quarter of organic growth on the back of higher securities clearance volumes and as collateral management balances remained elevated at a record $5 trillion in the quarter. Market volatility is driving dealer demand for U.S. treasuries and we are also seeing a promising pickup in new collateral balances related to our future of collateral initiatives with asset balances already being mobilized to the EMEA region and growing, providing our clients with optimization and funding benefits. Treasury Services also delivered another solid quarter of growth, driven by higher payment volumes and an improved product mix. The business continued to build on its recent track record of industry first, this quarter being the first bank to successfully connect to and send a message on the FedNow real-time payment system. And we are excited to welcome Jennifer Barker to the company as the new CEO of the business starting in May. Jennifer brings almost two decades of global client experience in the treasury service industry and she is the perfect leader to build upon the business\u2019 recent success and innovative track record. In Investment Management, given the environment, it\u2019s not surprising to see some challenges as clients and higher earning funds rebalance and de-risk. That said investment performance remained strong with over 80% of our top 30 strategies by revenue in the top two quartiles on a 3-year basis. We are also seeing good traction with our expanding suite of passive and active ETFs. We launched the BNY Mellon responsible Horizon\u2019s corporate bond ETF managed by Incyte and total ETF AUM grew by 8% quarter-over-quarter. I also want to highlight an exciting new share class for the Dreyfus government Cash Management fund called BOLD. This share class, which provides investors the opportunity to make a direct social impact supporting Howard University and historically black college and university already, grew to over $1 billion in AUM within only weeks of launch at the end of February. We also continue to be pleased with the healthy growth that we are seeing in Wealth Management, client acquisition rates continue trending in the right direction, and our improved digital tools and expanded banking offerings are driving deeper client relationships as evidenced by the solid loan and deposit growth. As an example, during the quarter, we successfully completed the initial rollout of Loan Path, our new digital platform for investment credit lines, which allows us to streamline our processes and significantly improve the client experience at the same time. Across the franchise, we are honored to have once again been recognized by Fortune for making both its world\u2019s most admired companies in 2022 as well as its Blockchain 50 list, which recognizes 50 companies around the world for deploying blockchain technology to speed up business processes, increase transparency and potentially save substantial costs for the industry. We are also proud to have been named to Barron\u2019s 100 Most Sustainable Companies list, which recognizes companies that score highest across 230 environment, social and governance indicators. Now before I turn it over to Emily, I\u2019d also like to touch on my decision to retire as CEO on August 31 and the appointment of Robin as my successor. When I joined BNY Mellon 36 years ago, I was drawn by the company\u2019s rich history, its special culture and the important place it occupies in the global financial system. Over the last four decades, we have undergone an incredible transformation from the traditional commercial bank that we once were to the globally significant lower risk financial services company that we are today. And I am particularly proud of what we have accomplished over the last couple of years. With a new leadership team in place, we launched a compelling agenda for growth and innovation under which we have already seen a meaningful pickup in organic growth. We have also really involved our culture. Today, we are much more performance-oriented and client-centric, we are more nimble in our decision-making and we are doing a lot better at connecting the dots across our differentiated businesses. When our strategic ambitions and the strength of our franchise were tested by the global pandemic, our people once again rose to the occasion and not only delivered on our commitments to our clients, communities and shareholders, but we also continue to make significant progress in our journey to position the company for the future. In Robin, we have found an outstanding leader to build on this agenda and to lead BNY Mellon into its exciting next chapter. Having known Robin as a client for almost a decade, I was thrilled to recruit them to the company in 2020 and to work directly with him these last 2 years. Since then, he has not only had a profound impact on the company through his leadership of Pershing, Treasury Services, Clearance and Collateral Management and our Markets businesses, but he has been a trusted strategic adviser to me and the rest of the executive management team. Rob and I are working closely together and with our executive committee to ensure a seamless transition in the next couple of months. With that, I will turn it over to Emily. Emily Portney : Thank you, Todd. And I will add my congratulations to you on your retirement and I want to thank you for your leadership and mentoring over the years. So, good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of results for the quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise. Starting on Page 3, total revenue was flat and included an approximately $90 million reduction related to Russia, a notable item this quarter. Fee revenue was down 3% or flat excluding the impact related to Russia. The benefit of higher market values as well as continued momentum across many of our businesses was offset by the impact of lost business in Pershing and Corporate Trust in the prior year, lower FX revenue of elevated levels in the first quarter of last year and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. While not on the page, firm-wide AUCA of $45.5 trillion increased by 9%, of which 8% is growth from new and existing clients and 1% is driven by the impact of higher market values, net of currency headwinds. AUM of $2.3 trillion increased by 2% year-over-year, reflecting cumulative net inflows and higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Money market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense were $199 million in the quarter, an improvement of $44 million compared to the prior quarter. This reflects the benefit of higher average short-term interest rates partially offset by higher money market fund balances. Once again, our growth in money market fund balances meaningfully outpaced the industry. Together, the impact of lower waivers and higher balances drove a sequential increase in pre-tax income of close to $60 million. On a year-over-year basis, fee waivers had a de minimis impact to our fees revenue. Investment and other revenue was $70 million and net interest revenue increased by 7%, reflecting higher interest rates on interest-earning assets, change in mix and lower funding expense. Expenses were up about 5.5% or 6% excluding notable eye. Provision for credit losses was $2 million. The benefit from the continued improvement in the credit portfolio, led by commercial real estate was more than offset by a $15 million reserve build on interest-bearing deposits with banks in Russia. And our effective tax rate was approximately 17% as expected due to the annual vesting of stock-based awards in the first quarter, which provided a seasonal benefit. EPS was $0.86 and included an $0.08 negative impact of the notable items related to Russia. Pre-tax margin and ROTCE were 23% and 15% respectively on a reported basis and 25% and 17%, excluding notable items. On to capital and liquidity on Page 4, our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio, which continues to be our binding constraint, was 5.3%, down 15 basis points sequentially. The sharp rise in interest rates resulted in a $1.5 billion impact to unrealized losses in our available-for-sale securities portfolio and we distributed roughly 60% of our earnings to our shareholders predominantly through dividends. The impact of the reduction of capital on our Tier 1 leverage ratio was partially offset by the benefit of a smaller balance sheet quarter-over-quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 10.1%, down approximately 100 basis points compared to the end of the prior quarter, primarily reflecting the negative mark-to-market of the AFS portfolio as well as an approximately 30 basis point impact from the adoption of SACCR. Finally, our LCR was 109%, consistent with the prior quarter. Turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on Page 5, which I will talk about in sequential terms. Net interest revenue was $698 million, up 3% sequentially. This increase reflects higher rates as well as continued growth in loan balances partially offset by lower cash and securities balances. Average deposit balances declined by 3%, while average interest-earning assets were down 2% sequentially. Within this, loan balances were up nicely about 3% sequentially. Moving on to expenses on Page 6, expense for the quarter were $3 billion, up about 5.5% year-over-year and up 6% excluding notable items from last year. This increase primarily reflects investments net of efficiency savings and it also reflects higher revenue-related expenses, which were partially offset by the favorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. A few additional details regarding noteworthy quarter-over-quarter expense variances. Staff expense was up 4%, reflecting the annual vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees. Distribution and servicing expense is up 5%, reflecting higher distribution cost associated with money market funds and net occupancy expense was down 8% as we continue to optimize our real estate portfolio. Turning to Page 7 for a closer look at our business segments. Security Services reported total revenue of $1.8 billion flat compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the reduction related to Russia, revenue was up 4%. Fee revenue was down 5% and up 1% excluding the impact of Russia and net interest revenue was up 6%, reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. As I discussed the lines of business within our Security Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will focus my comments on the investment services fee for each business, which you can find in our financial supplement. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 5%, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business, partially offset by slightly lower transaction activity from existing clients. As Todd mentioned earlier, our sales momentum continues to be strong compared to the first quarter of last year. Our Issuer Services business was significantly impacted by the reduction related to Russia. Investment Services fees were down 43%. Specifically, we accelerated amortization of deferred costs for depository services of Russian companies, which is a contra revenue item. Excluding this impact, investment services fees were down approximately 9%, and this primarily reflects lower depositary receipt fees and the impact of lost business in the prior year in Corporate Trust. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.2 billion, flat compared to the prior year. Fee revenue was also flat. And net interest revenue was up 2%, reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit balances. In Pershing, investment services fees were down 6%. This reflects the impact of lost business in the prior year as well as lower transaction activity versus a very active first quarter of last year, partially offset by the impact of higher market value. Pershing continued to deliver solid underlying growth. Clearing accounts continued to grow at a 4% annualized growth rate, and we gathered net new assets of $18 billion in the quarter. In Treasury Services, Investment Services fees were up 4% as the business saw growth from both new and existing clients and continue to gain traction in higher-margin products such as digital payments. And in Clearance and Collateral management, investment services fees were up 8%, reflecting both higher tri-party collateral management balances as well as higher clearance volumes. Now turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 9, Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $964 million, down 3%. Fee revenue was also down 3%. Investment in other revenue was a negative $8 million and included losses on seed capital. And net interest revenue was up 19%, reflecting higher interest rates as well as higher deposits and loan balances. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with assets under management of $2.3 trillion, up 2% year-over-year. This increase primarily reflects the benefit of cumulative net inflows into both cash and long-term products as well as higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. As it relates to flows in the quarter, we saw $1 billion of net outflows from long-term products and $11 billion of net outflows from cash. Having said that, LDI continued to be a bright spot with $17 billion of net inflows. In Investment Management, revenue was down 6%. Higher market values were more than offset by lower capital results and lower equity income as well as the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, which is more impactful in investment management, given that approximately 50% of our revenue is earned in foreign currencies. Wealth Management revenue grew by 4%, primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue and higher market value. Client assets of $305 billion were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher markets and cumulative net inflows. And we continue to see healthy growth in both deposits and loans as we\u2019ve expanded our banking offering and deepened our client relationships. Page 10 shows the results of the Other segment. I will close with an update on our outlook for the full year of 2022. Obviously, given the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, rapidly evolving global monetary policy and the continued overhang of the pandemic, the macroeconomic environment is very uncertain. For our outlook, we assume a scenario where interest rates follow the forward curve and market values stay relatively flat to where they were at the end of the first quarter. With this in mind, we project full year NIR to be up roughly 13% compared to 2021. Embedded in this assumption, we expect the correlation between rates and deposit runoff to be consistent with what we have seen in the past. We now expect fee revenue to be up 4% to 5%. This includes a tailwind of about 5% from the reduction of fee waivers, organic growth of 1% plus and a 1% to 2% headwind from the impact of Russia, market value, currency and other factors. For expenses, ex notable items, we now expect an increase of approximately 5%, slightly lower than our previous guidance. With regards to Capital Management, we\u2019ve taken a number of actions to reposition our portfolio to reduce the impact of higher rates and credit spreads. For example, we lowered duration in the AFS portfolio, reduced credit exposure and moved assets to HTM. These actions have reduced our AOCI rate sensitivity by about 25% going forward. Having said that, we remain cautious on buybacks in the near-term. And based on the environment we described earlier, we ultimately expect to return at least 75% of earnings to shareholders this year. We do continue to expect to return close to 100% of earnings to our shareholders over time. Last but not least, we continue to expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 19%. With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our first question from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First, Todd, congrats on your pending retirement and Robin, congrats on the new role. I look forward to working closer with you. Before a question though for Robin, I\u2019d love to drill down a little bit MOI what you talked about. More tactically around the actions you\u2019ve taken with the balance sheet to reduce the AOCI sensitivity. Could you maybe expand on that a bit and touch on some of the specific actions in greater detail and what impact we could expect on the outlook for NIR and how that might inform your updated expectation? Emily Portney : So Brennan, good morning. I just taking a quick step back, I do want to do a shout-out to our CIO because I think that really did \u2013 do a great job in terms of both optimizing NIR but also protecting against AOCI volatility during the quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks and I\u2019ll give a bit more color, we shortened the duration of the AFS portion of the portfolio. It\u2019s now a little over 1.5 years, down from more than 2 years at the end of last quarter. We\u2019ve transferred longer-dated securities to HTM. You\u2019ll notice that HTM now as a proportion of the securities portfolio is about 40%. That\u2019s up from about 36% at the end of last year. We\u2019ve also reduced convexity and credit risk in the portfolio. And so all of these things, I mean, we did \u2013 obviously, there was a reduction in AOCI of $1.5 billion during the quarter, but it would have been larger had we not taken these actions. And as you rightfully point out, these actions have also made us a lot less sensitive to rising rates going forward. And as I also, I think, mentioned, we\u2019ve reduced \u2013 just to put a finer point on it. We\u2019ve reduced DV01 in the AFS portfolio in excess of 25% just through the actions that we carried out this quarter. So as you can tell, we\u2019ve been managing the portfolio very actively, we\u2019ll continue to monitor it and be very nimble. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that, Emily. Robin, maybe one for you. Stepping back and widening out here. Understand that you\u2019ve just been named to the job. But you\u2019re not new to Bank of New York, for sure. So at this point, can you provide any details or plans about your goals or targets? Or maybe at least like a road map for when we could expect to hear more from you about your goals and your plans? Robin Vince : Sure. Good morning, Brennan, and I appreciate the comment and the question. So you\u2019re right. I\u2019m not completely new to the firm, which is certainly an advantage for me in coming in and taking on the role. But I will say that I\u2019m being very diligent, as Todd referred to earlier on in his comments about the transition. And so we\u2019re working very closely together. And I don\u2019t want to be complacent about the fact that there\u2019s a great opportunity for a CEO-Elect to have the opportunity to come in and to really benefit from a transition. Having said all of that, when I joined the firm, I was really struck by the breadth of the franchise. I mean, 93% of the world\u2019s top investment managers or clients of ours are as are 97% of the world\u2019s top 100 banks. And that breadth, coupled with the depth of the franchise, that real client trust that we\u2019ve talked about before is a super powerful foundation. And so job number one for me is to really build on that. And that\u2019s been an investment that Todd has been very focused on during his time as CEO. Now what I also would reflect on is some of the things that I\u2019ve been focused on in the Market and Wealth Services businesses. And the first of those is innovation. You\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve launched Pershing X. We\u2019ve been very focused on real-time payments in the treasury services space. And that concept of really driving innovation across the enterprise is another important pillar of how I think about the firm and the opportunity that\u2019s ahead of us. Another thing that we\u2019ve been doing in that segment, which I\u2019m very excited about across the company is really deepening the wallet, connecting the dots across the firm, helping clients that are existing clients of the firm to do more with us. And that whole ethos of on BNY Mellon, I think is a real important and deep vein for us to continue to mine. And then the last point that I have mentioned is operating leverage and focus on margins. In that segment, we had a 41% margin in the first quarter and having run operational businesses in the past. I\u2019m very focused on operating leverage, and that will continue to be a focus of mine along with these other pillars. So that\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about the world. But I\u2019d just remind you that I\u2019m still in the transition and enjoying working with Todd, and we\u2019re really focused on making this a smooth and effective handover. Brennan Hawken : Alright. Thanks for that color, Rob. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Brennan. Robin Vince : Thanks, Brennan. Todd Gibbons : Next question, operator. Operator : We will now take our next question from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, well, I was going to ask you, Robin, I asked that at the shareholder meeting, but maybe just a little bit more about your background. I just say that when Northern changed their CEO, they said the old CEO is more about marketing and I\u2019m more about numbers. When State Street changed, their CEO, they said, well, the new CEO was more about understanding asset management and their clients. Anything else \u2013 since we don\u2019t know you as well as Todd, who\u2019s been there for in his fourth decade, anything else about your background that you could share that could give investors confidence as you are about to enter the CEO role in several months. Robin Vince : Sure, Mike. Well, I\u2019m all about being a great all-around CEO. But to answer the sort of question a bit more directly in terms of my background, I feel like I\u2019ve been prepared for this role over the course of my career. I started off in the markets business, and I ran the money markets business at my prior organization, which was a great opportunity to really get into the markets, capital markets, interest rates and really the client franchise. And of course, a lot of those same clients are clients of ours and so that was a great formative start for me. I ran operations at my prior firm. I was a treasurer. I was the Chief Risk Officer. I was the CEO of the International Bank. I operated internationally. And so when I put all of that together, I think it really gives me the opportunity having touched a lot of different aspects of our franchise and our activities to really bring all of that to bear in the role going forward. And I\u2019m very excited about that. And as I joined the firm, I commented before, I\u2019ve been struck by a few things, including the depth and breadth of the franchise, but also the culture of the firm. And I think that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for us, and I\u2019m excited to have at it. Mike Mayo : And so to summarize, you kind of want to have like one BNY Mellon and improve the wallet share. And hopefully, I\u2019m not sure if you guys can give us now. I don\u2019t think so, Todd. There is not too many firms that do it. But what\u2019s your market share by large client, where was it a few years ago? And where do you hope it to be? Do you have any metrics around that or do you think we can get that in the future? Todd Gibbons : Yes. We haven\u2019t disclosed that publicly, but what I would say is we have grown with our clients, and we have continued to increase market share with our largest clients over the past couple of years especially in our servicing business \u2013 our Asset Servicing business. And I think some of the stats that we even did disclose this morning that Emily mentioned. We retained 90 \u2013 actually, I mentioned that. We retained 97% of all of the business that we re-bid on, which is an enormously high number. And we\u2019ve got some capabilities, I mean, the investments that we\u2019ve made in service quality. And some of that is in some of the technology that we\u2019ve got around that, keeping us much closer to our clients, much better informed, much more responsive. The investments that we\u2019ve made in our data management and data analytics, we have where I think we are the leader, not only in the servicing capabilities, but also the fact that we can \u2013 we\u2019ve got the ability to bundle all of the back-office service is not just custody and accounting administration. But TA as well as a differentiator. So I think we are seeing increased market share. I haven\u2019t disclosed it specifically against the major clients. But I think the fact that we are with just about every one of the major clients reflects that. Mike Mayo : Alright. Thank you. Robin Vince : Thanks Mike. Operator : We will now take our next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Emily, I wanted to ask you a little bit on net interest income and some of the changes that you\u2019re referencing. So I guess to start, can you help us understand your point about historical reference of deposits versus QT or rates environment. We saw the positives come down this quarter. Can you tell us what you\u2019re expecting to see out of the balance sheet going forward? Emily Portney : Sure. So when it comes to deposits and runoff, what I\u2019d first say is that we\u2019re just using the forward curve. So assume that it\u2019s just as baked into the forward curve, Fed funds is about 2.5% by the end of the year. Also, we\u2019re just assuming that betas largely retraced what we\u2019ve seen in the last cycle. It means that we will get to the end state faster, but they\u2019re going to largely retrace it\u2019s correlated to rates and largely are chased what we\u2019ve already seen. So with all that said, we would expect deposit probably run off maybe about 10% over the course of this year. And that\u2019s from where we are in the average of the first quarter. We\u2019ve already seen them come down a bit from the fourth quarter. And just as a reminder, our deposit base is largely institutional NIBs. Part of the growth you\u2019ve seen has been in NIBs and so we expect that to kind of normalize to over time. And the other thing I would mention is that as we see deposit runoff, we also could see a migration to money market funds. And if that does indeed happen, then obviously, that could be a nice tailwind for us as well. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then in terms of the shortening up of the duration, can you tell us how I don\u2019t know if you can size the magnitude of how much that might have changed your current views of full year NII up 13% versus what it might have been otherwise? And how you\u2019re now redirecting incremental cash flows into the portfolio versus what you might have done otherwise, if rates haven\u2019t gone up this quickly? Emily Portney : Yes. We are \u2013 we\u2019ve obviously shortened duration across the portfolio. We\u2019ve swapped fixed floating. And considering just the uncertain environment, we\u2019re also continuing to be cautious and nimble. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then you mentioned the more cautious on buybacks in the near-term and maybe returning 75% this year. How will you evaluate that? Obviously, we can do math on what it means for this year. But in terms of how much could the swings in AOCI continue to impact even being able to do 75%. Thanks, Emily. Emily Portney : Sure. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still intend to return 100% of our earnings to our shareholders over time, and that\u2019s, of course, across dividends and buybacks. We\u2019ve been cautious, and I think it\u2019s been appropriate to be somewhat defensive in this environment with the uncertainty and, of course, the reduction in AOCI. But given the assumptions in our forecast, we feel pretty confident that we would expect to return at least 75% of our earnings to our shareholders over this year. And the nice thing about SCB and the SCB framework is that we can be nimble, we can be flexible. And ultimately, depending upon the runoff we see we might be able to do more. Operator : We will now take our next question from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the NII guidance. I appreciate the color Emily on the deposit balance trajectory based on what we experienced last cycle. I was hoping you could just speak to the deposit beta assumptions underpinning the guidance for the full year? And also how much of a helper was premium on this quarter? And how much of a benefit do you expect to realize over the course of the remainder of this year? Emily Portney : So from a beta perspective, as I said before, we just expect betas to largely retrace what we\u2019ve seen historically. It does mean you\u2019ll get to the end state faster. In the first rate rise, it\u2019s generally and what we\u2019ve experienced is very much as we\u2019ve been expecting in line with expectations, kind of betas of 35% to 40%. By the time we kind of get towards year-end and we have many more rate hikes, that will be probably closer to \u2013 betas would be closer to 70% plus, which is kind of where we ended in the last rate cycle. In terms of \u2013 what was your last \u2013 sorry, I missed the question. Steven Chubak : Sorry. The premium Emily Portney : Yes. It was helpful this quarter. I don\u2019t have it right off hand. But it was obviously \u2013 definitely helpful this quarter, but \u2013 and we just expect it with rates rising as we go forward, it will continue to be a bit helpful, but frankly, at a more modest level. Steven Chubak : Understood. And maybe just switching over to the fee side, you spoke to fee revenue up 4% to 5%. I believe Emily, and I am sorry if I missed this, you alluded to organic growth of 1% plus being the underlying assumption. I know you had been running at 2% plus of late. And wanted to get a sense is that organic growth guide more reflection of conservatism, challenging macro or just what you are actually seeing in the backlog of new mandates? Emily Portney : It\u2019s definitely not so much on \u2013 at all on the mandate side. We still \u2013 fundamentally, our businesses are in really good health. The growth is really just considering the more challenging environment that we are in. And specifically, when you look at market levels or client activity across some businesses have slowed down, you are seeing or we are expecting a bit more risk-off behavior. And so the particular businesses, which are probably most \u2013 which are going to be most impacted, we think, are investment management, corporate trust, depository receipts to a lot lesser extent, asset servicing. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s all baked into the 1%-plus guide. But the fundamentals are very good and we feel pretty good about that considering the challenging environment. Steven Chubak : I couldn\u2019t agree more. And just one follow-up, tick-tack modeling question. Just on the asset servicing line. I believe in the slides you flagged a gain on strategic equity investment. I was hoping that you could size that for us. Emily Portney : We don\u2019t disclose that in \u2013 we only disclose that concrete item. Todd Gibbons : I would just add to that, Emily. So, if you look at our investment and other income, it was about in line with the guidance that we had given. On the asset servicing, we do have some investments that we have said and some fintechs that we work very closely with strategically and they have performed pretty well. But as you might imagine, in this down cycle in the first quarter, we got hit pretty hard in our seed capital and some of our other things. So, net-net, they basically offset each other. Steven Chubak : Got it. Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : We will now take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hi, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats again to both Todd and Robin here. So, my first question is around the kind of connectivity between organic growth and operating leverage in the business. So, organic growth sounds like 1%-ish this year. Fees were flattish year-over-year. Expenses, up 5%, right? So, I understand that there is obviously investments that you guys are making in the business. But when you think about this on a 18 months to 24 months out, should we expect BK to get to a point where fee growth is more in line with expense growth. I think this kind of dovetails maybe some of Robin\u2019s comments earlier around his focus on operating leverage. Emily Portney : So, what I would say is, look, we are very focused on driving positive operating leverage. And I just would remind you that overall, for \u2013 if you look at total revenues, we will be \u2013 our plan is to deliver positive operating leverage this year. And frankly, that\u2019s with the impact of the Russian notable items. So, I think that\u2019s pretty good. In terms of fee \u2013 when we think about just fee revenue versus expenses, what I would say is that when you look at our \u2013 the guide that we gave for the rest of the year, it does \u2013 our expense guide does include slightly more inflationary pressures as well as the investments, of course, that we have talked about extensively that we think are very compelling and some will pay off sooner and some will pay off a bit over the course of the next couple of years. And as we talked about, it\u2019s way too early to kind of talk about like what it\u2019s going to look like in, say, 24 months, 36 months out. But we have said that, ultimately, over time, we would expect expense growth, the rate of growth to moderate. Alex Blostein : Alright. We will stay tuned for that. My second question around maybe the Issuer Services business and really DR specifically. I think in the earlier release when you guys announced the Russia loss this quarter, there is a comment there around just a more subdued level of revenue growth. I think there is an ongoing effect from the Russia exit business as well. Can you just level set us what the DR business does in revenues now per year kind of net of these changes on a run rate basis? And then ultimately, how should we think about any other sort of geopolitical risk within that business? I don\u2019t know to what extent China is part of that revenue stream? Thanks. Robin Vince : Emily, do you want me to take it or you want it? Emily Portney : Sure. Go ahead. Robin Vince : So, I think there is a couple of questions there. So, Russia was \u2013 it was a material component of the total DR revenue. And the indication that we gave is there was a contra hit on kind of prepaid expenses there. So, that got reversed in the first quarter, and that was the most of the $88 million that we were talking about. And on a go-forward basis, we would expect probably something like $20 million \u2013 probably $15 million a quarter specifically from DRs. There are \u2013 I mean, China is an important market to us, too. So, we saw what we have seen, Alex, is a little bit of fewer transactions. Fewer new issuance in China a little bit down, and that\u2019s reflected in those numbers. We don\u2019t break out the entire DR revenue line. It\u2019s a small \u2013 a modest percentage of the total Issuer Services. But it is impactful and it did, as you can see, it hit the bottom line in the first quarter. Alex Blostein : Got it. Great. Thanks very much. Operator : We will now take our next question from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn, please ensure the mute function is switched off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Todd Gibbons : Glenn you are on mute, if you are still there. So, operator maybe we should go to another question\u2026 Operator : We will now take our next question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ryan Kenny : Hi. This is Ryan Kenny on behalf of Betsy. Good morning. Todd Gibbons : Good morning Ryan. Ryan Kenny : Just a question on the Pershing X initiative that was announced a few months ago. Wondering if you could dig in more on what specific areas you are looking to grow in and help us size the investment dollars, timing and the ROI of the investments here. And any expected impact on margins? Thanks. Todd Gibbons : Sure, Ryan. So, look, it\u2019s an investment that we are excited about. As we step back from our Pershing business, where as you know, we are a real market leader in that business. We touch about 15% of RIA accounts in the U.S. We touch a little over 30% of all RIAs with $1 billion or more in AUM. One of the things that we have heard from our clients is that the world is getting increasingly complex for them as they think about how to really pull all of the capabilities that they need to run their businesses together. And as we have really listened to our customers on that point, we decided that there was a great opportunity for us to help solve some of those problems. And so collecting the various different capabilities focusing on the data and the smooth movement of data across those various capabilities we saw that as an opportunity to really deliver something new and incremental to our customer base. And we have tried to speed our way, along that we hired, as you know, Ainslie Simmonds to run that for us. She has recently completed the rounding out of her top leadership team. We tried to speed our way to market with the acquisition of a direct indexing capability in the fourth quarter, Optimal Asset Management. That was an example of a bolt-on capability that we think can just help us to accelerate. But as we have disclosed before, we are not expecting this to drop much to the bottom line over the course of the next couple of years. This is an investment in positioning Pershing and the aggregate wealth management platform services platform for the future. And so this is an investment in the medium to long-term, we think it\u2019s important our customers very much want it, and we are excited for it. Ryan Kenny : Thanks. Operator : We will now take our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Hello. Hi, can you hear me? Todd Gibbons : Hi Brian. Brian Bedell : Great. Well, first of all, congrats again, Todd and Robin. And Robin looking forward to working with you. The first question is just on the short-term second quarter outlook. I know Emily, you gave the outlook for the full year. Maybe just to focus a little bit on the pace coming into the second quarter on the recruitment of fee waivers, and any commentary on the sort of near-term trajectory of NIR for the second quarter? Emily Portney : Yes. We really decided a few more of a full year guide for the second quarter. But I mean to size what you are thinking about, I think specifically on waivers, we do see the Fed raise rates by 50 basis in May as I think we are all kind of expecting. Obviously, that will be a nice uptick in terms of recouping waivers and it\u2019s to the tune of, call it, like $100 million or so is what I \u2013 is how I would estimate it. Brian Bedell : Okay. And then to focus a little bit longer term on the organic revenue growth outlook, the 1% plus. Just I guess if we do get a better \u2013 let\u2019s say, if we get a risk on backdrop in the second half as opposed to the current sort of view of a challenging market backdrop, how might that influence that organic revenue growth outlook? Is that enough to put you back in that 2% area, or do you really \u2013 there is a lot of things you are working on to really build that organically. And if you could just remind us the sensitivity of fee revenue to equity markets, global equity markets improvement? And then just lastly, whether you would be considering any type of major acquisitions to accelerate revenue growth, or really, it\u2019s just going to be a focus on organic? Emily Portney : So, I will take a couple of parts to that, and Todd or Robin might want to chime in about the inorganic opportunities. But in terms of organic growth, I mean just remember, when we define organic growth, we are normalizing for market appreciation or depreciation, but it is fair that risk-on or risk-off behavior associated with that could also impact organic growth. And so what I would say is, it\u2019s hard, we don\u2019t really say like what\u2019s the sensitivity. But yes, there certainly could be more upside if you see more risk on behavior and ultimately, that means more trading, more transaction volume, etcetera. So, that is upside. So, it\u2019s certainly not out of the realm of possibility that it could be higher. In terms of \u2013 what was your second\u2026 Brian Bedell : The equity \u2013 the fee revenue sensitivity to \u2013 so like every 10% increase in equity margin. Emily Portney : Sure. Yes. We have disclosed this. I think you can find in the K. So basically, any like a 5% move in equity markets is kind of happening gradually throughout the year is about an additional $75 million in revenue. Brian Bedell : Yes. Great. And then\u2026 Emily Portney : Todd, do you want me to take inorganic or you want to? Todd Gibbons : Yes, why don\u2019t you go ahead and take it. Before you do Emily, I will just add. So Brian, just that 5% was \u2013 that was not an average at $75 million. That means if it goes up on average over the course of the year, at above $75 million\u2026 Brian Bedell : Yes. That makes sense. Thank you. Todd Gibbons : Okay, you want to follow-up on organic, Emily? Emily Portney : Sure. I mean on inorganic, what I would say and Todd and I have been very consistent on this, is that we are \u2013 of course, we always are evaluating inorganic opportunities. But at the same time, the bar is really, really high. And it\u2019s not high just from a return perspective, it\u2019s also very high from an execution risk perspective. So, we have been doing several deals, but they have been mostly kind of digestible bolt-on things that are adding capabilities or markets or clients. And we will continue to look out for those. Brian Bedell : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We will now take our next question from Michael Brown from KBW. Please go ahead. Michael Brown : Hi, good morning. Todd Gibbons : Good morning Mike. Michael Brown : Good morning. I just wanted to ask about \u2013 start with the average loans were up 3% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. So, I just wanted to ask a little bit about where you are seeing the strongest demand? And what are your expectations moving forward and the ability to meet that demand given the expected trajectory of the deposit balances from here? Emily Portney : So actually, we have been \u2013 we are very proactively growing the loan portfolio. So yes, as you mentioned, it\u2019s up 3% on average and 18% year-on-year. We will continue \u2013 it\u2019s our expectation to continue to grow that over the course of this year. And where we are seeing it is really on a couple of different areas. So, capital call facilities, certainly, trade finance, likewise, margin loans, CCLs and mortgages and well, so let pretty much across the board. And that\u2019s \u2013 we want to be there and leverage our balance sheet for our clients when it make sense. Michael Brown : Okay. Thank you very much. And then just thinking about the capital ratios today and your comment on returning 75% of net income, any thoughts on the trajectory in terms of the quarterly pace, just given that the leverage is at 5.3% or ended the quarter at 5.3%. It seems like the buybacks may need to be a bit more back half weighted as the capital ratios kind of accrete higher from here? Is that a fair expectation? Emily Portney : I am not going to really comment on kind of how it\u2019s going to be paced throughout the year. I think you can kind of look at all of our ratios and make your own assumptions. But \u2013 and the thing I would just remind everyone again is that the SCB framework is really allows us to be very nimble and very flexible. Michael Brown : Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Todd Gibbons : Thanks Mike. Operator : We will now take our final question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Emily, can you share with us \u2013 and if it\u2019s not available, maybe you could answer it in a different way. But in your quarterly and 10-Ks, you and your peers always give us a 100 basis point parallel shift and the curve leads to an x percent increase or decrease in interest revenue. How does that \u2013 how do you stand today at the end of the first quarter versus the end of the fourth quarter? Do you have that number? And if you don\u2019t \u2013 will it be lower by 30% or 40% compared to the fourth quarter? Emily Portney : It\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t \u2013 we will obviously be updating that when we release the Q. What I would say is we are much more sensitive, of course, to short-term rates and long-term rates. That continues, of course, to be the case. And you will see more of that when we actually release the Q. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Very good. And then following up on the Tier 1 leverage ratio, I think last quarter, you mentioned that you guys trying to manage to 5.5%. Obviously, you are slightly below that today. Where do you think \u2013 how low can it go from where we are today, or just your views on how you are managing that number? Emily Portney : So, in terms of Tier 1 leverage, we have always said that given the extraordinary circumstances we are in and all of the excess liquidity in the system that we would be \u2013 it makes perfect sense to dip into our buffer to a degree, which is what we have done. We would expect, of course as we start to see some probably deposit runoffs that will take a lot of pressure off Tier 1 leverage. And what I would also just flag is that by the end of the year, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s likely \u2013 actually not out of the normal possibility, but frankly, probably likely that our binding constraint will become CET1 versus Tier 1 leverage. And frankly, I think if you are toggling between Tier 1 and turn leverage in CET1, that actually is very good. It means you are managing your balance sheet optimally. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just quickly, on the HTM, I think you said you lifted your HTM portfolio of 40% of total securities. Is there a limit on how high you would take that, too? Emily Portney : There isn\u2019t a limit per se, but we obviously do that very with our partners in risk, and we are always making sure that whatever we move there is high-quality liquid assets that generally speaking, you can repo it. Repo those assets, etcetera. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to increase a lot more from here. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Thank you. Todd Gibbons : Gerard, it\u2019s Todd. I will follow-up. I just want to add to \u2013 I mean, Emily made, I think all the right points around the capital ratios and the Tier 1 leverage. But remember, we are probably too precise when we give you a number of something like 550. If you remember, that\u2019s a 150 basis point bunker to what the requirement is. And the reason it\u2019s there is because we recognize that you could have a spike in the balance sheet and for us, it\u2019s not a risk spike. It\u2019s because deposits have increased, and we have certainly seen that through the quantitative easing over the past couple of years or you could have a sell-off and some impact in the OCI. That\u2019s exactly why the buffer is there. So, eating into the buffer in this type of situation is exactly what we would expect. And it\u2019s not really particularly constraining to us. as we still have that 130 basis points to Emily\u2019s point and in our modeling, if things run the way we would expect them off of the forward curve those deposits are going to come down 10% or so, and that\u2019s going to free up quite a bit of Tier 1 leverage. And basically \u2013 and we are estimating that we are going to get pretty close to common equity in Tier 1, which is a great place to be. And it also means common equity is a little easier to manage because that\u2019s a risk-based asset ratio where we can manage. It\u2019s not just what comes on to the balance sheet. So, I want to make that clear. Probably in the future, we should give you guidelines that are more ranges, and we can kind of calculate where we are in that range. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, Todd. And great run time with Bank of New York, and good luck with you next endeavor. Thank you. Todd Gibbons : Appreciate it, Gerard. Thank you. So, it is top of the hour. Operator, do we have any other questions? Operator : There are no further questions in the queue, sir. Todd Gibbons : Okay. Thanks everybody. Thank you for joining us today. Look forward to following up. I guess you can call Marius if you have any follow-up questions. Be well. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 :00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day. Thank you.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Marius Merz : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. As always, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. I'm joined by Todd Gibbons, our Chief Executive Officer; Robin Vince, President and CEO Elect; and Emily Portney, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, Robin will lead the call and make introductory remarks, followed by Emily, who will then take you through the earnings presentation. Following their prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July 15, 2022, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin. Robin Vince : Thank you, Marius, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before we talk about our results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment and recognize that today is Todd's last earnings call. Todd, on behalf of all of us here at BNY Mellon, I'd like to thank you for your leadership and for your many years of service to the firm and our clients. For nearly four decades, you made a tremendous impact on BNY Mellon and its evolution from the rather traditional commercial bank that we once were, to the globally significant financial services firm, sitting at the heart of the financial ecosystem that we are today. When the Board asked you to take the helm at a very challenging time and in a worldwide pandemic, you not only navigated the firm through this unprecedented environment with a steady hand, but you also continued to drive our client and growth agenda forward. On a more personal note, I want to thank you for working so closely with me during this transition. I know it was always important to you to ensure a seamless transition before you retire, and I couldn't have had a better partner on this journey. Having spent a meaningful part of the last four months meeting and listening to our employees, clients and many other stakeholders, I'm even more optimistic about the next chapter for BNY Mellon. At the very heart of our firm lies an exceptional client franchise. Our clients truly view us as a trusted partner and a resounding message that I have heard is that our clients want to do more with us. We have a growth opportunity by making that easier for them. We have to do a better job connecting the dots, both internally and externally, and we will. And while our investments over the last couple of years have paid off in the form of the remarkably resilient platform that we have today, I'm also of the view that the efficiency opportunity available in driving our operating model transformation has more runway. I look forward to formally taking on my new role at the end of August and will continue to share my views on our strategy and plans over the coming months. Moving on to the quarter, I'll start with some broader perspectives before I run through a few financial highlights and then I'll turn it over to Emily to review our results for the quarter in more detail. During the quarter, we continued to see high levels of volatility across both global equity and fixed income markets, persistently high inflation, rapidly evolving monetary policy around the world, and all this against an increasingly complicated geopolitical landscape. You've all seen those charts. The S&P 500 had its worst first half performance in over 50 years, 10-year treasury had the worst start to the year since the beginning of the Index in the early 1970s. And with 150 basis points in rate hikes, this is the fastest tightening cycle over six months since the Volcker era at the end of the 1970s. Underneath these headlines, what we're seeing across our platforms is that investors are clearly rebalancing and de-risking. We're seeing asset reallocation from growth to value, higher than expected cash balances, and relatively shallow market liquidity, making it harder for investors to move risk. That said, in our role as a critical infrastructure provider touching so much of the core financial system, we do see today that markets continue to function in an orderly fashion, trades are settling and failed and overdrafts are at fairly normal levels. Turning to our performance in the quarter and referring to page two of our financial highlights presentation, we reported EPS of $1.03 on $4.3 billion of revenue and a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $1.15 and return on tangible common equity was 21%. Our second quarter results reflect the benefit of higher interest rates, the strength of our diversified platform, and our unwavering commitment to our clients. Those clients clearly value our resilience, the quality of our services and insights, and the trusted relationship that they have with BNY Mellon. While lower market values adversely impacted asset-based fees, elevated volatility, wider spreads, and higher transaction activity across new and existing clients hampered the impact. Asset Servicing continued to see healthy client volumes and our sales momentum and pipelines continue to be strong. Wins and mandates are up year-on-year, and that's broad-based across products and geographies, producing a strong pipeline of AUC/A to be installed over time. And our retention rates continue to be exceptionally high, north of 90%. In our ETF servicing business, total funds serviced are up 5% year-to-date, enabling ETF AUC/A to hold steady despite the impact from lower market values. And in alts, wins year-to-date have already exceeded all of 2021. It's also worth noting that more than 20% of our multiproduct deals have a data and analytics component as our DNA capabilities become more meaningful to our overall Asset Servicing deal pipeline. In our markets franchise, FX revenue was up nicely year-over-year and the business continued its steady climb in the Euromoney FX survey, landing at number eight overall this year, our highest ranking ever, up from number 13 a year ago and number 32 in 2018, while also maintaining its top three real money ranking. Issuer Services, and in particular Depository Receipts, had a solid quarter on the back of growth in dividend annuity fees and cancellation activity. In Pershing, year-over-year revenue was also up, and we're seeing encouraging signs in terms of sales momentum. We continue to gather net new assets this quarter, albeit at a slightly slower pace given the market backdrop, but the pipeline for the second half and beyond remains strong as we continue to grow the core business and see renewed client interest in digital wealth solutions as well as the advisory tools we will offer for our Pershing X initiative. In a great One BNY Mellon example, this quarter, Pershing and Asset Servicing combined their capabilities to roll out what is essentially a self-directed vehicle for a large government agency, offering choice of roughly 5,000 funds to a total addressable population of about six million eligible participants for the benefit of their retirement plans. Last month, Pershing hosted its Insight Conference with 1,600 business leaders, industry advocates and next-generation talent. This conference is a flagship event for Pershing and we were pleased to announce some next-generation tech solutions for advisors and wealth management professionals with the introduction of the latest generation of our Pershing platform and enhancements to our API suite. Turning to Clearance and Collateral Management, the business delivered another strong quarter of growth on the back of higher securities clearance volumes, where market volatility continues to drive activity levels in US treasuries. And we also saw average collateral management balances reached another record of $5.2 trillion in the quarter, driven by money market fund demand for the RRP facility. Treasury Services also delivered solid growth, driven by higher rates and higher payment volumes as well as broad-based growth across multiple products, call US dollar wire, debit card processing and immediate payments from both new and existing clients. Our Investment Management business was significantly impacted by lower market values, the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar and clients derisking amid an increasingly uncertain environment. Having said that, our investment performance remained strong with over 70% of our top 30 strategies by revenue in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis. Insight was ranked first by Greenwich Associates for overall quality in LDI for the 12th year in a row and was ranked first for fixed income overall quality with UK consultants. And BOLD, which is the new cash management fund share class launched to help investors make a positive direct social impact, raised another $2 billion in the quarter, bringing total AUM to over $3 billion in just four months. As most of you saw, we also announced the sale of Alcentra to Franklin Templeton at the end of May. This transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, builds upon our strategic relationship with Franklin Templeton as we will continue to offer Alcentra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capabilities in BNY Mellon's sub-advised funds and in select regions via our global distribution platform. We will also provide Alcentra with ongoing Asset Servicing support. At closing, we expect that this sale will increase the firm's CET1 capital by about $0.5 billion and it will free up seed capital to help accelerate our strategy of developing new, differentiated solutions from our specialist investment firms that meet the evolving needs of our clients. And finally, Wealth management continued to execute against its three- pronged strategy : acquiring more client relationships in the ultra high net worth and family office segments, deepening banking relationships and investing in technology and driving efficiency. As we engage with our clients in this space, we continue to lead with some of the most innovative digital capabilities in the industry. For a second consecutive year, the Financial Times named BNY Mellon the Best Private Bank for Digital Wealth Planning, North America, recognizing our wealth online client portal and our proprietary goals-based planning tool advice path. And the Family Wealth Report recognized our active wealth accelerator as the best customer-facing digital platform. Turning to capital. Despite the significant headwind from rapidly rising interest rates, we remain well capitalized, with healthy capital buffers to support our clients with a strong balance sheet in this volatile market environment. The recently announced results of the Fed's 2022 stress test demonstrated once again that BNY Mellon has one of the most resilient business models and balance sheets in the industry. And our preliminary stress capital buffer, as calculated in the test, remains at Fed's 2.5% floor. And so, as expected, earlier this morning, we announced that our Board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend by 9% to $0.37 per share in the third quarter. Now before I turn it over to Emily, I'd be remiss not to also touch on our announcement last week that Dermot McDonogh will join us in November and become our next CFO, effective February 1, 2023. I've known Dermot for over 20 years, and I'm really looking forward to his addition to our team. And I'm also pleased for Emily, who after helping Dermot transition into the CFO role, will take on leadership of several of our key growth areas, namely Treasury Services, Credit Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, reporting directly to me. But in the meantime, I certainly like reminding Emily that she still has a few more earnings calls to go.\\ And so with that, over to you, Emily. Emily Portney : Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of our results for the quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless specified otherwise. Turning on page 3. Total revenue for the second quarter of $4.3 billion grew by 7%. Fee revenue was up 4%. This increase primarily reflects the abatement of money market fee waivers as well as continued underlying momentum across security services and market and wealth services, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar and lower market values across both equity and fixed income markets. Money market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense, were $66 million in the quarter, an improvement of $133 million compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by higher average short-term interest rates. Firm-wide AUC/A of $43 trillion decreased by 4% as continued growth from new and existing clients was more than offset by the impact of lower market values and currency headwinds. AUM of $1.9 trillion decreased by 17%, reflecting lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar. Investment and other revenue was $91 million, reflecting a quarter with strong trading performance as well as the benefit of a strategic equity investment gain which was partially offset by seed capital losses. And net interest revenue increased by 28%, primarily reflecting higher rates and a change in asset mix. Expenses were up 12%, including the impact of higher litigation reserves, a notable item this quarter. Excluding notable item, expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter, as expected, which translates to an increase of 8% year-over-year. The year-over-year growth includes, among other items, the impact of pulling forward our annual merit increase to the second quarter from the third quarter. Provision for credit losses was $47 million versus the provision benefit of $86 million in the second quarter of last year and they primarily reflect changes in the macroeconomic forecast. Our effective tax rate was 21.1%. The notable item increased our effective tax rate for the quarter by approximately 150 basis points. Reported EPS was $1.03, pre-tax margin was 26% and return on tangible common equity was 19%. Excluding the impact of notable item, EPS was $1.15, pre-tax margin was 28% and return on tangible common equity was 21%. Now on to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.2%, down 10 basis points sequentially. The continued sharp rise in interest rates in the quarter resulted in an approximately $900 million after-tax unrealized loss on our available-for-sale securities portfolio. And we distributed 33% of earnings to our shareholders through approximately $280 million in common stock dividends. Our CET1 ratio was 10%, down slightly versus the prior quarter. And finally, our LCR was 111%, up 2 percentage points sequentially. Turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on Page 5, which I will talk about in sequential terms. Net interest revenue was $824 million, up 18% sequentially. This increase was driven by the impact of higher interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding expense. Average deposit balances and average interest earning assets both declined by 1% sequentially. Loan balances grew by 3% sequentially, primarily driven by collateralized loans in wealth management and growth in capital call finance and trade finance. Our securities portfolio balances were down 3%. Moving on to expenses on Page 6. Expenses for the quarter were $3.1 billion on a reported basis and $3 billion, excluding the impact of higher litigation reserves. Excluding notable item, expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter, as expected, and up 8% year-on-year. This year-over-year increase reflects investments net of efficiency savings, the pull forward of our merit program as well as higher revenue-related expenses. The benefit of the stronger US dollar was largely offset by persistently higher inflation. A few additional details regarding noteworthy year-over-year expense variances : Staff expense was up 7%, driven by investments in the annual employee merit increase, which in the prior year was effective in the third quarter. Distribution and servicing expense was up 23%, reflecting higher distribution costs associated with money market fund. Business development expense was up, reflecting some normalization of travel and entertainment off a low base from last year. And lastly, the change in other expense was largely driven by the increase in the litigation reserves. Turning to Page 7 for a closer look at our business segments. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2 billion, up 12% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue increased 8% and net interest revenue was up 29%, reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. As I discuss the performance of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will focus comments on the investment services fees for each line of business, which you can find in our financial supplement. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 4%. This increase reflects lower money market fee waivers and higher client activity, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar and lower market values. Asset Servicing continued to deliver healthy organic growth from both existing and new clients and our pipeline continued to grow across client segments and with particular strength in EMEA. In Issuer Services, investment service fees were up 10% reflecting higher depository receipts revenue and lower money market fee waivers, partially offset by the impact of the previously disclosed lost business in the prior year in Corporate Trust. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.3 billion, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue was up 9% and net interest revenue was up 18%, reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances partially offset by lower deposit balances. Encouraging, investment services fees were up 9%. The positive impact of lower money market fee waivers and higher transaction activity was partially offset by the impact of lost business in the prior year, as previously disclosed. Net new asset were $16 billion in the quarter. In Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 10%, reflecting the benefit of lower money market fee waivers as well as higher payment volumes on the back of growth from both new and existing clients. And in clearance and collateral management, investment services fees were up 5%, primarily reflecting higher US clearance volumes amid elevated market volatility and continued geopolitical uncertainty, all driving strong demand for US treasury securities. Now turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $899 million, down 10%. Fee revenue was down 9%. Investment and other revenue was a negative $13 million, which included seed capital losses as opposed to gains in the prior year. And net interest revenue was up 32%, reflecting higher interest rates as well as higher deposit balances. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with assets under management of $1.9 trillion, down 17% year-over-year. This decrease primarily reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar and approximately 45% of our AUM are denominated in foreign currency. As it relates to flows in the quarter, we saw $14 billion of net inflows into long-term products and $26 billion of net outflows from cash. LDI continued to be a bright spot among our active strategies with $12 billion of net inflows. And our index strategies gathered $12 billion of net inflows as well. In Investment Management, revenue was down 14%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar, lower seed capital results and lower market values, partially offset by the benefit of lower fee waivers. Further to Robin's comments on our positive investment performance, just this past weekend, Barron's recognized our Dynamic Value Fund and Income Stock Fund as two top performing active funds based on year-to-date results as well as longer-term track record. Wealth Management revenue was down 1%, as growth from higher net interest revenue resulting from higher interest rates and healthy deposit growth was offset by a decline in fee revenue resulting from lower market value. The business has continued to increase the number of clients who use our banking services, which is now at 60%, up significantly from a couple of years ago. And client assets of $264 billion were down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower market values. Page 10 shows the results of the Other segment. I will close with a few comments on our outlook for the second half of the year. As we all know, the intersection of significant market volatility, rapidly evolving monetary policy from central banks around the world, continued geopolitical tension and increasing uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment has made forecasting difficult. Based on current market implied interest rates for the second half of the year, we now expect the percentage growth in net interest revenue for the full year to be in the low 20s compared to the prior year. This improved outlook continues to assume modest deposit runoff in the second half of the year. And it also assumes slightly lower deposit betas than previously expected, which has been informed by our repricing experience to date. Since we last provided you our fee revenue outlook for the year on our first quarter earnings call, both equity and fixed income market values have declined further and the US dollar has continued to strengthen significantly against most major currencies. Assuming equity and fixed income values as well as currencies stay at the level where they ended the second quarter, we would project fee revenue for the full year to be flat to slightly up year-over-year. As it relates to expenses, ex notable items for the year, we continue to manage towards a year-over-year increase in the 5% to 5.5% range. Continuously strong inflationary headwinds are expected to largely offset the favorable impact of the stronger US dollar. Revenue-related expenses are increasing, as fee waivers abate and we're onboarding our strong sales pipeline. And we continue to invest in the targeted growth and efficiency initiatives that we've highlighted before. Due to the impact of the notable item in the second quarter, we now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be closer to 19.5%. Taken together with our 16.7% tax rate in the first quarter, our expectation for a 19.5% to 20% tax rate in the second half of this year remains unchanged. And last but not least, we continue to be cautious on buybacks in this volatile environment. Although based on current projections, we expect to end the third quarter at or above our internal capital ratio target. With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions? Operator :  Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey good morning. Emily, that was sort of intriguing, I guess, talking about your thoughts now on betas and the deposit declines and the higher NII. So, can you kind of talk about a little bit -- unpack that a little bit more in terms of what's changed over the last few weeks? What you're seeing with -- after the latest rate hike and how you're thinking about NII from here? Emily Portney : Sure. Good morning Jim. So, as you rightly point out, we've increased our NIR guide. We now expect NIR to grow in the low 20% range year-on-year. And really, the main things which have changed from a couple of weeks ago is that deposits haven't run off as fast as we had expected. Also, betas are coming in a bit lower than we had anticipated. And also now baked into that, our expectation is that, of course, we'll get some higher yields from cash held at central banks just given the pace of monetary policy. So, those are the main drivers that are in the outlook for the full year. And I would just obviously kind of caveat everything that there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty and it's pretty impressive at the time. Jim Mitchell : Okay, that's helpful. And then just your comment of getting to where you want to be in the third quarter on capital if all else equal, does that mean you would be thinking about getting back into the buyback game in the fourth quarter, or is it still a little too early to be calling for that? Emily Portney : So, what we've always said in terms of capital returns and specifically buybacks, that they would be dependent upon the trajectory for both AOCI as well as deposit levels, both of which were -- AOCI was a bit -- it deteriorated this quarter and deposits were a bit higher as I just suggested. It's still an incredibly uncertain environment. So, of course, we're going to continue to be cautious. We do expect deposit to decline. And so we are projecting that we'll be north of our internal targets, which, of course, for Tier 1 leverage is 5.5%, and we want to be north of our CET1 -- CET1 10% on a sustainable basis. And then it's about that time that we'll start to talk about and think about buyback activity. Having said that, as you all know, it's completely situational and very dependent upon the future outlook. Jim Mitchell : All right. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Robin Vince : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Hi Robin, I had a question for you. It's been probably more than five years, maybe a decade, we've all been getting questions on the threat of technology, the threat of blockchain to your industry. And it kind of comes and goes in ways. And over the last two weeks, I just got another barrage of questions on this. So, I wanted to, as your first call here as CEO -- incoming CEO, can you give us your sense as to how you see the time frame and the speed with, which you need to be transforming the organization? Robin Vince : Sure. So this is -- if you just step back, this is a super interesting space in our industry. And I think about it as once upon a time there was paper everywhere, we had runners, we had markets closing and we had the rise of computing and we've had traditional ledgers for the past 50 years. And now we've got a great new technology in the form of blockchain and that gives us the opportunity to do new things. And we're excited about that. We think it's going to bring great opportunity to our business. You're right, there's an element of potential disruption risk and so we've got to be ahead of that. But we also see a lot of opportunity in everything that this brings to bear. And I'll just note that the amount of interest that we have from our clients in us helping them to navigate this landscape is really remarkable. That's demand from the institutional clients around looking after cryptos, which we view as interesting but not really the main core digital assets, to building various different capabilities across the digital asset life cycle, coins, tokenized assets and we've already cemented ourselves as a leader in the space, all the work that we've been doing for some of these stable coin providers, we've been doing our traditional business with them, looking after traditional assets as part of their stable coin portfolio. But in doing so, we've really inserted ourselves into the ecosystem and that gives us a great landscape. So there's a lot to do here. My view on this is it's going to be years and potentially decades for the full effects to be known, but we're in it and we're excited about it. Betsy Graseck : And the operating leverage as you go through this journey, how do you think about managing that? Robin Vince : This is a super long-term journey, Betsy. I think it's very hard to have a point of view. But if I zoom out, would I at the margin, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably helpful longer term, but I'm going to emphasize super longer term on that, sure, it probably should be, because I think some of the inefficiency of post-trade processes, you can squeeze more of that out with some of these new technologies. And as was the case in the handover I'm sure from paper to original computer ledges. But this is going to be a while in the making. And, of course, we are going to have to invest to get us from A to B on this thing. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Robin Vince : You're welcome. Operator : Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning. Emily, when you look at your fee revenue, you gave us some guidance on if the markets don't change materially from where we are today by the end of the year and gave us that guidance. Can you remind us, what percentage of fee revenues would you say are tied to values with their variable rate price for your customers versus a fixed price? Emily Portney : It really depends by line of business. But, for example, when you think about Asset Servicing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about 50%. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then \u00e2\u0080\u0093 yeah, go ahead. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry. Go ahead. Emily Portney : So I was going to say, just to give a bit more color just in terms of unpacking that fee guidance because I think it's probably helpful. So when about now the year-on-year change of flat to slightly up, about 5% of that is coming from the abatement of waivers. That is more than offset, call it 5% to 6% from what I would call market factors, and that is market levels, as you just suggested. It's also currency as well as the impact of geopolitical factors. So for us, obviously, some of the impact made the loss that we took on Russia, and in Ukraine are just some CC business in that region. But then that is offset by organic growth, but still 50 odd \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is expected to be between 50 basis points to 100 basis points. And really, we have very strong fundamentals across Asset Servicing, Treasury Services, CCM, and even in Pershing and Corporate Trust, which are lapping some lost business from last year, the fundamentals and the pipelines are strong. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And maybe for Robin, obviously, disruption is going to create opportunities for some companies over the next 6 to 12 months to make acquisitions. Can you give us your thoughts on what you think you can add if you need something to the product set that Bank of New York has? Robin Vince : Sure. So I think about this pretty similarly to the way that Todd and Emily have described this before. It is largely for us, at least as we sit here today, Gerard, an opportunity to acquire capabilities. As you can imagine, a large and transformational sort of transaction is not very high on my list of priorities right now. I'm much more focused on the organic growth, the opportunities that we have across the franchise and also just really driving the operating effectiveness of the company. But as you saw last year, we made an acquisition in the form of optimal asset management, which set us a little bit along on our journey on Pershing X. We made an acquisition in the form of Milestone, which was helpful and accretive to our business broadly in Asset Servicing. And so we're going to continue to be on the lookout for those types of things. But as with anything in the M&A space, there's a high bar. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And Todd, good luck in the next run. Great job being at Bank of New York. Todd Gibbons : All right. Thank you so much. Appreciate that. Operator : Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, and best of luck, again, both of you, Robin and Todd. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Ken. Ken Usdin : Emily, on the deposit side, can you talk a little bit more about your slightly different expectations for beta. So I'm just wondering, can you flesh that out for us in terms of how you think that projects? And also can you help us understand the difference between how you might expect deposits in the US deposit side to act versus when we start to see the impact of the non-US deposit base move? Thank you. Emily Portney : Sure. So what are we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there's a couple of things in there, so about deposits \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so I mean about the betas in particular. So betas have been coming in a little bit better than we had anticipated, call it, 5% or 10%. Why that is? Certainly, our thinking is that, it's probably due to a couple of factors. Certainly, the sheer amount of liquidity that's in the system, the risk off behavior that you're seeing just based on the uncertainty. But also proactive management by us in terms of our deposit base and targeting operational deposits that we do want to retain, we still think that ultimately betas will retrace what we saw in the last cycle, although like I said, they're currently lagging what was actually anticipated. It's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we're seeing pretty much similar themes in both the US as well as Europe. What I would say is as the ECB gets to zero, that's probably the toughest place to be for us. And then as soon as they get negative, we expect betas to also kind of largely retrace what we saw in the last cycle. But that's basically what we're seeing and thinking. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. And then any updated thoughts in terms of -- you gave us that update on where you expect deposits to be this year. But on a through-the-cycle basis, do you have any way of dimensionalizing how you think total deposits might act through this cycle versus last as well in terms of either mix shift or total? Thanks. Emily Portney : Yes, sure. So just a couple of things. The first thing I would just say is I just would step back for just a moment and just remind folks about the central role we play in terms of liquidity across the financial ecosystem. So we manage on any given day $1.2 trillion in liquidity across our sophisticated clients. So some of that, of course, is on balance sheet as we're talking about. But there's also a significant chunk of that off balance sheet. We offer a lot of off-balance sheet options, whether it's our own money market funds, third party market funds, a repo. The reason I say all that is just that as deposits move, we will also get some benefit and see some of that moving around the system based upon where we are in what I would call each hold the fact. So we can benefit from that and see all of that as cash moves around the system. But getting very specifically into your question on deposits and deposit balances, what I would say for this year, and then I'll talk about the landing point, for this year, assuming currently implied rates are realized, we would expect deposit -- average deposit balances to probably decline another 5% to 10% from where they were in the second quarter, and that was $311 billion. Just to give you some color, in June, they were at $305 billion. And on a spot basis, they're already below that. Some of that, of course, expected because of seasonally. Likewise, just a reminder, when you think about the components of our deposit base, we would expect most of that run-off to be in NIBs. And so we'd expect NIB to revert to about, call it, 20% to 25% of our total deposit base. They're currently about 30%. And then when you just think about the entirety of the cycle, when we're fully through the cycle and just putting it in perspective, so between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2021, deposits increased by about $100 million. About 50% of that was NIBs. They are, of course, as we've always talked about, more rate-sensitive. And we would expect also, given the change in mix of our business, Treasury Services is a much bigger business, Asset Servicing likewise is a bigger business, so we think we'll be able to retain roughly two-third of that when it's all said and done. Ken Usdin : Great color. Thanks, Emily. Operator : Mike Mayo, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Mayo : Hi. Can you hear me? Emily Portney : Yes, Mike. Good morning. Mike Mayo : Okay. Great. Just the big picture question back to Robin. Start of the call saying customers would like to do more business with BNY Mellon and that would be by connecting the dots. And connecting the dots is a simple and powerful statement but also so extremely difficult to execute, because these dots are in different business lines, different geographies, managed by different people. So how are you able to connect the dots and really focus around the customer and so many of these businesses are in just parts of the firm? Just conceptually, how do you attack a problem like that? Robin Vince : So yes, it's a great question, Mike. And it's one -- it's something that I'm really very enthusiastic about as a firm. One of the benefits of having spent a lot of time really talking to clients over the course of the past four months and having worked across and really spent time with employees at all levels, up and down the company, internationally, it has really been to be able to get into this particular opportunity that I highlighted that you just referenced. And I feel we've got a few things that are really going for us. So number one, we've got this real differentiated trust from our clients. And so there's a will to do more business with us. And actually, I get questions from clients that ask me that they want to do more business with us and they're not sure how to do more business with us. And so that, frankly, is a pretty differentiated situation to be in and I view that as a real advantage. Second, we have a large set of related and interconnected businesses. So it's not like we're trying to sell completely different products to people where it's a real reach. These are adjacent business lines. So it's collateral talking about margin. It's collateral talking about Treasury Services. Treasury Services for wealth clients. Foreign exchange for Treasury Services clients. It's real adjacent things. And so there's that opportunity as a result of the nature of the businesses we're in. And then third, it's actually the culture of the people. We have people here at BNY Mellon who are client first, firm second, self third. That is a very powerful cultural attribute. And I intend to mine that and the other two things. And I'll just give you one example, because I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but I think it's a great example, which is Pershing and Asset Servicing came together over the course of the past few months to provide this new capability for this large government client that I referred to which has a significant addressable market for us. But the interesting thing, although the revenue, hopefully, will be interesting, the really interesting thing there is how they came together. And I think it is different than maybe the way it would have been a few years ago. So I'm optimistic about this and we'll keep talking to you about it. We call it ONE BNY Mellon, and I'll be pleased to give you updates along the way. Mike Mayo : And then one follow-up on that. Just your client first, firm second, self third, how do people get paid for doing this, or how do you -- just from a 10,000-foot level, how do you think about individuals getting paid for connecting the firm the way you would like? Because to the extent that incentives ultimately drive behavior, if people get paid more for doing it, they're more likely to do it or maybe you disagree. Robin Vince : Well, I'm not naive. So, of course, financial compensation comes into it, but on that hierarchy of client first, firm second, self third, the compensation bit, while important was, in fact, third on that list and people take a lot of pride associated with these cells and rallying around to deliver the firm for clients. And so we're going to do all of the above, leverage the pride of our institution, America's oldest bank, the fact that we have this incredible connectivity with our franchise and, of course, we'll align appropriately the rewards, both financial and non-financial to achieve those objectives. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Robin Vince : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, I'm curious on the relationship with fee revs and expenses. It seems as though, of course, we've got a challenging market environment. So, not surprising to see the fee revenue pressure. I guess just if you could update us on the thinking around the sort of rigidity, so to speak, of the operating expenses and whether or not there's an ability to do something, given the challenging environment, to ease some of that pressure a bit. And I think you usually, Emily, guide to core expenses, so we'd back out the charge this quarter, but just to housekeeping-wise confirm that. Emily Portney : Sure. So there's a lot in there, Brennan, and so let me take a step back. So just when you think about the 5% to 5.5% upside for the year, it's kind of very much in line with what we've been talking about since the beginning of the year. Any benefit that we are getting from currency tailwinds is being more than offset by much more persistent inflation pressure. So if you just take that out of the equation, the 5% to 5.5% up is about 2% driven by higher revenue-related expenses. Think distribution expenses associated with the abatement of money market fee waivers, think clearing fees associated with higher volumes. And also in that number is higher onboarding costs associated with the strong pipeline that we're onboarding across various different businesses. And so the remainder really relates to investment net of efficiencies, as well as, what I would call normalizing costs as we return to the office, like T&E and occupancy, et cetera. And in terms of just kind of how we think about managing the cost base and when we think about the cost base in general, it's really three main categories that we talk about here. One is the revenue-related category. The other is the structural around the bank category. It's obviously difficult -- it's a little bit more difficult to move in the near term, and then there's the change the bank or investments, the discretionary category. As Rob and myself, Todd have all talked about before, we see a lot of compelling opportunities, very -- I mean, I'd say a lot, but we've been extraordinarily targeted in those opportunities, Pershing X, future of collateral, data analytics, et cetera, and we will stay the course on those investments. You don't just stop and start them based on the macroeconomic backdrop and they are important to the future of the firm. Having said that, there are areas of course, that we are pushing on and that we can hopefully accelerate from an efficiency perspective, things like eliminating bureaucracy, automating the manual processes that still we have across the firm, optimizing our real estate and geographic footprint, better scaling our vendor usage to get more buying power, reducing unnecessary temps and consultants, all of those sorts of things, and that could be meaningful in totality. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for all of that. And we -- just the core part of the question, this is -- you guys guide to core expenses, right? Emily Portney : Yes. I'm sorry. Yes, it was core ex notables, correct. Brennan Hawken : No, I know. I had a bunch of pieces. So I want to make sure you got that. Okay. No, I appreciate all of that. I guess, when we think about the pieces of the expenses that are tied to the revenue and the pipeline and everything, would that suggest then -- because the revenue trends have actually been adverse this year versus where we had started, so should we be thinking that some of those benefits that -- where you're having some expenses or bearing some expenses this year would be coming in 2023? Is that the deal, or is the idea that the revenue that's tied to the expenses is getting offset by some of the environmental headwinds that we've all seen? Emily Portney : Well, I mean, just to remind you, I mean, the environmental headwinds, meaning market levels and currency, have been an enormous headwind. So, I mean that's the challenge very much this year. Yes, it is fair to say that some of the cost base is just the normal upfront costs that we have in this industry for onboarding clients that you will actually see the fee revenue realized over 2023, 2024 and beyond. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Rob Wildhack from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Rob Wildhack : Hey good morning. You called out a nice to be installed pipeline AUC/A. Can you just remind us how long that takes to get installed and start generating revenue? And is there any notable difference in the profitability of some of the new wins like that ETF business that you called out, any more or less profitable? Anything like that worth noting? Emily Portney : So, there are a couple of things in that question. So, when we think about -- I mean the to be installed and how the timing of the onboarding is obviously just very dependent upon the business unit you're talking about. But generally speaking, it's about a kind of six -- anywhere from a six-month to a 12-month onboarding kind of timeframe. And in terms of the -- kind of how we think about the profitability and the fees generated from the pipeline and in terms of ETF, , et cetera, Robin, if you want to-- Robin Vince : Yes, I would say that we are very focused on the net margin contribution of new business that we're bringing on. We have a rigorous process to look at that. As you look at the overall margin of the business, I think we're a bit victim of, and that was choices at the time, a business that was onboarded that wasn't always at the appropriate margin. And so we're being very scrupulous about that as we look at the business coming in today. Rob Wildhack : Okay. Thanks. And a quick one, Emily. Could you just quantify or did you quantify what the effect of that merit increase that was pulled into 2Q? Emily Portney : It was about 1% when you -- just in terms of the quarter-on-quarter variance. Rob Wildhack : Okay. Thanks a lot and congrats to you and to Todd and Robin. Robin Vince : Thank you. Todd Gibbons : Thanks Rob. Robin Vince : Thanks Rob. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Great. Thanks very much. And I also echo my congrats and good luck for Todd and welcome Robin and also for Emily. Just a couple -- just a couple of small modeling questions for Emily and then a strategic revenue growth question for Robin. So, just with Emily, just checking if your net interest revenue assumptions are using just the forward curve globally for Central Bank's hikes? And also if you can size the strategic investment equity gain in the quarter. And then also on the Issuer Services, that $300 million was really strong, is that a reasonable run rate into the second half? Emily Portney : Okay. Got three questions there. So, first, in terms of deposits, yes, we use the forward curve for all major countries and regions. So it is global. Two, what was your two, sorry? Brian Bedell : Just the strategic investment gain that you called out, the size of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6? Emily Portney : Yes. We're not disclosing that specifically, but it did -- it was part of the reason and a driver why investment and other income was $90 million. But we've also given you the normal run rate for that line. So you can think about what that would, therefore, mean. But it is also worth saying that there were some seed capital losses net of hedges in that line this quarter that did not exist in the -- actually, that were a gain in the second quarter of last year, so all of that is playing through the investment and other income line. And then your last question was? Brian Bedell : The Issuer Services was really good this quarter, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good run rate? Emily Portney : Yeah. No, of course. So in Issuer Services, ultimately, we had a better performance in DRs than we had originally anticipated and just strong dividend activity. Some of that is seasonal that you normally just see first quarter to second quarter. So that's really the driver. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. And then Robin, if I could just finish on Pershing X, it sounds like you are making traction there. I know that's still like a two-plus year type of materiality at least at the last earnings call. So I don't know if you want to update us on whether you think that might actually happen sooner. And then just on the organic growth, which is looking like 50 to 100 basis points like you said for this year, just with all of these initiatives, do you have -- do you envision of where that organic growth rate could maybe go in the next couple of years? It sounds like there's a lot of exciting growth initiatives and business opportunities given how you've characterized it? Robin Vince : Sure. So let me start, Brian, with Pershing X. And so we're very pleased with the progress that we've made. Initially onboarded in the second half of last year, as you know, it just crossed the nine-month mark. We've rounded out the management team. We acquired Optimal Asset Management. We actually integrated our Albridge business into Pershing X as well, which has been quite helpful because it's quickly augmented the number of engineers, an extra 150 engineers into the mix. And so we've had hands on keyboards writing code for the past three months on that. We feel we're very much on track. And we're expecting to launch a very early minimum viable product with a very small select group of clients by the end of the year on the business, which will be helpful. And we've been taking a lot of client advice along the way and have had a lot of client engagement, which is helpful not only to make sure that we're building exactly what clients want, which, as you know, is the origin of the product, but also, of course, helps us with the early presale of the whole conversation. So we're excited about the direction of travel. I'll reiterate my prior point on the revenue though, which is we don't expect to have a meaningful drop to the bottom line on this thing, I said at the time, for a couple of years. That was a quarter ago. So we're still on that same track, notwithstanding, the fact that we're going to be starting testing the MVP at the end of the year. And it's a multiyear endeavor for us and we remain excited about it. In terms of organic growth, more broadly, I will say that that comes in a couple of different forms. Of course, we've got the interesting initiatives like Pershing X, like our investment in RTP. We've also got it in the form of the margin walk that we've walked you through before in Asset Servicing, which includes top line activity as well as the bottom line as we do all of that. But \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so we've got all of those initiatives, those contribute to organic growth. But we also think that, to my conversation earlier on about One BNY Mellon, that there is blocking and tackling which isn't necessarily glamorous, but it's important under the hood to make sure that we really are introducing all of our clients' store of the products and capabilities and platforms of BNY Mellon. And I'm excited that that's going to contribute growth as well over time. Not in a position to give you a number today, but I think it will be part of the equation. Brian Bedell : Great. That's great color. Thank you. Robin Vince : Thank you. Todd Gibbons : Thanks, Brian. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin with any additional or closing remarks. Robin Vince : Well, thank you very much, operator. And thank you, everyone, for your interest in BNY Mellon. I know it's a very crowded morning today, so we appreciate you dialing in. If you have any follow-up questions, please do reach out to Marius and the IR team. But let me just say be well and enjoy your summer as we finish up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 :00 PM Eastern Standard time today. Have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Marius Merz : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. As always, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. I'm joined by Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Emily Portney, our Robin will make introductory remarks, and Emily will then take you through the earnings presentation. Following their prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 17, 2022, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin. Robin Vince : Thank you, Marius, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Having formally taken over as CEO a little over a month ago, it is a tremendous honor to usher in a new chapter for this great institution. After spending a significant portion of the past few months, engaging with clients, regulators, employees and other business leaders, I'm excited about our exceptional client franchise, our central role in global financial markets and the opportunity that lies ahead. Now as a new CEO and considering the current environment and it being the time of year when budgets and strategic plans are helpfully debated and brought together, naturally I'm using this opportunity to take a particularly close look at our priorities. While I'm still reviewing everything, it's apparent to me that while we've made good progress in a number of areas over the last couple of years, there are also clearly opportunities to further enhance BNY Mellon's performance for our clients and shareholders alike. First, I see exciting growth opportunities and numerous examples of innovation like Pershing X, the reimagining of our collateral and custody platforms, digital assets and real-time payments that we need to continue to invest in and execute on with great discipline and urgency. Second, we're not just reviewing the top line. We are also closely examining our cost base and margins. I'm questioning how we do things and I'm of the view that our margins should be better in some areas. For example, we talked to you about improving our pretax margin in security services to 30% over the medium-term. More broadly, we are also going to be looking for efficiency opportunities as we drive our operating model transformation and will be very determined to see them through. And third, while we have been providing more holistic solutions to clients that we believe our unique collection of businesses is better placed to deliver, we have the potential to do a lot more. I touched on this on the last earnings call, but I continue to believe that the opportunity to deliver the whole firm through a more unified One BNY Mellon is meaningful. As we continue to work through and bottom out all of these opportunities in the coming months, we will be regularly providing you with progress updates along the way. Moving on to the quarter, I'll start with some broader perspectives before I run through a few financial highlights and then I'll turn it over to Emily to review our financial results in more detail. As you are aware, during the quarter, we continue to see high levels of volatility across both global equity and fixed income markets persistently high inflation, driving increased expectations for significant rapid rate increases by central banks in developed countries, a strengthening U.S. dollar and a complex geopolitical landscape. We also began to see some government intervention, for example, Japan stepping into the FX market to manage their currency. And this was particularly on display in the UK wherein the last few weeks, there has been extraordinary volatility in the gilt market as a result of the UK government's spending and taxation plans. This led to a series of actions by the Bank of England, including delaying their QT plans, announcing a gilt purchase program and a liquidity facility aimed to stabilize the market. Our business model as a core provider touching so much of the financial system, gives us a terrific vantage point on what's going on in markets. For example, our data shows that building up throughout the quarter and heading into quarter end, the market was extremely short euros to levels not seen in quite a few years. And we've seen international holders selling U.S. treasuries. And more broadly, it's clear that market liquidity continues to be challenged in some markets more so than in others. As we sit here today, most markets have continued to function in a relatively orderly fashion, trades are settling and failed and overdrafts are at fairly normal levels. But clearly, risks are elevated and the system feels more fragile than it was a few months ago. While the environment is quite uncertain, our platform of trust and innovation is very much in demand by our clients. As their cost pressures rise, we are seeing a lot of interest in engaging with us to review operating models. The scale of our platforms should allow us to lower operating costs for our clients enabling them to focus on their core strengths. Turning to our performance in the quarter and referring to Page 2 of our financial highlights presentation. We reported EPS of $0.39 on $4.3 billion of revenue and a return on tangible common equity of 7%. These results were impacted by a goodwill impairment charge that Emily will discuss in more detail shortly. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $1.21, up 11% year-over-year, and our return on tangible common equity was 22%. Revenue grew 6% year-over-year, a testament to the diversity and resiliency of our business model. This performance reflected the benefit of higher interest rates as well as continued strength in client volumes and balances across our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments. While investment in Wealth Management was naturally more affected by the continued decline in global market values, particularly in Investment Management, the business delivered positive net inflows in the quarter and continued to deliver solid investment performance for our clients. Touching on a few business highlights. Asset Servicing continued to deliver solid top line results and our sales momentum remains strong with wins and mandates up from a strong 2021 and yet to be installed AUCA meaningfully higher than last quarter. In ETFs, we continue to see strong net inflows and the total number of funds serviced is up almost 10% from the beginning of the year. We're also seeing strong momentum and traction in the alt space and have an active pipeline across credit, private equity and real estate. And we were pleased to announce that Aviva Investors, a large European-based global asset manager, recently appointed us to provide a fully integrated operating model for certain front office support services as well as middle and back office activities, allowing them to focus on delivering an exceptional client experience powered in no small part by the scale and capabilities of our platform. And finally, following the formation of our digital assets unit in 2021, we are now live with our digital asset custody platform in the U.S. To this point, we continue to see significant institutional demand for resilient, scalable financial infrastructure built to accommodate both traditional and digital assets. And we see digital asset custody as an important foundational capability for the future of financial markets as blockchain technology allows for tokenization of all kinds of assets and currencies. But just to be clear, we did not invest in this space just for the purpose of custodying crypto. We see this as the beginning of a much broader journey. Pershing had a solid and resilient quarter, benefiting from its diverse revenue mix that includes not only market-based fees but also transaction fees, balance base fees, subscription fees and net interest revenue with many of these income streams playing well in the current environment. We also gathered a strong $45 billion of net new assets in the quarter, and the pipeline remains healthy, boding well for flows in the months ahead. Pershing X reached another milestone through an equity investment and partnership with Conquest Planning, a fintech, which uses AI and powerful analytics tools to help advisers improve their efficiency and create highly customizable financial plans for their clients. X's minimum viable product remains on track to launch in the fourth quarter. Our client engagement, together with the product design input, which that brings is helping us to accelerate and enhance the delivery of an exciting end-to-end digital experience for advisers. Clearance and Collateral Management delivered strong growth on the back of higher U.S. clearance volumes as market volatility continues to drive secondary trading activity in U.S. treasuries. In fact, in September, settlement volumes were the highest they've been since March of 2020. We also saw growth in margin-related services, reflecting the industry-leading work that the team is doing to help our clients comply with uncleared margin rules in derivatives trading. Treasury Services achieved a number of wins this quarter as we continue to bring innovative new solutions to the market. We were awarded a contract for white-labeled trade processing for a major U.S. bank. We sponsored our first supply chain financing program for a major investment-grade corporate client and we were awarded and will be managing payroll and digital asset transfers for a major digital asset client. Recognizing our momentum in this business, the banker named us 2022 Global Transaction Bank of the Year. We're also proud to have been recognized by them with additional awards for our work to transform the real-time and digital payment space and optimize trade finance payments by leveraging emerging technologies. Let me conclude with a note of humility about the uncertainty that we're all witnessing in markets these days. None of us can predict the exact path of markets and the economic conditions from here and the level of uncertainty is greater than many have become used to. As a firm, we are positioning ourselves conservatively in this environment and recognize that the strength and stability of our platform is important for the uninterrupted functioning of a significant part of global capital markets. We're proud of this role and the service that we deliver to our clients around the world. With that, I'll hand it over to Emily for the more detailed review of our financial performance in the quarter. Emily Portney : Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of our results for the quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise. Starting on Page 3. I Total revenues increased by 6% to $4.3 billion in the third quarter. Fee revenue was down 1% as the benefit of lower money market fee waivers and organic growth across our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segment was offset by the impact of lower market values across equity and fixed income markets and the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Firm-wide assets under custody and administration of $42.2 trillion decreased by 7%. The impact of lower market values and currency headwinds was tempered by continued growth from new and existing clients. And assets under management of $1.8 trillion decreased by 23%, also reflecting lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by cumulative net inflows. Investment and other revenue was $117 million in the quarter. This included a $37 million gain on the sale of our HedgeMark subsidiary. Through a minority equity stake in the combined company, we will continue participating in their growth and our clients will certainly benefit from a robust suite of managed account solutions. Net interest revenue increased by 44%, primarily reflecting higher interest rates. Reported expenses were up 26%. This included a $680 million impairment of goodwill associated with our investment management reporting units, which was driven by lower market values and a higher discount rate. While having impacted our earnings for the quarter, this impairment represented a non-cash charge and did not affect the firm's liquidity position, tangible common equity or regulatory capital ratios. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 4%. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $30 million, primarily reflecting reserve releases related to cash balances and exposure to Russia as well as a modest benefit from our commercial real estate portfolio. Our effective tax rate was 38.4% or 19.5%, excluding notable items. Reported EPS was $0.39, pretax margin was 15%; and return on tangible common equity was 7%. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $1.21, pretax margin was 31% and return on tangible common equity was 22%. Now on to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.4%, up 19 basis points sequentially, reflecting the benefit of lower average assets, which was partially offset by a decrease in Tier 1 capital. The sharp increase in interest rates, especially in the last weeks of the quarter, resulted in an increase of the unrealized loss on our available-for-sale securities portfolio of approximately $900 million after tax during the quarter. And we distributed approximately $300 million of earnings to our shareholders through common stock dividends. As I mentioned earlier, the goodwill impairment did not affect our regulatory capital ratio. Our CET1 ratio was flat sequentially at 10%. And finally, our LCR was 116%, up five percentage points sequentially. Turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on Page 5, which I'll also talk about in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $926 million was up 12% sequentially. This increase primarily reflects higher interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding expense. Average deposit balances decreased 7%. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar contributed approximately one percentage point to this decline. Overall, this is largely consistent with our previously expressed expectation for the trajectory of deposit balances through the remainder of the year amid continuously rising interest rates as well as typical seasonal declines in deposit balances in the third quarter, while non-interest-bearing deposit balances continue to hold up better than we had previously expected. Average interest-earning assets decreased by 5%. Underneath that, cash and reverse repo declined by 10%; loan balances decreased by 1%; and our securities portfolio balances were down 2%. Moving on to expenses on Page 6. Expenses for the quarter were $3.7 billion on a reported basis. Excluding notable items, expenses of $3 billion were down 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 4% year-over-year. This year-over-year increase reflects investments net of efficiency saves higher revenue-related expenses, including higher distribution expenses related to the abatement of fee waivers as well as the impact of inflation, partially offset by the benefit of the stronger U.S. dollar. A few additional details regarding noteworthy year-over-year expense variances. Distribution and servicing expense was up 16%, driven by higher distribution costs associated with money market funds. Business development expenses increased as travel and entertainment expense continued to normalize off a low base last year. And lastly, the change in other expenses reflects litigation expenses in the prior year. Turning to Page 7 for a closer look at our business segments. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue was up 1% and net interest revenue increased by 54%, driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. As I discuss the performance of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will focus my comments on investment services fees for each line of business, which you can find in our financial supplement. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees were down 3% and as growth from abating money market fee labors, high client activity, and net new business was more than offset by the impact of lower market values and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We continue seeing healthy organic growth from both new and existing clients, and our sales momentum continues with wins year-to-date up meaningfully compared to an already strong 2021. In Issuer Services, Investment service fees were up 2%, primarily reflecting the reduction of money market fee waivers, partially offset by previously disclosed lost business in Corporate Trust in the prior year and lower fees from depository receipts programs for Russian issuers. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.4 billion, up 17% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue increased 11% and net interest revenue was up 34%, reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit balances. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 16%. The positive impact of lower money market fee waivers and higher client activity was partially offset by the impact of previously disclosed lost business in the second half of last year and lower market levels. Net new assets were $45 billion in the quarter. On an annualized basis, this translates into a 9% growth rate, highlighting strong quarter of inflows for both new and existing clients especially in this current environment. An average active clearing accounts increased by 3% year-on-year. In Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 3% and driven by lower money market fee waivers, new business and slightly higher payment volumes, partially offset by higher earnings credits for our clients on the back of higher interest rates. Pending clearance and collateral management, investment services fees were up 5%, primarily reflecting higher U.S. government clearance volumes driven by continued demand for U.S. treasury securities due to elevated volatility amid a rapidly evolving monetary policy backdrop. Now turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $862 million, down 16%. Fee revenue was also down 16% and net interest revenue was up 21%, reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $1.8 trillion decreased 23% year-on-year. The decrease primarily reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar as about 40% of our AUM are denominated in foreign currencies, partially offset by cumulative net inflows. As it relates to flows in the quarter, we saw $23 billion of net inflows into long-term products and $2 billion of net outflows from cash. In Investment Management, revenue was down 20%, primarily reflecting lower market values, the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar as well as changes in the AUM mix, partially offset by lower fee waivers. Robin mentioned the extraordinary volatility in the U.K. government bond market earlier. This has caused some significant challenges for U.K. pension scheme over the past few weeks. As a manager of liability-driven investment strategies, Insight has been working closely with our clients to maintain the appropriate hedging levels in their portfolios. And I'd like to note that as an agent between our LDI clients and their market counterparties, we have no balance sheet exposure. In Wealth Management, revenue was down 7% as the decline in fee revenue resulting from lower market values was partially offset by higher net interest revenue, reflecting higher interest rates. Client assets of $256 billion were down 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower market values. Page 10 shows the results of the other segments. As always, I'd like to close with a few comments on our outlook for the remainder of the year as we see it today, acknowledging the heightened uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment and continued market volatility. Based on current market implied interest rates, we now expect net interest revenue for the full year to be up approximately 30% compared to 2021 as we expect another quarter of sequential NIR growth. Given the continued decline in equity and fixed income markets as well as the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect fee revenue for the full year to be down slightly compared to 2021, assuming equity and fixed income values as well as currency stay at the levels where they ended the third quarter. We continue to expect expenses, excluding notable items for the full year to be within the range of up 5% to 5.5% that we had guided you throughout the year. That being said, we are intensely focused on disciplined expense management and are working hard to drive this towards the bottom half of that range and we still expect an effective tax rate between 19.5% and 20% in the fourth quarter. And finally, I'll note that we continue to manage to a Tier 1 leverage ratio target of 5.5% as well as ACET1 ratio target of 10%. As we think about the right timing for a resumption of buybacks in the coming months, we will continue to be prudent and considered capital levels, the expected trajectory of deposit balances at AOCI as well as the economic outlook at that time. With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : So I appreciate your comments about acting as agent in the LDI cases in the UK. I wonder if we could get a little more of the ins and outs, the impact to both BK and clients because Insight has been a great acquisition that produced a lot of flows for you in the past. So I'm curious on impact in the quarter and you get more collateral when clients have lower balances and what you think clients are going to do with this business going forward? Robin Vince : Sure. Well, good morning, Glenn, and thanks for the question. Obviously, this topic has been in the news a lot over the course of the past few weeks. Let's maybe just start by stepping back and remember what LDI actually stands for and what it is. So it's liability-driven investing and the principle at work as I think you know, but let me just recap it is really the investment approach that ensures that the assets ultimately are moving more in line with the value of the liabilities. And so we think that principle, which has been very important to the pension space, overtime is an important one, and it's going to be something that we would expect to continue. I mean these strategies have been employed by many years. They've been extensively embraced by the pension regulators in the UK and then the consultants who advise our pension clients in the space. The second thing I'd say is that, more broadly, higher interest rates have actually served to improve the funding positions of most pension funds because the value of the liabilities has decreased by more than the decreases in their gilt holdings. And so that has been a net positive in terms of contributing to the pension funds funding status. But look, clearly, as you pointed out, the speed and the magnitude of the rise in the UK government bond yields has been pretty unprecedented and certainly has created challenges in the market with the sort of speed and magnitude of everything that's been going on. And that's created issues, including liquidity issues, for many of these pension funds, you've had to sell gilts and mobilize other forms of liquidity in order to be able to meet the margin calls on derivatives. And as you know, they are the principal on the derivatives. This has clearly put a strain on the markets. I mean, the sheer size of the pension market versus the UK gilt market, just sort of shows the degree of impact that they can have. And it's also highlighted some operational challenges. If you just think about the two-day settlement of margin versus the time to liquidate assets across the wider asset pools, and that's been exacerbated actually by some operational providers. We actually don't provide direct operational support to Insight. That's done by a third-party. And what happened as a result of all of that? Well, clearly, people are raising additional liquidity, which makes a lot of sense. Now, we've been pleased to the other part of your question, we've been pleased with Insight's performance. They've been focused actually on building collateral buffers throughout the year, and this prudence, I think, has been quite helpful in protecting client portfolios and Insight also been, over time, working on a strategy that they called integrated solutions, which is really encouraging pension funds to be able to look across all of the types of assets that they have, so that they see the whole and not just the individual pieces. So the investment of maybe less liquid components is done with a mind and a view to what's being done and where leverage might exist elsewhere in the portfolio. And I think that that integrated approach which they've been a big proponent of has actually been a good solution in this particular crisis. And so, we actually think that net-net, our solution is being strengthened in the market. Insight's reputation has done quite well. In fact, they are turning away new business as they've seen and benefited, frankly, from the incomings and a bit of the flight to quality. So, clearly, a situation that's still evolving. Today's market looks a little bit better following some of the news at the end of last week and over the weekend. But we're watching it very closely. Glenn Schorr : So I appreciate all that color. I follow everything and it feels like nothing on balance sheet risk, didn't have major client outflows. The last part I wasn't sure about is why would they be turning away new business? Or are clients not going to use this as much forward or just use less leverage. I'm curious on your outlook. Again, I think it was a good source of flows in the past, and just curious what you think going forward. Robin Vince : Yes. So, the reason why we've been turning away some new business is because really we want to protect the interest of our existing clients. And so taking on more problematic situations and there are some in the market which have less funding and liquidity available and then essentially taking them into our franchise and having to deal with that problem. This didn't seem like the smartest moment to do that and also, frankly, wasn't in the interest of our existing clients who've been along with Insight along the journey. So that's actually the reason there. But more broadly, we do expect to continue to get incoming phone calls given some of the differentiated nature of how Insight has performed through this, and we view that to be positive for the franchise. So actually, I view that as something of a tailwind because these types of reputational events in the market are frankly can sift out some of the different players. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Brown from KBW. Please go ahead. Mike Brown : So Robin, I noticed that the AUCA declined just about 2% quarter-over-quarter. This would be less than we'd expect given the market backdrop here. You talked about the strong sales momentum and recent wins. So how much did organic growth contribute this quarter, if you could kind of quantify that? And when did that come in, in the quarter? Emily Portney : It's Emily, I'll take that. The AUCA is really speaks to the trends in AUCA speak to the diversity of the franchise overall. So, firm-wide AUCA was down about 7%. That was based on lower security services AUCA of about 11%, but very much tempered by growth in Market and Wealth Services, led by CCM. If you want to kind of drilldown a bit more in terms of Security Services and what you're seeing there about -- the 11% decline, about 13% of that was due to lower market values as well as the strengthening U.S. dollar, and that was partially offset by about 2% of net new business. Mike Brown : Okay, great. And then -- and if I heard your comments correctly on the share buybacks, it sounds like it's really dependent on the capital levels. But did I understand that correctly that it's still possible that you will -- that you could be in the market for buybacks this quarter if the capital levels perform as expected? Emily Portney : As I said in my prepared remarks, and it's very important that everyone really understands we're going to continue to be prudent with respect to buybacks. So I think that's natural given the continued volatility that we're seeing across the markets and frankly, the uncertain macroeconomic environment. We also -- we do want to be above our internal target for our capital ratios before we consider resuming buybacks. So, it is true that when we think about capital distribution, frankly, our approach hasn't changed, whether it's this quarter or next quarter, it's always going to be informed by the rate trajectory and the corresponding impact on AOCI, the size of our balance sheet, market conditions, of course, and frankly, our forward outlook. But what I would remind everybody is that beyond the near term, we have a business model that really allows a meaningful amount of return to -- of our capital to shareholders and pending the sale of Alcentra as well as over time, as rates do move in a different direction that AOCI will be pulling back to par, and that will -- both of those things will free up meaningful capital levels. Operator : We will now take our next question from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : I wanted to start off with a question on the operating margin. While the operating backdrop, Robin, as you've noted remains highly uncertain. In the last Fed tightening cycle, the Company was generating mid-30s operating margins fairly consistently, so well above current levels. I just wanted to get your perspective or take on whether you see a credible path to getting to those type -- back to those types of operating margins? And what are some of the drivers that could potentially help you close the gap here? Robin Vince : Sure, Steven. Well, I'll just start by reminding you, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, but when we announced our re-segmentation in December last year, Emily and I both commented on the fact that we were driving towards a 30%-plus margin in our Securities Services segment, which, as you know, is not where we have been. And we said at the time, that's going to be made up of a variety of different components. It was going to be top line organic growth. It was also going to be, of course, the rate cycle, which is a meaningful contributor. And we do view that as an important contributor to our firm. And then third, it was going to be through focus on the bottom line. And so if you take that as a microcosm for a second, that's exactly how I think about the strategy for the whole firm. We're laser-focused on executing on our growth investments. Things like Pershing X, real-time payments and some of the other things that I've detailed before. But we also have to be a very good steward of expenses and although we've made significant investments in resiliency over the course of the past four to five years, I feel that there is more room for us to be able to invest in efficiency-related technology. So investing in technology on the top line and the bottom line -- really a cost of doing business. Emily can comment maybe just for a moment on our budget process because we're in that season and we've adjusted our budget process to really try to get at this margin question that you raised. Emily Portney : Sure. So we are, as Robin said, intensely focused on our forward expense trajectory. And in the budget cycle that we've just kicked off, we're actually doubling down on a rubric that we've actually used historically, but mostly just for tech and now we're looking at it and applying that rubric across the entire company. And in effect, what we're doing is stratifying all of our expenses across three buckets. So first is really structural or run the bank. Second is change the bank, and we're really drilling into that category to be very clear about if we're making investments, are they for growth, are they too transform or for that matter, are they to continue to meet ongoing regulatory obligations. And third, of course, the third bucket is just revenue related, which obviously rise with top line growth. So I can share that as we go through this, more than 50% of our expenses are structural in nature. They are certainly higher where the higher than we think they should be, as Robin has alluded to. And we're very, very heavily focused on driving these down. In some areas, we have multiyear programs like transfer agency, fund accounting, et cetera, which are businesses that are highly manual in nature, and we do have programs to make them more efficient, and we'll come back to you when we finish the planning process. Steven Chubak : Thanks for all that color. It's really helpful perspective. And maybe just for my follow-up on the deposit outlook, Emily, you noted that the non-interest-bearing outflows have been tracking better so far this cycle. And as a percentage of total deposits, it's still fairly elevated at 28%, I believe, last cycle at trough somewhere around 22%. What's your expectation in terms of the pace of non-interest-bearing outflow, what's driving the better outcome this cycle? And where do you expect NIBs to ultimately trough this cycle relative to last? Emily Portney : So I think I've mentioned and we still believe that NIBs will ultimately revert to what we saw pre-pandemic, which would be about 20% to 25% of our total deposit base. We actually think that, that might happen here in the fourth quarter. In terms of why they've held so-so steady, I think some of that is probably risk-off behavior. Some of that is just our businesses are a bit bigger. And ultimately, what I would say is that we have seen when we look at our deposit trend overall, and this is very important, irrespective NIBs or IBs, the runoff we've seen thus far has been largely non-operational in nature and that's actually good. We're seeing the right runoff, and I think very much due to our very statistics -- what's become much more sophisticated pricing across clients and segments and businesses. Operator : We will now take our next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Emily Portney : Ken, we can't hear you. Operator : Please enter your mute function is turned off to allow your single to reach our equipment. Marius Merz : Yes. Operator, let's move on to the next question and come back to Ken later. Operator : We will now take our next question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ryan Kenny : This is Ryan Kenny on behalf of Betsy. Wondering if you could give us more color on the goodwill charge. What specifically was the driver of the charge this quarter? And does it give you more flexibility on your strategy and investment management. Robin Vince : Sure. Happy to. So first of all, let's be clear about what it is and what it isn't. So it's not the outcome of any changes in our strategy. It's also not related to the pending sale of Alcentra. And it's also not a statement about the fundamental health of the business as we see it today and going forward. It is the outcome of our regular impairment testing process, and it's a reflection of both the lower market values that we've seen across equity and fixed income markets and also a higher discount rate. So inevitably wrapped up in your question is the strategy. And so maybe I'll just recap for a second, where we are on that investment management journey. As you know, over the course of the past 15 years or so, we've streamlined the investment portfolio. We used to have 27 independent investment management firms. That's down to seven once out center is closed. That helps us to sharpen our focus as does the fact that we've improved substantially the alignment between strategy and the individual firms. And so we've realigned Mellon's investment capabilities into parts of Newton and Insight and Dreyfus. We think that helps make it less confusing for our clients externally and sharpens the focus internally. We're also investing in the types of solutions that, of course, people want in this day and age and some of those outcome-orientated solutions, active ETFs, responsible investing. We talked about bold, I think, on our last earnings call in the money market fund space. It's another example of that. And then very importantly, in the investment management space, the investment performance has improved and remains healthy. So kind of that's where we are. Operator : We will now take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : So there's been a number of liquidity challenges in the market, and Robin, you alluded to those in your prepared remarks as well. So as BK serves, obviously, a fairly critical function in sort of the capital markets plumbing globally, what are some of the risks, I guess, you're most mindful of that we should be looking after. And as you think about any opportunities that this kind of environment creates for the bank as well, I would love to hear your thoughts on that. Robin Vince : Sure. So Alex, we've got a bunch of different crosscurrents at the moment in the system. On the cash side, we're coming off the back of QE. Central bank is obviously driving very aggressively at inflation, clearly necessary given the continued prints. But then on the flip side, and these two things don't necessarily always happen at the same time, which is what makes it complicated is we've got supply chain issues ongoing geopolitics, energy prices, risks of recession, already very much front and center. And so, we've got sort of a risk on and risk off angles sort of happening at the same time. We've also seen some pretty unprecedented starting places for some of these markets. And I think that's a little bit for us where we see some of the concern, which is that the usual toolkits around market stability aren't available in maybe quite the same way. You saw that in the U.K., where to take that as a microcosm for a second, their bond market goes through a little bit of tumult as a result of some news in the government actions. And at the time, the Bank of England was still in the QT process, which they had to suspend to then go do some buying. You can't really be doing buying and selling at the same time. That's a good example of the fact that the tool kits aren't fully available. We look at the scale of moves in the market and we look at the amounts of liquidity and so much has been done in the banking sector, particularly over the course of the past decade post financial regulatory reform, the regulators have been very much added. So banks, massive amounts of liquidity, large amounts of capital very well set up for this. But if you have huge selling from other market constituents, there is a little bit of a question there of where the buyer is going to be, and we see echoes of that in the U.K. market. There are legitimate concerns about that in the U.S. market if there were a significant episode as we've seen in the past, what does that pivot looks like. And to some extent, those are the consequences of having and benefiting from the most liquid markets in the world on a normal basis and also being the place where people store their cash. And when they want cash, they need it back and they're selling. So, the question becomes who are the buyers. We've seen the Central Bank of Japan having to be sellers of treasuries as they defend their currency. So, there's a lot going on in the world, and it's a bit complex. But I think we have a healthy amount of caution as we saw this play out over the course of the coming weeks and months. Alex Blostein : Got you. All right. And then my follow-up just around the LDI dynamic again, and I appreciate your comments around Insight on the asset management side. But I guess, as a servicer, curious how you're thinking about your exposure U.K. pension plans on the asset servicing side of the business, either as custodian or middle of back office administrator. Any sort of implications for fees or deposits we should be thinking about as you give pensions post-collateral? Robin Vince : Yes. It's been pretty businesses as usual for us on the servicing side. As I mentioned before, that isn't the case everywhere. Clearly, there have been issues in that market, and there are a couple of providers who've had some more stresses associated with the massive upsurge in volumes, but that has not been our experience. Clearly, there is more cash in the market generally. And look, let me just make a broader point about cash because I think it's very interesting position for us as a company, the various different roles that we play in cash because -- yes, we have deposits on our balance sheet, that tends to be a lot of the focus that we talk about in terms of cash. But we actually manage over $1 trillion of daily liquidity for our clients in markets all around the world. And this goes way beyond deposits on our balance sheet. It goes to our money market fund business, it goes to a market-leading liquidity direct portal, which helps treasurers and other cash managers be able to direct cash through the system. And so we actually feel pretty well positioned as a company on the topic of cash because sort of irrespective of exactly where the flow is heading, we set ourselves in a little bit of an orchestration role in the middle of that, which we think is really quite good for our franchise over time. Operator : We will now take our next question from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Okay, great. I'm going to answer my question, I think, which you're guiding a little bit lower for fees, but you're not guiding lower for expenses. And I guess the answer is because you're looking to invest through the cycle, if you can validate that? And then just more on the digital asset custody platform, you said that custody of digital assets and crypto are simply the start of a journey. And there's a lot written pro and con as it relates to digital currencies. Clearly, you think this has legs. Maybe that's one reason why you're going to invest maybe more even with softer fees, but if you could elaborate on that? Robin Vince : Sure. Mike, let me -- I'll take the whole thing. So first of all, in terms of -- we're not re-guiding on expenses. Emily said that the original guidance of 5% to 5.5% is intact, but she also said that we're aiming towards the lower end of that range. So that's meant to be sort of a vote of confidence in our own active management of expenses, which we're really driving at. And we are very, very focused, as Emily said earlier on, on this journey. And so you should expect us to continue to give you updates on how we do on that over time. Let me talk a little bit about digital assets because it is a very important question, and I tried to stress this in my prepared remarks around the fact that it really isn't just about crypto. So one of the things that we did recently was we did a survey of large institutional asset managers, asset owners, hedge funds. About 40% of them already hold crypto in their portfolios. About 75% of them are actively investing or exploring investing in digital assets. But here's the important stat, which is over 90% of them are interested in investing in some type of tokenized asset within the next few years. And so what we heard from our clients is they want institutional grade solutions in the space. And the way that we think about the world is, yes, sure, there are cryptos and those are things that are clearly have had a lot of spotlight recently, but we view the tokenization of types of assets, whether they're traditional financial assets or maybe assets that haven't been as easy to manage in the financial system, like hard commodities, real estate, forest all sorts of things. You could think about certificates and with the world of ESG. Some of those things could be much better managed using tokens. And then also tokenized currencies where real currencies, fiat currencies or proxies for fair currencies, we also think could be quite interesting. Now all of this is over the course of the next few years, the actual dematerialization of assets from paper into technology back in the '60s and '70s, took a long time to actually happen. It was not coincidentally happening with the rise of computing in business. Now we've got a new technology, the rise of that in business, we think is going to be important but I'm not going to put an exact time scale on it, but its years, maybe it's even decades for full adoption. But we thought that with a longer-term view this was an important space. Now we're not spending a ton of money on it, but we're deliberately investing in smart places in that ecosystem so that we are prepared to be there for our clients over the long-term on this important journey. Mike Mayo : And what was the tipping point, just as a follow-up, the tipping point for you to really highlight this. I mean this is front and center here. This was the third area that you've mentioned investing. You said person, collateral, digital assets, real-time payments. This was number three on your list. So certainly, it's moved up in priority. And crypto has been around a little while now. What was the tipping point here? Was it a new survey of your clients? Did you see something in the market? What's changed? Robin Vince : So I mentioned the survey. The survey wasn't the tipping point, but it was an affirmation. But the answer to your question is client demand. Our clients want institutional grade custody and solutions in this space. And I enjoyed the quip that I read in the media maybe a year or so ago, which is, you know what, it's not a real asset until BNY Mellon say they'll look after it. Operator : We will now take our next question from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : A couple of follow-ups on deposits. So, Emily, you've previously indicated that you had expected by the fourth quarter that deposits on an average basis would be down 5% to 10%. They were actually down -- they're already down seven based on the 3Q average. Should we still think about that range of $5 million to $10 million or might that end up being different, and maybe if you could update on how beta is tracking in your expectation there, too? Emily Portney : Sure. You're correct, I did guide, I think it was around second quarter that we'd expect a decline of about 5% to 10% by -- well, average to average Q2 to Q4 in the third quarter, as you also rightfully pointed out, deposits down 7%. Now that's in part due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which was a headwind of about 1%. And also just seasonality, just that you normally see lower deposit levels in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we are anticipating a decline of about 3% to 4%. And as I mentioned before, we expect it to be mostly in NIB as the percentage of NIBs as a total of our deposit base kind of reverts back to pre-pandemic levels. And like anything, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. So, this is what we are anticipating based on the forward curve and ultimately, the forward curve and what we have been seeing so far this year. In terms of betas, betas do continue to be a little better than we had anticipated. Just as a note, they do vary widely by line of business. So treasury services and markets are certainly have much higher betas than say, asset servicing or corporate trust. So it's just important to keep that in mind. Looking ahead, we do expect marginal betas to continue to ramp higher as rates continue to rise, but at the end of the day, we do think that they will largely retrace what we saw in the last cycle and so ultimately end up higher than where they are today. And again, I would just say that's just another factor, whether it's deposit balances or betas, those are all factors that are somewhat uncertain based upon the macroeconomic backdrop. Brennan Hawken : Yes. Okay. And then another sort of related question. Helpful to get full year 2022 NII expectation for sure. But when we step back a bit and think about I know it's too early to comment on next year, but just sort of generally speaking, at this point, we've gotten back to triple-digit NIM. Rates continue to be pretty robust. You think your beta is going to largely replace last cycle, as you just said, Is there any reason why the NIM can't retrace the prior cycle NIM? And when we think about the security reinvestment tailwinds for 2023, any reason why once policy rates stop moving higher, you're going to largely see some stabilization because that's what kicks off most of your deposit re-pricing. And then you've got a tailwind from reinvestment that continues to flow through into 2023. Is there anything wrong with thinking about things that way? And how long do you think it might take for the NIM to? Is it possible to retrace the last cycle? And how long do you think that might take? Emily Portney : Well, there's a lot there, so let me try to unpack it a bit. As you have seen from our financials, we've seen several consecutive quarters of sharp increases in NIM. We do expect another step-up in the fourth quarter and even beyond the fourth quarter based on a lot of the factors that you mentioned. We do expect that NIM will continue to expand but probably at a slower rate. In terms of portfolio positioning, we do actually think that rates will continue to surprise to the upside. And so, we're therefore really positioned for greater asset sensitivity. But of course, we can continue to be nimble there. And as we think about the portfolio overall, obviously, we're managing it with the objective of optimizing capital liquidity as well as NIR. Operator : We will now take our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : That was kind of my question on net interest income as well. Maybe just one point on that just technical on the Fed funds purchased spread, that's on the asset and liability side. I see that spread went up to about $72 million in 3Q versus 38% in the second quarter. I guess how should we think about that book as more of a matched book with a spread sort of contained in that area? Or actually, is that poised to dramatically rise in the next couple of quarters? Emily Portney : Yes, I think on that particular question, I think it's just best to follow up specifically with IR. If you're asking more specifically about the kind of the outlook for NIR, which is kind of the broader-based question, based on the forward curve that we see today, we would probably expect some growth from our Q4 exit rate. And just to kind of talk a bit about the drivers there. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, we expect central banks to continue to increase rates and the probably remain elevated for most of the year. We do think that a large majority of the deposit outflows will be behind us by year-end. And again, that's largely because our client base is institutional more rate sensitive rate, sensitive than sensitive to the size of the balance sheet. We could have a little bit more runoff, but we do expect also some organic growth NIBs, as I've already talked about, and marginal betas will increase. So, all of those factors just are kind of coming into the fact that we would expect some growth from our fourth quarter exit rates. Of course, lots of uncertainties. Brian Bedell : That's great color. And maybe if I can pivot to the organic growth initiatives that you talked about in your prepared remarks, Robin, maybe if you could just focus on real-time payments. You've talked a lot about Pershing X recently and, of course, the digital platform. But maybe just if you can talk a little bit about sort of the -- what you're thinking in that area? And to what extent you think these initiatives can enhance that organic growth rate. I don't know if it's too early to put out a target there for 2% or 3%? Or do you think we're going to stay in the sort of 1% plus range for a little while? Robin Vince : So, it's a little too early for a specific target. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're working through all of the various different businesses, understanding the priorities for each one. And as we come out of all of that, we'll have a better sense on that part of the question. But let me talk about real-time payments because I think this is quite interesting for a few different reasons. It is a new payment rail. And whenever there's a disruption or a change in the ecosystem, you have some degree of change in sort of the established order or at least the opportunity for that disruption. And so for us, we think that those opportunities don't come along every day. And so we're quite focused on taking advantage of that. But it's also part of a broader solution set because providing faster payments is nice and safer payments is good. But when it's combined with the ability to do digital invoicing in the request for payment and when that's combined with payment validation, fraud protection and other data services, they can become very interesting solutions for clients. And we view ourselves as not just a payment provider, but a platform provider for entry into the banking system. And we think this is where it overlaps very nicely. You'll remember that we cover 97% of the world's top 100 banks. That makes us with that installed customer base and then the leadership on the product side, it makes us a very appealing partner for fintechs and regional banks as they are thinking about wanting to take advantage of all those capabilities, but either because they don't actually want to be a bank in the case of some fintechs or in the case of the fact that it's very expensive to make all of this investment, and we've done that in the case of other regional banks. We're now providing access to RTP, Zelle, account validation, soon-to-be FedNow, white label solutions and with the real-time invoicing. And we think that whoever gets that collective set of rails up and running, really frankly has an advantage. And as you know, we were the first bank to make real-time payments. We were the first to launch a real-time e-billing and we're a leading in the whole process with Fed now as part of that rollout as well, working very closely with the Fed and other banks as well. So, it's for all of those reasons that I think this is an interesting space. We haven't put a number on it, but we're certainly getting franchise traction. Operator : And our final question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Emily, can you just share with us -- can you share with us your way you guys are managing your securities portfolio. In view, I think you said you think rates will be going higher as we go forward. In terms of the strategies of moving some into held-to-maturity versus available for sale to protect you on the AOCI. And as you go forward, how are you looking at the AOCI issue? Emily Portney : Sure. So as I did say before, we do expect the environment to remain volatile and actually rates to continue to surprise to the upside. And frankly, we really would need some change in tone from central banks or some evidence that inflation is declining probably to change our view on that. So, we are continuing to position the portfolio for greater asset sensitivity. Year-to-date, we have reduced DV01 by about 50%. Duration is also the lowest it's been in a really long time. You do mention that certainly, we did also take measures earlier in the year to protect against AOCI volatility. And so, we did move a portion of the portfolio, about 40% of it now is in held to maturity that certainly has helped with diminishing AOCI unrealized losses. They would have been more, of course, than they have been if we had not taken that action. But ultimately, the portfolio is positioned for greater asset sensitivity. Having said that, we are going to be very, very nimble and should the environment change, we do benefit actually from the fact that 60% of the portfolio is designated as available for sale and have a short duration. So we can be pretty flexible and act very swiftly. Gerard Cassidy : Does it make sense since you have so much in available for sale you're an advanced approach bank. So it's already going through your CET1 ratio to actually take some realized losses and then redeploy those funds at higher yields? Emily Portney : We feel very comfortable where we are in terms of held to maturity. We really want to retain flexibility and also certainly want the flexibility around not only managing interest rate risk, but of course, liquidity as well. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just as a follow-up question, I know you've touched a lot about your deposits today in your answers to questions. Just one last question on deposits. QT now is in full speed operation here in the United States. Have you noticed any change in the deposit outflows since we've gone to the $94 billion, $95 billion a month? And how do you -- I know you out deposits are going to come down in the fourth quarter. But when you look out to next year, is that going to change your thinking at all? Or is it behaving as you expected? Emily Portney : Yes. I think as I indicated, deposit outflows are behaving pretty much as we anticipated. We do think the lion's share of the runoff will be behind us by the end of this year. Why we think that our client base is predominantly institutional in the past and even now. They've proven to be much more sensitive to rates than actually just the size of the Fed's balance sheet. Also, just as a reminder, our businesses are much -- are much bigger. They've grown significantly since what we've seen in the last cycle. So treasury services is much bigger, AUCA and asset servicing is much bigger where that comes, just naturally more deposits. And even what we've seen in the runoff, as I suggested or said it's been mostly non-operational. So I think we feel pretty good about our expectations here and that the large majority is behind us. Having said that, could there be more runoff? Yes, I mean there's so much uncertainty, whether it's interest rate volatility, the levels of the RRP, macroeconomic uncertainty in general. So that's our best estimate based on the forward curve of what we've seen thus far. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I will now hand the call over back to Robin with any additional or closing remarks. Robin Vince : Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your interest in BNY Mellon. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 :00 p.m. Eastern Center Time today. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call, hosted by BNY Mellon. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Marius Merz : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. As always, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. I'm joined by Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Emily Portney, our Chief Financial Officer. Robin will start with introductory remarks, and Emily will then take you through the earnings presentation. Following their remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 13, 2023, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin. Robin Vince : Thank you, Marius. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before Emily takes you through our quarterly results, I'd like to make a few broader comments on our performance in 2022 and on some areas of focus for 2023. As you can see on Page 2 of our financial highlights presentation, we reported earnings per share for the full year of $2.90, down 30% compared to the prior year, and a return on tangible common equity of 13%. Excluding the impact of notable items, we reported earnings per share of $4.59, which was up 8% year-over-year, and a return on tangible common equity of 21%, reflecting our solid underlying performance against the backdrop of a complex operating environment in 2022. Our results this year included several notable items; for example, those related to Russia in the first quarter and the goodwill impairment related to investment management in the third quarter. And our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of a number of decisions that we made to improve our revenue growth and efficiency trajectory moving forward. Excluding notable items, revenues grew a little faster than expenses as we continued to see strength in client activity and volumes, while continuously positioning ourselves to derive meaningful benefit from the upward move in interest rates. Together, these factors more than offset the stiff headwinds from lower market levels. On the back of organic growth in AUC/A, we're continuing our role as the world's largest custodian, and we saw cumulative net inflows in assets under management. Beyond the numbers, I'd like to highlight a couple of areas where I'm particularly encouraged by our performance in 2022. First, our sales momentum, which speaks to the strength of our client franchise and our capabilities. In Asset Servicing, we continued to elevate our client dialogue, while maintaining a strong focus on service quality to support our clients through a difficult environment. Sales wins increased off a strong 2021, and we're winning larger and higher value deals, which is where the elevation of client dialogue matters. In ETFs, AUC/A reached $1.4 trillion, as we saw strong net inflows throughout the year and the total number of funds serviced rose by 12%. And in Alts, we grew AUC/A by 14% and fund launches were up by over 25%. Treasury Services delivered strong broad-based growth throughout 2022. In the fourth quarter, we announced a collaboration with Conduent to be their trusted payments infrastructure provider as they launch a digital integrated payments hub for businesses and the public sector. This hub will enable access to more secure, faster and cost-effective options to send, request and receive payments and refunds in a matter of minutes using real time payments and other proven payment technologies. And we also onboarded several new clients during the quarter as we continued to build our digital payments and related FX businesses. And finally, while 2022 was no doubt a difficult environment for the wealth market, our Wealth Management business acquired more clients with particular strength in the ultra-high net worth and family office segments, and we continued to deepen existing relationships through our expanded banking offering where the percentage of advisory clients who also bank with us rose by about 5 percentage points. Notwithstanding the tough backdrop, Pershing, which is, in fact, our largest play as a company in the wealth space, brought in net new assets of over $120 billion, representing 5% growth. In the fourth quarter, we announced two very exciting wins, demonstrating the broad-based capabilities that Pershing is uniquely positioned to offer. The first was State Farm, which is an exciting relationship given State Farm\u2019s size and reach with its thousands of agents across the country serving tens of millions of households. And we also onboarded Arta Finance, which was founded by a team of former Google executives, who are now leading a global digital family office that uses advanced technologies to empower investors with tools to invest intelligently. This win is an important proof point of our proven set of APIs and digital capabilities and demonstrates our ability to win with tech forward clients. The second area of performance I'll call out is that we continue to forge ahead with our longer-term growth initiatives, such as Pershing X, real-time payments, the reimagining of custody and collateral, and digital assets. These initiatives will help position the company for the next leg of growth beyond the medium term. We went live with our digital asset custody platform in the U.S. in October. And as I highlighted in my op-ed in the Financial Times a month ago, this will continue to be a focus for us, not so much for crypto, but really the broader opportunity that exists across digital assets and distributed ledger technology. If anything, the recent events in the crypto market only further highlight the need for trusted regulated providers in the digital asset space. We are also now live with our first release at Pershing X, just one year after launching the initiative. This release to a small number of select clients includes three core products : Portfolio Solutions, including direct indexing; Client Servicing; and Data and Reporting tools. But equally importantly, this release is about our ability to set a goal on a tight timeline and execute. Finally, the third and probably most important highlight of the year for me is our people and our systems, once again, demonstrated remarkable resilience. Across the war in Ukraine, the extraordinary moves we saw in several government debt markets and volume surges, the operational readiness of our people and our systems consistently enabled successful outcomes for our clients. I cannot thank our people enough for their hard work and dedication to serving our clients. While we're proud of these accomplishments, it's also important to humbly recognize an area where we fell short this past year, acknowledging the inflationary headwinds, expense growth for a second straight year was around 5% ex notables. We consider that number too high, especially considering the expense growth benefited from a stronger U.S. dollar throughout the year. On a constant currency basis, expense growth ex notables was approximately 8%. While I'm encouraged by the renewed sense of urgency across the organization over the last few months to better manage our expenses, we still have ways to go on this journey, which brings me to our key focus areas for 2023. First, expenses. My leadership team and I are fully committed to bending the cost curve this year. That will come from instilling further expense discipline across the firm and from focusing more on profitable new business growth, saying no to more things when the economics aren't what they should be. Efficiencies are also going to come from implementing ideas that will make BNY Mellon a simpler, more efficient place to do business with. And so here, we've embarked on an enterprise-wide initiative, led by senior leaders and high-performing employees from around the world focused on driving greater efficiency and enabling sustainable growth. No one knows the ins and outs of our products, services and processes better than our people. And so, all of our staff have had the opportunity to take an active role in this initiative by submitting ideas for how we can run the company in a better way for all our stakeholders. To date, we've approved about 1,500 high quality ideas, of which about 200 are already completed and another 500 are on track to be implemented this year with a meaningful amount of these ideas requiring little upfront investment. Emily will cover this in more detail, but as a result of these initiatives and our renewed determination, we expect to achieve nearly double the amount of efficiency savings this year compared to what we achieved in any of the recent years. But our priorities are, of course, not just about managing expenses. We are also focused on reinvigorating profitable growth. Our project commits to achieving positive underlying growth this year across almost all of our businesses, with particularly healthy growth coming from Asset Servicing, Pershing and Treasury Services. We will continue full speed ahead with our critical long-term growth investments that I mentioned earlier with clear and specific targets that we expect the teams to hit over the course of the year. Lastly, on the top-line, our priorities include goals for our ONE BNY Mellon program, which incentivizes cross business referrals and development of innovative, multi-business solutions that only BNY Mellon's unique collection of businesses is equipped to provide. In 2022, we saw good initial momentum and we surpassed our initial goal for the year, and we intend to deliver a further pickup in 2023 as we increasingly sell our platform and better connect the dots for our clients. Finally, on capital management, I'll highlight that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program, which provides us ample flexibility, and having ended the year comfortably above our capital management targets, we're now resuming buybacks. And so, in summary, while none of us can predict exactly what the operating environment will look like in 2023, we are laser focused on growing the franchise and executing against our efficiency plans with discipline and urgency to drive some positive operating leverage in 2023, while returning a healthy amount of capital to our shareholders this year. With that, let me turn it over one last time to Emily as our CFO. Emily Portney : Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of our results for the quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless I specify otherwise. Starting on Page 3 of our financial highlights presentation. Total revenue of $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter was down 2% on a reported basis and up 9% excluding notable items. As Robin mentioned earlier and as you can see at the bottom of the page, our reported results in the fourth quarter included a few notable items resulting from actions to improve our revenue and expense trajectory. Reported revenues included approximately $450 million of net securities losses recorded in investments and other revenue, resulting from a previously disclosed repositioning of our securities portfolio, which I will expand upon later. Fee revenue was flat, as the benefit of lower money market fee waivers and healthy organic growth across our Security Services and Market and Wealth Services segments was offset by the impact of lower market values from both equity and fixed income markets and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Firm-wide assets under custody and/or administration of $44.3 trillion declined by 5%. The headwind of lower market values and currency translation was tempered by continued growth from both new and existing clients, and assets under management of $1.8 trillion decreased by 25%. This also reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, and again, this headwind was partially offset by cumulative net inflows. Investment and other revenue was negative $360 million in the quarter on a reported basis. Excluding notable items, investment and other revenue was a positive $100 million, a good result reflecting another quarter of strong fixed income trading performance. And net interest revenue increased by 56%, primarily reflecting higher interest rates. Expenses were up 8%, or 2% excluding notable items. Notable items amounted to approximately $200 million in the quarter, primarily severance expenses. And provision for credit losses was $20 million, primarily reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast. On a reported basis, EPS was $0.62; pre-tax margin was 17%; and return on tangible common equity was 12%. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $1.30, up 25% year-over-year; pre-tax margin was 31%; and return on tangible common equity was 24%. Touching on the full year on Page 4. Total revenue grew by 3% on a reported basis and by 6% excluding notable items. Fee revenue was flat. Investment and other revenue was negative $82 million, or positive $340 million excluding notable items. And net interest revenue was up 34%. Expenses were up 13% on a reported basis and up 5% excluding notable items, consistent with our goal to drive 2022 expense growth towards the bottom half of the 5% to 5.5% range that we guided to throughout the year. Excluding the benefit from the stronger U.S. dollar, expenses ex notables for the year were up 8%. Provision for credit losses was $39 million compared to a provision benefit of approximately $230 million in the prior year. On a reported basis, EPS was $2.90; pre-tax margin was 20%; and return on tangible common equity was 13%. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $4.59, up 8% year-over-year; pre-tax margin was 29%; and return on tangible common equity was 21%. On to capital and liquidity on Page 5. Our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.8%, up approximately 35 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings, the sale of Alcentra and an improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returned through dividends. Our CET1 ratio was 11.2%, up approximately 120 basis points, driven by the increase in capital and lower risk weighted assets. And finally, our LCR was 118%, up 2 percentage points sequentially. Turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on Page 6, which I will also talk about in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $1.1 billion was up 14% sequentially. This increase primarily reflects higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs. Once again, NIR in the quarter exceeded our expectations as noninterest-bearing deposits remain elevated. Average deposit balances decreased by 2%. Within this, interest-bearing deposits increased by 2% and noninterest-bearing deposits declined by 11%. Despite this decline in the quarter, the share of noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits has held up better than expected at 27%, which is higher than historical averages. And we continue to actively manage our deposit footprint to optimize across NIR, liquidity value and return on capital. Average interest-earning assets remained flat. Underneath that, cash and reverse repo increased by 4%, loan balances were down 1%, and our investment securities portfolio was down 3%. As I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we took actions to reposition the securities portfolio to improve our NIR trajectory for the coming years. We sold roughly $3 billion of longer-dated lower-yielding municipal and corporate bonds, which we've been replacing with significantly higher-yielding securities earning roughly 5% or 250 basis points to 300 basis points more than what we were earning on the securities that we sold. While we realized an approximately $450 million pre-tax loss with this sale, this transaction was virtually capital neutral because the unrealized loss was already recognized in AOCI. In fact, we freed up roughly $150 million of CET1 capital as a higher credit quality replacement portfolio consumes significantly lower RWA. Moving on to expenses on Page 7. Expenses for the quarter were $3.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 2% year-over-year. This year-over-year increase reflects investments, net of efficiency savings, higher revenue related expenses, including distribution expenses, as well as the impact of inflation, partially offset by the benefit of the stronger U.S. dollar. Turning to Page 8 for a closer look at our business segment. Security Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, up 18% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue increased 2% and net interest revenue was up 79%, driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by lower balances. As I discuss the performance of our Security Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will focus my comments on investment services fees for each line of business, which you can find in our financial supplement. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees were down 1% as the impact of lower market values and a stronger U.S. dollar were mostly offset by the abatement of money market fee waivers, higher client activity and net new business. In Issuer Services, investment services fees were up 7%, driven by the reduction of money market fee waivers and higher depositary receipt issuance and cancellation fees. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 9. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.4 billion, up 19%. Fee revenue was up 14% and net interest revenue increased by 33%. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 22%. This increase reflects lower money market fee waivers, higher fees on sweep balances and higher client activity, partially offset by the impact of lost business in the prior year and lower market levels. Net new assets were $42 billion, reflecting a very healthy level of growth from existing clients, while flows related to dividends and year end capital gain distributions were naturally more muted than in the prior year quarter. And average active clearing accounts were up 4% year-on-year. In Treasury Services, investment services fees were flat. The benefit of lower money market fee waivers and net new business was offset by the negative impact to fees from higher earnings credit on the back of higher interest rates. And in Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 6%, primarily reflecting higher US government clearance volumes driven by continued demand for U.S. treasury securities due to elevated volatility and an evolving monetary policy. Now, turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 10. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $825 million, down 19%. Fee revenue was down 18% and net interest revenue was up 2%. Assets under management of $1.8 trillion declined by 25% year-over-year. This decrease largely reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar partially offset by cumulative net inflows. As it relates to flows in the quarter, we saw $6 billion of net outflows from long-term products and $27 billion of net inflows into cash. Among our long-term active strategy, liability-driven investments continued to be a bright spot with $19 billion of net inflows in the quarter, a real testament to our market-leading capabilities and resilient performance during the recent market dislocation. A very healthy net inflows into our cash strategies come on the back of strong investment performance, most notably in our Dreyfus money market funds. In Investment Management, revenue was down 22% due to lower market value and mix of cumulative net inflows, a stronger U.S. dollar and the sale of Alcentra partially offset by lower money market fee waivers. And finally, in Wealth Management, revenue was down 12%, primarily reflecting lower market values. Client assets of $269 billion were down 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower market value. Page 11 shows the results of the Other segment, where investment and other revenue includes the net loss and the repositioning of the securities portfolio and expenses include severance. Now let me close with a few comments on how we're thinking about 2023. With regards to NIR, we have positioned ourselves for another year of healthy growth. And so, we currently project an approximately 20% year-over-year increase for the full year and that assumes current market-implied interest rates. Having said that, the range of potential outcomes remains relatively wide and the quarterly trajectory of NIR will be dependent on various factors, including the path of deposit levels and mix, as well as interest rates. As it relates to fees, as you know, market-driven factors like equity and fixed income market levels, currency and interest rates dominated fee dynamics in 2022, while underlying growth across Security Services and Market and Wealth Services was offset by headwinds in Investment and Wealth Management. For 2023, we expect to return to some underlying fee growth for the firm. Now, Robin talked about the work we've been doing over the last few months to bend the cost curve, while making sure we're continuing to invest. For 2023, this translates into expenses, excluding notable items, increasing by approximately 4%, assuming exchange rates remain flat to where they ended 2022 or by approximately 4.5% on a constant currency basis. This compares to 8% in 2022. And then, on taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for the year to be in the 21% to 22% range, primarily due to an increase of the corporation tax rate in the UK this year. And finally, I want to close with a few remarks on capital management. As you saw, we ended 2022 comfortably above our management target. And our Board of Directors has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program, which provides us ample flexibility. As always, the timing and the amount of repurchases is subject to various factors, including our capital position and prevailing market conditions, among others. Based on our current expectation for continued earnings growth in combination with our estimated trajectory of AOCI pulling to par, we're now resuming buybacks and we\u2019d expect to return north of 100% of earnings through dividends and buybacks in 2023. With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, congrats to Emily on your new role. Emily Portney : Thank you. Brennan Hawken : I'm sure you won't miss our earnings quarterly, but it was a real pleasure to work with you here these past few years. So, I'd love to drill down on the NII expectations. You indicated that it assumes current market rates, but maybe you could please walk us through some of the more specific drivers, primary assumptions and moving pieces that underlie that 20% growth assumption. Emily Portney : Good morning, Brennan. And it's been great to work with all of you as well. So, if you think about the NIR outlook, the first thing I would just mention is that we use the forward curves to as a basis of our projection. So, we don't try to get cute. And as all of you know, for the Fed that assumes another 50 basis points of hikes in the first quarter, probably followed by a pause until the end of the year. The curves outside the US assume about 125 basis points to 150 basis points worth of hikes by both the BOE and the ECB. So, as a result of these curves and rising rates as well as, I would say, all of the actions that we've taken in the securities portfolio, and by that, I don't just mean the rebalancing that we did in December, but we, obviously, positioned the portfolio throughout the year, meaningfully shortening duration, adding floaters, et cetera, so with all of that, we do continue to expect to benefit from significantly higher reinvestment yields. Now tempering that a bit, we do expect deposits to decline modestly, call it, low to mid single digit from fourth quarter average. And finally, as it relates to marginal betas, we would expect them to continue to increase, but of course, more so for non-dollar balances. So that's really what's behind the 20% guide year-on-year. But I would also say there's a lot of uncertainty in the market and certainly, we're prepared for many different outcomes. It will be highly dependent upon deposit levels and there's some upside there if we retain more NIBs. Brennan Hawken : Great. That's very helpful. Thank you, Emily. Capital accretion was really encouraging this quarter. You guys have the rather large buyback announced and you made some positive comments on it in your prepared remarks, Emily. So, how should we -- AOCI was really, I think, the source of the big surprise from my perspective. How should we be thinking about AOCI accretion if yields remain stable from here? What does that timeline look like? Emily Portney : Sure. So, assuming the portfolio doesn't change and forward rates are realized. The latest -- our latest forecast would expect to recover probably close to 50% of the $2.5 billion of unrealized loss in the AFS portfolio over the course of, call it, 15 to 18 months. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning, everybody, and Emily, congrats again. I was hoping we could start with a question around fixed income markets. There's generally a broad set of bullishness on the outlook for fixed income flows, particularly with respect to ETFs. I'm curious, as a very large servicer of fixed income assets, and you guys just kind of touched that whole ecosystem in multiple different ways, can you help us frame how BK's fees overall and servicing fees specifically could benefit from an improved outlook for our -- from fixed income flows, both mutual funds and ETFs? Is there a particular difference, when it's like inflows versus outflows? Just hoping to get a little more granularity as we think about the fee outlook for '23. Emily Portney : Sure. So, just as we think about the fee outlook, what I would say is just our base case assumption is that there's a relatively soft landing in the U.S., so that would be average equity markets as well as fixed income markets are not that far off from what we've seen averages in 2022. You are correct that our money market platform does benefit that to a degree. Having said that, we do expect some modest runoff in balances as well in money market funds. And what I would also just highlight is that any strength in the fixed income market really does play to the strengths of our investment management business. Robin Vince : Yes, Alex, I -- it's Robin. I would just add a couple of things to that. Just as you think across the breadth of our franchise, and Emily mentioned a couple of them, we have a lot of oars in the water on fixed income generally. So, our asset servicing business is fixed income heavy, that gives rise to a fixed income heavy, security lending business. We have a $1.3 trillion worth of cash on our investment platform. So that plays in the short end of the market, which obviously has an overlap with fixed income as well. We have our Dreyfus money market fund, which has done -- which has performed really quite well over the course of the year in terms of performance and asset gathering. We have our treasury business in terms of our clearance business. We have our treasury market repo business. So, we've got a lot of different opportunities that come from all of this, and we're obviously paying attention to all of them. Alex Blostein : Got you. Great. Thanks. And then maybe just my follow-up on operating leverage in the business broadly, and you mentioned, Robin, a number of different efficiency programs that you have in place that sound like they're ramping nicely and just kind of incorporated in your expense guidance for this year. But when you sort of take a step back and assuming that short-term interest rates remain sort of range-bound or whatever the forward curve is forecasting, how are you thinking about the pre-tax margin for the firm as a whole over time? I'm not sure if you're ready to talk about those targets yet, but in the past, you guys were north of 30%. Is that ultimately the goalpost as you think about the ins and outs of your programs, but also what's going on in the top-line? Robin Vince : So, you're right in that we're still working on it. I'm four-and-a-half months into my tenure. We've talked about the strategy reviews. They are ongoing. We've made some good progress. It's true on the business side. It's also true on the function and the support side as well, but we are focused. To your question on margin, we are focused on driving profitable growth which is top line, but with an eye to the bottom line and also just exuding expense discipline through doing the work. We think we've got a high-performing culture, but we continue to drive on things that relate to that. And I think when you look across revenue growth, pre-tax margins and ROTCE, you have the key metrics that we're really using. Now, we are considering a variety of different KPIs, and we look forward to giving you all more transparency on some of those KPIs as the year progresses. And so as we do the work, we're going to come talk to you about it. Alex Blostein : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell. Your line is open. Sir, please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning. [Technical Difficulty] great working with you over the years. Maybe you could talk a little bit shift gears a bit to a scenario in which we don't have a soft landing, let's say we do have a recession and a lot of pressure on markets. In that scenario, if we assume that there still is actually pretty good allocation to fixed income, which of course, you would benefit from, can you just talk about throughout your platform, to what extent you would expect to be resilient against that? And some of the areas I'm thinking of or even in deposits where deposit growth could outperform the expectations that you described, Emily? And then, if you could also just remind us on the fee revenue sensitivity to equity market declines? I think, it's 1% plus through every 10%, I think. Emily Portney : Sure. So, a couple of comments there, and I think Robin will add on probably. So, just in terms of our sensitivity overall, our fee sensitivity to fixed income market. Just remember for every 5% or so gradual change in fixed income markets that impacts annual fee revenue to the tune of south $40 million. So that gives you some idea on how to size that. And then, certainly, as Robin pointed out earlier, we have many different businesses that ultimately would benefit from also strength in fixed income markets. Robin Vince : But Brian, let me just add something else. One of the things that -- we're a trust bank, we often get obviously compared to trust banks, and I understand why. But we have a broader portfolio that I think is quite relevant in answer to your question, particularly, and they happen to be higher growth, higher margin businesses for us. So, things like Pershing, things like Treasury Services, our Clearance business, our Collateral Management business, and those really do contribute to the underlying diversification that we have as a firm. And that portfolio helps us with the stability of underlying revenues through different market conditions because they're essentially driven by different things, and so we get a balance for that. Now, on top of that, we're, of course, thinking about how to make sure that we are increasing the mix of the types of revenues that we have as well. So, yes, we have fees. Yes, we have net -- NIR, but we're also powered by transaction volumes, and we're also powered by subscription fees. And so, the combination of these diversification of the businesses and the diversification of the types of revenue streams, we think helps us quite a bit in these different market conditions, and that's why you've seen us, in fact, perform in an effective and relatively stable way through some pretty significant gyrations. Brian Bedell : That's great color. And then, maybe, Robin, if you just want to continue on the growth initiatives that you've outlined, Pershing X, the payments venture with digital payments, especially in terms of -- these are definitely long-term investments and trajectories. But maybe if you can sort of think -- or sort of telegraph what you think might be the contribution this year or just outline what you think might be a reasonable organic growth rate -- revenue growth rate for this year? Robin Vince : So, look, we've talked about the fact that these are medium-term initiatives, and they are. The contribution to revenues today from real-time payments is really small. But we do see this as rails of the future, and we see it as creating an opportunity for a connected set of services; think of fraud prevention and account validation and bill pay-related things. So, there's an ecosystem that builds around the actual capability. And we think that that's a significant opportunity for us. You've seen some announcements that we've made. But if I tick through very briefly, and I will try to be quick about it, but through each of our businesses. Look, in Pershing, we've had a strong year of net new asset growth. We talked about it in my prepared remarks. And we think that we'll have growth in the near-term through onboarding the pipeline, and then we've got the medium play of Pershing X. In Asset Servicing, we've been growing sales. And at the same time, we're leaning into the future with things like digital assets, and we're focusing on the expense base as well. So, again, it's something for the near term and for the medium term. In Markets, we're driving with foreign exchange and liquidity and securities lending, and then for the medium term, execution services and new products. In CCM, we expect the evolution that will come from the gradual decant of repo into tri-party, which we think we're well positioned for. In Treasury Services, we're picking up cross-border activity in terms of U.S. dollar clearing and we're playing for the longer term that I talked about with real-time payments. And so, across so many of our businesses, we've got opportunities in the near term, we're focused on executing them, and we're investing for later. Brian Bedell : That's great color. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wildhack. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Rob Wildhack : Good morning, guys. I appreciate the color on deposits for 2023. I wanted to ask a little bit more about what you saw in the quarter. Interest-bearing deposits flipped to growth. Wondering what the drivers are there. And on the noninterest-bearing side, that outflow accelerated quarter-over-quarter. So, any more color on either of those would be great. Thanks. Emily Portney : So, deposit balances overall for the quarter were down very modestly as you can see. And most of that was a runoff in non-operational, but NIBs did and still are remaining at elevated levels. So just for what it's worth when we're talking about the trajectory for deposits in 2023, as I said before, we would expect average deposits to decline very modestly, call it, low single digit from fourth quarter averages. And you should expect and we are expecting the large majority of that to be from NIBs because they will probably revert back to about 20%, 25% of our total deposit balances as we've really seen in historical average. Rob Wildhack : Okay, thanks. And then, Robin, you highlighted healthy growth in Asset Servicing as a priority for this year. That's a business that's well established, sometimes can be more difficult to differentiate. So, what are the kinds of things you can do and you want to do to accelerate growth there? Robin Vince : Well, I'm going to start off on this one, but then I'm going to give it over to Emily because she is going in to run that business and knows it pretty well already from her prior time. But I think there are a variety of different opportunities for us. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're really elevating the conversation more into the C-suite of some of these firms, because gone really are the days where we're selling a small component of a service on an isolated basis, we see more opportunities to sell bundled deals with data and digital capabilities, all wrapped up in it. And that we see -- we are getting traction from that. We had a very significant new client that we announced earlier on in the year -- or last year, that is a good example of that type of package sale. So that's one thing. We also have the bottom-line focus. I want to continue to point you at the comments that we've made before that the margin in that business is not acceptable and that we will continue to invest both in the top-line, we'll benefit some from rates, and investing in making the cost of execution cheaper and more efficient in that business. So, it's really a package of all of the things. I don't know, Emily, if you want to add. Emily Portney : Yes, just a few things to add. So, as Robin alluded to in his prepared remarks, I mean, we are winning larger and higher-value deals, but we're also very focused on the profitability of the mandate and the relationship overall. And so that also means we're being more selective even in the RFPs that we participate in. Likewise, we're leaning into higher-growth areas like Alts and ETFs. 20% of the wins that we have seen or -- had a data component, and data is very critical, especially, in the forward trajectory to our clients. And I would say our pipeline is very strong. And the other thing, of course, as Robin mentioned, is we are very, very focused on driving the cost down across the Securities Services segment, inclusive of Asset Servicing for those businesses, which remain pretty manually intensive, so think Transfer Agency, think Fund Accounting. So, there's opportunity there for sure. Rob Wildhack : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Chubak. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. Robin Vince : Good morning, Steven. Emily Portney : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So, Emily, I'm going to ask the question I had asked you 12 months ago, roughly, on the earnings call about Basel IV. We still don't have a proposal, but we know something is coming in early '23. And given his speech had hinted at capital requirements moving higher for the G-SIB cohort, recognizing there is still no proposal, but I was hoping you could just speak to how you're scenario planning for the finalization of Basel III? Whether that has any influence on the potential cadence of future buybacks or just capital management, more broadly? How you see that potentially evolving? Emily Portney : Sure. So, look, we're obviously very involved with regulators in the industry around the conversations around Basel IV. It's true, of course, the introduction of operating or operational risk RWA into the standardized approach would, by itself, drive an increase in our standardized RWAs. When we crunch the numbers, our calcs suggest something a bit less than probably what you've seen for the GSIBs aggregate in the QIS. And there are also -- we do also expect there are going to be some offset for us. So, lower credit risk RWAs and also, we'll probably benefit modestly from the more risk-sensitive market -- the market -- the more risk-sensitive, excuse me, market framework. So, they'll be puts and takes. We'll have to wait, really, until the regulators release their proposed version. And we already -- and we do obviously -- for us, we're always looking at RWA optimization. You can actually see that RWAs came down in the quarter, again from optimization that we have been ongoing, that's ongoing and we've been doing. And I would just remind you, too, that the industry will have time to leg into whatever the results end up being. Steven Chubak : Fair enough. And just for my follow-up on expenses. I was hoping you can help us reconcile what the expense guidance for '23 implies for both the op margin and dollars of expense as it relates to the Securities Services segment specifically? It feels like that's the area where there's still some of the most low-hanging fruit, if you will, to drive efficiency gains. And just given the planned efficiency actions, how should we think about that second derivative for expense growth? Should we expect that to steadily improve over the course of the year, where you implement the plan, you start to realize some of the benefits, and the exit rate on expenses, therefore, in '23 should reflect a lower level of expense growth relative to the other quarters? Emily Portney : So, I'll kind of answer that more focused on margin for Securities Services because that's really what we've been talking about and a very critical KPI for us. So -- and I think Robin already said, we are very committed to a 30%-plus margin over the medium term. You'll see we printed in the fourth quarter, margin of about 27%, for the full year that was closer to 21%. In 2023, we will benefit somewhat from NIR. So, higher rates will be partially offset perhaps by a modest decline in NIBs. Also, we are absolutely extraordinarily focused on executing against the revenue growth as well as the efficiency initiatives that we have been talking about. When you think about Securities Services though, I'd also just mention, there's going to be some nonrecurring activity that we enjoyed in 2022 that we won't have in 2023 in Issuer Services in particular. So, kind of net-net, putting it all together, when you look at the margins for Securities Services overall, they're going to be lower than what we printed in Q4, but certainly higher than the full year level. So, we're making progress. Steven Chubak : And just the expense growth, on a firm wide basis, whether the exit rate for '23 should reflect some of those additional efficiency benefits that you had cited? I'm just trying to think about the cadence for how we should think about the expense trajectory over the course of the year. Emily Portney : Yes. So, I'm not going to kind of give too much detail on what we expect quarter-on-quarter. I mean, the only thing I would say just and all of you guys know this is that for the first quarter, staff expenses are typically a bit higher due to long-term incentive comp associated with retirement-eligible employees. And of course, the actions we're taking, they're front-loaded, but you'll see that over the course of the year. So, I think, I would just go back to, we are absolutely bending the cost curve. We are expecting to deliver and are very committed to deliver year-on-year growth of about 4%, 4.5% constant currency, and again, that compares to 8% in 2022. Steven Chubak : Helpful color, Emily. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Can you hear me? Robin Vince : Hey, Mike, how are you? Mike Mayo : Good. Robin, I think you inherited a tough hand here. So, I mean, BNY Mellon historically has had periods when they do a better job controlling expenses, but that typically coincides with periods of slower top-line growth, but you're starting off here, fees were down 3% last year. Looks like your guide for NII implies that's flat with the fourth quarter. So, it's not so much, okay, revenues are slow, you can control expenses so much they've already slowed or they're about to. So, it just seems like your efficiency savings are going to be tougher. And as part of that, this predates you, Robin, but when it comes to notable items or one-time items, you had some this quarter, but if you look over a decade, your notable items add up to $3.5 billion. That's almost a year's worth of earnings. So, the real question here is how can you improve your profit margin and your efficiency ratio and squeeze more out of BNY Mellon when the revenue environment has been tough and you have inflationary pressures? I guess, how confident are you to turn this around in terms of the positive operating leverage on a core basis? Robin Vince : So, Mike, without reflecting on the past in terms of what people have done and how they've done it, I'll just say that we acknowledge that the past decade has been disappointing in terms of our company's broad financial performance. You can look at some spots on the top-line, the bottom-line, expenses, we pick your spot, but we're not comfortable with the broad performance of the company over the past decade. And that's how we've talked to our Board about it, that's how we talk to our employees about it, and we're determined to change that. And so, you're hearing from us, I think, I hope, a determination around changing that outcome. Now to your question, let me take the two parts of the things that you've really talked about. So, first of all, the notable items. And so, we are very, very clear, and we do this in our earnings release and we do it in our prepared remarks, we talk GAAP first. So, you can see the reported numbers and it's very clear and you can judge us on that. But we also want to give you the transparency, and frankly, the insight into the way that we're running the company under the hood. And we think that's why that additional element of disclosure is helpful, but you'll make your judgment based on that transparency and the insights that we're trying to provide. Now, I own that 4% to 4.5% number, 4%, if use the exit rate of currency, 4.5% on a constant currency basis, and that's essentially half of what it was in 2022. And the environment, from an inflation point of view, isn't expected to get any better. We had inflation over the course of the past few months, CPI between 6%-and-change and 9%-and-change, we've still got that environment. But we've been very deliberate in terms of staffing, choices of things that we're going to do, choices of how we're going to do it. I talked in my prepared remarks about a variety of -- involving our employees in bending the cost curve, because I think it's a cultural thing for us as well. We're attacking it on all of those fronts. Now, once we've done all of those things to the implied question of what do we think the future holds, well, we don't want to stop there. We don't have line of sight to all of the things that we're going to do in the future, but we see opportunities. For instance, I'm just going to pick one and then I'll finish, which is on technology. We've invested a ton rightly so in resiliency as a company. Resiliency is incredibly important to our products and services. It's wrapped up in our brand, and we wanted to make sure that we really took ourselves to a better place than where we were five years ago. But now we've largely done that. It's a continuous journey. We always have to do stuff. But the next leg for us is investing in things like the applications, the digitization of our footprint. We're the world's largest custodian, but we've got more than one custody system. We've got multiple loan systems. We've got five different call centers, and so we're going in and seeing all of these opportunities. And then, over time, we'll do the work to resolve the issues. But we can't do it all at once, because otherwise, we'd spike on the expense base in order to solve the problems, and we only have finite bandwidth. So, we're working through it and we'll continue to work through it. Mike Mayo : Yes, that would be great if you can share more of those metrics over time and how -- what your targets are. The other part of that is your -- you said you have four growth initiatives. You did mention digital assets and -- post the recent debacle. Can you put any concrete metrics or put more meat on the bones as far as where you'd like to eventually get to, or revenues, or what's the endgame, just something more on this whole? It's one of your four key growth initiatives. Just a little bit more color? Robin Vince : Sure. So, I just want to make one comment about the four things that I mentioned and that you're quoting. Those aren't the only growth initiatives in the company. I pick them out because I think they're good and representative examples, but -- and they're different things, and they have different timelines associated with them as well. But there are other things that I haven't mentioned, at least haven't given great as much prominence to, but that could be very interesting to us over time. But specifically for digital assets, it's the longest-term play out of any of the things that we talked about. I expect it to be negligible from a revenue point of view over the course of the next couple of years, it might be negligible for the next five years. But as the world's largest custodian, we are in the business of looking after stuff. We look after $44 trillion worth of stuff. And if there's going to be new stuff to look after, we should be in the business of looking after it. If the way in which we look after stuff, which is the point about the technology changes, we have to adapt to that. And so, we're investing for a future that probably will come to be, but it may not. But if it does come to be, we have to be there. It would be like being the custodian of 50 years ago and sticking with paper and not adopting a computer. That's not going to be us. So, we're investing. We're being cautious. We're being deliberate. And we've got R&D in different parts of the company, and it's measured. But we do think it's important for us to participate in the broader digital asset space. Mike Mayo : Great. Thank you. Robin Vince : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Emily. Hi, Robin. Emily, on the noninterest-bearing deposits, you mentioned how they are a little higher than normal. I think you said 27% of total deposits, but you do expect them -- I think you said to drop to more normal levels, 20% to 25%. What's keeping them up so high? And second, could they remain maybe higher for longer this year? Or do you see some real trends that, no, they're definitely going to get back to normal? Emily Portney : Great question. And frankly, there is a lot of uncertainty around that. So, look, more generally, as it relates to NIBs, I think -- we think it's -- they're high. They're probably elevated because of certainly some risk-off behavior. The other thing though that I'd really mention is that we've gotten a lot more sophisticated too in just how we manage our deposits and the tools with which we manage our deposits. So, I think there's something to that also as well. We do expect the NIBs to revert to about 20% to 25%, but you're right, I mean, to the extent they remain elevated, that is going to be very helpful and we will have upside to our NIR projection. And look, the only other thing I'd mention is that we've seen significant growth in, for example, Asset Servicing, Corporate Trust, et cetera, which actually those businesses attract NIBs. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. We all know that, obviously, your bank is a fee-based bank, it is not a bank that any of us are concerned about credit quality, but I would just like to get your guys' thoughts. And you had a small provision increase, again, nothing material. And again, I emphasize nobody is really concerned about Bank of New York's credit quality. But with the expectation of a soft recession or a slowdown, whatever you want to call it, are you guys seeing any trends in the loan book that you're just watching maybe a little more closely today than 12 months ago? Emily Portney : So, just as a reminder, and I think you've already alluded to it, the quality of our portfolio remains very high. So, weighted average rating is AA minus. Investment grade is over 90%. NPLs and delinquencies are stable. The only area that, of course, we're monitoring very closely is the CRE portion of the portfolio and the office segment, in particular. At the moment, occupancy and rent collections remain high, but it is an area that we're paying closer attention to. Gerard Cassidy : And what percentage of that the CRE of the loan book is that about, Emily? Emily Portney : It's about 9% of the funded loans. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Robin, I know you talked earlier just about the general view for fees to increase and some thoughts on Asset Servicing. Just wondering if you have a view on just what you think organic growth can look like? And also, it's nice to also see some of the movement in the fourth quarter in specifically in Pershing and Collateral Management. Just wondering if you have a thumb nail on what the outlook for those two areas is as well. Thank you. Robin Vince : Sure. So, from an overall fees point of view, we are focused on this internal growth. Forgetting about M&A or any of those other ways to grow, just the blocking and tackling and execution of what we think we can do in the company over the course of the year. We haven't given fee guidance because of the reasons that Emily alluded to, which is there are just so many things going on in the market. There are just too many puts and takes for that to be credible for us so that we are -- but we, of course, have our internal budget, and that's what we've been working through over the course of time. Look, you called out two businesses and those are businesses where we both -- where we think those are bright spots for growth. And so, we expect those to be above the average growth of the company. They're not the only ones that would be above the average, but they are two that would be, and we feel quite good about the prospects for a variety of the different underlying reasons that we've talked about already. Ken Usdin : Okay. Very good. And then, just one quick one in terms of that follow-up on the balance sheet mix. Emily, is there anything changing with regards to how you think about the mix of securities that you add from here in terms of as we get towards the peak of the rate cycle, whether you start thinking about putting on more fixed rate versus the floating type, and what that means for the types of yields that you're able to get on your kind of front book investments? Emily Portney : Sure. So, there's a lot in there. So, look, we've been very nimble and continue to be very nimble in terms of managing our portfolio. Bottom-line right now, we're positioned to benefit from higher rates, but I just call everyone's attention to the fact that the duration of our portfolio is the shortest it's been in recent memory, and more than 60% of the portfolio is in available-for-sale. So, we've really retained a lot of flexibility, and we can act very swiftly should the environment ultimately change. And as it relates to reinvestment yields, I guess it was in the second quarter, I believe, in 2022 that reinvestment rates began to exceed roll-off rates. The difference between the two has steadily expanded to about 250 basis points in the second quarter. And when you just think about how much of the portfolio resets at any moment in time, about 40%, as I said, of the securities, or you can see it, 40% of the securities portfolio is floating rate assets. And the duration of the fixed asset securities is about three years. So, you can kind of do the math there. Ken Usdin : That\u2019s great. Thanks, Emily. Operator : And our final question will come from Michael Brown. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Michael Brown : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Most of them have been answered. But\u2026 Robin Vince : Hi, Mike. Michael Brown : Yes, hi, Robin. Hi, Emily. I guess, my question was kind of as we think about further out into 2023, and so, the market is assuming some rate cuts could occur before year-end. As we get -- if we get to that point, what is your view on how deposit pricing performs there, right? Because if your deposit betas were generally higher than the broader banking system on the way up, how do we think about it to the point where we start to see some early rate cuts? Because I guess in that backdrop, it's not an expectation that we're heading back to where we were, just some modest rate cuts. So, how do you think about the deposit pricing in that environment? Emily Portney : Sure. I'll take that. So, we do expect deposit pricing to perform similarly on the way down as it did on the way up. So, we'll get the benefit, of course, because our -- we will get the benefit should rates suddenly start to come down of deposit costs also coming down very quickly. And likewise, I'll just remind you that to the extent that rates start to come down, then AOCI will pull to par faster. Michael Brown : Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then, just one more on NII. Appreciate the full year annual guidance. As you look at the fourth quarter, it was up about 14% sequentially. Within the annual guidance, any view on how we should think about the first quarter? I know it's a moving target, but any range here just to help us think about the trajectory. Emily Portney : Yes. As I mentioned, the range of outcomes is very wide. So, it's really hard to predict the trajectory in any given quarter. It really is very dependent, probably most specifically on the deposit trajectory. And like I said, if NIBs remain elevated, there's upside there. Michael Brown : Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to hand the call back over to Robin for any additional or closing remarks. Robin Vince : Thank you, operator. I'd like to close today's call by thanking Emily for her time as our CFO and to congratulate her on taking up her new role, starting February 1 as the CEO of Asset Servicing, which as you know, is our largest business. Emily brings a set of experiences and relationships to this role that are going to be invaluable in driving profitable growth of our client franchise. And finally, I'd like to welcome Dermot McDonough, our next CFO, to the BNY Mellon team. He joined us in November, and he's hit the ground running. I know that you are all looking forward to his first earnings call with him in April. So, with that, I'd like to thank you for your interest in BNY Mellon. And if you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well. Emily Portney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 02 :00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Marius Merz : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. As always, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. I'm joined by Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. Robin will start with introductory remarks and Dermot will then take you through the earnings presentation. Following their remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 18, 2023, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin. Robin Vince : Thank you, Marius, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn the call over to Dermot to review our financial results, I want to provide some broader perspectives and an update on how we're serving our clients stepping up as a [firm] (ph) in this complex environment. Following a relatively benign start to the year, markets were quite unsettled in March, when we saw two prominent bank failures in the United States and a government brokered distressed bank takeover in Europe. While things have calmed down somewhat over the past couple of weeks, after over a decade of zero interest rate monetary policies, the risks and uncertainty associated with the fights against inflation, higher interest rates and quantitative tightening, together with geopolitical tensions remain elevated. And domestically, we continue to march closer to another debt ceiling standoff. Against this backdrop, it's a healthy reminder that the strength of BNY Mellon's highly liquid lower credit risk and well-capitalized balance sheet, in combination with the resilience of our platforms is the bedrock that supports our client franchise. For nearly 240 years, we've built up a legacy of client and industry trust rooted in our resiliency through good times and bad. We've been a port in the storm for our clients in periods of stress over that time and recent weeks have been no different as we've helped our clients to navigate the volatility in markets with our strong balance sheet and broader liquidity solutions. After seeing deposit balances increase following recent market events, we ended the quarter slightly higher than where we started it. And our broader liquidity platform, which manages over $1.3 trillion worth of cash and other short-term investment options on behalf of our clients has seen growth across most channels. But more broadly, the recent events have led to concern around the health and stability of some banks as they've highlighted the critical importance of robust asset and liability management for all financial services participants as one of the largest banks in the United States and as a G-SIB we are held and we hold ourselves to a high standard, including stringent capital, liquidity and stress testing requirements. On capital, unrealized losses related to our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio are already reflected in our capital ratios. We have consistently maintained the majority of our investments securities portfolio as available for sale. And as you will recall, we've had a view for a while now that rates would be a little higher in their terminal rate than the market has been pricing it. And so, over the last 1.5 years, we meaningfully reduced the duration and enhanced the risk and liquidity profile of the portfolio. Together, these actions provide us with ample flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions as we move through the year. And on liquidity, our robust liquidity management framework includes risk metrics such as concentration limits and daily liquidity stress testing protocols that go beyond regulatory requirements. It is these periods of stress that also showcase our characteristic resilience and the power of our diversified and lower-risk business model. We primarily serve large institutional clients who collectively maintain substantial deposit balances with us as part of the services we provide to support their business activities whether that's custody, cash management, clearing and corporate trust services. As a result, roughly 2/3 of our deposit base is operational and sticky in nature and derived from a diverse set of business lines. And as I mentioned earlier, we manage over $1 trillion of cash on behalf of our clients across deposits, money market funds, repos and securities lending, which allows us to retain a connection to the money when it moves around various short-term investment alternatives. And we're also the largest provider of collateral services globally, our average tri-party balances increased to $5.6 trillion this quarter, which is another example of just how comprehensive our role is in the broader liquidity ecosystem. Now turning to our financial performance in the quarter. As you can see on Page 2 of our financial highlights presentation, we delivered solid results. We reported earnings per share of $1.12, up 30% year-over-year or up 20% excluding notable items, primarily in the first quarter of last year. Revenue was up 11% year-over-year. We closely managed expenses, up 3% year-over-year, and we generated a healthy return on tangible common equity of 20%. And given how in focused capital and liquidity are at the moment, I'll note that our Tier 1 leverage ratio as well as our liquidity coverage ratio remains strong and unchanged compared to the prior quarter, well above regulatory requirements and our own management buffers. Stepping back for a moment, I'm encouraged by the early progress that we are seeing around the Company to deliver on the commitment that we made to you back in January. First, we are bending the cost curve. Our first quarter expense growth came in marginally better than our initial internal plan and we remain firmly committed to cutting our core expense growth by roughly half this year compared to 2022 on a constant currency basis. Second, in line with our outlook for the year, we continued to derive healthy growth in net interest revenue. Third, we delivered positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. And fourth, we returned a meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders, including $1.3 billion of common share repurchases. We've made good initial progress on our plan to return more than 100% of earnings to shareholders in 2023, and we currently expect to continue buying back stock, albeit at a slower pace given the uncertain environment. At the same time, I've made a promise to you to call it as it is when we fall short of our expectations. And so to be candid, our fees being flat year-over-year was somewhat lackluster. Having said that, there were a number of business highlights this quarter that are designed to help us change this trajectory and drive underlying fee growth over time. And so I'll call out a few. In Asset Servicing, the pipeline remains strong, and the margin on new deals is improving as we're increasingly holding the line on price to drive more profitable growth in the business. ETF activity is up across all measures with healthy increases in AUC/A, orders and flows and wins with [Vault] (ph) and in our data platform service business were pleasing to see this quarter. In January, we announced the launch of our outsourced trading business powered by a platform that already executes more than $1 trillion in volumes annually for our investment management business. This global multi-asset trading service can help clients to reduce their costs and focus on alpha generation. While still early days, we think there is significant opportunity here to offer front office trading capabilities in a trusted, un-conflicted way to the market. Pershing brought in a healthy $37 billion of net new assets during the quarter, representing mid-single-digit organic growth on an annualized basis and total revenue was a quarterly record. As part of BNY Mellon, clients recognize Pershing as a source of strength and stability in the marketplace. In the current environment, clients also appreciate the flexibility and choice of our product offering. Meanwhile, our Pershing X team continues to make great progress as we aim for a broader rollout this summer. Just last week, we announced a collaboration with Snowflake to provide our prospective Pershing X clients with more powerful analytics and faster data management, improving their digital experience so they can operate more efficiently. Clearance and Collateral management activity remained elevated, given the volatility in the market and as dealers increasingly finance larger inventories via tri-party. We continue to see growth from the investments that we've made to increase market connectivity by expanding our tri-party platform into new markets across Asia and EMEA and into new trade types and collateral pools, reinforcing our role as the only truly global provider of collateral management. Treasury Services delivered broad-based client wins across U.S. dollar, digital and FX payments, liquidity and trade finance products and also saw a nice pickup in account and operational deposit growth towards the end of the quarter. Investment and Wealth Management, although our investment performance remains solid, AUM flows were mixed with strength in fixed income and LDI strategies partly offset by outflows in other long-term strategies. During the quarter, our U.K. investment manager Newton launched five future legacy funds, its first range of risk-rated sustainable multi-asset funds to support growth in the U.K. retirement market. And back in the U.S., the Dreyfus Bold share class, which we introduced last year, has now raised over $4 billion in AUM. In summary, over the past few months, I've spoken about our combination of client trust at scale platforms, client-focused culture and resilience as a powerful foundation on which we can build. I'm also proud that our culture has been front and center in recent weeks as our people have risen to the occasion, responding commercially and working tirelessly to enable successful outcomes for our clients in these uncertain times. I view this client-first culture as the key to make more out of our diversified portfolio of adjacent businesses. While we are the world's largest custodian and a trust bank, the contributions from Clearance and Collateral Management, Pershing, Treasury Services and Issuer Services are differentiating in our client value proposition. With that, let me officially welcome Dermot to his first earnings call. Dermot, over to you. Dermot McDonogh : Thank you, Robin, for the introduction, and good morning, everyone. It's a privilege to be here, and I look forward to working with you all. I'll start on Page 3 of the presentation with some additional details on our consolidated financial results in the first quarter. Total revenue was $4.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year. This reflects fee revenue being flat as headwinds from lower market value, a stronger dollar and the sale of Alcentra, which closed in November last year, were offset by significant improvement in fee waivers and the absence of a notable item last year related to Russia. Firm-wide assets under custody and/or administration of $46.6 trillion increased by 2% year-over-year. Growth from new and existing clients more than offset the stiff headwinds from lower market values and currency translation, a real testament to the strength and diversification of our franchise. Quarter-over-quarter, assets under custody and/or administration increased by 5%. Assets under management of $1.9 trillion decreased by 16% year-over-year. Here, the impact of lower market values and the stronger dollar was tempered by cumulative net inflows over the 12 months. Quarter-over-quarter, assets under management increased by 4%. Investment and other revenue was $79 million, and included another strong quarter of fixed income trading on the back of elevated volatility and greater demand for U.S. treasuries. And net interest revenue increased by 62% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher interest rates. Expenses were up 3%, driven by higher investments and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings and the impact of the sale of Alcentra. The impact of inflation and merit increases were largely offset by the favorable impact of the stronger dollar. And the provision for credit losses was $27 million in the quarter, reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast. As Robin mentioned earlier, earnings per share were $1.12, up 30% year-over-year or up 20% excluding notable items, largely in the first quarter of last year. Our reported pre-tax margin was 28% and our return on tangible common equity was 20%, the highest in three years. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which continues to be our binding capital constraint, was 5.8%, essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, and our CET1 ratio was 11%. The strength of our balance sheet and our healthy earnings generation in the quarter allowed us to return $1.6 billion of capital to our common shareholders, including $1.3 billion of common share repurchases while maintaining our capital ratios well above regulatory minimum and above our more stringent management target. Similarly, on liquidity coverage ratio was 118% and also unchanged compared with the prior quarter. The strength of our highly liquid, lower credit risk and well-capitalized balance sheet is one of the cornerstones of our franchise. Starting in late '21 and throughout '22, we proactively reduced the duration and enhanced the risk and liquidity profile of our investment securities portfolio, while consistently keeping over 60% of the book available for sale to position ourselves with at flexibility for changing market and interest rate conditions. Between the beginning of this year and early March, we saw deposit balances declined in line with typical seasonal patterns and in line with our expectations, considering continued Central Bank tightening via both rate hikes and quantitative tightening. This was followed by a swift increase in deposit balances as clients of the strength of our balance sheet during the recent turmoil in the banking sector. We ended the quarter with deposit balances up 1% sequentially on a period-end basis, but we expect continued moderation of deposit levels in the months ahead. Now moving on to net interest revenue and further details on the underlying balance sheet trends on Page 5, which I will describe in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% quarter-over-quarter. This sequential increase reflects higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs and the impact of balance sheet size and mix. Our just clearly a very volatile quarter in rates markets, it is worth noting that, on average, realized rates were in line with our projections for the quarter. Our outperformance compared to our prior expectations was primarily driven by slightly lower-than-expected deposit basis. On a quarterly average basis, deposit balances decreased by 3% sequentially. Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 26% of total deposit balances, which continues to be above our long-term range of 20% to 25% based on historical averages in normal interest rate environment. Average interest-earning assets decreased by 1% quarter-over-quarter. Underneath that, cash and reverse repo was flat, loan balances were down 6%, and our investment securities portfolio was flat. Moving on to expenses on Page 6. Expenses for the quarter were $3.1 billion, up 3% year-over-year. As mentioned earlier, this reflects investments in higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings and the impact of the sale of Alcentra. The impact of inflation and merit increases was largely offset by the favorable impact of the stronger dollar. Robin has been clear about our determination to bend the cost curve. We're executing with discipline and urgency, as you can see signs of our delivery in our professional, legal and other purchase services, net occupancy and business development line. We feel good about our progress in the first quarter and how it positions us for efficiency savings in the coming quarters to help us meet our goals for the year. Turning to our business segments. Let's start with Security Services on Page 7. As I discussed the performance of our Securities Services and Market & Wealth Services segment, I will comment on the investment services fees for each line of business described in our earnings press release and the financial supplement. Security Services reported total revenue of $2.1 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 4%. Within this FX revenue was down 6% as the benefit of higher volatility was more than offset by a decline in emerging market volume and net interest revenue was up 77%. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees decreased by fee waivers and net new business was more than offset by the impact of lower market values, lower client activity and the stronger dollar. In Issuer Services, investment services fees increased by 67%. This increase largely reflects the absence of the notable item last year related to Russia as well as lower money market fee waivers in Corporate Trust. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Markets & Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 10% and net interest revenue increased by 53%. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 15%, primarily driven by the abatement of money market fee waivers, partially offset by lower client activity. Net new assets were a healthy $37 billion in the quarter, and average active clearing accounts were up 6% year-on-year. In Treasury Services, Investment Services fees decreased slightly by 1% driven by higher earnings credit on noninterest-bearing deposit balances on the back of higher interest rates, partially offset by lower money market fee waivers and net new business. And in Clearance and Collateral Management, Investment Services fees were up 7%, largely reflecting higher used government clearance volumes and make continued demand for U.S. treasuries. Moving on to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $827 million, down 14% year-over-year. Fee revenue was down 15%. Investment and other revenue was $6 million in the quarter primarily reflecting free capital gains as opposed to losses in the first quarter of last year, and net interest revenue was down 21% year-over-year. Assets under management of $1.9 trillion decreased by 16% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, this decrease largely reflects lower the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar, partially offset by cumulative net inflows. In the quarter, we saw $5 billion of net inflows into long-term products. We continue to see healthy net inflows into our LDI strategies of $10 billion, and we also saw $4 billion of net inflows into our fixed income strategy. In cash, where we expected outflows from a small number of clients, this was offset by healthy inflows on the back of our continued strong investment performance. In Investment Management, revenue was down 15% year-over-year. This decrease reflects the impact of the sale of Alcentra, the mix of cumulative net inflows, lower market values and the stronger dollar and was partially offset by lower money market fee waivers. In Wealth Management, revenue was down 12%, driven by lower market values and changes in product mix. Client assets of $279 million was down 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower market values. Page 10 shows the results of the other segments. I'll close with a few comments on how we're currently thinking about our financial outlook for the year, which in short remains basically unchanged. From our earnings call in January, you will recall that based on March implied forward interest rates at the end of last year, we projected an approximately 20% year-over-year increase in net interest revenue for the full year '23. As you all know, we continue to see significant volatility in rates, markets and market implied forward interest rates currently suggest some meaningful fed easing relative to the dock plots. We have positioned ourselves for continued interest rate volatility and retain ample flexibility and liquidity to respond to a wide range of outcomes as the ultimate impact of continued tightening remains uncertain. We're off to a good start in the first quarter. And based on March implied forward interest rates at the end of March, we still believe our outlook for 20% year-over-year growth in net interest revenue is realistic with some skew to the upside. We also still expect expenses, excluding notable items to be up 4% year-over-year, assuming foreign exchange rates at the end of last year or by approximately 4.5% on a constant currency basis. As we said on our earnings call in January, we are determined to deliver some positive operating leverage this year. We still expect an effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range and finally, as we calibrate the amount and pace of our continuing share repurchases in the weeks and months ahead, we will be mindful of the continued uncertainty in the operating environment, especially as it relates to the uncertain path of interest rates and so we're planning to maintain our current more conservative capital buffers for the time being. So to wrap up, we're pleased with the Company's solid financial performance in the first quarter which have made a challenging operating environment once again showcased the strength and resilience of our business model. As we look forward, we are continuing to manage our balance sheet conservatively and we are confident that we are well positioned to help our clients navigate the elevated uncertainty in global markets. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Welcome, Dermot. To follow up on your NII, you reiterated 20%, perhaps a little upside. Obviously, with a good start to the year that implies a sequential slide as the year goes through. Can you just kind of help us understand how that works through in terms of what you're expecting for deposit trends and liability costs as you look through to that. Dermot McDonogh : Okay. Good morning, Ken. And thanks for the question. Before I answer, I'd just like to acknowledge Emily, who is the former CFO and has been a tremendous partner with the transition and to the finance team and Investor Relations team who really helped me settle in well, and it's a real privilege to be here, and I look forward to working with you all. So on to your specific question around the mix between NII and deposits. Look, back in January, the environment was a little bit different to where it is today. We feel we've had a very good start to NII. We did a lot of scenario analysis in January to come up with that number. And look, there was a big kind of divergence between the market implied forward curve, which we use to kind of budget and project where we think NII is versus where the Fed is in the dot plots. If you look at it today, there's a little bit more of a coming together of that and there's more of a market color around higher for longer. We're positioned for that. We feel good about this. And as a consequence of that, we've locked in a good quarter and we feel good about subsequent quarters. And look, the important thing in my remarks was skewed to the upside. The range of outcomes is probably more uncertain today than it was in January. We have the debt ceiling to come, geopolitical uncertainty, all the factors that you would know about. And as a consequence, I don't really want to update the guidance, but feel we're solid on 20% with that skewed to the upside. Ken Usdin : Got it. Great. And just as a follow-up then, can you maybe just flesh out a little bit how you're thinking about how the deposit trends go from here, both in an absolute sense? And then perhaps what that mix of DDAs to total looks like from, I think, the 26% that you posted this quarter? Dermot McDonogh : Sure. So, if you kind of take a step back on deposits and think about coming out of the pandemic and as people started to focus on inflation and having better yield opportunities and you look at the system in total, you see over the course of the last 15 months across the industry, deposits leaving the system, we're kind of tracking that. And we're the same really as everybody else. We're down 3% in terms of average deposits and maybe if I kind of double-click on what happened in the quarter, a little bit, up to March, we were in line with our forecast, which kind of gave us the 20% year-over-year growth. We kind of had a blip to the upside for deposits in the latter part of March as a result of a little bit of the turmoil that happens there. We saw a flight to our balance sheet. People wanted to use our platform. And so we saw deposits elevate. Now that's largely moderated, albeit we're a little bit above our forecast, we expect that to moderate further like the rest of the industry in the coming quarters as our clients are sophisticated and they will look for yield. But look, I refer you to Robin's comments in his remarks where he talked about the cash ecosystem and we kind of touched $1.3 trillion of a cash ecosystem, we want to point them to our products and services. So while they may not use our deposit platform, we want them to use other products within our ecosystem. So, we feel very good about where our deposit balances are and the trajectory for the rest of the year. Operator : And our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So, I wanted to start off with just a question on some of the buyback commentary. We saw a strong capital return in the quarter. You noted plans to temper the pace of buyback, was hoping to get some more context as to what's informing that decision. If I think about some of the key inputs, the leverage denominator should be shrinking, albeit modestly, given some of the deposit commentary you decided, you've sounded more sanguine on Basel IV, you're less exposed to credit shocks. It just feels like you're better placed than most to continue a healthy pace of buyback. Just want to understand the decision to retrench a bit in terms of the pace of deployment. Robin Vince : Thanks for the question, Steven. I wouldn't use the word retrench. I would just go back to January and kind of just reaffirm what we said we'd do, which is return north of 100% of earnings to our shareholders this year. In Q1, it was a total of $1.6 billion, of which $300 million was dividends, $1.3 billion in share repurchases. So a good start, March came along, and maybe some of it is me being a freshman CFO and wanting to just slow down the pace a bit to see how the macro environment plays out. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. I would reiterate, we are going to continue to buy back but we're just going to take it easy now and watch the situation day by day, week by week. If the situation clarifies itself. If we get debt ceiling resolution, there are a lot of things that play into the next couple of months, and we'll watch and see and adjust accordingly. Steven Chubak : So just to understand, is it's -- you're making adjustments, but are you still committed to the 100% payout or north of 100% payout at least for the time being? Dermot McDonogh : That's correct, Steven. Steven Chubak : Okay, great. And just for my follow-up on the topic of efficiency, really encouraging to hear that you're doubling the efficiency savings this year. I know you had highlighted that previously. We saw some really nice progress in improving the Security Services operating margin. You talked about staying disciplined on managing cost there. With the margin there above 25%, how quickly do you think you can get to that 30% margin? I wanted to understand what your plans are for the Investment Management segment, in particular. The pro forma the Alcentra sale, the margin there is fairly subdued, just wanted to get some expectation around where you think that margin could potentially traject to over time, what your plans are in terms of efficiency, if there are any for the investment management segment as well? Dermot McDonogh : Okay. So, there were a few questions there. So I'll try and deal with them as best I can. So, if we kind of zoom out for a second and look at the firm, yes, a 28% margin with a 20% ROTCE, the highest in three years, okay? So margin good, always want to improve. And then you double click into that and you go Security Services, 26% going to 30%. The positive in there is Emily was the CFO for a number of years, and now I get to partner with her figuring out how to drive that margin higher. And so we have a plan, you will have noted that we committed to half the expense growth year-over-year. We're off to a good start and that will have -- that will -- that segment will be a beneficiary of that. Then you double click into the next segment, which is Market & Wealth Services, which is a 48% margin, which I have no problems as CFO with that long may it continue. And then we go into Investment and Wealth Management, which 11% margin is a bit -- to be honest, it's probably a bit disappointing. But 18 months ago, that was a 30% margin business. And we don't see any reason why we can't get back there with a lot of hard work. There were quite a number of headwinds going into that last year, lower market values, a significant strengthening of the dollar. And some of our clients wanted to do a bit of a mix shift from equities to fixed income, and that was going from higher fee to lower fee, but the important point that I would draw to you there is the clients stayed in our ecosystem and that's the key message. Clients are in our ecosystem and just mix shifting, and we're working with our clients to deliver good outcomes for them. Operator : And our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : I was hoping we can zone in on fees in Investment Services, particularly within Asset Servicing and Pershing. At a macro level, it feels like a lot of things have gone your way, markets were up. Activity rates were very strong, particularly in treasuries, money market funds, retail, et cetera. So all sort of things in your wheelhouse, yet the revenues in both businesses were down sequentially. So you just unpack a little bit what were some of the offsets that drove to disappointment on fees? And as you look out, I guess, for the rest of the year, I think on the Q4 call, you guys made comments around just the overall firm-wide fee growth for 2023. Just wondering to get your latest thoughts on that? Dermot McDonogh : Alex, hope you're well. As a former colleague, I think you were supposed to ask me an easy question, not a hard question. So look, Asset Servicing, the way I kind of think about Asset Servicing is -- and look, the headline number is 2% down, yes. That equates to a little over $50 million, yes. In the context of our quarter, that's a small number. So the way I kind of think big picture, again, I've said this in the answer to other questions, did we attract clients to our ecosystem, yes. And then within that, is like how do we derive fee revenue from those clients. Some of it is to do with market levels, some of it has to do with volume and some of it is other stuff like account opening. So within that context, we did see a risk-off sentiment from our clients wanting to pause, push stuff out to subsequent quarters. So the client volumes were down, and so that really kind of drove the Asset Servicing side of it. And if you kind of look at Issuer Services, it's a smaller number for us, but that's a seasonal business, and depository receipt is within that. And Q1 is typically a quiet quarter there, and we'll expect that to pick up in Q2 for dividend season. And on the plus side for Asset Servicing, we had higher market levels, and we got some fees from that. So overall, I feel good about Asset Servicing. We have to work hard on the fee outlook, but it's not -- I would say, it's not as negative as some commentators would portray the fee outlook to be as I see the situation today. As it goes to Pershing, look, we're very excited about the Pershing business. You'll see from our commentary in our prepared remarks that we had $37 billion onto our system. Robin talked about it in his prepared remarks we're very excited about Pershing X. The partnership with Snowflake, we're going to do a lot of great stuff in that area, and we will tell you about it as the quarters unfold, but Pershing and Pershing X is very, very exciting for us. Alex Blostein : Got you. Maybe as a former colleague, is an easier question on the follow-up. I guess as you sort of think about the dynamics in the banking space over the last month, 1.5 months, sort of the disruption that, that's created and some of the opportunities that you guys might see on the back of that, whether it's retaining some of the deposits that came over or some new areas within the fee side of the equation. Where do you think you could lean into most to gain extra share? Robin Vince : Look, Alex, I'll start that. Look, I think the events of March have really shown the importance of asset liability management as a key discipline. And so whether you start on the asset side and think about tailoring your liabilities accordingly you start on the liability side and make sure that you've got the right duration of assets and the right composition of assets. That to me is lesson number one. I'm sure we'll see a bunch of outcomes from that from policymakers over time as that all gets digested. We're in the preparedness business, not the predicting business, and that goes to everything across the franchise and we've positioned ourselves well for this, and we positioned ourselves so that we would be able to deal with lots of different eventualities, and critically, to your question that we could help clients through those various different eventualities. And so, we're proud of the fact that we've served as a little bit of a port in the storm for some of our clients. We've had a lot of net new accounts opened in various angles on the business. And I think it's reaffirmed for us and we've said this before, that resiliency is a commercial attribute. We spend a lot of money on resiliency. We spend money in terms of making sure that our technology systems are state-of-the-art all of the investment that we've made over the course of the past few years, our investment in cyber, but it's also investment in the resiliency of our balance sheet and the combination of that allows us to then be able to use times like this to be able to attract clients to the platform. Dermot talked about a bit more about that ecosystem, which is another example, which is we built businesses over time, and we've lent into investments in those businesses that allow clients to be able to get what they need within our ecosystem, even when they may be a little risk on, they may be a little risk off, they may favor deposits, they may favor a money market fund, they may favor equities, they may favor fixed income, but we have all of those cylinders, if you will, to the engine to be able to help our clients. We think that breadth and that diversification of the business which is built up over a period of time and which we have been leaning into is very, very important. I know we get described as a trust bank. And by the way, we're proud of the trust that, that Monica implies, but remember that our most profitable, highest growth, highest margin segment of Market and Wealth Services contains a set of businesses which you would not find in a trust bank. Operator : Our next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Dermot, welcome to welcome to the role. Looking forward to working with you. A question on the NII reiteration, Dermot. So previously, there was an expectation that noninterest-bearing deposits would get back to the historic 20% to 25% range. Is that still the case? And can you maybe add a little color on why you think the noninterest bearing deposits have stayed above that range that we've seen in prior history. Is there a business mix shift change that has happened or any other structural reason which could cause it? Dermot McDonogh : Thanks for the question, Brennan. So like the way I kind of think about it again is like I know I've said it a couple of times, it really is NIBs and BNY Mellon is really is an ecosystem point that I will start with. Clients leave and we don't leave with the deposit product. Clients come to our ecosystem for a range of products, and they leave their cash with us to prosecute that business. So, I'll pick out three examples like Corporate Trust, NIB stay with us because they have to make coupon payments. Treasury Services clients leave balances with us to offset fees. Asset Servicing balances stay with us because of underlying client activity. And then our Clearance and Collateral Management business, I mentioned another one, we have decent NIBs there. So our businesses are bigger than a few years ago. Balances are bigger and clients are doing more with us. So NIBs are just attractive to the ecosystem. So then you kind of take a look at history and you do the bottoms-up analysis. And through the last cycle, NIBs did bottom out at the 20% range. Currently, we're at -- we're still at around the 26% range. It stayed sticky. And I think our reason that you could ascribe to that is clients left cash with us in March because they just wanted to leave and use the safety and resilience of our balance sheet and just it stays there. And so, in our forward outlook in terms of why we reiterate the 20% guidance with the skew to the upside is, we expect that to moderate, not meaningfully, but in line with our projection and the work that we did at the beginning of the year. So we feel good about where it is at the moment. We feel good about the forecast. And it's been stickier in the past than we projected it to be is how I would answer it. Robin Vince : But we're not relying on that stickiness. And I think that is an important point that Dermot mentioned. And so to the extent that we are -- we will harvest the benefits as we have them, but we definitely recognize that they could go down to the prior cycle those in percentage composition terms, and we're managing ourselves accordingly. Brennan Hawken : That's very, very clear, all that color. Robin, you spoke to -- you actually said it very eloquently resiliency as a commercial attribute. In the past, you've spoken to the embedded position that Bank of New York has a counterparty. How are you thinking about utilizing that position and that commercial attribute of resiliency in order to drive revenue? Do you have any additional color or commentary that you can provide on how you've been thinking about that? Robin Vince : Sure. So look, we've been quite careful over the course of the events of March to help our clients and to welcome clients into the ecosystem, but we have not wanted to profit from the fact that there's been stress in the system. And so that's obviously an important line, and we participated, as you know, one of the 11 banks that participated in helping another key participant in the financial system with a large deposit. So, we are very cognizant of our role in the system and the responsibility that we have to the system given the role that we play, but at the same time, over time, we do view this resiliency to be a strong commercial asset. So if you step back from the whole of BNY Mellon, I think of ourselves as sort of offering a couple of things that are really differentiating. One is this 239-year history where we touch 20% of the world's investable assets. We are the world's largest custodian. We are the world's largest collateral manager. We have that $1.3 trillion worth of cash in the ecosystem. We have another $5.5 trillion worth of tri-party. That's $7 trillion in total in that space, largest depository receipts firm, number one in the broker-dealer, Pershing, Wealth Management Infrastructure space, et cetera. We have these terrific individual components. And for us, bringing them together and actually being able to demonstrate to our clients the breadth of the platform with resiliency that we offer, we think that's a winning combination and one that over time, as I've talked about before, we don't think we've taken full advantage of. So, it is telling the story of who we are, our place in the world, the roles that we play and helping our clients to realize just the breadth of activity that they can actually do with us and the fact that they can trust and rely on us. Operator : And our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Well, as you said to me at the annual meeting, it's a new country, new firm, a new job. And so just pulling the lens out a little bit, now that I can ask you a question specifically, how do you approach the CFO job? I mean, what skill set do you bring to the position. I know Emily is still there, bigger and better, but how might you look at things a little bit differently? What kind of lens you use? And what are your kind of objectives, say, over the next several years? Dermot McDonogh : Okay. So it's kind of interesting, you asked the question, Mike. When Robin and I talked about the opportunity and when I decided to join, I listened to the first earnings call after I've made the decision to join. And Robin, and he's first as kind of CEO apparent, he talked about connecting the dots across the enterprise, and he's just answered in the question that he just answered there, he talked about that, too. And so, in my prior life, connecting the dots across the enterprise was a thing that I majored on. I also grew up in the financial world, and I intend, hope and plan to bring financial discipline across the firm. We have a great finance team here at BNY Mellon. I couldn't be prouder of what they do. And so I kind of think about the role in three ways. One is working with all of you. clients, regulators, external stakeholders, really kind of delivering the message of what we're about at BNY Mellon over the next several years. So I see that as very important. And then internally, working with the executive committee and the rest of the leadership of the firm and the finance team to develop really good financial analysis in which we can make good strategic decisions about the way we want to take the firm. And that's a lot of work. But the team has already done a good job. And look, you're beginning to see the fruits of this come out in the expense area and other parts. In terms of our top three priority for this year is really is about slowing the expense growth of the firm. We've made a commitment, one quarter in, we're delivering on us. And this is not about -- I don't think about it in some ways as expense cutting, it's like -- it's attacking structural expense basis in the firm where we can think -- we really fundamentally believe we can do the same thing in just a better way and more efficiently and we want to invest and grow the firm. So it's kind of -- I think about my expense priority is like how do I think about run the bank? And how do I think about grow the bank because we really want to take those dollars that we get from efficiency and invest in things like Pershing X and other really key growth initiatives. So it's all about financial discipline and giving the team the financial resources they need to grow the firm and just managing the balance sheet, which is kind of a thing that we've had to do in the last couple of months quite aggressively. Mike Mayo : Just one follow-up. Connecting the dots, it makes sense. And you and Robin both came from Goldman Sachs where there's the culture of connecting the dots. It's just the incentives to get people to connect the dots, right? Breaking down the barriers, breaking down the silos and don't people just ultimately do what they get paid for. And isn't that like a big, tough task to change the incentive scheme to get people to connect the dots with each other? Robin Vince : So if your question is, does it take a lot of work? And is it a big task to run a company differently than it's been run before? The answer is absolutely yes. And we have got a leadership team who are very focused on approaching the next decade differently than the last decade. And this point of connecting the dots is a very important one. Let me give you one example. So Dermot was talking about in our Investment Management business. And he also mentioned Pershing. And so Mike, when you look at those two businesses, just interestingly, they couldn't have been run more separately within the ecosystem of BNY Mellon. Investment Management was run as essentially almost a separate company off to the site. Pershing was run essentially as a different separate company off to a different side and we never really explored the opportunities to be able to think about the manufacturing of investment management with the fact that we have across Pershing and Wealth Management, a $2.5 trillion distribution base. Now we're an open architecture firm. And so we aren't distributing all of our manufactured product into our distribution arms, but we have opportunity to explore that which frankly hasn't been fully explored up until now. Take the adjacency between margin where we've seen a significant growth for our Collateral Management business associated with new margin rules of un-cleared margin, exchanges need more efficient margin delivery. Those products are very adjacent to the rest of our Collateral Management business in tri-party. They're also quite adjacent to our foreign exchange business. They're quite adjacent to our cash management ecosystem. So we have both diversification in the firm, but we also have a lot of natural adjacencies that people haven't explored before. So that's the way I think strategically about it. And then your question is one of the several pillars of execution, which is what are the things that we have to do to actually get after that. Some of those things are structural, some of them are incentive based, some people based, some of them are organizational based. And so we're going to approach all of those different pillars so that we ultimately attack that strategy effectively, and we're very committed to doing it. Operator : Moving on to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, gentlemen. Can you -- Robin, around the debt ceiling that's coming up for this country, what type of risks there are for your business if a debt ceiling isn't negotiated effectively by Congress and the President. Can you -- what kind of risk do you see in just that situation developing as point on the operating of the treasury market. We don't have a crystal ball though, obviously, in terms of how debt ceiling is going to get resolved. And we do think of the Fed and the treasury as clients of ours as well, and we want a seamless experience as much as possible for them and also, of course, for a broader client franchise. And so we're really doing a couple of things. number one, we think it's our responsibility to the system to lean into the dialogue that's going on in D.C. in a way that can be helpful. And so doing our bit for raising awareness, sort of educating on various things, debt ceiling breach is not the same thing as a government shutdown and making sure that that folks really understand what would happen and some of those consequences. And so we're spending time there. We obviously spend time with the Fed and the treasury on the topic, as you would imagine. And then internally, really for the benefit of our clients, we're using all of the lessons learned from the past to update our playbooks. We're putting in automation on various different things, and we are organized around being very ready to be able to execute come what may. Now of course, we're going to take a lot of guidance from the Fed and the Treasury on that as well as we go through it. So there are a whole bunch of different things that we are doing. I will also note that in the background, our own iFlow data, which, as you know, we have quite good insights into market liquidity. It shows that once again, treasury market liquidity isn't great. The market is a little bit less supported from foreign buyers. We can see that from our iFlow data and all have access to the information on sort of off the run versus on the run it offers, et cetera. And so it's not great from a starting point, which I think is a cautionary tale to the official sector that we really do want to try to get good outcome on this thing. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, Robin. And then Dermot, more of a technical question. In your average balance sheet, I think in the supplement, it's Page 7. Can you share with us why is the Fed funds sold yield so high? And the same thing with the Fed funds purchase. The yields one 16.3% in the first quarter and then the Fed funds sold looks like it's 19.75%. Any particular reason why these seem to be out of line with the rest of the yields in the balance sheet? Dermot McDonogh : Gerard, I think that's kind of largely kind of a gross-up netting issue, but I will get Marius to follow up with you after the call and kind of give you a more detailed explanation. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Yes. It just seems very odd to be so high. Operator : We'll take a question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great welcome Dermot, looking forward to working with you. Maybe to the growth outlook for -- Can you guys hear me, okay? Robin Vince : You're breaking up for a second, Brian. I think you've come back. Brian Bedell : Okay. I just wanted to come back to the growth in Pershing and Asset Servicing revenue growth. I heard you loud and clear on the drivers for 1Q as we think about the trajectory over the course of this year, I guess two questions on this. First of all, did you benefit, do you think, from a revenue perspective in those areas on the fee side in March versus January, February? So just to get a sense of how volatility can help the revenue picture? And then secondarily, if you can talk about what you mentioned before in terms of connecting the dots, if you will, and how sort of quickly that can work its way into the revenue picture? Or is that much more of a longer-term goal? And then I'll do a follow-up question separately. Dermot McDonogh : Okay. So Brian, let me start with Pershing. So I would say in both businesses that you asked a question on Q1 was -- it was predominantly a risk-off environment, but notwithstanding the risk-off environment for Pershing, we attracted $37 billion of new assets onto our system. And so we're growing organically at a nice clip, which we're very pleased about. So I would say Pershing feels good. The outlook feels good and we're going to do the launch -- official launch of Pershing X in June. And so, the clients that are beta testing that feel good about what they're seeing. We've got the partnership with Snowflake. So, I would say the outlook for that business overall in terms of our continued growth in assets -- and as a consequence of that, notwithstanding the risk off sentiment in Q1, we believe being the number one in the market with broker-dealers and several million active clearing accounts that we have on the system. We feel pretty good about the future for that one. Asset Servicing, I think the way I would kind of think about asset Servicing is more steady as she goes, yes. It's a big business. We kind of have a mixtures like, in the past, people have talked about as of as being a fixed income house. And so I would characterize it, we're both a fixed income house and an equity house. And so 2/3 of what comes in is kind of largely fixed income related, 1/3 equities. And we continue to grow our AUC and our AUM and so over time, that mix shift between fixed income and equities, where they either play to our strengths or kind of it will slow us down a bit. So overall, we feel like it's a steady as she goes environment for Asset Servicing. Brian Bedell : Okay. That's great color. And then if I could just follow up with the comments you made on the global multi-asset trading capabilities. Similar question there. Is that something more near term or a little bit of a longer-term build out? And is that coming in Asset Servicing? Or the FX and other trading line? And then if I can sneak in on Pershing X, if you're rolling that out in June, should we expect a revenue ramp contribution in the second half to that? Or again, is that more of a longer-term build? Robin Vince : So I'll start with Pershing X. That is a longer-term build. We've talked about the fact that it wasn't going to meaningfully contribute over the course of couple of years since we first talked about that. And so, that's really a '22, '23 thing. You should expect essentially nothing from it in that period of time, but we'll update as we go past launch, we'll give you some updated view on that. But I view that as being a '24, '25, '26 story overall in terms of its ramp. And again, we're still in beta testing. We feel quite enthusiastic about the client response to the product, but I'm going to reserve judgment until we start signing contracts and we launched live in the market on that. In terms of outsourced trading, so this is something that we've launched and we made the public launch during the quarter, hence, we've made the comment, but this is a very medium, long-term opportunity. We talked before about the fact that as a firm, we are very interested in up the value chain of the various different businesses that we do in Asset Servicing. Once upon a time it was custody and then middle office got added and now data solutions get added an integration and these various different components that create a broader solution set for investment management and asset owner clients. And now we're adding to that and saying, \"Hey, there's not actually a ton of alpha for an asset owner or investment manager, particularly one that is managing in the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of AUM. There's not a lot of alpha associated with execution. The alpha is in portfolio construction, asset selection, but the actual buy-sell action isn't. And in fact, it's not great scale because clients often need desks in multiple locations. If they're a multi-asset asset manager, they need lots of different specializations when it comes to the execution. So we have all of that. We've executed $1 trillion or so a year of exactly that type of broad-based asset management execution for our own investment management firm. And so now we've turned that into a platform that can operate not only for ourselves, but also operate for clients. We're externalizing an existing at-scale platform, which is fully capable across products and we're externalizing that now for clients and saying, \"Hey, there's no real alpha for you associated with your own trade execution. Let us take it off hands. And I view this in also in a way as an extension of what we already do in foreign exchange, where we do exactly that on a range of different execution basis for our clients in foreign exchange. And so this is something that we know how to do and something that we already do, now we're externalizing it, and I view it as quite an exciting evolution, but it's a very medium long-term thing as part of our overall journey on fee growth over time. Brian Bedell : That's very interesting. Looking forward to hearing a lot more about that in the future. Operator : And our next question will come from Robert Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Robert Wildhack : You called out the strong pipeline in asset servicing, while holding the line on price, and I wanted to unpack that a little more. First, how does the current backlog and velocity of new business compared to past periods? And then second, given that you're being disciplined on price, what are the common elements that you think are driving your success here? Robin Vince : So, this is part of our overall March to 30% margin in the Security Services business, Rob. And so when we look at that, Dermot talked a little bit about the focus on the expense line. That's important. And it goes a little bit hand-in-hand here. If you look at our margin last year of 20%, now 26%, depending on last year or this year's stat, but if you just take this year stat, we should be putting 4x as much energy into the expense line as the revenue line in order to be able to get the same net effect at the bottom line. And so we're doing that. But on the revenue line as well as driving new activities, this discipline point pricing pressure is a normal part of this business, but as we look back and we review certain deals that have been struck over the course of the past few years, going back, in some cases, going back several years, I think we did win in some cases, on price. And we look at and we now have new capabilities about reviewing the margin on a deal-by-deal level. And when we look at some of those deals, we're pretty disappointed. So that's causing us to engage with those clients and talk to them about the other things that we would like to do for them that help us to be able to broadly improve the margin at a client level. And then in some cases, there have been deals and I'm thinking of one example in my mind of a client who came and they had a real expectation about pricing at a certain level. And we were like, we're just not going to do the business at that level and we negotiated and we substantially increased the price to a level which we thought was appropriate for the actual business involved. And look, I don't know about the past, how that would have happened. But if I look at the history of deals that we've actually got on the platform, my guess is that, that behavior is not something that would have occurred before and therefore, it's yielded a different outcome. So this focus on the true cost to serve and then the standardization that needs to be done across the platforms that will improve and in fact, reduce over time the cost to serve. So even the same piece of business can be more profitable, not only because we're pressuring on price, but also because we're making it cheaper to actually execute that business and the trick will be doing both. Dermot McDonogh : Yes. Look, the point I would add in there having the growth rates and becoming more efficient as a company. So all the work that we do on expenses and efficiency management feed into that discussion as well. So you kind of have to join the expense narrative again with the pricing good business narrative to get the complete picture. Operator : And we'll take a question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : A couple of clarifications. The deposit inflows in March that you were talking about, which businesses did you see that in? Dermot McDonogh : So I would say, broadly speaking, we saw it across the ecosystem. The point-to-point was up 1%. We finished the quarter on a period-end basis at $281 billion. our average for the quarter was, I think, roughly $277 billion. But there was no one business. It really was broadly spread. And I guess the important point that I would call out here is, we made a strategic decision about 15 months ago to kind of centralize how we think about deposits into one platform. So we kind of think of deposits as a platform as well as a product. And we have very, very good client connectivity and engagement. So when we talk about deposits, we talk about it across the system, and that will echo Robin's point about connecting the firm, dissolving different businesses, so we think of deposits as an enterprise effort. And that's how it came together for us in the quarter. Robin Vince : Okay. And the flip side, during this turmoil in March, there was a lot of inflows into money market funds. But when I look at your cash AUM, you had no -- for the quarter, it shows no inflows. Any color on why you didn't benefit in that business also because you've historically been a big player in there? Dermot McDonogh : So yes, like I think -- and historically, I would say, and continue to be a very big player in that. our performance in our Dreyfus cash business has been excellent and continues to be excellent this year. The simple answer to that question is, we had some -- we knew in January, we were going to have some known outflows. So we were projecting to be slightly down in Q1. And with the inflows as a result of what happened in March, that got us back to flat. So overall, I think the average balances were higher, but on a period-to-period basis, we're flat, but we continue to feel very good about the business and more importantly, performance. And then this business performance matters, so we expect that will -- you'll see better balances going forward. Vivek Juneja : And the outflows that you're talking about in January, what was driving that? Is that pricing? Is that something else? What drives that? Dermot McDonogh : It was clients wanting to do something else with their cash. They told us that they were doing it. It was in our forecast time we knew what was going to happen. There was no specific reason. Robin Vince : And I'd just add on to that. I think this quarter was a little idiosyncratic in a couple of different ways. And we -- last year, we outgrew the market in the drivers money market platform and sort of two other observations. There's a little bit of composition that you have to look at under the hood on these institutional money market funds in terms of where the money is coming from. Was it really coming from sort of mega individual ultra-high net worth or was it coming from actual institutional flows. And so I think you have to look a little bit at that on a money market fund by money market fund basis as well. And then as Dermot pointed out, the broader -- our broader connectivity to money market funds goes beyond our own money market fund. And so, we have this market-leading liquidity direct product. And so, even when money goes to other money market funds, we are benefiting from that because we have this connectivity. And so, we are a very large source of inflows to some of those other money market funds that you've seen growing. And again, this is the benefit of the ecosystem. It might be on our balance sheet, it might be on a money market fund, it might be in someone else's money market fund. It might be that we're selling treasury bills to clients, but all of those things are in the mix as is the repo and Fed's reverse repo facility. Operator : And we will take a question from Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Rajiv Bhatia : Thinking about operational interest-bearing deposits versus nonoperational interest-bearing deposits, how much of the rate you paid differ between those two buckets? Robin Vince : So we don't disclose the exact rates on the different components, but let me just sort of broadly talk to you about the deposits, Rajiv, because I think this is quite important. So first of all, to me, the decision tree is not insured versus uninsured that's a convenience. It's sort of a retail expression. It's a short hand that gets used in the market. The ultimate decision tree is whether deposits are stable and sticky or whether they're not. And in short, it's just one lens of that, and that lens is a bit more relevant to retail than institutional. And by the way, even within insured, not all deposits are equally sticky, right? Because you've got checking, you've got high-yield savings, you're going to have different outcomes for these, whether they're true operational accounts, even on the retail side, but there are other types of sticky and stable. And so for us, 2/3 of our deposits in the first quarter are operational across our portfolio of businesses. And those are, as Dermot said earlier on, those are required in order to be able to provide clients with those operational services. And it's diversified across our portfolio and you are custody, cash management, clearing, Corporate Trust, there are a bunch of different sort of business cylinders that give rise in that operational cash engine. And we obviously spend a lot of time and effort modeling all of these types of things and sort of -- and we've seen that has really proven to be stable over multiple cycles. And so that's sort of why we focus so much on operational. And then for nonoperational deposits, look, there's a little bit there associated with which we don't expect them to leave, but we plan for them to be able to leave and obviously at a much, much higher rate than we would think about that on the operational side because we just think that's good asset liability management. Rajiv Bhatia : Okay. And then just one follow-up. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that Wealth Management revenues were down in part due to changes in product mix. Can you expand on what that is and whether you expect that to continue? Dermot McDonogh : So I think that just goes back to the point of the risk off sentiment in -- that we saw in Q1 and people just wanting to, a, not do activity and move from fixed income products to equity products, normal behavior, nothing out of the ordinary that I would call out, totally expected just us working with the clients to deliver the risk appetite that they wanted to have for that quarter. The turmoil of March is kind of, you would say, for now, may have a basis and we may see a change in client behavior, but back when they took these actions in March, we didn't know how long we're going to be in this situation for us. So, it's behavior that we expected to see and is kind of I would view it as normal BAU. Operator : Our last question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Just a couple of things. One, on the MMF discussion that you just had with WIC, you also benefited from MMF through your custody platform as well, right, because your custody a lot of MMF, is that fair? Robin Vince : Yes, that's right. We touch -- it's another touch point with money market funds on the Asset Servicing side. Betsy Graseck : Right. Okay. And that helped the deposits, I'm guessing. So, my question really has to do with your role as a global payment provider, one of the top, obviously. And I think you're involved in the FedNow pilot. I just wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about how FedNow is integrated within your Global Payments platform get an update on the BNY Mellon digital asset platform? And is there anything that's going on within crypto that would have you lean in or out? So kind of three legs of that question. Robin Vince : Okay. So let me start with real time. We are part of the FedNow test. I think actually might have been the first bank to start testing on it. We were the first bank to do a test on the clearinghouse real-time payment rails. And look, overall, when I step back from real-time payments, if I use that as the generic term that would cover both FedNow and the clearinghouse, it is a couple of things. It is a new payment rail. And I think that represents an interesting disruption, and we would like to participate in that disruption, which is one of the reasons why we've been leaning in. I think there's a bunch of opportunities for clients there, quicker, cheaper, more control over the payments. And so that's a good thing, saves them dollars and ultimately, it's quite helpful for the industry's carbon footprint as well because it's really a check, should be over time at check eradicate and there's a lot of sort of carbon footprint and ESG more broadly in the handling of check. So that would be a good thing. We've got the opportunity to be part of that disruption because of our existing Treasury Services business, and we see that also as part of a broader solution set because we wrapped up in real-time payments. There's payment validation, there's fraud protection and there are other data services, and we find ourselves selling that bundle more often than not when we sell RTP. And I think we have a position you sort of framed it in terms of FedNow. But we have a position in terms of real-time payments and payments more broadly as a pretty un-conflicted provider. As you said, we're a very large provider. But that un-conflicted nature means that whether you're a Fintech, whether you're a smaller or medium size regional bank, whether you're a foreign bank, we're not threatening as a set of rails to plug into, and that makes us pretty appealing as a partner. But look, this is a multiyear endeavor. We're pleased with the traction. We've done a bunch of stuff, and we're playing it forward. But obviously, the story is going to be inextricably linked to seeing all of this take hold in the U.S. The other key question that you asked, Betsy, was on digital assets. And look, I haven't changed my point of view here at all. I view it as a completely different thing than real-time payments. And in fact, in digital assets, some people do complete the two and view things like coins and Central Bank digital currencies as solutions to problems which I would actually argue that real-time payments might be a better solution for. So there is a little bit of overlap, but I do favor real-time payments more broadly the question of how to speed up payment rails and payment processes in the United States to make them more efficient. But then on digital assets, we think this is about the tech. We believed in the fact that distributed ledger technology, smart contracts that you can build on top of it have good opportunity over time. That's many years, maybe several decades evolution. It's still early, hasn't really been proven and we'll see opportunities to have more efficiency, easier handling of certain asset types, think about things that aren't standardized today. So they're messy in the financial services system like real estate and loans probably speed up settlement there on tokenization as a sort of as a new form of handling assets. So we like all of those concepts. But in terms of the actual crypto, we've said all along, we're going to be incredibly slow accrual before we run on digital assets broadly and cryptos are -- it's something that we've gone exceptionally slowly. Betsy Graseck : I'm sorry, you broke up at the end. On crypto, you mentioned. Robin Vince : We've gone exceptionally slowly. Betsy Graseck : Yes. And just because of all of the opportunity -- of all the infrastructure that you have I would think you would be an attractive place for crypto deposits. I'm wondering if that's something that you would agree with or not? Robin Vince : I don't particularly agree with that. No. I understand that there are other firms who've over time made it part of their business model to really attract a ton of cash in that space. We do not view ourselves as a crypto bank. We have a variety of clients. We have some clients who touch the digital assets ecosystem, but that's not been a business strategy of ours to grow that aggressively. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just lastly, on FedNow, it launches in the next quarter or so. Is that accurate? And is there a meaningful impact? Or is this, as you mentioned, a really long runway to have an impact on your revenues? Robin Vince : It's a longer runway. You have to get confirmation from the Fed about their exact launch plans because it has evolved a little bit. But it's a long runway. And it isn't so much FedNow as real-time payments of which FedNow is one provider. Operator : With that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin with any additional or closing remarks. Robin Vince : Thank you very much, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your interest in BNY Mellon. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team, and we wish you well. Operator : Well, thank you. And this does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 :00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Marius Merz : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. As always, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. I'm joined by Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. Robin will start with introductory remarks and Dermot will then take you through the earnings presentation. Following their remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July 18, 2023, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin. Robin Vince : Thanks, Marius, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Dermot will walk you through the financials for the quarter shortly. But in summary, the company delivered good financial performance amid a very dynamic operating environment, and we've continued taking actions to position the firm for higher underlying growth and enhanced operational efficiency over time. Referring to Slide 2 of our financial highlights presentation, BNY Mellon reported second quarter earnings per share of $1.30, which was up 26% year-over-year, on $4.5 billion of revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Consistent with our focus on driving pre-tax margin expansion in 2023 and beyond, we drove meaningful positive operating leverage, as we maintained strong expense discipline, while continuing to make significant investments to improve our growth trajectory and transform our operating model. As a result, our pre-tax margin improved to 30% and we generated a return on tangible common equity of 23% in the quarter. As I've said many times before, disciplined execution and consistent progress from milestone to milestone is the key to unlocking the financial opportunity inherent in our high-quality franchise. While we're conscious of the work ahead of us, we're pleased to see the momentum building across the company. First, we're getting an increasingly firm grip on our expense base. I'm proud of our people who are embracing the task of making BNY Mellon a more efficient and scalable company, which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver tangible results in 2023 and beyond. Remember, in January, we committed to essentially cut expense growth in half this year, roughly 4% growth excluding notable items in 2023, compared to roughly 8% ex currency in 2022. Halfway through the year, I'm pleased to report that we're on track even a little ahead of our plans. Second, the strength of our balance sheet, the resiliency of our business model, and our proactive balance sheet management continue to differentiate us with clients and create value for our shareholders. Net interest, revenue and deposits were both bright spots in the quarter. And the Federal Reserve's 2023 bank stress test demonstrated our capacity to withstand an extreme stress scenario. As a result of the test, our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement remains at the regulatory floor of 2.5%. And while our overall approach to returning capital to shareholders remains unchanged, we increased our quarterly common dividend by 14% to $0.42 starting this quarter. Third, we remain laser focused on driving sustainably higher underlying growth across the firm. We've talked before about the advantages of our business model. Businesses such as Clearance and Collateral Management, Pershing, Depository Receipts, Corporate Trust and Treasury Services offer us a breadth and diversification in comparison to traditional trust banks. We saw strength in some of these differentiated businesses in the second quarter, and new business pipelines are healthy across the board. And importantly, we continued pushing ahead with new innovative client solutions that we expect to become growth accelerators for the medium and long-term. Less than 2 years of the hiring employee #1, Pershing X is now live with Wove, our open architecture wealth management platform that addresses a major pain point in the advisory market by better integrating advisers' core applications. Wove allows us to integrate some of the best solutions from around BNY Mellon, including from our Investment Management business as well as from leading third-party fintechs. Our launch of Pershing's Insight Conference in June has garnered significant early enthusiasm from clients and industry influencers who see Wove as a promising solution. The client pipeline is growing nicely, which we will report on more in the quarters ahead. More broadly, Wove is a proof point of our ability to execute at speed. We can deliver leading solutions quickly when we empower our people, surround them with the expertise and tools that they need and drive forward with a product mindset, leveraging our great platforms. It's also a reflection of the change in mindset we are cultivating here, more commercially oriented with a greater sense of ownership and a greater focus on execution. I'll also call out Treasury Services, which continues to innovate in areas like faster payments and Banking as a Service. This quarter, the business announced a strategic alliance with Mobility Capital Finance or MoCaFi, a black-founded fintech whose mission is to enable underserved communities to access banking services. This is just the latest example of how we are deploying our capabilities to advance financial inclusion in an innovative way. Now I've spoken in the past about the opportunity to do more things for our clients by connecting the dots for them through our ONE BNY Mellon initiative and how we are going to operationalize that. To help us realize this potential and more broadly, to sharpen our commercial focus and elevate the client experience across the firm, in May, we welcomed Cathinka Wahlstrom as our first Chief Commercial Officer and member of our Executive Committee. In addition to taking on oversight responsibilities for global client management, I've tasked Cathinka to embed ONE BNY Mellon into the operations of our company. It's important that we commercialize this opportunity through training, by properly incentivizing our people to collaborate across the firm and by developing deliberate approaches to multiproduct solutions. Stepping back for a moment, let me provide a few thoughts on the macro environment. We acknowledge that the path of interest rates, continued QT and elevated U.S. treasury issuance activity carry meaningful uncertainties for the environment in the months ahead. From our vantage point as the primary clearer of U.S. treasuries and through touching roughly 20% of the world's investable assets, our data tells us that more than half of recent T-bill issuance has been absorbed by funds flowing out of the Fed's RRP, but a good chunk of the balance has come from the banking system. Most of the money market fund demand for T-bills has been concentrated at the very front end as funds have been less comfortable extending duration past the end of July, ahead of an expected rate hike later this month and continued uncertainty on the path of rates thereafter. We are also not seeing much foreign demand as cross border flows into U.S. treasuries of all maturities are negative and have been for some time. Together, this is likely going to put some incremental pressure on domestic funding sources, funds, banks and corporates as well as state and local governments to absorb upcoming supply unless T-bill prices cheapen materially from current levels. For this reason, we do expect some further pressure on deposit balances across the industry in the months ahead. As you would expect, we are optioning ourselves prudently given these uncertainties, but see these flows as benefiting our broader cash ecosystem. We manage over $1.3 trillion worth of cash on behalf of clients across deposits, money market funds, repos and securities lending. And we are the biggest provider of collateral services globally as well with about $6 trillion of triparty balances on our platform. This $7 trillion of relevance to money market flows allows us to retain a connection to the money when it moves around various short-term investment alternatives and allows us to help our clients find the right solutions for their investment needs. Let me conclude my comments on a reflective mode. As I've acknowledged before, strategy matters, but execution and culture matter even more. As we close the books on the second quarter, we are entering the back half of the year with good momentum and confidence in our ability to drive change by executing consistently and at pace. Over the past couple of years, we've been able to attract high-caliber talent to upgrade multiple important roles across the company. Our existing team, together with these new leaders, are rising to the challenge of unlocking our potential. And it's clear to me that we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us by leveraging our unique combination of businesses, our preeminent client franchise and the power of our culture and people. I'm encouraged by the initial progress over the past couple of quarters and excited about what lies ahead. With that, over to you, Dermot. Dermot McDonogh : Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Page 3 of the presentation with some additional details on our consolidated financial results in the second quarter. Total revenue of $4.5 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Net interest revenue was up 33% year-over-year primarily driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by changes in balance sheet size and mix. Fee revenue was down 2% driven by the sale of Alcentra in the fourth quarter, the mix of cumulative AUM net inflows and lower FX revenue on the back of lower volumes and volatility, partially offset by the abatement of money market fee waivers. Firm-wide AUC/A of $46.9 trillion increased by 9% year-over-year. This increase reflects the impact of higher market values, client inflows and net new business. Assets under management of $1.9 trillion decreased by 2% year-over-year. The impact of lower market values driven by a year-over-year decrease in the U.K. fixed income markets and the sale of Alcentra was partially offset by cumulative net inflows over the last year and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Investment and other revenue was $97 million. We continue to see strength in fixed income trading and positive seed capital results. Expenses were flat on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items. This was driven by higher investments and revenue-related expenses and the impact of inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings in the Alcentra divestiture. Provision for credit losses was $5 million in the quarter, reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast, resulting in higher reserves relating to commercial real estate, largely offset by reserve releases related to financial institutions. As Robin mentioned earlier, earnings per share were $1.30, up 26% year-over-year or up 20% excluding notable items. Pre-tax margin continued to improve to 30%. Our return on tangible common equity improved to 23%. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our regulatory capital ratios remained roughly unchanged. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.7%, down 14 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by an increase in average assets. Tier 1 capital increased slightly driven by capital generated through earnings net of capital returns through buybacks and dividends. The CET1 ratio was 11.1%, up 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter primarily reflecting higher CET1 capital. As we said on our earnings call in April, we tapered buybacks in the second quarter to maintain conservative buffers above our management targets being mindful of the uncertain environment. Overall, we returned 72% of earnings, including approximately $300 million of common dividends and approximately $450 million of buybacks in the second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned 119% of earnings. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 120%, an increase of 2 percentage points compared with the prior quarter. Our consolidated net stable funding ratio, which we are reporting publicly for the first time this quarter, was 136%, well in excess of the regulatory requirements. Moving on to net interest revenue and further details on the underlying balance sheet trends on Page 5, which I will describe in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $1.1 billion was down 2% quarter-over-quarter driven by deposit mix shift, partially offset by higher interest rates. Overall, deposit balances have remained elevated relative to our expectations as they increased 1% sequentially on an average basis. Interest-bearing deposits were up 5%. Noninterest-bearing deposits were down 11%, in line with our expectations. Average interest-earning assets increased by 4% quarter-over-quarter. Underneath that, cash and reverse repo was up 15%. Loan balances were flat. Our investment securities portfolio was down 5%. Turning to expenses on Page 6. Expenses for the quarter were flat year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items relating to litigation and severance. As I mentioned earlier, this reflects higher investments and revenue-related expenses and the impact of inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings and the Alcentra divestiture. To summarize, we continue pushing forward with our multiyear investments to increase the growth trajectory of the firm and transform our operating model for greater scalability over time. Importantly, we remain focused on driving positive operating leverage and delivering continued pre-tax margin expansion. As an example of the expense discipline that Robin mentioned, for the second quarter, we self funded the entirety of our incremental investment spend and importantly, are on course to do the same for the full year. Turning to our business segments, starting with Securities Services on Page 7. As I discuss the performance of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will comment on the investment services themes for each line of business described in our earnings press release and the financial supplement. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Fee revenue was down 2%. Within this, investment services fees were flat. FX revenue was down 20% on the back of lower volatility and volume. Net interest revenue was up 46%. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees were flat with healthy underlying growth from new and existing clients, offset by lower client transaction activity, reflecting the current market environment. Importantly, strength in attractive market segments continued. Despite an industry slowdown for private markets and hedge fund launches, we saw strong growth in our old [ph] servicing business. High single-digit growth, both ETF AUC/A and number of funds serviced continued. Within Issuer Services, investment service fees were up 3% driven by our Depository Receipts. Here, the impact of a large client corporate action in the current quarter was tempered by the absence of Russia-related client activity in the second quarter of last year. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 5%. Net interest revenue increased by 24%. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 4%. The increase reflects the abatement of money market fee waivers and higher fees on sweep balance, partially offset by lower transaction volumes, consistent with the decline in U.S. equity exchange volumes and the impact of lost business. The net new assets number was a negative $34 billion in the quarter, reflecting the deconversion of a regional bank client that was acquired in May. Excluding the impact of this ongoing deconversion, which we expect to weigh on our reported net new assets for several quarters, net new assets grew at a mid single-digit annualized growth rate. We remain confident in Pershing's underlying momentum and prospects. Importantly, our continued investments to enhance Pershing's core platform as well as the business' access to the strength and breadth of the whole company is being recognized by clients as a differentiator, especially in the current market environment. Also, as Robin mentioned earlier, Wove is off to an excellent start. In Treasury Services, investment services fees decreased by 2%, reflecting higher earnings credits for noninterest-bearing deposit balances and lower payment volumes, partially offset by continued momentum across payment and liquidity solutions. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 10% driven by U.S. government clearance volumes reflecting elevated volatility and U.S. treasury issuance following resolution of the debt ceiling. We also saw healthy growth in collateral management fees. As the largest truly global collateral manager, we continue to increase market connectivity by expanding our triparty platform to include new markets, trade types and collateral pools. Our average triparty collateral management balances increased by 16% year-over-year to $6 trillion. Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $813 million, down 10% year-over-year. Fee revenue was down 10%. Investment and other revenue was $12 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting seed capital gains, and net interest revenue declined 37% year-over-year. Assets under management of $1.9 trillion decreased by 2% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, this decrease largely reflects lower market values driven by the year-over-year decrease in U.K. fixed income markets and the Alcentra divestiture, partially offset by cumulative net inflows and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar. In the quarter, we saw $9 billion of net outflows from long-term products as clients continue to derisk and rebalance their portfolios. And despite competitive investment performance, we saw $9 billion of net outflows from cash. In Investment Management, revenue was down 9% year-over-year primarily reflecting the sale of Alcentra and the mix of cumulative net inflows, partially offset by improved seed capital results and lower money market fee waivers, while Wealth Management revenue decreased 10% driven by lower net interest revenue and changes in product mix. Client assets of $286 billion increased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 10 shows the results of the Other segment. I will close with a few comments on our current financial outlook for the second half of the year. Number one, our net interest revenue outlook for the full year '23 remains unchanged for 20% growth year-over-year. This is based on market-implied forward interest rates towards the end of the quarter. We are pleased with our net interest revenue trajectory and balance sheet management year-to-date, but mindful that we are operating in a very uncertain environment with continued rate volatility and higher for longer rate market backdrop and uncertainty surrounding meaningful U.S. treasury issuance in the coming months. Number two, we are ahead of plan when it comes to executing on our efficiency efforts. We remain focused on outperforming our target of 4% expense growth excluding notable items for the full year '23 and will work hard to drive this closer to 3% in the coming months. While we expect the operating environment to continue to weigh on fee growth relative to what we expected at the beginning of the year, our progress on the expense side continues to give us confidence in our ability to deliver positive operating leverage this year. Number three, we still expect to return 100% of our earnings or more to our shareholders over the full year while continuing to position ourselves conservatively with respect to our capital levels, considering the amount of operating uncertainty. In conclusion, I am pleased to report that the company continues to perform well against the backdrop of complex operating environment. And we continue to execute with a great sense of urgency against our growth and efficiency initiatives. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Dermot, I'd love to \u2026 Dermot McDonogh : Good morning, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Dermot, I would like to start with which you just touched on the unchanged NII outlook. Curious what you're seeing as far as deposit cost pressure, we've begun to see that emerge. There are peer firms of Bank of New York that have flagged some upward pressure in the back book. How is it that you are able to avoid these pressures and keep on your NII outlook that you had provided earlier? Dermot McDonogh : Thanks for the question, Brennan, and good morning, everyone. So I will accept the fact that the pressures are there, but I think the team is doing a great job managing both sides of the balance sheet in a very dynamic environment. So if we kind of look at the first half of the year, I think we are very pleased with where it's -- where we've come out in the first half of the year and feel we are on a very good footing for the back half of the year. In January, when we spoke to you, we kind of gave a guidance of 20%. And that was with a mid single-digit decline in deposits over the balance -- over the course of the year. If you reflect on the two quarters just behind us, we had elevated deposits in Q1 on the back of uncertainty around regional banks. We had elevated deposits in Q2 on debt ceiling, which really speaks to the strength of our balance sheet and the strength of our franchise and clients looking to use us in times of uncertainty. Now when you look to the back half of the year and our deposit -- average deposits in Q2 were around $277 billion, up 1% sequentially. And we do expect this growth to moderate in the back half of the year, and we do expect declines in our balances as a result of the treasury issuance, which I think is going to be announced in August in terms of what they're going to do between bills and coupon payments. And the interplay between QT, RRB [ph] and bank reserves is something that we're all watching carefully. So we do expect our balances to go down to mid to high single digits from here. But when we reflect back and do the bottoms-up, top down and talk to clients and see what's happening in the marketplace, we come back to the same places where we started at the beginning of the year in terms of our overall feel good about the guidance of 20%. And specifically to your point on deposit costs, look, our client base, unlike others, is largely institutional and our bases are in the mid to high 70s. We feel our book is kind of -- we passed on the rate rises to our clients over the last 1.5 years. So we feel pretty good about where the book is. We price competitively. Clients come to us not just for deposits. They come for a broad range of goods and services, and deposits are part of our overall product mix. So we feel very good about where the book is and where the cost is. Notwithstanding, there are pressures given the higher for longer rate environment and people looking to optimize their net interest income. So that's it. Brennan Hawken : That's very helpful. Thanks, Dermot. I appreciate that. And so switching gears a little bit on the fee revenue side. This was a pretty good outcome for you guys here this quarter. How should we be thinking about jumping off into the next quarter? Is there anywhere in particular where you would flag some adjustments that we should be making to the baseline? Or is this a fair way to think about it? Dermot McDonogh : So as it relates to fees, Brennan, look, I think when I look across the various businesses and the feedback that we are getting from clients and when I talk to our teams, our backlogs are good. We are winning our share -- our fair share of deals. I have to say the enthusiasm and the energy of the team when they came back from the Insight Conference having launched the Wove product gives us great optimism about the future and what we can do for our clients. So overall, I would say our backlog is good in a very uncertain environment. We are winning our share, and our yet to be installed book of business in Asset Servicing is healthy and strong. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. Thanks for that color. Operator : And our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for the question. Just a quick follow-up first maybe around the deposit discussion. So Dermot, if I hear you correctly, no kind of catch up from the back book that you expect to see in your deposit pricing for the rest of the year. But I guess if we look at the deposit beta over the course of this quarter, it looks like it was pretty close to 100% on a currency adjusted basis. Maybe help us break down the deposit cost in the U.S. and non-U.S. and maybe the type of -- what kind of deposit pressure and client conversations are you seeing in the kind of different regions. Dermot McDonogh : So on the catch up, Alex, I would say when we talked about this last quarter, we kind of said our Q1 results were kind of largely a little bit of the price lag there, which we feel is largely behind us, and that catch up has happened in Q2. So overall, I think we feel pretty good about the catch up. Mid to high -- cumulative basis are in the mid to high 70s for dollars. And look, it's reasonable to expect that they will continue to grind higher from here, but I would say no meaningful change. If you take the overall deposit book in total, it's largely a dollar-based book, 80% dollars and then 10% split between euros and sterling. And the betas for sterling and euros are roughly in the kind of 50% to 60% range. And then I'll just reiterate like the point, and I think it's a very important point. The deposit book is largely institutional, sophisticated clients. And we've really repriced our book quite efficiently over the last 1.5 years, and that's really the message I'd like to leave you with. Alex Blostein : Makes sense. Thank you. And then, Robin, a question for you, maybe a little bit more on the strategic side. When we look at the Investment Management business at BNY Mellon, there are some areas that one could maybe characterize as sort of subscale. The organic growth has been muted, and obviously, margins is something you guys as previously said need to sort of work on. So are there any strategic areas where you feel like you could address some of these issues by either divesting or adding scale to businesses that are subscale? So just kind of thinking more holistically about that business in the context of BNY Mellon. Robin Vince : Thanks for the question, Alex. Obviously, this is an area, a segment we spend a lot of time on. Just to remind you, we did a series of strategic reviews all across the company. Going back over the course of the past 9 months, we've looked at every function. We've looked at every business. And we did spend a particular amount of time digging in to our Investment and Wealth Management segment. Look, in terms of IM in particular, if you think about it as part of the IWM segment, 2 years ago, that whole segment was a 30% pre-tax margin segment. There's no reason to think we couldn't get back there over time. But there are a series of different things that we have set out to do ourselves. And so the execution of all of that is going to be really important. There's going to be a combination of improving top line, what you'd expect in terms of really focused on meeting client needs, strong investment performance, new products, et cetera, and also some of the desiloing and expense management that's really in there. But the thing I'm going to call out to you, which I really think of as the BNY Mellon superpower, and I think everyone needs to have a superpower these days in Investment Management is our distribution. And so that's a place where strategy for the whole company really meets strategy for Investment Management because if you step back from the way that we were organized, Investment Management was its own silo in the company and, frankly, a bit landlocked over there in its silo. But our distribution capabilities, $2.5 trillion worth of retail distribution as one example, but obviously, we have other distribution as well in the company on the institutional side, was separately landlocked over in a different corner of the company. So our plan here is really to lean in to what we think of as one of our superpowers, distribution, and then allow the business in this newly configured format to really be able to stretch its legs in this non-siloed format and then go from there. And we think that, that's a good path forward. Alex Blostein : Great. Thank you both. Robin Vince : Thank you. Operator : And we will take a question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Dermot McDonogh : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I know we talked a lot about deposits, but I did just want to drill down on how you're thinking about the life of the deposits. And is that at all changed versus history? And part of the reason for asking is just trying to understand if there's any impact on the securities portfolio as you put those -- that deposit flow to work. Thanks. Dermot McDonogh : When you say life of deposit, Betsy, do you mean like tenor and duration of the deposit that stays [ph]? Just to clarify the question. Betsy Graseck : Yes, how you -- what you are assuming the life of the deposit is because I'm expecting that drives how you're investing those deposits. Dermot McDonogh : Okay. So let me start like talking about the $277 billion of average balance sheet that we have. Important point number one, two-thirds of those deposits are operational or what we call sticky. Here at BNY Mellon, we don't classify between insured and uninsured. We call it sticky and non-sticky. So the vast majority of our deposits are with us because the clients are in our ecosystem for the long-term and need to have cash with us to execute their business. So that's why we think about it in that way. On the asset side of the balance sheet, like I would like to go back 18 months when we kind of made some strategic decisions about positioning for this rise in interest rates. We took a view in terms of how we wanted to set up the balance sheet with a rapid increase in interest rates. And so we've done a lot of work last year in terms of repositioning the portfolio in terms of higher for longer. 60% of our portfolio is in AFS, and a big part of that is 60% of the portfolio is also fixed. That has a weighted average maturity of about 4 years. So think of about rolling off a quarter every year. So if you take on the asset side, the amount of money that we have in cash plus the amount that's rolling off from fixed to floating, and the investment yield pickup of that is about 300 basis points. We feel when you look at both assets and liability together combined, we are really well-positioned over the next 12 to 18 months to manage through this rate environment. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And you would say that the deposits already reflect the rates that obviously have come through to date, right? Dermot McDonogh : Largely, yes, absolutely, which is why cumulative basis are in the mid to high 70s. And we expect them to grind a little bit higher from here. But we -- as I've said, we pay our clients a competitive rate, and they are sophisticated, and they know what they're doing. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Okay. And then just a separate question on op risk RWA. Next week, I guess, we are getting the Basel III and game rules. And just wondering -- I know we don't have the final rule, but I'm sure you've thought a lot about this or op risk RWA component that's being added to standardized. Maybe you can give us a sense as to how you're thinking through and how we should think through assessing your position when those rules come out next week. Thanks. Dermot McDonogh : So again, look, we've talked about this pretty much for the last 12 months. So just to kind of recap what we've said before, based on what we know, we expect operational risk RWAs to be in the standardized approach, and that will drive an increase in our standardized RWAs. Based on our internal analysis, we think that will have a smaller increase than what the QIS has shown in the past. And so we kind of feel like capital levels will be a little bit higher. But we feel we will have the ability to adapt and live with whatever the outcome is. But again, it's been delayed a couple of times. So I think for us, we are just waiting to see and we'll return it around quickly, and we'll communicate to you when we have something tangible to say. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Robin Vince : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : And our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning, Robin and good morning, Dermot. Robin Vince : Good morning, Steven. Steven Chubak : So wanted to dig into noninterest-bearing deposits. They're now firmly within your 20% to 25% guidance or target range. Your peers have offered more conservative guidance on NIB deposit trends. I know some of your businesses in your mix is pretty unique or idiosyncratic, but I wanted to just better understand what's driving the resiliency in NIB trends and your confidence level at that 20% to 25% range is still appropriate. Dermot McDonogh : Okay. Thanks for the question, Steven. Let me again go back to my last call when it was at 26%. And I guess everybody on the call was looking to see why weren't we guiding higher. And we kind of said history has told us that through the cycle and the trough, our history and our experience, and we have data going back 20 years, and we look at that, the history tells us we should be in the 20% zip code. So we've done a very much a bottoms up analysis looking at the history. Important point to make here is our mix of businesses today is a little bit more diversified than it was 20 years ago premerger 2007. We have a more diversified range of business, as you said. We have Corporate Trust, Treasury Services, Asset Servicing, Clearance and Collateral Management. And each of our clients in each of those business segments use us for different reasons, and deposits behave in a slightly different way within each of those businesses. And the mix between NIV in those businesses varies. And so that gives us a really good confidence level in terms of the diversified business nature that we have. So our internal analysis is kind of pretty solid. And then we look at what the industry is saying and what you analysts are writing about, and we kind of take that into accommodation, also what other people have guided and what our clients are telling us. And we take all of that together, and we kind of feel at the end of the day, consistent with what we've said in the last two quarters is 20% is the best we can give you in terms of through the cycle, which importantly then feeds into our NII guidance of 20% over the course of 12 months. So it's important to remember, it's a 12-month guidance as opposed to managing it quarter-to-quarter. Steven Chubak : That's really helpful. And just for my follow-up, encouraging to see the 30% margin for Securities Services this quarter. That said, the IWM margin remains subdued, running in the low teens year-to-date. I know, Robin, you had talked about distribution being a big focus, but what do you see as an achievable target versus that low teens level you're running at today? And how much of that margin improvement is contingent on the revenue opportunities like improved distribution versus efficiency gains? Robin Vince : Sure. So looking at the whole company, the Securities Services margin was 29%. We've given previously the guidance and the target around getting that to 30%. We are very pleased with the progress. But there's no question that we've had some sort of easier tailwinds in the form of rates, and we have to continue to get after this deliberate cost to serve. And so I just put that as a footnote on the Securities Services point. We are laser-focused on continuing to drive that margin higher. We're not complacent about this at all just because it happens to be approaching our original target. But look, on Investment Management, and this goes a little bit to the prior question, 2 years ago, this was a 30% pre-tax margin segment. So we look around the world, we look at what's happened, how has it come down the various quarters, some of which is obviously a little bit cyclical. And our conclusion is we don't see any reason why we couldn't get back there. But execution comes in a bunch of different pieces, as I touched on before, and we really have to get after that execution. And I think for me, this point about the superpower of distribution, remembering that we are a diversified set of businesses of BNY Mellon. And we've had these tremendous distribution capabilities, which we have really not put alongside this Investment Management manufacturing capability as well as we could have. And so that's a strategic change in the company. And as we pursue that strategic change, and it will take a little while, that, we think, is going to have some important opportunity. I'll also call out the expenses. I've talked to you before about the fact that one of the other problems with silos as well as not bringing all of our company to bear on problems is the fact that we have duplicate costs. And Investment Management is a great example of this. We have, in our Investment Management central team, additional expense that duplicates to the rest of the firm. And we can find better ways of bringing those capabilities together to actually execute better. So there's opportunity there as well. So collectively, we are going to pursue all of these things. It's going to take us a couple of years realistically to see all of the benefit of all of this work, but we feel reasonably optimistic about our path forward here. And of course, we're going to continue to report it, and we will keep you updated as we go on the journey. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great color. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello. How are you? So the FedNow platform has -- hi. So the FedNow platform has started for instant interbank payments. I'm assuming you're going to be playing a big role in this, but I'm curious what you think the expected impact for the industry and for BK is. Like these things are usually good for expenses, good for capital efficiency, but bad for revenue. But I'm just curious if you can tell us what you think. Robin Vince : Sure. So immediate payments, which is the umbrella I'll put both FedNow, which is the new service coming into production from the Fed, and also the clearinghouses' real-time payments rails that the whole immediate payments world does to us represent an interesting disruption opportunity in the ecosystem of payments because there hasn't been a ton of disruption over the course of the past sort of 20-or-so years. And so when these evolutions occur, we see that as an opportunity because we've been a bit underrepresented. Although we are the seventh largest U.S. dollar payments clearer, we feel a bit underrepresented in some parts of the flows of that ecosystem. So we've deliberately invested to be ready as a market-leading participant in the real-time immediate payments, let's call it, evolution. So yes, we think it's important. Yes, we think it's an opportunity. We were the first bank to do a test in the original rails. We've seen good traction. It's still early days. I think FedNow will be a bit of an accelerant to this because it creates more awareness of real-time payments, and it broadens out the overall sort of participation rate, I think. We've been very involved in them -- with them on this initiative. And we're trying to position our payments platform as rail-agnostic. And so clients of ours can come to us and say, \"Hey, BNY Mellon, I want to make a payment.\" They don't need to care about is it going to be FedNow or is it going to be the RTP rails? How do they want to migrate away from checks? How do they want to treat it -- a payment on the Fed wire versus ACH versus one of these new capabilities. And remember, we wrap them in new services, so the ability to offer real-time request for payment, bill pay capabilities, the ability to wrap additional fraud services in this whole thing, we think this will be quite an interesting evolution. And to your point about volumes versus price, one of the good things about being a disruptor when you don't have as big a share of some of the credit card flows and some of those other things, which admittedly have a higher price on them, we aren't. So we get the opportunity to bring this unconflicted approach and benefit from the upside, frankly, without sacrificing much on the other side. Glenn Schorr : Very interesting. Thank you for that. Separate but related, I think you guys have done a very good job of taking that 20% net interest income growth you expect this year, offsetting a couple of percent expense growth and bringing that operating leverage. I'm trying to think out loud. The mid to high single-digit expected deposit decline in the back half makes for a tougher full year '24. So even with good expense control, I guess my question is, how much do you need more of those -- get clients to do more with Bank of New York cross selling mentality to kick in to produce that operating leverage next year? Dermot McDonogh : So look, that's a kind of a crystal ball type question, Steven (sic) [ Glenn ]. So I think it's a bit too early for us to comment on '24. There are three parts to the question is like one, BNY Mellon client franchise, we go at it every single day with incredible intensity. We want clients to do more with us across different parts of the firm, and we are really working hard at that. The second point is expenses. Two quarters in, we are very pleased with where we are. We like the forward in terms of how we are executing and how the firm has set up to execute. I would remind you, like this time last year, we conducted a bottoms up exercise where we took 1,500 ideas across the company from all our team members around the world, put a bit of investment dollars behind it, digitization, automation and eliminating manual processes. And in the expenses flat quarter-over-quarter, you're beginning to see the dividends of that paying through. And importantly, in my prepared remarks, I said that we funded the entirety of our investment plan for the second quarter from efficiency, and we expect that to continue over the medium term. And then NII, we will just prepare as we go. And the outlook is uncertain, but we will manage through it. Robin Vince : Glenn, I'll add one thing to that, which is as you look across our strategy, we were very clear at the beginning of the year about what we wanted to achieve this year. We set out these three points of our outlook, our guidance for 2023. And of course, the year is always going to evolve a little differently than you imagine it will right at the beginning of the year. And we've certainly had a year like that this year, where we've had unexpected things happening in all quarters of financial markets. And so what we have done is we stuck very deliberately to our medium-term plan. And we've not allowed ourselves -- well, we manage every quarter, of course, deliberately every individual thing that we are doing every day, generating more fees, focused on NII, focused on expenses. What we are really doing is preparing our company for this medium and longer term journey of delivery and achieving our objectives. And so there are always going to be a little bit of pluses and minuses in the quarter. But we really think that, that sort of broader strategy is what we are about, just deliberately executing and bringing the culture to bear. So I hear you on the next couple of quarters, but I would just continually remind you and put you back to that guidance that Dermot mentioned about what we're trying to do this year. Glenn Schorr : I will leave there. Thanks. Operator : And we have a question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Dermot McDonogh : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Just had a follow-up, Dermot, on the NII side. So heard everything that you talked about. You've done a good job in terms of forecasting NII and depositor behavior. Give us a sense of if we don't get any rate cuts over the next 12 months, where does NII trough, given the repricing on the security side that you expect and assuming no big surprises on deposits relative to your current expectations. Just is there a natural trough to NII without -- before we bake into it any Fed moves? Dermot McDonogh : So look, the path of -- it's a difficult question. The path of interest rate matters, yes -- rate -- level of rates, timing. If you look at the last 8 months, the market, broadly speaking, hasn't got it right relative to Fed docs [ph] and has now come into line over the last several weeks. I think the two things that I'm looking at are -- it's pretty baked in that the Fed will hike in July. Then you have Jackson Hole. That's going to be a very important meeting. And then what happens in November because of its one hike every two meetings, between July and November is a long time, and there will be a lot of data in that period. And so if they pass on November, it's going to be very hard for them to restart again. So I think when we look at our balance sheet, we positioned it higher for longer. And that kind of has informed our guidance of 20% for this year. And the book over the next 12 months, 12 to 18 months, we are broadly neutral on the outcome for rates up a little bit or rates down a little bit, and that's kind of how we think about it. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess just one follow-up maybe, Robin, you made efficiency improvement a huge focus for the last year or two. And as we think about and without sort of asking for guidance into next year, as we think about these efficiency benefits to the bottom line, should we think about it in increments much like you achieved it this year? Or should we expect a larger move at some point as you had the time to assess operations and maybe we see something larger next year or so? Robin Vince : It's an important question, Ebrahim, and I'm going to frame it slightly differently to you, which is we are focused on things that are going to be relatively quick wins associated with cleaning things up that we thought were inefficient. And we've also laid out for ourselves a series of medium-term things and a series of long-term things. And so we have a variety of initiatives in each of those buckets. Of course, we've been executing on them in parallel, but you only see the benefits of some of the shorter-term things right now. So Dermot gave you the example of the ideas that our people generated, and we're going after those. And we said those were sort of a 3-year or so implementation to get after that. We talked about the fact that we did some work, some delayering in the organization at the end of last year into the beginning of this year, which has been quite helpful. That's also been a slightly shorter-term thing. At the same time, we are looking very deliberately and remembering that we are essentially a diversified financial services company because all of these different businesses that we have, and we have a lot of embedded platforms within that, platforms that have been operated in sort of non-platform ways as a result of our sort of slightly siloed past. So now we are getting after organizing those things a little bit differently. And as we organize that, there'll be some expense benefit from that. But also then having organized them in that way, we get to really deliberately go after the duplication of systems and processes that are inside the company. And that's also when we really get to go after the digitization. So it's harvesting a little bit for the short-term, focused on the things that we think make the company a well-run company, organizing ourselves to be able to structurally operate ourselves as we think of the company and then harvesting the benefit of that. So there's a 1-year story, a 2, 3, 4, 5-year story associated with doing all of those things. But as with everything, we have to execute it really well. And we want our people to come along with us on that journey because a lot of this is change of behavior from how people have worked in the past, which is why we have a strategy. We are laser focused on the execution, and culture really matters. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thanks for the color. Thank you. Operator : And we have a question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up, to your point about being able to beat that expense expectation for the year and in reaction to a little bit different outcome on the fees than initially expected, I just wonder if you could just talk to us about both sides of that. Number one, the beating on the expense side, is that doing anything incremental in terms of either the severance effects or delaying investments? Or is it just the core? And on the fee side, I'm just wondering if you can kind of catalog for us which businesses have underperformed a little bit? And do you have a better line of sight for a better rate of change for those going forward? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh : Okay. So I'll take that on the expense side. So like the guidance was 4%, okay? So -- and that's kind of down from 8% ex notables, ex currency, important point to kind of stress there. And so then it's like it really comes down to executing an operational excellence in everything that we do on all the points that Robin made. And I think the Executive Committee and the firm and the team coming together and seeing that it can be done in a different way and then executing on that. If you double-click into different businesses, and let's take the Market and Wealth Services segment for a second, that's a segment that has a mid-40% margin. We are growing that segment. We are investing in that segment. We are putting big budget dollars to work there, and that's evidenced by our launch of Wove. If you go to our Securities Services segment, that is about increasing our margin through the cycle to 30%. And within that, we are insanely focused on our cost to serve, automation, digitization, serving our clients in a more differentiated way that brings down our cost to serve. So it does mean different things to different businesses at different points in the cycle. Plus in the first instance, it's all about how we show up and how we execute. On the fees, I think generally, we feel very good about our backlog. We feel very good about the pipeline. We are winning our share of what the market has to offer, and our clients like what we have to offer. So on the forward, we feel we have excellent momentum, and we're executing well with our clients. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks a lot. Robin Vince : Thanks, Ken. Operator : And moving on to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But maybe just a follow-on on the ONE BNY Mellon initiative. Maybe on the revenue side of that, it sounds like, obviously, there's a lot of low-hanging fruit on the cost side that will run well over the next 1 to 2 years. But on the revenue side of that, I guess, how would you -- just in a comparison perspective relative to expenses, how would you cite the revenue potential for ONE BNY over the next couple of years? And if you can point to any one early example of cross-sell traction? Robin Vince : Sure. So let me -- Brian, I'm going to split this into two pieces. So one is specifically on ONE BNY Mellon, which we think of as increasing wallet share with our clients, being able to do more with existing clients, also attract new clients, of course, to the platform and sort of dealing with this issue that the median client at BNY Mellon is a consumer products from one of our businesses. So that started as an initiative. If I really look back to the very origin of it, it was almost a bit of a movement. So it was a heart to mind exercise around getting people focused on the fact that this was an opportunity. And that was a good way to start. We set ourselves targets for 2022. We exceeded them. We set ourselves targets for 2023. By the way, we've achieved 80% at the half year mark, 80% of our full year sales targets for that initiative, and at least 50% of our sales force has made at least one referral. So we feel good about the way that we started. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, actually kind of industrializing that, embedding it into the way that we actually run all of our sales and relationship management groups all across the company, that's the next critical phase of this. And so that's when it becomes part of sales targets and part of the way in which we assess people's performance. And we incentivize them, and we train them. And to enable that, we made an important new hire, and I mentioned Cathinka in my prepared remarks because we needed to put somebody and wrap that strategy deeply into how we actually operate the company. So that's the specific ONE BNY Mellon initiative. We feel very good that, that creates an underlying boost to whatever our growth would have been without that on the new business side. In addition to that, the point that I made earlier on about desiloing the company, that has -- we talked about that more through the lens of expenses. But actually, it has an equally important component in terms of growth. And so we are investing in growth in how we actually operate our existing businesses in addition to the new innovations that we've talked about like Pershing X and outsourced trading and others. And so I'll give you a few examples of that. Let me give you one good classic example, which is we are a large clearing firm. We are known for having that as one of our businesses, but we actually had two institutional clearing platforms at BNY Mellon, one embedded in our Clearance and Collateral Management business and one embedded in our Pershing business. Now remember, I'm talking about institutions here. So this isn't including the wealth piece in Pershing. And it didn't make any sense. Because we had multiple platforms, clients were confused. We did it in different ways. And so we've taken those two businesses, and we combined them. And now we have one institutional clearing business at BNY Mellon. We're in the process of executing that change right now. I can give you the same types of examples around the way that outsourced trading came into being, which was originally landlocked inside Investment Management. We took it out. We aligned it next to our markets business. We have another example of that with trading that we do for certain clients where we had multiple examples. So we have a long list of things where we were operating kind of independently. And part of our growth is by bringing those together, yes, we will get benefits in terms of efficiency, but we expect more client business from it, too. Brian Bedell : Yes. That's fantastic color. Maybe if I could just finish up on the deposit, one more on the deposit side for you, Dermot. You mentioned that your pricing is already very good. You're not seeing a great deal of pressure on deposit costs other than the grind higher that you cited. Within the Asset Servicing segment specifically, so the Asset Servicing part of Securities Services, are you seeing a different dynamic there whereby clients are looking to either shift out of NIBs or look for better deposit pricing? And then in those contracts that you have, servicing contracts that you have, do you have provisions for embedding sort of a level of revenue type of outcome depending on whether they pay VFC or compensating balance? Dermot McDonogh : So, look, I think you're trying to do a read across. So I think it's not really appropriate for me to kind of get into the detail on any specific business because we aggregate up to the firm, and we give you a firm view. So I wouldn't say -- I'm not seeing anything within Asset Servicing as it relates to the mix of IBs and NIBs that would cause me to think there's been an outlier change quarter-over-quarter or something that's unusual and out of line with what we expected at the beginning of the year. Brian Bedell : Fair enough. Thank you. Dermot McDonogh : Thanks, Brian. Operator : And we have a question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Dermot \u2026 Dermot McDonogh : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : \u2026 earlier Robin pointed out that, obviously, there's going to be a lot of treasury issuance in the second half of the year. Could you guys quantify the benefit or the monetary benefit that you'll see from this type of issuance because you're the primary clearer of treasuries, of course. Is there any way of quantifying that for us? Robin Vince : Well, I'll take that actually, Gerard. So look, when you look across all of our businesses, we recognize that growth comes in lots of different forms, and our clients growing their wallet share with us. We can have market appreciation. We can have transaction balances, the total addressable market can go -- there are different ways in which we see opportunity. And in the treasury market, given the role that we play in the treasury market, at the end of the day, more treasuries is a benefit for us because there are more treasuries that get traded in the market. There are more treasury that need to get funded in the market. There are more treasuries that get issued in the market. So there's a broader set of benefits there. And you've seen that as we've reported some of our results in Clearance and Collateral Management, which obviously has been a growing business. Now that business isn't only about treasury. It's also about international clearance. It's about global triparty outside of the U.S. So I don't want you to zero in and only think about that being driven by treasuries. But clearly, treasuries is a market we serve. And so when there are more of them and more activity, we regard that on average as good. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. I appreciate that. And then, Dermot, you were talking about the balance sheet and how the portfolios, the securities portfolios are positioned going forward. Firstly, if we're in a higher for longer rate environment, what if we get surprised sometime in the spring of '24, and the Fed starts cutting rates? How quickly can you reposition the portfolio for that, or would you need to do that? Can you give us some color on the opposite of what everybody expects today of higher for longer? Dermot McDonogh : So, the kind of the quick answer is a large part of our portfolio is cash, so reprices very quickly up or down. So we kind of think of our balance sheet as broadly neutral. So if they cut by 25 basis points or 50 basis points, we are okay. I think also our CIO has taken a couple of a little bit of protection on NII for '24 in terms of locking some of the gains in. So I would say, again, to the question a little while ago, we are broadly neutral up or down over the next 12 to 18 months. Gerard Cassidy : And then just if we were to move into this lower rate environment, because your deposit banners are so high so far year to -- from the beginning to where we are today, I would assume you would be able to cut rates pretty quickly -- deposit rates pretty quickly? Dermot McDonogh : Symmetrical. 100% accurate. Yes. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Super. Dermot McDonogh : [Multiple speakers] way down, it [indiscernible] all the way up, yes. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : And we have a question from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Rob Wildhack : Good morning, guys. I wanted to go back to the theme of fees versus expenses and drill down a little bit into Securities Services and the margin in there. I mean, what portion of the margin improvement you're aiming for do you think will come from sheer expense discipline? And then what portion do you think comes from all the fee opportunities that you're speaking to? Dermot McDonogh : So I'm not too sure I would like to give guidance at that granular level of detail. But what I would say is Emily and Roman are intensely focused on delivering a better cost-to-serve model than what we've done in the past. And we want to give clients a better experience with respect to automation, digitization and how we deliver our products to them. And so that is an intent focus of the team. Also, we feel we have -- we are the world's largest custodian. We are #1 in a lot of different things in the Securities Services space. And so we like our hands. We are winning our share. As I said earlier, our backlog is very strong, and we have a good medium-term opportunity set in front us that we are looking to win and execute on. Our yet to be installed book of business is very healthy. So I think we're going after the two legs with equal intensity, and both will deliver that margin of 30% through the cycle, very important. This quarter we had a nice healthy pickup from the rate back up. But as Robin has said in an answer to another question, we are just not relying on that. We know we have a lot of work to do, and we are getting about it. Rob Wildhack : Thanks, Dermot. And then just one more on Pershing. Excluding the deconversion, performed pretty well again in terms of net new assets. Can you speak to some of the drivers there, remind us what the revenue impact is and how you're thinking about the pipeline for that business specifically? Dermot McDonogh : So I don't want to do revenue outlook based on the deconversion because I don't think it's right to talk about any single particular client. But what I would say ex the deconversion over the quarter, we had like 4% growth. Pershing is a business that's grown really well over the last number of years. We are very competitive. We are #1, top 3 in different things. And so I would say the feedback from our conference in Florida Insight, where we launched Wove, was really, really good. And Robin spoke about this at length in terms of the appetite about Wove. So we kind of think over the next several quarters, we like the business momentum. We have a lot of stuff in the pipeline. I think come October, we are going to have a couple of deals that we are going to be able to talk to you about that are quite exciting and will make you feel pretty good. Rob Wildhack : Okay. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Rajiv Bhatia : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just on that Pershing business, can you remind us how much of your revenue is from RIA [ph] custody side? And then can you talk about what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint? Goldman Sachs seems to be expanding in this area. Envestnet has partnered with FNZ. SEI has also made some moves here. So curious how you see the competitive landscape evolving? Robin Vince : Sure, Rajiv. Look, we don't split out the RIA versus the broker dealer. As you know, we are #1 in broker dealer, and we are in the top 3 in RIA. So we are clearly a market leader. It's interesting the names that you picked because none of them are in the top 3 on either of those measures. So having said that, we are obviously not complacent about newer entrants into the market or other people who want to sort of get into this. This is a business that we've been in for a long time. We understand it, and we have scale. I'm just going to repoint you to the $2.3 trillion of assets on that platform that we think is -- it gives us a tremendous starting point with clients and then the innovation that we've got in it. So we've gone multi-custody, which is very important in that business. We are innovating -- a lot of our services traditionally have been focused on the investor, but now we are delivering to the adviser as well with the Wove platform. We've innovated into direct indexing capabilities, financial planning capabilities, tax-aware investing capabilities. We are deploying BNY Mellon advisers and the capabilities from Investment Management because we have a $1.9 trillion investment manager. We have existing technology from our Wealth Management franchise, which is market-leading. And we are adopting a ONE BNY Mellon mindset to that. So we are taking that technology and delivering it through Wove to other adviser clients. So we've got this whole breadth to how we are actually approaching this opportunity. And while we, of course, welcome the competition from some of these other folks, I don't think any of them can deliver that breadth of capability to our clients. And so for advisers and investors, we feel very good about our direction of travel in this business. Rajiv Bhatia : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin with any additional or closing remarks. Robin Vince : Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your interest in BNY Mellon. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day. Thank you.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Marius Merz : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. As always, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. I'm joined by Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. Robin will start with introductory remarks before Dermot take you through the earnings presentation. Following their remarks, there will be a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 17, 2023, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin. Robin Vince : Thanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Before we get to the earnings call I'd like to address the horrific terrorist attack on Israel and the ongoing conflict in the surrounding region. We're heartbroken as we continue to witness a human tragedy unfold. And I'm immensely grateful and proud of our employees in Israel who despite everything that they have been going through continue to deliver uninterrupted service to our clients. Our hearts go out to colleagues, clients, and community members in the region. Now I'll share some brief comments about our financial results for the third quarter and we'll then give a quick overview of some of our strategic priorities. BNY Mellon delivered solid financial performance and continued progress on the steady transformation of our company. As you can see on Slide 2 of the financial highlights presentation, we reported earnings per share of $1.22 versus $0.39 in the third quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, which primarily impacted last year's results, EPS of $1.27 increased by 5% year-over-year. We generated a return on tangible common equity of 20% on $4.4 billion of revenue, up 2% year-over-year and a pre-tax margin of 29% in the third quarter. These results once again highlight the efficacy of our prudent and proactive asset and liability management amid a rapidly evolving operating environment. Net interest revenue was up 10% year-over-year, as we continued to maximize the positive aspects of rising interest rates. Our strong liquidity position allowed us to reduce our wholesale funding footprint. And despite the significant steepening of the curve, unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio remained well contained. Our 20% return on tangible common equity, together with all of these actions, allowed us to continue to deliver attractive capital returns to our shareholders, while further strengthening our capital and liquidity ratios to be prepared for a wide range of macroeconomic outcomes. As I've just rounded out the first 12 months in my seat. I'd like to take a step back for a moment and reflect on our work to date and where we're headed. Through a series of strategic reviews, we have affirmed what we believe to be our key assets. Number one, our client reach and breadth of engagement. Our top tier clients from all regions of the world both trust and want to do more business with us. Number two, our collection of market leading businesses. We're a broad based financial services company with a balance and diversification that makes us stronger and our unique business mix sets us apart from our competitors. And number three, our culture of teamwork. Our people are naturally collegial and seek out opportunities to work together to serve our clients and communities. These assets are hard to replicate and it's rare that they exist together. But as I have acknowledged before, the company's long-term financial performance track record hasn't lived up to the quality of this franchise. As a result, we've committed to drive higher underlying growth, consistently deliver positive operating leverage, and improve our pre-tax margin over time. As an important mark of clarity and focus to help tie together where we are heading and why, we recently communicated three strategic pillars to our employees around the world. One, be more for our clients. Two, run our company better. And three, power our culture. These three pillars are not fundamentally changing the businesses we're in. Instead, they drive at how we operate and who we are day to day for our clients. As I've said before, strategy is important, but ultimately just a set of words. Actually doing it and how we do it matters a lot. While this was just one quarter in what will be a multi-year transformation, I'm optimistic about the steady improvements we are seeing inside of BNY Mellon, and I want to share with you some of this perspective that gives us confidence that we're on the right track with the work that we are doing under each of these pillars. First, I'm encouraged by the pace of progress toward making BNY Mellon a better run company. Our businesses have historically operated largely in silos. We've run somewhat like a corporate conglomerate with a holding company that owns a series of vertically self-sufficient subsidiaries. This has led to clunky client journeys, wasteful duplication, and a lack of joined-up thinking. We have many opportunities to run our company better and more efficiently, to reduce bureaucracy, and we need to be smart and disciplined with how we spend so our investments in the business go further. I've talked to you before about our efficiency initiative comprising about 1,500 ideas developed by those who often see items ripe for improvement most clearly and closely, our people. This program, internally we call it project catalyst, is well underway, and we started to see some early benefits in our financial results. As you may recall, in January, we set out to essentially half our expense growth rate this year to roughly 4% growth excluding notable items compared to roughly 8% ex-currency in 2022. We have made good progress against this goal. With less than three months left in the year, we are confident that we will outperform our 4% expense growth target for 2023, all while self-funding over $0.5 billion of incremental investments this year. As we've started the budgeting process for 2024, we are determined to bend the cost curve further. We're now working to adopt a platform's operating model, which will help us to do things in one place, do them well, and elevate overall execution. And we're embracing new technologies so we can be more productive, more efficient, and focus on growth. Automation of processes and investment in operations digitization and AI across the firm will make it easier for our employees to do their jobs and subsequently channel their energies toward new innovations. Which brings me to our work toward being more for our clients. Our financial results in the quarter tell a tale of two cities. Against the backdrop of seasonally slower summer months, we once again saw outperformance in some of our differentiating businesses. Strengthening clearance and collateral management continued, and we saw healthy underlying growth in Pershing, as well as solid momentum in asset servicing. This was offset by continued softness in investment management fees and lower foreign exchange revenue given the subdued market backdrop. Our path to higher underlying growth is clear. In addition to always being on the hunt for new clients, we have to deliver more to our existing clients, develop new products, and do a better job at connecting the adjacent ones. Our new Chief Commercial Officer has hit the ground running as we start operationalizing one BNY Mellon across the organization to sharpen our commercial focus and elevate the client experience across the firm. At the same time, we're pushing forward with innovative new client solutions that leverage the adjacencies among our businesses. While still early days, initial client wins with our recently launched solutions as well as the quality of our pipelines are encouraging. PershingX's new open architecture wealth management platform, Wove, is off to a promising start, including a couple of client agreements already signed, several prospective clients in active contracting, and a steadily growing pipeline. As an example, Integrity, a nationwide insurance and financial services firm with a network of over half a million agents and advisors has selected our Wove platform to support their wealth management business. With Wove, we are also connecting solutions from across BNY Mellon. For example, Integrity will have access to third party models and institutional grade solutions from our specialist firms in investment management and broker dealer clearing and custody solutions through Pershing. In another example, Pershing expanded their long-standing relationship with Lincoln Investment as the company transitioned their self-clearing business onto Pershing's custodial platform and selected Wove to provide a suite of technology solutions to its financial professionals. As we onboard additional clients through the remainder of 2023. We are planning to start disclosing relevant financial information and leading indicators for you all to keep track of Wove's growth trajectory at the beginning of next year. We also signed the first external client, a leading GSIB-owned European Asset Manager, for our recently launched buy-side trading solutions. Without a doubt, we expect our more prominent solutions, like Wove and buy-side trading, to move the needle on growth over time. But we are leaning into innovation to solve evolving client challenges across all of our businesses. For example, in Treasury Services, we were one of the first banks to go live on FedNow, the Federal Reserve's new instant payment rail. This allows us to expand our capabilities for corporations, non-bank financial institutions, and fintechs, and as a service provider, we are helping our financial institutions clients access instant payments, remain competitive, and provide best-in-class service for their customers. As another example, this quarter the business announced the launch of [Bankify] (ph), an open banking payment solution that as an alternative to credit or debit cards and third-party payment platforms helps organizations receive consumer payments from bank accounts with a seamless user experience and guaranteed settlement. Let me conclude by saying that we are optimistic about the opportunity in front of us and our strategic objectives for the short, medium, and long term are clear. We are innovating and pushing forward on our multi-year growth investments, all the while remaining disciplined to deliver positive operating leverage and pre-tax margin expansion. As I've said all along, the path to transforming BNY Mellon into a consistently high-performing company will take some time, but for 2023, we are on track to deliver what we said we deliver at the beginning of the year, while making steady progress toward our strategic priorities. I'm proud and appreciative of our people's dedication to be more for our clients, run our company better, and power our culture, collectively to unlock BNY Mellon's potential. With that, over to you, Dermot. Dermot McDonogh : Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. I will start on Page 3 of the presentation with our consolidated financial results for the third quarter. Total revenue of $4.4 billion was up 2% year-over-year. Net interest revenue was up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by changes in balance sheet size and mix. Fee revenue was flat. Growth on the back of higher market values, net new business, and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar was offset by the Alcentra divestiture in the fourth quarter last year, lower foreign exchange revenue and the mix of AUM flows. Firm-wide assets under custody/administration of $45.7 trillion were up 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, client inflows, the weaker dollar, and net new business. Assets under management of $1.8 trillion were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting the weaker dollar and higher market values, partially offset by the Alcentra divestiture. Investment and other revenue was $113 million in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in fixed income trading. Expenses were down 16% year-over-year on a reported basis, primarily reflecting the goodwill impairment associated with our investment management reporting unit in the third quarter last year. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 3% year-over-year. Provision for credit losses remained low at $3 million in the quarter, as the impact of reserve bills to reflect continued uncertainty on the outlook for commercial real estate was largely offset by reserve releases related to financial institutions. As Robin noted earlier, reported earnings per share were $1.22. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.27, representing 5% growth year-over-year. We delivered positive operating leverage. Our pre-tax margin was 29% and we generated a return on tangible common equity of 20%. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Consistent with the prior quarter, we returned $450 million of capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and we paid approximately $330 million of dividends to our common stockholders, reflecting our previously announced 14% dividend increase, which became effective in the third quarter. Taken together, we returned 82% of earnings to shareholders in the quarter, or 107% on a year-to-date basis. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio improved sequentially by approximately 40 basis points to 6.1% reflecting a decrease in average assets and an increase in Tier 1 capital driven by capital generated through earnings, net of capital returns through buybacks and dividends. Unrealized losses related to available for sale securities remained roughly unchanged in the quarter. The CET1 ratio was 11.4%, representing an approximately 30 basis points improvement compared with the prior quarter, reflecting lower risk weighted assets and an increase in CET1 capital. Just like our regulatory capital ratios, our liquidity ratios further strengthened in the quarter. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 121%, a 1 percentage point improvement compared with the prior quarter. And our consolidated net stable funding ratio was 136%, well in excess of the regulatory requirement. Next, on Page 5, net interest revenue and further details on the underlying balance sheet trends, which I will describe in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $1 billion was down 8% quarter-over-quarter, driven by changes in balance sheet size and mix, partially offset by higher interest rates. As we expected, temporary deposits related to the debt ceiling impasse in the second quarter left in July and along with seasonally low balances in August, average deposits for the quarter decreased by 5% sequentially. In line with our expectations interest-bearing deposits were down 3% and non-interest bearing deposits were down 16%. You will remember from prior earnings calls that we expected non-interest bearing deposits to moderate to approximately 20% of total deposits in the second half of this year, which is consistent with our deposit mix in the third quarter. Following seasonal troughs in August, we saw the anticipated pickup in monthly average balances in September, and again, some modest growth in the first two weeks of October. Average interest earning assets were down by 6% quarter-over-quarter. This reflects a reduction in cash and reverse repo by 11%, while we actively reduced wholesale funding. Our investment securities portfolio was down 4% and loan balances were up 1%. Moving to expenses on Page 6. Expenses for the quarter were down 16% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 3% excluding notable items. This year-over-year increase was driven by higher investment and revenue related expenses, the unfavourable impact of the weaker dollar as well as inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings and the Alcentra divestiture. I'll talk more about our outlook for expenses in a moment, but as Robin mentioned earlier, it is worth highlighting that for 2023, we are expecting to fully self-fund over $0.5 billion of incremental investments through efficiency savings. Turning to our business segments, starting with security services on Page 7. As I discuss the performance of our Security Services and Market and Wealth Service segments, I will comment on the investment services fees for each line of business described in our earnings press release and the financial supplement. Security services reported total revenue of $2.1 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Fee revenue was flat. 2% growth in investment services fees was offset by a 19% decline in foreign exchange revenue on the back of lower volatility and volumes. Net interest revenue was up 12%. In asset servicing, investment services fees were up 3%, driven by higher market values, healthy net new business, and a weaker dollar, partially offset by lower client transaction activity. The strength of our balance sheet, as well as the stability, breadth, and depth of our solutions remain clear differentiators that position us well with clients, confronted with a persistently challenging market environment and an evolving competitive landscape. For example, ETFs, Assets Under Custody/Administration, were up over 20% year-over-year and the number of funds serviced on our platform continued to grow at a healthy clip. In all, assets under custody/administration and related investment services fees, both grew in the mid-single digit percentage range despite the number of fund launches having slowed significantly over the past year. With Issuer Services, investment services fees were down 2%. Growth from net new business and corporate trust was more than offset by the absence of fees from elevated depository receipt cancellation activity in the third quarter of last year. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.4 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 5%, and net interest revenue increased by 6%. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 2%, reflecting higher fees on sweep balances, partially upset by the impact of lost business and lower transaction volumes consistent with the decline in US equity exchange volumes. Despite the continued headwind from the ongoing deconversion of the regional bank client highlighted in the second quarter, Pershing saw $23 billion of net new assets on the platform this quarter, reflecting positive momentum in the underlying business. As Robin mentioned earlier, the momentum around Wove is building with both new and existing clients. While at the same time, ongoing investments in the core Pershing platform to enhance advisor experience and lead with innovative solutions have positioned us well to capitalize on the heightened pace of change in the RIA community. In Treasury services, investment services fees decreased by 1% as growth from higher client activity was offset by higher earnings credits for non-interest bearing deposit balances. In clearance and collateral management, investment services fees were up 16%, reflecting broad base growth across US and international clearance and collateral management. In particular, we saw strength in domestic clearance volumes reflecting elevated volatility and US treasury issuance activity and continued migration from the Fed's reverse repo facility to traditional tri-party collateral management balances. Recent macro trends, including heightened volatility, uncertainty associated with monetary policy and banks regulatory capsule requirements, as well as the recent consolidation in the banking sector, further reinforce the value of our tri-party collateral management service. In addition to expanding our platform both in the U.S. and internationally, we continue to innovate new solutions for our clients to better utilize their collateral. Turning to investment and wealth management on Page 9. Investment and wealth management reported total revenue of $827 million, down 4% year-over-year. Fee revenue was down 2%, and net interest revenue declined 33% year-over-year. Assets under management of $1.8 trillion increased by 3% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, this increase reflects the weaker dollar and higher market values, partially offset by the Alcentra divestiture. In the quarter, we saw $15 billion of net outflows from long-term strategies driven by client de-risking and rebalancing, and $7 billion of net inflows into short-term strategies led by our [DRIFAS] (ph) money market fund complex. In investment management, revenue was down 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the Alcentra divestiture and the mix of AUM flows, partially offset by higher performance fees, as well as the impact of higher market values and the weaker dollar. In our wealth management business, revenue decreased by 5%, driven by lower net interest revenue and changes in product mix, partially offset by higher market values. Client assets of $292 billion increased by 14% year-over-year, reflecting higher equity market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 10 shows the results of the other segments. I will close with our current outlook for the rest of the year. Based on market implied forward interest rates at the end of last month, our net interest revenue outlook for the full year 2023 remains unchanged for 20% growth year-over-year. Moving to expenses. We are making good progress on bending the cost curve by protecting our important investments to accelerate growth and deliver superior client experiences. Where we sit today, I am confident that we will outperform the target of 4% expense growth, excluding notable items that we communicated in January, and we remain determined to drive that growth rate down to 3% for the full year 2023. This reflects our expectation for a sequential step up in expenses, excluding notable items in the fourth quarter, with seasonally higher business development expenses, as well as discrete increases for professional services and occupancy. And finally, we expect continued stock buybacks at a pace consistent with the second and third quarter. This is inline with our full year outlook to return 100% of earnings or more to shareholders over the course of 2023, while maintaining our strong capital ratios, mindful of the significant uncertainties relating to the operating environment. In conclusion, our financial results this quarter highlight the effectiveness of our balance sheet management and tangible progress on our journey towards higher operational efficiency and scalability. While we have more work to do, our teams around the world are embracing change and our pace of bringing innovative new client solutions to the market gives us confidence that revenue growth will follow over time. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolf Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. Robin Vince : Good morning, Steven. Steven Chubak : I wanted to start off with a question on the NII outlook. I was hoping you could just give some thoughts on the deposit trajectory if rates are higher for longer and the Fed continues to engage in QT? And given we're at that 20% lower bound for NIBs, where do you expect that to ultimately settle out as a percentage of deposits? Dermot McDonogh : Sure, Steven, I'll take that, and good morning. So I guess the way I'd like to answer the question is just to kind of start with January, where we kind of gave the guidance to the market of 20% NII growth for the year and we've been consistent with that on the call since then. And we reconfirmed that guidance today for 20% for the full year. Now, the world has kind of played a different hand to us over the course of the year since January. We had the bank turmoil in March and we had the debt ceiling impasse over the summer. And clients used us as the porch in a storm during that time and we kind of saw surges in deposits and so that benefited us. Now over the course of the summer we see those deposits leave and we feel we've reached an inflection point of puts and takes between the natural organic flow versus our kind of surge deposits leaving. So we feel the pace of decline has slowed. We feel like we hit the trough in August and we've seen modest pickup in deposits in September and into October. So overall, that and when you take the asset side of the balance sheet and how liquid we are on the asset side and how that's rolling down, you might want to know that as the balance sheet continues to roll down, we have a yield pickup of 200 basis points to 300 basis points, which kind of gives us a lot of confidence in our estimate for the year and outlook into 2024. As it relates to NIBs, we always said that it was going to be 25% to 20% through the cycle. The trough happened during the summer months and has stayed in the 20% zip code. So we feel overall pretty good about NIBs as a percentage of total deposits being in the 20% range. Steven Chubak : Very helpful. And just for my follow-up on the expense outlook, you've spoken about the commitment to improve operating margins. You've cited a number of efforts, Robin, to deliver efficiencies across the platform. As we look out to next year, given a lower NII exit rate relative to the first half for you and for some of your industry peers, I want to get a sense of how much flexibility is embedded in your expense plans and your ability to drive expenses lower potentially in a more challenging revenue backdrop. Dermot McDonogh : Steven, I'll start. So, look, we've said on every call this year that bending the cost curve is a very important strategic objective for the firm. And we're attacking structural expenses in a number of different ways. And that's just continuous execution, day in, day out, blocking and tackling. The result of all that blocking and tackling has caused us to outperform the 4% guidance that we gave in January. And we're determined to push that number closer to 3%. But we don't believe the work is over this year and we're now in the middle of budget season and we are determined to bend the cost curve into next year and to continue to deliver that positive operating leverage. And we kind of go at it in a number of different ways, rationalizing vendors, rationalizing locations, remixing our kind of headcount on how we hire. This year was our biggest campus class ever, double last year, and we continue to build on that. So there are a lot of things happening underneath the hood that give us a high degree of confidence that we'll be able to continue to bend the cost curve into 2024 and beyond. Steven Chubak : Very helpful, Dermot. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Just maybe following up on the discussion around deposits. I think Dermot, you used the word trough multiple times. Just give us a sense of it. Obviously, you called it right this year in terms of how things have played out. But just give us a sense of, is it about the mix or the granularity of your deposits or the client behavior that you've seen that gives you confidence that this 20% of what you saw in August was a trough? And if we are in a period through next year where there are no rate cuts, it's higher for longer, like, where does the negative surprise come from, if any? Dermot McDonogh : Thanks for the question. So, look, this has been a journey for the last 15 months. We took a view at the beginning of last year that the Fed was going to hike quite significantly and we positioned the balance sheet in a way to do that. And so, when we kind of talk about deposit, I think it's very important to look at both sides of the balance sheet at the same time in terms of how we're positioned on the asset side. We have a lot of the balance sheet in cash which benefits from the higher interest rates. Our fixed rate securities are going to roll down over the next, a decent amount of the fixed securities, I think it's a quarter a year rolled down over the next couple of years. And that gets us a pick-up of 200 basis points to 300 basis points. And at the beginning of the year, we did forecast a kind of mid-single digit decline in deposits. And that kind of bottoms up analysis. And also, it's important to remember that clients of BNY Mellon are not just with us for deposits. They come into our ecosystem. And just remember, it's a $1.3 trillion cash ecosystem that we have and they come in for a variety of different reasons. It's a portfolio of businesses that give us our deposit makeup. So when we look at it at a portfolio level we get a lot of confidence around the stability of the deposit base. And look, there were a lot of gives and takes this year through the bank turmoil in March and the debt ceiling impasse which benefited us and that's kind of moderated and those deposits have left for higher yielding opportunities. But we feel like the summer slowdown, the seasonal slowdown that we experienced in August and the conversations that we have and talking to our deposit team, we feel very good about where we are on the deposit balance now and the pickup that's happened in September and October. And that kind of gives us the confidence to say here today that 20% NII is a good number, which I think should be good for you guys to know that we've been consistent in our approach over the whole year. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. Thank you. And I guess maybe if I heard you correctly, I think you mentioned $0.5 billion of investments are self-funded. That's about 4% of your expense base. Is that $0.5 billion -- I'm just wondering the relevance of that number, is that something that we should think about as a go forward sort of incremental investment spend that you need to self-fund to efficiencies as we from the outside try to figure out what expense growth could look like next year? Just if you could contextualize that $0.5 billion in investments and what that means going forward? Dermot McDonogh : So the way I kind of think about that and the message that I would like to give you is, it gives a message of discipline, in that we've halved the growth rate, we're going towards 3% and within that 3% growth we've had the financial discipline to be able to self-fund a $0.5 billion of investments that we are confident that will deliver further efficiency in years ahead and revenue opportunities. So it's both kind of powering the top line and automating and driving further efficiency. And we look to continue to do that into the budget season this year and next year. And like this year, we doubled the efficiency saves that we have typically achieved in past years. And that's both bottoms up. I think we both mentioned it in our prepared remarks, the catalyst project that we were roughly 40% the way through and we're doing real work day in day out that is driving that expense growth down and is kind of delivering opportunities for us that we will harvest in the quarters to come. Robin Vince : Ebrahim, I'd add just a couple of things to that. One, we've been very deliberate about not cutting our way to glory, but rather working the problem at a pretty fundamental level so that we can both manage our expenses for the necessary operating leverage, which we want to achieve, but also sowing the seeds for future efficiencies and future fee growth. And so, that's really the way in which we're thinking about it. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you both. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please Go ahead. Kenneth Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just one more follow-up. So, yes, it's great to see the 20% for the year reiterated, and obviously, as discussed, that implies a lower fourth quarter exit. But I want to more importantly understand the moving parts from there, and at what point can you see that stability going forward in terms of some of the things on the front book side helping versus where deposit costs could continue to go up? Just trying to understand if we're at a stable DDAs, can you see a path early next year to get that NII point stable? And just let me start there. Dermot McDonogh : So I don't really want to give guidance for next year today, Ken. We will do that in January. I got a lot of questions about that at Barclays as well. So I kind of feel good about the 20%. I feel good about the deposit pipeline that we have. We've talked on previous earning calls about our strategic pivot a couple of years ago where we centralized all our deposit businesses in one area. And so I feel very good about how we're managing the deposits, how we're pricing the deposits. You know, we're a little bit different to other institutions in that. We have -- our clients are sophisticated. So, cumulative betas are not materially changed from last quarter, they're in the 80% zip code and we've passed on the rates. So, I think it's important to note that there's no material pricing lag to catch up here. And so, we kind of feel the absolute level of deposits is pretty good. We feel very good about our outlook for the rest of the year, but look the world is very uncertain and who knows what comes tomorrow and for 2024 like we'll give you more detailed guidance in January, but I feel pretty good about where we are today. Robin Vince : Yeah, and Ken, I'll just add to that, just to draw your attention to really emphasize two things. Number one is, when we started off the year when we gave the guidance of 20% for NII growth over the course of the year. Clearly the year has turned out differently, but I think the power of the Global Equities Solutions team that we've put together has really been able to prove our ability to be agile in this space, sort of a little bit irrespective of the environment. I don't want to be complacent with that comment because clearly the world can change, but we saw a lot of things over the course of the first three quarters of the year. I think the team's done a very good job adapting to those and maintaining the consistency. And you'll remember Dermot\u2019s comments earlier in the year, which, is we thought NIB's were hanging in a little higher than we would have expected them to be and we've always expected them essentially to come down to this level. It just happened a little later than we thought, but obviously we've been fine with that. And then the second comment is, remembering the inputs in terms of the diversification. Dermot said it earlier, but it really is critical to our deposits franchise. We've got the issuer services business with corporate trust, which drives on one set of inputs to their deposit algorithm. We've got a clearing and collateral management business, which has a different set of drivers. We've got our treasury services business, which has yet a different set of drivers. And of course, we have our asset servicing business as well. So that breadth and diversification just creates for different outcomes and I think you've seen that over the course of this year. So we're not sitting here today giving guidance for next year, but the fourth quarter NII is probably a pretty decent place to start as you think about the world. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Got it. Thank you. And just one question on Pershing, it's great to see the wave start and the good commentary you have about the momentum. Just wondering, we know that there was going to be a client deconversion coming out of that as well. Did we see that in the third quarter result or is that still a pending yet to happen? Dermot McDonogh : We expect that to happen over several quarters, Ken. I think the important point, so it happened over both quarters. I think the second quarter was a little bit more than the third quarter, but we do expect that to work its way through over the next several quarters. I think the important point I'd leave you with on Pershing, in addition to the Wove developments, is the fact that we added $23 billion of net new assets in the quarter, and the underlying strength of the business and our ability to provide solutions to our clients in that space is really, really terrific to see. Kenneth Usdin : Yes, and that's what I'm hoping for that you can offset that with the organic growth. That's what I'm getting at. Dermot McDonogh : Yeah, we believe we have the confidence to earn our way out of that over the next several quarters. Kenneth Usdin : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I think you guys have been pushing for stronger fee growth, and that's a slog, but in the meantime, you're certainly bending the calls curve, as you say. I guess, Robin, to your opening comment about a conglomerate with a bunch of silos and breaking those down, certainly is a key to growing revenues faster. How can you actually implement horizontal integration among these disparate businesses and by breaking down those silos. Like, do you have any proof points or evidence now, or is this more like a three to five year plan? Robin Vince : Sure, Mike. So look, this approach of de-siloing the company is clearly one of our critical pillars. And we put that under the heading of run the company better in terms of our internal conversations. And so, there are many things that we're doing. We're really looking at what is it that we do across the company where we have like capabilities. So we have some examples of that on the business side. A recent example is, we had institutional clearing and settlement that we actually did in our Pershing business, but we also have an institutional clearing product in our clearance and collateral management business. So we've moved the piece from Pershing into our clearance and collateral management business, so now it's all together. And I could give you five other examples that are just like that of us rearranging pieces on the business front end inside the company to be able to be more joined up in terms of how we approach clients. And so that is essentially truly making sure that we have consistent client-facing platforms in terms of how we're doing business. Then on the supporting side of the organization, and if you think about our company a little bit like a platforms business, we have all these world-leading platforms, the largest security lending company in the world, the largest collateral manager, the largest asset servicing custodian with AUC, etc, etc. What we hadn't done is adapted the way we run the company to actually look like that. So we've decided to adopt this more platforms like operating model where we're taking things that we in terms of the support that we provide for our businesses and reducing that duplication. So I'll give you an example on the call center side, we used to have seven call centers, those seven call centers were each essentially providing a service to their respective businesses. Now we're moving at the beginning but moving towards a single consistent contact center that can provide the service to all seven of those businesses and frankly do it in a better, cheaper way which is providing more capability to our clients. Even note the difference in the word call center versus contact center, because there's a client benefit associated with that. So look, we're at the beginning of this thing, but we think a platform's operating model is very fit for purpose for our company, and it should really simplify how we work, improve the client experience, and employ our employees. And we've got other proof points. We talked about deposits. Dermot was describing the better outcomes that we think we've had as a result of implementing global liquidity solutions. That is a consistent deposit approach across the company. We've got KYC as an example as well. We used to do KYC in each of our businesses. We're bringing that together to have a KYC platform. So there are a lot of proof points that we've got in various stages of development here in addition to the actual pilots that we did, specifically for a platform's operating model. Mike Mayo : So when you add it all together you said next year you expect to have positive operating leverage, is that in aggregate or positive fee operating leverage and how can you have such confidence at this stage? Robin Vince : So look we're committed to positive operating leverage over time. And I don't want my second year as CEO to be one where we have negative operating leverage. So we are focused on positive operating leverage next year. That's aggregate operating leverage to answer your question. And one of the reasons why we have confidence in that is because we've been investing on both the revenue side and on the expense side in the short, medium and long-term perspective. Dermot just went through a few things that we've done specifically for 2023, but the platform's conversation and the answer I just gave to you, that's an investment in medium and long-term efficiencies. And we haven't seen any of the benefit of that really yet. And the same thing's true on the revenue side. Some of the shorter term things that we've done are the enthusiasm around one BNY Mellon, the referrals that we've had across the business, we've talked about that in prior quarters, but now we're moving to the medium and longer term benefits which are really getting the benefit of our Chief Commercial Officer and her approach to operationalizing one BNY Mellon, that's a more medium-term opportunity. And then long-term, really harnessing the benefits of these product investments that we've made with things like Wove and buy-side trading. So we've been seeding on the revenue side and the expense side, short, medium, and long term, as we try to manage for this operating leverage over time. Mike Mayo : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Maybe shift gears a little bit. I was hoping to spend a minute on capital. Nice to see the capital ratios build over the course of the quarter. So I guess as you're thinking on the buyback on the forward basis, given that it's been a little bit lighter over the last couple of quarters, how are you thinking about that over the next 12 months? And maybe just a reminder, in terms of how much capital do you expect to accrete back to your capital ratios from securities maturing over the next, call it, six quarters or so? Dermot McDonogh : So I'll take that one, Alex. Good morning. So I would say for the next quarter, no really change in the buyback. It's going to be consistent with the last couple of quarters. Going back to one of the three things that we said in January, buybacks was one of those and we committed to buying back 100% more of earnings, or returning 100% more of earnings to our shareholders over the course of the year, and we're on track to do that. I would say, as we look out on the world today, it's very different to where it was in January. You still have the kind of huge volatility in the rate environment. Like it was 100 basis points in Q3. The geopolitics are very uncertain at the moment. So -- and then last but not least, you've kind of got Basel 3 and advocacy and what's going to happen there. So there are a lot of things to be worried about. And at this stage, we'd rather be on the cautious end of things and see no real need to change our stance on buybacks in the short term. As it relates to your specific question, we have about $2.3 billion of unrealized losses in our AFS portfolio and we expect about a half of that to come back into capital over the next over the next 12 months. So from where we sit here today we continue to build capital, we feel very good about our capital position ratios are healthy, liquidity is healthy and at the right time we'd communicate a change in stance on that, but for now, steady as she goes. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks for that. And then there's one business that I was hoping to kind of double-click into, which is clearance and collateral management. We've seen really good growth there for the last several quarters now. I think it's up 11% year to date versus last year. Can you maybe help us unpack some of the sources of that growth between sort of what's been really market and maybe somewhat elevated volumes given everything that's been going on in treasuries versus more kind of baseline growth in those businesses, we're sort of thinking about the building off of this baseline. Thanks. Robin Vince : So look, CCM, Clearance and Collaborative Management, very big business for us. I would say a couple of things. A lot of volatility in the market this year, significant volumes, lots of treasury issuance. All of that is kind of helps that business. I think we continue to innovate as well internationally. And so, we spend a lot of time on the road with clients overseas because of our strength in the US, we feel that we have a lot of value to add in the international space. And so, we kind of look to build our international business from here. I think in the medium term we kind of still see that business continuing to grow given the level of treasury issuance and what's happening in the market. So we kind of feel good about the underlying growth. Also a lot of people might think of it as a kind of steady eddy type business, but I have to say the amount of innovation that we do under the hood in terms of serving our clients' needs with new solutions and how they can optimize their respective balance sheets and fund it on our platform is very, very pleasing to see. So we feel very good about the state of the business and the trajectory from here. Alex Blostein : Thanks very much. Robin Vince : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'd love to start on Pershing. I\u2019m curious if you could maybe give a little color on what drove the strength in Pershing revenues. I know you flagged higher fees on sweep balances, but we're seeing other wealth management firms flagging headwinds there. So, curious about whether or not you can provide some color on that and what's driving the resilience for Pershing? And then, I know that it's going to be several quarters before we see the decommissioning that you referenced. Any sense you can give for size of that headwind that we should expect? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh : So on the last question first, we don't really give specific guidance on the deconversions, but as I said on an earlier question, we feel the underlying strength of the business, you're always going to take your lumps and things that happened that you wouldn't expect to happen. And we feel we have the ability and the confidence and the people and the strategy and the products to earn our way out of that. So Pershing is a very strong business for us. It's in our most profitable segment, markets and wealth solutions, and we feel very good about the margin of that segment and of Pershing in particular. Just kind of double-clicking on your original question, there are many things that make up the fees that are coming into Pershing. They're transactional, which is kind of correlated to U.S. Exchange volumes, asset-based, based on equity market levels, and balance-based. And so, again, when you take the kind of portfolio approach that we have with our business and the different composition of the fees and then the amount of clients that were onboarding that kind of -- that leads you to a nice good fee outcome for the business overall. And so, look, Pershing is market leading, we're number one with broker dealers, we're very important to the RIA community, we have a lot of excitement in the marketplace around our Wove product. And so we have -- that's attracting new clients to our system as well as existing clients who are excited about that product. And that gives us belief that by adding to our existing platform new products, we'll be able to be a more meaningful player than we are today. Robin Vince : And Brennan, I'll just add one thing. You used the term underlying momentum, I think, and it's very true in the business. If we had been on this call maybe a year ago, someone would probably have asked me, did I think that we could compete with the self-clearing changes that were going? I remember we had these conversations about the puts and takes of the various different flows in the market. Whereas this quarter, we announced Lincoln, who was self-clearing, joining our platform, because they just see the benefits of the economies of scale that we can provide, the capabilities that we have. And then, of course, with an eye to Wove and the opportunity to be able to really provide that advisor set of solutions in the same way as the classic Pershing platform provides the investor set of solutions. So we feel quite good about the feedback that we're getting. And remember as well that we have this relatively unconflicted business model in terms of the fact that we're not running our own large RIA sales force next to our business and we think that some of our clients really appreciate that. Brennan Hawken : Yep. That's all very helpful color. Thank you for that. And then I'd like to ask a follow-up question on the noninterest bearing. So you flagged that there was some growth quarter to date. Is it possible to quantify or give us a rough idea about what kind of growth we'd be talking about? And are you also seeing corresponding growth in the overall deposit base along with the trend in the NIBs? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh : So I think I used the words modest in my prepared remarks for September off the seasonal lows and I also used the word inflection point with the puts and takes between the level of activity as a result of March and the debt ceiling impasse. We kind of feel we've kind of reached a more natural level for deposits. And if you kind of go back to the remarks in January, we kind of went -- decline in the deposit base of kind of mid-single digits from where we were at the beginning of the year. And so, that's really largely how it's played out with albeit a different zigzag to what we thought was going to be at the beginning of the year. And look, the important thing to walk away from the call with is, we feel confident with the outlook and the guidance that we're given today of 20%. And that's made up of a ton of different factors, both on the deposit side and on the repricing on the asset side. So we kind of think of the two as very joined up and interlinked and don't really want to get into specific numbers, but we feel pretty good about where we're at. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And are those trends applying to both the broad deposit base as well as the NIBs? Just... Dermot McDonogh : Yes, I think it's fair to say that. Yes. Brennan Hawken : Great. Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Rob Wildhack : Good morning, guys. I appreciate the update on the strategic priorities. I'm curious on the do more for clients front, how is the progress you've made and are making there manifested itself so far? Are you seeing an uptick in organic growth, new business wins, anything like that? And then the obvious follow on from there is, when do you think that we could expect to see that progress manifest itself and whether it's fee revenue growth or operating leverage more broadly? Thanks. Robin Vince : Yes, it's an important question, Rob. So the way that we have laid out be more for our clients internally is in a few different threads. So the first is delivering more to existing clients and you've heard from us before on this, so many of our clients have a single business relationship with us, a single product, single solution. And so we just have the opportunity, frankly, to have them be able to do more things with us by connecting the dots and offering more to our current clients. I'll give you a stylized example. So if you're an asset servicing client today, you probably do some securities lending with us. You may or may not do some foreign exchange with us. If you do those two products with us, why wouldn't you do some margin segregation with us? If you do margin segregation with us, you're in our collateral ecosystem, why wouldn't you do more collateral management with us? If you're in that ecosystem, you're starting to touch the cash ecosystem, and so why wouldn't you also be open to some of the cash liquidity related solutions we have? And if you're touching that, you're adjacent to Treasury Services, and so why wouldn't you also be interested in some of our treasury services products. And so that's exactly. The fact that we haven't done that is the ultimate manifestation of the problem with silos for a company like ours, because our businesses are pretty adjacent to each other. So that is a very important focus. It is the top priority of our new Chief Commercial Officer to really drive the operationalization of making all of that a reality as opposed to just a sort of an internal call to action in the company. The second thread is developing new products and connecting adjacent products so that, different than the first example, so that two things which are inextricably related to each other could potentially be sold as a solution. If you look elsewhere in the technology industry, there are often multiple pieces of software that are bundled into one aggregate solution which is actually what clients buy. We haven't done as much of that because our products have been strewn across the company in their respective silos. So being able to look more horizontally, we get to be able to gather up the products and think about the world a little bit more along the lines of solutions. And you've seen us do that with some of our asset servicing clients more recently, where we've done these bigger, more bundled deals, and there are more opportunities for that. And then the third opportunity is to just win more market share and brand new clients. Now to be fair, we do know a lot of the clients that are out there in the world, 90% plus of Fortune 100 companies, 97% of global banks. So that's not the biggest opportunity of all of them, but we want to be in the hunting business as well. And so we'll go find those clients that we don't currently do business with and actually engage them as well. So there are a lot of threads under that whole umbrella of being more for clients. Rob Wildhack : Thank you. Robin Vince : Thanks Rob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, Robin. Hi, Dermot. Robin, can you expand upon your comments about FedNow? You touched on it, you were one of the early adopters who were in the test phase and just implications are once this goes live throughout the system. Robin Vince : So immediate payments are one of those disruption opportunities that don't come along that often in the overall ecosystem. And you have to remember that the US is actually less advanced in some respects in terms of the speed and the efficiency of payments versus some other large countries around the world. And so, we look at this as saying, well, we have a large installed client base that's pretty rooted in some of the classic payment methods. We are a large check clearer, we're a large payments provider. And we also have a pretty un-conflicted approach because we're not really in the credit card business which creates a little bit of fee disruption risk if you are in that business to embracing instant payments. And so, we identified this some years ago that this would be an opportunity that we would want to participate more in and that's exactly what we've been doing. So we've been live on the clearinghouse rails for a while. We're now live on the FedNow service. Those are essentially competitor instant payment services to each other. But now we are going to be focused, as I think the rest of the industry will be, on the network effect that's going to be required to really adopt these instant payment rails. And so, we're a provider to small and mid-sized banks, helping them to access the rails. We think there are a bunch of things that you can do with these new rails that you couldn't do with some of the old rails. Request for payment is a great example. The opportunity to really deliver e-billing, instant requests for payments that can be met with instant, perfectly timed payments. There's a lot of control there. There's also some security opportunities. Who wants to give their bank account and ABA number out and their credit card number out when you're dealing with various billing-based solutions. And so, operationalizing all of that with our clients is important. We just launched Bankify, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that allows consumers to be able to use these rails a little bit more efficiently. And so, look, it's early days in this disruption, and I don't want to call exactly how and when it's going to occur, but we feel over time, this is a good new technology, and as we do see more network effect, and these use cases start to go live, it provides a lot of client value. And so at the end of the day, I think that client value is going to win out and we want to help them to do that. Gerard Cassidy : Great, and then Dermot, you touched on with deposits, the challenges the banking system faced earlier in this year and Bank of New York was looked at as a safe haven in some people's minds and your deposits have reflected that as you pointed out. Can you share with us if QT stays with the Fed through the end of next year, what kind of impact are you guys thinking that that could have on deposits throughout 2024? Thank you. Dermot McDonogh : So I think it's a bit too early for me, Gerard, to kind of give you guidance for 2024 on that. But like I said earlier, we kind of feel we've reached a more kind of normalized level given what happened in March and then the debt ceiling and who kind of knows what's going to happen from here. But our balance sheet is positioned for higher, for longer. We have a lot of the balance sheet in cash. Our fixed income securities are going to roll off a quarter a year over the next few years, and the pick-up and yield from that is about 200 basis points to 300 basis points. So when we look at the balance sheet together, we kind of feel very good about our NII for the next while. January will be when we give you more detailed guidance for how we think about it for 2024, but our deposit base and how our clients are in the ecosystem. And look, if they're not with us for deposits, we want them to be in our DRIFAS money market fund complex and be kind of using our products and services. So we don't want to lose the cash, we can put the cash into other products. So I think we feel very good about where the deposit franchise is now. We feel very good about the pipeline of activity that's coming our way, but who knows? And we are prepared and risk managed to a higher for longer continued QT, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Robin Vince : And Gerard, I just add one point to that, when it comes to the rates markets, we've avoided trying to have a crystal ball on exactly what it is going to happen. We said we think resilience is a commercial attribute for us. You highlighted the benefit of that resilience that we saw earlier on in the year as clients really came to us as a safe refuge and obviously we're very happy to help them with that. But that also means that we have views about what might happen. We have views about how we position our balance sheet, but ultimately we are positioning to be able to deal with any of these eventualities. I was sat on a trading desk for the first 10 years of my career, and the current level of 10-year rate is kind of at the bottom end of the range over that period of time. So there's absolutely no reason why the curve can't move further from here. It's moved 100 basis points since mid-July at the 10-year point. And so, we are positioning ourselves to be able to be adaptable to however the world is going to unfold. And Dermott commented on that when it came to our capital ratios earlier on. Now there are some things that are played out exactly as we thought, other things that are played out a little differently. I think the Treasury has done a very good job in coordinating with the Fed as they have ramped up the issuance of bills in particular, and that has worked very gracefully with the roll down of essentially $1 trillion at this point of the RRP. So the interplay between reserves, between RRP, between the very high levels of issuance coming out of the treasury. These are all significant inputs, and our data shows us that there's actually been less foreign buying in the treasury market over the course of this year. And so there's going to be a supply and demand dynamic that's going to occur further out the curve, which I don't think anybody can predict, but you certainly have to be ready for the different ways that can play out. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Let me just add a nuance on the net interest revenue by segment. So just the security services versus the market and wealth segment, it looked like there was more pressure on the security service business, NII, versus the second quarter. I was wondering if that is more of the low in NIBs that you referenced, Dermot, in August, and if you think that might just normalize as we move into the fourth quarter. And I guess, and/or are you doing things internally in terms of the growth initiatives that you just talked about, Rob, in a couple answers ago that might accelerate the NIA in that segment much more rapidly over time? Robin Vince : So let me deal with the first question. So I would say there is nothing really noticeable underneath the hood that is nuanced, that is different by different segments. Like if you think about asset servicing, our issuer services as a segment made up of three businesses, asset servicing, depository receipts, and corporate trust. Corporate trust as a business tends to attract a higher level of NIBs due to the nature of that business. Q3 would have been a seasonally quieter period for that business. Debt issuance activity was more muted. So that would explain a little bit of that. And asset servicing, let's just say how clients are behaving with us at the moment in the ecosystem, but I wouldn't really call anything out that is kind of noticeably different. And we kind of think about our deposits as one platform, kind of centrally managed under one roof, and that's how we kind of manage it. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. And then just maybe just to follow up on the, actually in the other investment and other revenue, there's one area there that's been growing quite nicely sequentially for now three straight quarters, that's the other trading revenue line and the size of that is now -- if it continue with this type of growth the next two or three quarters you'll be approaching your FX trading revenues. Just wonder if you talk about the drivers of that and whether you see that type of growth path continuing. Dermot McDonogh : So look, the key feature of that business this quarter as it has been all of this year really has been the strength of our fixed income trading. You do have a little bit of fee capital gains in there as well, but it's predominantly the fixed income trading. So we feel very good about it in the overall kind of scheme of the quarter and the results. It's a small number in the big scheme of things, but we like what we have there. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Robin Vince : Thanks Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks so much. I know we've touched on this throughout the question, so you can be brief, but I want to put it in a different package. So not lost on you, we've seen a lesser ability to predict or control client behaviors from some of the peers when it comes to all things deposits. And so, I don't know if there's a way to give it the attribution, but is there -- is it all related to your business mix and client base? Do you think your consolidated deposit efforts have actually moved the needle? Just trying to get inside your confidence relative to what we've seen elsewhere. And I don't know how much of that is depletion of non-operating balances anyway, so now you know most of what\u2019s left is operating. So thanks a lot. Sorry for repetitive. Dermot McDonogh : So, I will give you two dimensions to that answer, Glenn. One is, we have a portfolio of businesses that attract both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. Corporate Trusts, Treasury Services, Asset Servicing, Clearance and Collateral management being the primary ones. They all have different characteristics about them and they do things in slightly different ways so it kind of gives you a portfolio effect so that you feel like you have a diversified deposit platform. I think that's important point number one. Important point number two is, how we manage and price the deposits. If you came to BNY Mellon three years ago, you would have all of those deposits in different lines of business. They would have all handled their clients separately, they would have all priced their deposits separately, and you would have ended up with suboptimal outcomes when you aggregate that up from the BNY Mellon\u2019s standpoint. Now we've got global liquidity solutions, it's one team, interfaces with each of the line of the businesses, but we price consistently, we manage consistently, and we have a pipeline that we think of as one firm. I think you add all that together, you get the one BNY Mellon effect, you get the strategy effect, and you get the line of business effect. And that gives us confidence that we have a good handle on our deposit franchise and where we want to be from here. Glenn Schorr : Thank you, that was the bow I was looking for. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Rajiv Bhatia : Great. Good morning. So just following up on the deposit conversations. I mean, by my calculations, your deposit data rose quite a bit in the quarter. I guess, can you comment on what your US dollar versus non-US dollar deposit data were in the quarter? And then how do your deposit data differ across your lines of businesses, such as asset servicing, issuers servicing, purchasing, and payments? Dermot McDonogh : So thanks for the question. I guess 75% of our book is dollars, roughly 10% euro, roughly 10% sterling, and the rest other. As it relates to betas, I kind of think about it in cumulative beta terms. The cumulative beta of our dollar book is around 80%, which I think I said earlier, and that hasn't materially changed quarter-over-quarter. Sterling and Euros are about 50%, 60% respectively, give or take a little bit. And so, we kind of feel as it relates to passing on the pricing, the clients that we have are sophisticated, largely passed on the prices as they come through. And it may grind a little bit higher from here, but overall we feel pretty good about where the book is, where it's priced. You may see some modest catch-ups and lags here or there, but overall we think it's where it should be given what's happened in the market. Rajiv Bhatia : Great. And then like your deposit beta is by like lines of business? Dermot McDonogh : I don't have that level of detail with me, so we can follow up with you offline. Rajiv Bhatia : Alright, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Just a question. You guys have had a lot of success in improving the organic growth and things like pursuing collateral management. But investment management has been sort of left out of that discussion. Long-term flows outside of liability management have been negative last year. So do you see an organic growth opportunity there? Are you investing in that business and how do you improve that organic growth from here? Robin Vince : Thanks for the question, Jim. Look, we said on a couple of calls ago that, where the margin of that business is at the moment, we feel we have work to do, we're not happy with it. There are a bunch of things that have happened last year that are feeding into this year that have caused a kind of remixing by our clients out of active strategies into passive, which are lower fee paying, out of equities into fixed income. So there's rebalancing going on under the hood and we're kind of attacking it in a number of different ways. One being kind of getting after structural expense inefficiencies, and we've talked a lot about that today, and this segment is no different to that, so we're attacking it there. We're rolling out new products, and that's going to take time to build AUM, but do that in a first-class way. We kind of think organic growth will come on the back of that. Inside of BNY Mellon, we have a very kind of powerful distribution platform, So we're very focused on kind of really energizing the distribution platform to support our kind of boutique asset managers. And we've made some leadership changes there this year, and we're going to begin to see the fruits of that in the coming quarters. So we're kind of going after it in a number of different ways. And some of the asset management boutiques are performing very well and we're very happy with them and some of them have work to do and we're very focused on it and we're not sitting idle wishing it to happen. We're active in trying to make it happen. James Mitchell : All right. That's it for me. Thanks. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just as a follow-up, you've been giving a lot of optimism. I know you have to execute, but you said you're paying the cost curve. NII should do pretty well with the way you're positioning for rates. You're investing for growth. You're shooting for positive operating leverage next year, so it all sounds pretty good. When you think about the risk to the company over the next year, what are the main risks that come to mind that you think you need to pay a little extra attention to whether it's macro or micro? Robin Vince : So I'll just start Mike with the way that you set up the initial part of the question. You're right, we are optimistic about the potential that we have in the company and the opportunities that our franchise and our businesses afford us. Now we haven't lived up to that potential, but the reason why you detect the optimism, I think, in the way that we talk about it is because we do have an inherent optimism that this is absolutely a doable proposition to unlock that potential. Now It's a ton of work as Dermot just said in answer to a different question, we're not going to wish our way there and maybe that's one of the things that we've really doubled down on now as a leadership team is that, we have to work the problem and we have to work the problem through all of these different angles in order to really be able to unlock the potential. And as I said in my prepared remarks, there's a cultural change that we need to creating the company to take what is otherwise been a great culture but take it to the next level, power it forward the really allows us to de-silo and operate more broadly across the board and you and I just talked about that a few minutes ago. We have to execute to get it done so of course that it follows from that really evolving the culture to de-silo and to move toward this platform mindset and getting things done in execution are critical to us unlocking our potential, then the biggest risks in the company in some respects from an internal point of view become not doing those things. So we are laser focused on doing those things, tracking those things, and as a leadership team really coming together to make sure that we're holding each other to account for the respective parts that everybody in the leadership team of the company plays in moving that forward. So that's the reason for the optimism, but also the reason for the constant humility associated with the fact that it's execution that's going to get the job done. Now in terms of the outside world, there's clearly a ton going on in the world. We've got geopolitical tensions through a continuum all the way to war in many regions of the world right now. We have all of the uncertainties still of rates and inflation in the economy here in the U.S. that creates uncertainties. There's the ever-present cyber risk, which we always take very seriously, and those things are always collectively on our minds. We don't pretend to predict exactly how things are going to occur. We try to prepare for them as best we possibly can, recognizing that that's what our clients need from us as we help them to adapt to this environment and that we manage through it. So that's sort of the way that I think about both the internal and external answer to your question. Mike Mayo : Okay, thank you. Robin Vince : Thank you, Mike. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin with any additional or closing remarks. Robin Vince : Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for your interest in BNY Mellon today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day.",

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or re-broadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon\u2019s, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Marius Merz : Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here with Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. As always, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. And I'll note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the investor relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 16, 2024, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin. Robin Vince : Thanks Marius, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Dermot will talk you through the financials in a moment, but in summary, BNY Mellon is off to an encouraging start for the year. The firm delivered solid financial performance, while we continued to take important steps in the deliberate transformation of our company. And we're seeing early signs of progress that give us confidence, as we work toward the opportunity ahead. Looking beyond BNY Mellon, the first three months of the year provided a mostly constructive operating environment with global markets signaling expectations for continued growth. Equity and credit markets rallied, even as rate cut expectations partially unwound and bond yields rose. Foreign exchange markets, on the other hand, saw a continuation of the relatively low volumes and muted volatility that we've now seen for the past several quarters. And of course, there are many tail risks, including a variety of different market scenarios, the possibility of escalation in one of the ongoing geopolitical conflicts or an unexpected result in the many elections taking place worldwide this year. As I've said many times before, being resilient matters and this represents a commercial strength for our business. We are constantly preparing and positioning for a wide range of potential scenarios to support our clients and deliver compelling outcomes for our shareholders. Now referring to page two of the financial highlights\u2019 presentation. BNY Mellon delivered double-digit EPS growth as well as pre-tax margin and ROTCE expansion on the back of positive operating leverage in the first quarter. We reported earnings per share of $1.25 up 11% year-over-year, and excluding notable items, earnings per share of $1.29 were up 14%. Total revenue of $4.5 billion was up 3% year-over-year. That included 8% growth in investment services fees, led by strength in asset servicing, issuer services, and clearance and collateral management, which more than offset revenue headwinds from muted volatility in FX markets and lower net interest income. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 2% year-over-year and up 1% excluding notable items. Consistent with our goal to generate at least some operating leverage this year, in the first quarter, we did deliver positive operating leverage, both on a reported basis and excluding notable items. Our reported pre-tax margin was 29% or 30% excluding notable items, and we generated a 21% return on tangible common equity. Our balance sheet remains strong with capital and liquidity ratios in-line with our management targets and deposit balances were up both year-over-year and sequentially. Year-to-date, we returned close to 140% of earnings to common shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and our Board of Directors has authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program. On our last earnings call in January, we communicated medium-term financial targets and presented our plan to improve BNY Mellon's financial performance. We framed this work for our people through three strategic pillars. Be more for our clients, run our company better, and power our culture. Throughout the first quarter, we've made progress to be more for our clients, including both product innovation and greater intensity around better delivering our platforms to the market so we can truly help clients achieve their ambitions. As a global financial services company, our unique portfolio of market-leading and complementary businesses presents a tremendous additional value for our clients and shareholders. As you know, we are maturing our ONE BNY Mellon initiative by implementing this mentality into the nuts and bolts processes across the company. For example, we recently announced that Ashton Thomas Securities, an independent broker dealer and registered investment advisor, will use clearing and custody services from Pershing and BNY Mellon precision direct indexing capabilities from investment management. This is a great example of multiple lines of business working together to provide holistic solutions for clients. As we continue to grow our client roster, we also know that delivering more to our existing clients represents a significant opportunity. As another example, last month we expanded on a long-standing relationship with CIFC, an alternative credit specialist and existing client of ours in asset servicing and corporate trust to bring their US direct lending strategy onto our global distribution platform. This also speaks to the incremental value that asset servicing can bring to our asset manager clients, by allowing them to tap into BNY Mellon's global distribution platform to extend the reach of their capabilities. Consistent with our previously communicated intention to grow the revenue contribution of our market and wealth services segment, we're starting to see our investments to accelerate revenue growth in this high margin segment begin to bear fruit. For example, we continue to be encouraged by the level of interest from both new and existing clients in our Wove, Wealth Advisory Platform. We have several clients live on the platform today. We closed a number of deals in the first quarter, and the sales pipeline continues to be strong. Across market and wealth services, we also continue to bring new solutions to the market. For example, Treasury Services successfully launched virtual account-based solutions, a set of cash management solutions to meet our clients' demands for more flexibility and transparency into their payment flows. Next, we are taking important steps to run our company better by simplifying processes, powering our platforms, and embracing new technologies. Over the past several months, we've been working to realign several similar products and services across our lines of business. The largest of these changes was moving institutional solutions from Pershing to our Clearance and Collateral Management business. This is also part of making progress toward adopting a platform's operating model. By uniting related capabilities, we can do things in one place, do them well, and elevate overall execution to better serve our clients and drive growth. Last month, we went live with the first step on the transition into our new model. While it has taken and will continue to take a lot of hard work as we transform our operating model over time. We are confident this new way of working will create better outcomes for our clients and it will also create more efficiency and enhanced risk management. Around 15% of our people around the world are now working in our new operating model, allowing them to feel more connected to what we're doing and empowered to make change. I'd like to thank our teams who are part of this exciting change for pushing us forward as we mark this important milestone. We also see meaningful opportunity over the coming years from continued digitization and re-engineering initiatives, as well as from embracing new technologies. To support this effort, we are making deliberate investments, enabling us to scale AI technologies across the organization through our enterprise AI hub. Last month, Nvidia announced that BNY Mellon became the first major bank to deploy a DGX SuperPOD, which will accelerate our processing capacity to innovate, reduce risk, and launch AI-enabled capabilities. Our people have identified hundreds of use cases across BNY Mellon, and we already have several in production today. Across the company, it's our people who continue to power our culture. If you were to walk the halls of BNY Mellon, you'd feel the energy and sense of purpose our leadership team feels when we visit our teams around the world. To that end, we're investing in our people. Over the past several months, we launched new learning and feedback platforms powered by AI, expanded employee benefits, launched a new well-being support program, improved and accelerated our year-end feedback and compensation processes, and more. And we're delighted to welcome Shannon Hobbs, who will join us as our new Chief People Officer in June. As we continue to power our culture forward, we adopted the following five core principles to guide how our teams work and collaborate as we drive our success as a company. The client obsessed, spark progress, own it, stay curious and thrive together. To wrap up, our performance in the first quarter provides a glimpse of BNY Mellon's potential. Running our company better, inclusive of our focus on platforms, is enabling us to improve profitability and invest in our future. While we are pleased to see early signs of progress, we remain focused on the significant work ahead of us, as we become more for our clients and deliver higher performance for our shareholders. As I have said before, the transformation of our company is a multi-year endeavor but we've started 2024, the year of our 240th anniversary, with a sense of excitement and determination around what's possible. Now over to you, Dermot. Dermot McDonogh : Thank you, Robin, and good morning everyone. Referring to Page 3 of the presentation, I'll start with our consolidated financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $4.5 billion was up 3% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 5%. This reflects 8% growth in investment services fees on the back of higher market values, increased client activity and net new business, partially offset by a 14% decline in foreign exchange revenue, as a result of lower market volatility. Firm-wide assets under custody and our administration of $48.8 trillion were up 5% year-over-year, and assets under management of $2 trillion were up 6% year-over-year, both largely reflecting higher market values. Investment and other revenue was $182 million in the quarter. Effective January 1, we adopted new accounting guidance for our investments in renewable energy projects resulting in an approximately $50 million increase to investment and other revenue. We have restated prior periods in our earnings materials to provide you with like-for-like, year-over-year and sequential comparisons. The adoption of this new accounting guidance is largely neutral to net income and earnings per share, as the increase in provision for income taxes roughly equals the increase in investment and other revenue. Net interest income decreased by 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting changes in the composition of deposits, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. Expenses were up 2% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items, primarily severance expense. Growth was from incremental investments and employee merit increases offset by efficiency savings. Provision for credit losses was $27 million in the quarter, primarily driven by reserve increases related to commercial real estate exposure. As Robin mentioned earlier, we reported earnings per share of a $1.25 up 11% year-over-year, a pre-tax margin of 29% and a return on tangible common equity of 20.7%. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.29, up 14% year-over-year. Pre-tax margin was 30%, and our return on tangible common equity was 21.3%. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 5.9%. Average assets increased by 1% sequentially, as deposit balances grew. And tier 1 capital decreased by 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting capital return to common shareholders partially offset by capital generated through earnings. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 10.8%. The quarter-over-quarter decline reflects a temporary increase in risk-weighted assets at the end of the quarter, which was driven by discrete overdrafts in our custody and securities clearing businesses, as well as strong demand for our agency securities lending program. Consistent with tier 1 capital, CET1 capital decreased by 1% sequentially. Over the course of the quarter, we returned $1.3 billion of capital to our shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of 138%. Turning to liquidity. Our regulatory ratios remained strong. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 117% flat sequentially. And our consolidated net stable funding ratio was 136% up 1 percentage point sequentially. Moving on to net interest income and the underlying balance sheet trends on Page 5. Net interest income of over $1 billion was down 8% year-over-year and down 6% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by changes in the composition of deposits, partially offset by the benefit of reinvesting maturing fixed rate securities [and] (ph) higher yielding alternatives. Against typical seasonal patterns, average deposit balances increased by 2% sequentially. Solid 4% growth in interest bearing deposits was partially offset by a 5% decline in non-interest bearing deposits which was in-line with our expectations. Average interest earning assets were up 1% quarter-over-quarter. We reduced our cash and reverse repo balances by 2% and increased our investment securities portfolio by 5%. Average loan balances remained flat. Turning to our business segments starting on Page 6, please remember that in the first quarter we made certain realignments of similar products and services across our lines of business, consistent with our work to operate as a more unified company. As Robin mentioned earlier, the largest change was the movement of institutional solutions from Pershing to Clearance and Collateral Management both in the Market and Wealth Services segment. And we made other smaller changes across our business segments. We have restated prior periods for consistency. Please refer to the revised financial supplement that we filed on March 26th for detailed reconciliations to previous disclosures. Now, starting with Security Services on Page 6. Security services reported total revenue of $2.1 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Investment services fees were up 8% year-over-year. In asset servicing, investment services fees were up 8%, driven by higher market values, net new business and higher client activity. We've remained focused on deal margins, and as a result the year-over-year impact of repricing on fee growth was de-minimis. Consistent with past quarters, we continue to see particular success with our ETF offering. ETF assets under custody and/or administration surpassed $2 trillion this quarter up over 40% year-over-year on the back of higher market values, net new business and client flows, and the number of funds serviced was up 16% year-over-year. While the pace of alternative fund launches was slower than in the prior year quarter, investment services fees for alternatives were up over 10% on a year-over-year basis. Throughout the quarter, we saw broad-based strength across client segments, products and regions. In issuer services, investment services fees were up 11% reflecting net new business across both depository receipts and corporate trust, as well as higher cancellation fees in depository receipts. Foreign exchange revenue was down 11% year-over-year and net interest income was down 12%. Expenses of $1.5 billion were flat year-over-year, reflecting incremental investments, as well as the impact of employee merit increases offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was $591 million, a 4% increase year-over-year, and pre-tax margin expanded to 28%. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 7. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 7% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 3%, reflecting higher market values and client activity, partially offset by the impact of business lost in the prior year. Net new assets were negative $2 billion for the quarter, reflecting the ongoing deconversion of the before-mentioned lost business. Client demand for our Wealth Advisor platform, Wove, continues to be strong. In the first quarter, we signed nine additional client agreements, including our first direct indexing clients, and we onboarded four clients onto the platform. In treasury services, investment services fees increased by 5%, driven by net new business. We continue to invest in our sales and service teams, new products and technology. And so we are pleased with this solid growth and momentum continues to build. Last but not least, strength in clearance and collateral management continued with investment services fees of 13% on the back of broad-based growth both in the US and internationally. Net interest income for the segment overall was down 7% year-over-year. Expenses of $834 million were up 7% year-over-year, reflecting incremental investments, revenue-related expenses, and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was down 2% year-over-year at $678 million, representing a 45% pre-tax margin. Moving on to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 8. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $846 million, up 2% year-over-year. In Investment Management, revenue was up 2% driven by higher market values partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. In our wealth management business, revenue also increased by 2%, driven by higher market values, partially offset by changes in product mix and lower net interest income. Expenses of $740 million were flat year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of incremental investments and employee merit increases, which was offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was $107 million, up 15% year-over-year, representing a pre-tax margin of 13%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2 trillion increased by 6% year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw $16 billion of net inflows into our long-term active strategies with strength in LDI and fixed income. And we saw $15 billion of net outflows from index strategies. Strength in our short-term cash strategies continued with $16 billion of net inflows on the back of differentiated investment performance in our [drivers] (ph) money market fund complex. Wealth management client assets of $309 billion increased by 11% year-over-year, reflecting higher equity market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 9 shows the results of the other segments. I will close by reiterating our existing outlook for the full year 2024. As I've said before, we have positioned our balance sheet for a range of interest rate scenarios and we're managing both sides of it proactively. And so, despite the repricing of the curve since the beginning of the year, we continue to expect net interest income for the full year to be down 10% year-over-year, assuming current market implied interest rates for the remainder of 2024. Similarly, on expenses, our goal continues to be for full year 2024 expenses excluding notable items to be flat year-over-year. We are off to a good start, but we have more work ahead of us to realize further efficiency savings and drive year-over-year expense growth rates lower over the coming quarters, while we continue to make room for additional investments across our businesses. Overall, we remain determined to deliver some positive operating leverage this year. While we don't manage the firm to operating leverage on a quarterly basis, our performance in the first quarter with positive operating leverage on both a reported and an operating basis gives us confidence that we're on track. In light of the adoption of the new accounting guidance for our investments in renewable energy projects, which, as I discussed earlier, increases both our investment and other revenue, and the provision for income taxes. I'll note that we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be between 23% and 24%. And finally, we continue to expect returning 100% or more of 2024 earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks over the course of the year. As always, we will manage share repurchases cognizant of the macroeconomic environment, balance sheet size and many other factors. And so for the foreseeable future, we will calibrate the pace of buybacks to maintain our tier 1 leverage ratio close to the top end of our 5.5% to 6% medium-term target range. To wrap up, over the past three months, we've made good progress towards achieving our target for 2024. And we're encouraged by the drive we're seeing in all corners of the firm, as our people embrace being more for our clients, running our company better and powering our culture. With that operator, can you please open the line for Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. So Robin, really nice progress I guess on organic growth initiatives across a handful of businesses underneath BNY Mellon, as some of the things you talked about are starting to kind of take hold. Can you maybe frame what the firm's organic growth rate aspirations are for the next couple of years? How are you thinking about that for 2024 as well? And then as a side question I guess to that, we've seen quite significant amount of activity in sort of Clearance and Collateral Management. Can -- you maybe help size what is sort of transitory versus more of a recurrent baseline to think about from here. Thanks. Robin Vince : Sure, Alex. Good morning. So, let me start with the growth question. As you point out, we are quite -- feeling quite good about the early momentum that we have in growth. As you know, we set it out last year to really get our house in order, generate positive operating leverage and really think about the various different investments to drive sort of shorter, medium and longer-term growth. And that's really what we've been focused on and we're pleased that we've got a good start to the year on it. Clearly, we're trying to control the things that we can control. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks and as Dermot touched on as well, our focus here has really been wrapped around being more for our clients, our commercial model. We hired our first Chief Commercial Officer. We're operationalizing One BNY Mellon, as I called it, the nuts and bolts, kind of getting into building that into our client coverage organization, our coverage practice, starting to deliver integrated solutions. I gave a couple of examples of those in my prepared remarks. And we've got a whole bunch more things that really cut across all of the different segments that are related to that. So look, it's early in the journey. I would have said maybe last year we were working the problem. I think now I would say we're working the opportunity. Could you just remind me the second part of your question? Alex Blostein : Yeah, sure. Really nice results out of Clearance to Collateral Management for the firm and it's been a pretty active market in Q1, related to treasury issuance and activity there broadly. I'm just trying to get a sense for a better baseline to think about from here. Was there anything kind of transitory in the first quarter that helped the numbers or this is a good baseline to think about going forward. Robin Vince : Look, I would say in terms of transitory, not really, but let me just go through a few of the drivers. So remember that it's a business that like several of the businesses we have, respond to volumes and it was an active quarter when it comes to trading volumes in the US Treasury market. Now for better or for worse, US Treasuries is kind of a growth business and so that's probably a bit more of a secular tailwind, as opposed to something cyclical. And then remember under the hood in Clearance and Collateral Management, we've also been investing in the operating model of that business as we talked about in our prepared remarks and took something that was very, very adjacent to our Clearing business from Pershing institutional clearing and aligned it with the rest of our clearing -- bigger clearing business in Clearance and Collateral Management. And what we're finding now in those conversations with customers, it's a much cleaner conversation because we've got the ability to deliver all the solutions in our clearing business whether it's US Treasuries, whether it's international, whether it's the different models of clearing that we offer we're able to deliver that in one conversation with a client, and clients are responding to that. So I would call that secular as well. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks so much. I'll hop back in the queue. Robin Vince : Thanks Alex. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning, Robin. Good morning, Dermot. Robin Vince : Good morning, Steven. Steven Chubak : So I want to start with a question on capital, a bit of a two-parter, if you will. I was hoping you could just speak to the drivers of RWA growth in 1Q, which was fairly robust, where you're seeing attractive opportunities to deploy that excess capital. And just -- how we should be thinking about the cadence of the buyback. You alluded to this somewhat, Dermot, but I was hoping we could drill down into -- you noted the 6% target or that upper bound on tier 1 leverage is, how should we be thinking about the cadence of buyback in light of planned balance sheet actions and growth potential. Dermot McDonogh : Okay, I'll take that one. Steven, good morning. So some of the capital increase, there are two parts to the RWA increase, one was a kind of temporary increase around quarter end, as it relates to discrete overdrafts in custody and securities clearing businesses. So that kind of come and gone. And then there was also -- there was strong demand for our agency securities lending program throughout the quarter and particularly leading up to quarter end and that's continued into this quarter. So I would say, half of it was that and half of it was temporary. As it relates to the buyback, I guess there's a little bit of a Groundhog Day here in terms of how we thought about a Q1 of last year versus how we're thinking about a Q1 of this year. Both quarters, we got off to a strong start. But look at there -- there's a lot of rate volatility out there in the market. You've seen the backup in rates last week with the hot inflation report. Last year it was the war in Ukraine, this year it's the geopolitics in the Middle East. And so we kind of gave a guidance in January where we said we were going to be 100% more of earnings throughout the year. We don't give quarter-by-quarter guidance. I would reiterate the guidance of 100% or more, notwithstanding the fact Q1 was very good at 138%. I wouldn't expect that pace to continue, but we'll take it quarter-by-quarter. Steven Chubak : Understood. And for my follow-up, maybe just drilling down into the investment and wealth margins, in particular, since across the other segments, we're seeing continued progress towards the longer-term targets. That's admittedly the segment with the biggest shortfall. I know in the prepared remarks, Dermot, you noted that you're making investments in the business and just wanted to better understand, one where are those dollars getting deployed? And maybe if you could just speak to the primary drivers underpinning that glide path to 25%. How much is contingent on revenue growth versus expense optimization? Dermot McDonogh : Okay, so the first point would be pre-tax margin for the Q1 there was around 13%. If you normalize that for typical seasonal volatility in terms of retirement eligible stock and such, like, if you back that out and adjust it, the margin would have been somewhere in the 16% zip code. So we feel pretty good about that. Still a ton of work to do. And I would say, it's not one thing over the other, it depends on which part of the business you're talking about. In some of our asset managers, we're investing, we're launching new products. Clients, in some places, continue to de-risk and move from more risk on equity to passive fixed income. But in other cases, we see clients coming in and AUM growing. We saw -- we were very pleased with the performance of our drive with cash management business in Q1, where we saw strong inflows and the performance of the business in terms of returns was -- first quarter, so we feel very good about that. So we are investing the business to give our clients good products to invest in. The flip side is, we still believe as it relates to running the company better and desiloing the firm and connecting asset management to the broader enterprise, there's a lot of opportunity there. And at the same time as the opportunity, it allows us to take costs out and become a lot more efficient. So I would say we're working both sides of us. We see more opportunity on the revenue side, and we're working the problem on the efficiency side. Steven Chubak : Very helpful, color. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. I had two questions. One was just on the AI commentary that you were leading with in the prepared remarks and I wanted to understand how you're thinking about the benefits to the expense ratio and the time frame with which this is going to flow through? Because there's clearly revenue enhancing opportunities and expense reducing or flattening. And how much of this AI investment is, how important is it to your 2024 expense outlook. And yeah, if you could give us the medium-term outlook, that'd be helpful, thanks. Robin Vince : Sure, hi Betsy. First of all, it's great to have you on the call. Really glad to have you back and to know that you're doing well. Betsy Graseck : Thanks so much. Robin Vince : So on the AI, I'll start with the sort of the latter part of your question, which is I really don't think this is a 2024 story. Of course, we're doing things in 2024. But if you ask me to try to put a pin in where the real benefits and sort of tailwinds kick in, I'm actually going to say it's not even necessarily a 2025 story, although maybe we'll see a little bit in \u201825. I think this is a \u201826 and on out benefit on the expense line. But let me go back to the sort of the premise of your question and just sort of briefly mention how we're embracing it, so I'll put it actually through the three pillars that we've laid out in terms of -- the guiding so much of what we're doing in the company. So first, being more for our clients, we think there are solutions out there for clients that are going to help them make better decisions, see risks, be able to be more efficient themselves. We've got software in market today doing that with predictive trade analytics around fails and settlements, allowing clients to be able to look out and to see and take evasive action essentially on potential fails. And by the way, some of those actions involve using other parts of the BNY Mellon platforms in order to be able to improve their businesses. And so that's an interesting example and there are going to be a lot more of those. Under the heading of running our company better this is going to be about streamlining business processes, productivity, figuring out and seeing anomalies that we can see, code assistant, as so many people talk about for our developers. I was walking around one of our buildings the other day, talking to one of our developers. They've been out of school for a year and change and already they think that 25% more productive as a developer and that's in the very early days of using GitHub Copilot. So that's going to be -- there's going to be more there -- and that ultimately is going to create efficiencies for us. And then under the culture heading, which is very important, we want AI to empower our people to be able to go out and be able to be more efficient in terms of what they're doing. And there are any number of different examples of things over time that we think AI is going to be able to help with us. Now importantly in this -- is the way in which we're doing it. Both Dermot and I talked about platforms and another concept in our platform strategy is to create these hubs, these centers of excellence. And in AI that's particularly important. We do not want to repeat the problems we've had in the past of having everyone go off in their own direction. And actually in AI, it's particularly important because problem statements that sound different can in fact have very common root causes. So you might want to be able to respond to an RFP. You might want to generate summaries of documents. You might want to be able to get a head start on a research report. But actually, when you look under the heading, those three things sound different. But the AI that's actually powering them, some of the -- sort of mini platforms that are required are very, very similar. So we're using our AI hub to collect these different use cases and then be able to sort of deliver solutions and many AI platforms that can then be used in multiple places around the company. So we're excited about this. We think it's going to be very significant over time, but it's not a 2024 story. Betsy Graseck : Okay, got it. That's super helpful with the color. Appreciate that. And then just a follow up on the tax rate guidance. This is part of the accounting change, I believe, is that right? And can you tell us where in the [PPOP] (ph) the offsets are, thanks? Robin Vince : Sorry, I missed the last part of it, Betsy. Where are the --. Betsy Graseck : Offsets -- there's the offsets, right, to the tax -- the taxes impacted by the accounting change, is that right? Robin Vince : Yeah, so it's economically it's net neutral for the firm. It's just a gross up in revenue which will show up in the interest and other revenue line and then the offset to that is in the tax line. And we filed an 8-K, a couple of weeks ago where we restated all the prior periods for comparison so that people will see it on a consistent basis going forward. Betsy Graseck : Sure, I just wanted to highlight that your tax rate guide has the offsets in the revenue. So I appreciate that. Thank you. Robin Vince : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you good morning. Robin Vince : Good morning Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Yes, I guess, not sure Dermot if this was addressed here but in terms of your outlook on deposits, I think the period ends, so a pretty big uptick to $309 billion. Just give us a sense of, within your NII guidance, one what are you assuming in terms of deposit balances? And secondly, if the forward curve holds, is the next inflection on NII and margin higher or lower? Yeah, thank you. Dermot McDonogh : So, as at the quarter end, Ebrahim, I think the spot number was around $310 billion of deposits. And that was largely, you may recall that quarter end this year fell on a good Friday where markets were closed. So we got a lot of clients putting cash in, so that they could make certain payments. And so we saw a kind of surge in deposits over the last few days of the quarter. And they've largely left the system now. We've returned to more normal levels, which is in the kind of high [270 range] (ph). So that's kind of really the explanation for the spot deposit balance versus the average trend. So sequentially, we're down 6% in the deposits, or NII, an 8% year-over-year. And we saw a 2% growth in the deposit balance, generally speaking. Our guide at the beginning of the year was down 10% and given the rate volatility and what's going on with the inflation report last week and the back-up in rates et cetera, et cetera, we don't see, you know, there's nothing that's causing us to think that we should change our guidance between now and the balance of the year. We're very neutrally positioned, as to whether rates go up a little bit from here or down a little bit from here. And we feel very good about the overall guidance that we gave in January, which was approximately down 10%. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess one just follow up in terms of some of the actions you took in moving businesses in Pershing. As we think about the strategic review, I guess Robin, maybe it began a year ago or longer than that, give us a sense of in terms of the franchise positioning, how the businesses are talking to each other and if they are in the right place within the enterprise. Is all of that done? How close are you to getting the franchise synced up in terms of what is coming along with regards to what you want to achieve in terms of client synergies? Thank you. Robin Vince : So the punch line is we're making good progress, but you're essentially asking a cultural question and we're not done on that. So when we did, to go back to your point, when we did our original strategy reviews, which is 18 months or so ago now, and took us a few months to go through, we were really focused on answering the questions of what are we doing, are we doing the right things, how are we doing them, are we doing them in the right way, do we have the right people doing them, and so we looked at that and we certainly found bits of the company that were just in the wrong place and so we've lifted those bits up and we put them in what we now think of the right place so that's what both Dermot and I talked about in our prepared remarks and that was what some of the restatement of prior periods so that you could make the easier comparisons there was about. That was basic blocking and tackling but the bigger opportunity for sure is how the businesses work together, not only to be more for clients by saying, hey, that client over there is a client, but they're not my client in my business, can we work together to basically make them a client of both businesses? That's very significant. That's where we talk about maturing One BNY Mellon into the real heart of a new commercial coverage model and that's being driven by our Chief Commercial Officer. Another part of this is saying, there are things that we used to think of as standalone capabilities, some might call them products, we think about them as client platforms. And in fact, what the client is asking for, and we really heard this when we did our voice of client survey, they don't want these individual products, they want us to take them and weave them together to create solutions for them that are on point to their needs. And so we've also started to do that, and I mentioned some examples of that, and that's a very powerful thing because that takes the breadth of our company, and rather than it being siloed, which is getting in the way of solutions, it's now actually ending up being the opportunity for us to deliver from the breadth of our platforms to our clients with solutions that frankly some other people aren't going to be able to do. So that's we think very exciting and in those journeys, we're still relatively early and that is cultural and we've been doing a lot of things internally in the firm to make sure that our people are lined up behind that. It's early days, but we're quite excited about the direction of travel. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you both. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to start, Dermot, when you were walking through Pershing, I believe you talked about the offboarding and the impact of how that was weighing on the net new assets. Could you give us a update on how far we are along in that off-boarding process and how much we should continue to expect for the rest of the year? And then also LPL recently announced the acquisition of Atria, which I understand was a Pershing client, and they're planning to consolidate those operations in 2025. So is that going to extend maybe some of the headwinds that we're seeing from some of these idiosyncratic off-boardings? Dermot McDonogh : Okay, thanks for the question. So the first thing I would say about Pershing in the context of the overall kind of the segment. With respect to Pershing, we continue to invest in Pershing. Pershing continues to grow. As we said since the deconversion was announced, we're going to earn our way out of this situation. That's what's happening. So -- we still as a business feel very good about Pershing and our ability -- it's a market that's growing in mid-single digits on an annual basis and we're a big player in that market. So we're going to win our shares. So while the deconversion was unfortunate, we continue to march on and we learn our way out. Specifically, I would say, we'll be largely done with the deconversion by Q3 of this year. And as it relates to the second part, I would say look we're in a competitive market, people are going to do things the LPL Atria thing it's not a particular headwind, it's not been highlighted to me, it's not hit my radar in terms of oh my gosh, we need to worry about that. And so I think we're winning more than we're losing and we're investing and that's really going well. And when you take it in the context of what's going on with Wove, we're building a strong pipeline there. The backlog is looking good. We've added nine clients to the platform in Q1 of this year, and we made a commitment to the market that we would kind of add $30 million to $40 million of revenue this year, and we still feel very good about that guidance and that commitment that we made to you back in January. Robin Vince : And Brennan, I just add on the business front to that, which is remember that when we look at a deconversion, for sure those happen, and the one that you're referring to, the original one was a larger one. But we're also growing with our clients. Our clients are growing with us and we also are on the receiving end of roll-ups as well. Our clients are quite acquisitive and we have a couple of clients who've been doing acquisitions and we have some of our largest clients who are growing very significantly and very healthily. So it's always unfortunate when there's a roll-up that goes against us, but when there are roll-ups that go with our clients, those things balance out to some extent which is why Dermot makes the point about overall, we still feel quite enthusiastic about the net new assets growth over time. Brennan Hawken : Great thanks for that color And then when we think about the deposits, I'm trying to think about really, Dermot, the fact that here we are one quarter in. I get it -- you maybe don't want to update expectations. But it seems like, based on what we've seen so far, deposit trends seem to be doing better than expected. We saw a pick-up in the deposit balances at year-end. They sustained, which is a little unusual. And even though they've come down from [EOP at 331] (ph), they're still in a similar ballpark to where you were on the average. Are you guys -- is there something specific that's driving the expectation for deposit decline or is it just a component of conservatism? Dermot McDonogh : If I'm honest with you, I would say it's a little bit of both, but I would expect, like everybody expected deposits to decline this year, and it hasn't necessarily happened yet, And I kind of think -- I make that statement in the context of QT. And so if you look at the [RRP] (ph) in Q1, the drain largely came from there. And if QT continues and rates stay higher for longer, on balance I would expect deposits to decline from here. And so I don't see anything that tells me that I should update the guidance from down 10% NII year-over-year. And then underneath the hood, in terms of the composition of the deposits themselves, you have the mix between interest bearing and non-interest bearing. And as rates stay higher for longer, I would expect NIBs to grind a little bit lower. So the overall balance may be higher, but you have to mix underneath, which will kind of feed into that overall NII guidance. So it's not just the absolute level, it's also the composition of it. Brennan Hawken : Yeah, yeah, that's great. Thanks for the candor and the embracing the uncertainty. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Robin Vince : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : Can you hear me? Yeah. So I guess non-interest bearing deposits inched down again, and I'm just wondering where that floor is. I guess it's 18% versus 19% last quarter and 26% year-over-year. And so on the other hand, your servicing fees were up 8% year-over-year. So I'm not sure if I should draw a link or not. Maybe what you're not getting in non-interest bearing deposits, you're getting in servicing fees. So I guess the question is, how are you getting such strong servicing fee growth year-over-year of 8%, how much of that is due to markets, how much of that is sustainable, and is any of that simply a substitution effect from the non-interest bearing deposits to servicing fees? Dermot McDonogh : Thanks for the question, Mike. So let's go with the fee component first. Q1 is kind of one of those quarters where we came into the year I guess both in deposits and in pipeline and sales activity in very good shape. As it relates to kind of asset servicing in particular, the pipeline was strong, we felt good coming into the year, markets rallied nicely. And so clients were in risk on mode, doing more with us. Flows were stronger. Balances are higher. And we're winning our share of mandates. Little factoids for like, of all the deals that we competed for in Q1, we won north of 50%. So we're competitive, we're pricing well, we're very focused on client profitability and deal margin and it goes back to the point that we made in several quarters prior to this where we're very focused on the cost to serve. And so by improving margin, focusing on cost to serve, being more for clients, we can be more competitive in the pricing point. And I made that remark, I made the point in my prepared remarks that we saw repricing being de-minimis. So it was a good quarter all around and we feel very good about the backlog and the pipeline going forward. As it relates to the mix between fees and deposits, you know, we don't lead with deposits as an institution. Clients do multiple things with us across the enterprise and as a consequence of that they leave deposits with us. You know, it's an important point but two-thirds of our deposits are operational in nature and therefore very sticky. But with a higher for longer rate environment, it's only natural to expect that people with NIBs are going to over time move out of that and look for a higher yield. It's inevitable and it's a fact of life and we're ready to deal with that but I'm very proud of what our global liquidity solutions team is doing in terms of winning their share of the business in terms of the deposits and how we price them and so sequentially, we've seen the balances go up because of that competitive pricing. So all-in-all, when you take the ecosystem together we feel very good about where we're at. Robin Vince : And Mike there was nothing idiosyncratic about trade-offs to the other part of your question. I don't see the quarter built around that at all. Mike Mayo : Okay. And so for -- a separate question, for all the growth and servicing fees, asset management, what can you do to reverse the trend for sustainable growth? I mean, would it ever be an option to consider selling that? The synergies, when you think about One BNY Mellon, I kind of get the rest of the firm being all one cohesive unit over time, but how does asset management fit into that? Robin Vince : Sure, so this is a question that we talked a little bit about last year and I said at the time that we think, and I'll underline the word think, that the business really can complement the strategy of the firm, but we had more work to do and that -- that was a thesis and we needed to put in place the various different steps to really be able to operationalize and make the most of that. And that's what we've been working on over the course of the past few months. The basic thesis is we think there's a strong industrial logic to have $2 trillion worth of manufacturing platform aligned to BNY Mellon's $3 trillion worth of retail distribution capacity, if you look across wealth and Pershing together. Pershing alone having [$2.5 trillion] (ph) plus of client assets on the platform. And so if you only operated in a silo in investment management where it was manufacturing and only its own distribution, there's a legitimate question there about whether or not it would have the scale and the capacity to be able to truly compete but when you put it together with the rest of the company we think there's a pretty compelling thesis there. And so we don't think we've properly capitalized on those benefits in the past and so our strategy is let's -- let investment management stretch its legs in that new approach. And we see some early signs of progress on that. We've been joining some dots. I mentioned a couple of things in my prepared remarks, both in terms of us having a broader distribution platform that actually can attract other investment managers who maybe don't have the benefit of our distribution and they want to come join our platform rounding out our offerings and essentially making our distribution platform more complete but also being attractive to them, so they don't have to build their own. If you will, they're building their business on one of our platforms. And so we've given you our targets. We want to be able to expand the pre-tax margin in the business to over 25%. It's not for nothing that we didn't grow expenses in that segment or in security services for that matter because we're really focused on the margin in those businesses and we have had some growth. And so this is about really working that set of opportunities and we'll see over the coming quarters how we do. But this quarter was one where we felt, we took an important step forward. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. [Robin] (ph) mentioned it, so maybe it wasn't that big of a deal, but T+1 starts at the end of May. I'm curious if it was a big expense lift that we get some relief on going forward? And then related to that, are there any headwinds on NII and any benefits on capital that we have to think about as a result of moving towards a more T+1 world? Thank you. Robin Vince : So T+1 , sure we had to for sure spend money in different parts of the company in order to be able to ready ourselves for this. We view that as frankly ordinary course of business. There's always some market structure change going on in the world that we have to respond to. So while they may be individually lumpy, there's always something. So we just think about that as part of the expense of running the company and not something that will yield a particular benefit when we happen to have finished the work. Now, I do think that T+1 overall provides benefits to the financial system, improvements in efficiency, some risk reduction. I would say to the second part of your question that more of that probably accrues to our clients because we're not as big a principal player there. It can improve liquidity and capital requirements in the fullness of time. The industry's come a long way. You know, it wasn't that long ago that we're at T+5, T+3 sort of moving down the curve. And I will also say from an opportunity point of view, not only do clients look to us to help them navigate these types of things because they're complicated and detailed, and they want us to essentially help them in executing this type of change, and that's exactly what we've been doing. But we also think that there are just opportunities associated with these sorts of inflections, because clients look at us and it does sometimes cause the question to be raised of another big change in the post-trade landscape life's too short I'm an investment manager or I'm broker dealer or I want to go about the core of my business, I don't have to worry about that stuff as much as I currently do. BNY Mellon, can you help us? Can you help us and maybe there's a platform sale opportunity there for a little bit more outsourcing? Because if the world makes these changes, speeds up, gets more complicated, more change management, we of course have the benefit of scale, we get to change once and we get to take some of those problems off their hands. So I'd call that out when it comes to real-time payments, I'd call it out in T plus 1, I'd call it out in clearing. Each time these things happen, we look at it through a lens of opportunity as well as a lens of client service but overall also just good for the market nothing good happens between trading and settlement as is often said. Dermot McDonogh : And Glenn on this specific point about headwinds as it relates to NII, I kind of look at the last two quarters together in terms of the strength of what we've done on NII and I feel overall we're in a good place. The balance sheet is very clean. Our CIO book is well positioned and kind of short duration and the CIO is doing a really good job at optimizing yield. And so when you see our securities that are maturing at the moment, they're rolling off at a 2% to 3% rate and then are being deployed at current market yields. So based on what I see today with the back-up in rates that happened last week as a result of the hot inflation report, we feel pretty good about where things are for the balance of the year just using that forward curve. As I said earlier, rates up a little, down a little, don't materially impact us. And so we feel like our base case is, we feel pretty good about it. Glenn Schorr : Thank you all. Operator : Our next question is come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Robin. Hi, Dermot. Robin Vince : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Dermot, can you give us some color? I noticed you said in your prepared remarks the average loan balances were essentially flat in Q1 versus Q4. But I noticed the spot number, the year-end -- quarter-end number for loans was actually quite a bit higher, you know, around $73 billion versus the spot number in the fourth quarter. Was it something at the end of the quarter that caused that to increase? Dermot McDonogh : Thanks, Gerard. Again, it was a little bit of what I call the Good Friday effect, where clients use our overdraft facility mechanisms going into that weekend. And so that really caused the spot balances to go up and that's kind of largely cleaned out so has reverted more to the average numbers that you're familiar with. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, good. And I know this is not a big area for you guys, so maybe you could give us better insights since it's not as big as it is for a traditional bank. But can you maybe give us some color on the commercial real estate? I know you pointed out you've built up the allowances there. What are you guys seeing? Is it similar to what we're reading about and hearing from others or is it something different? Dermot McDonogh : So I would say, look, we're prudently marked in the commercial real estate portfolio. Overall, our CRE portfolio in the context of our overall balance sheet is quite small. 3% of total loans, $2 billion. And the reserve builds that we took in Q1 was really just kind of being prudent on a couple of specific situations that are coming up for restructuring. But I would let you know that they're all still paying and everything is working, and their class A office buildings. And we feel good about the occupancy. So I would say overall very, very clean and nothing that really has me unduly concerned. And look, there has been a lot of chatter in the market, in the press over the last quarter about what's going to happen. I'm sure the back-up in rates, hasn't really helped that chatter but like surveying other banks results so far this quarter I haven't really noticed any specific CRE bills on the back of what's been going on over the last couple of quarters, so it does feel like as a sentiment matter to be quite muted at the moment on the back of others earnings release, at least what I've observed. Robin Vince : and Gerard I just add to that for the more general view which is I think the answer to what happens in corporate real estate, clearly it depends which markets you're involved in. There are some markets around the country that are more distressed than others. It continues to be focused on office, as you know, although there are certainly some questions on multi-family, but the fact that we're sort of still short housing in the US, as a general matter is probably, ultimately going to be helpful to that story. The most single most important driver of it, as we sit here today, is where are longer-term rates? And so there's so much chatter about what's going to happen in fed funds. Is the fed going to cut? Are they going to stay? Are they going to hike a little bit? But what really matters is where's the curve from five years to 10 years? And as that backs up to the extent that we cross 5%, you get very different outcomes on commercial real estate than you do at 10 years or at 4%. And if they ended up, for some reason, not our base case, but it's possible, you've got to plan for it. If they end up at 6%, then for some folks in the market, that's going to be a much more painful outcome. So I think you watch -- so goes the [10 year] to some extent, so goes the commercial real estate market. Because this is a \u201824 a little bit, but really \u201825 refinancing story. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Appreciate those insights. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Smith with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. David Smith : Good afternoon. Could you please help us think a little bit more about how far along you are in the efficiency opportunity journey? I know, it's really never ending in some ways, but can you help us think about when the pace of improvement might start to decline, as you get through more of the low-hanging fruit? Dermot McDonogh : So, thanks for the question. I was wondering when it was going to come. It's a multi-year journey, and look let's go back to last year and kind of go through it. And last year, we kind of ended up at 2.7% versus a guide of 4% versus a previous year of 8%. And this year, we've guided flat. And we started Q1 on an operating basis of 1%. You'll see that our head count -- we've largely, you know, give or take a few hundred people, it's largely flat and so the headcount is flat, we feel like we have our arms wrapped around that. There's a lot going under the hood in terms of bringing in -- like growing our analyst class, high-value location growth, et cetera, et cetera. So we see a lot of opportunity to continue to improve the efficiency story. Also, as we both said in our prepared remarks, the migration to a new way of working, the platform operating model over the next couple of years, we feel will not only help us grow top-line, but it will also just help us run the company better. And I think, it's quite important culturally that we don't really talk about efficiency internally. We talk about running our company better, which is very important strategically and also culturally. So I think you're going to see quarter-by-quarter proof points on how we're able to run the company better, which will result in efficiency, which will then in turn result in improved margin. So we feel very optimistic about what's coming. David Smith : Thank you. And lastly, just to confirm, you know, $1 billion or so of buyback in 1Q, does that come out of the $6 billion new re-purchase authorization or is the $6 billion incremental to what you did in 1Q? Dermot McDonogh : So we did an authorization last year which was $5 billion. We have a little bit left in that. And so -- it's just more of an administration thing that we decided to get another authorization this year for $6 billion. That's largely open-ended. So I wouldn't really dwell on the size of the authorization that much. It's just more of what we commit to you doing on an annual basis. And the key thing for you to take away is we're committing to north of 100% this year. David Smith : Got it. Thank you. Dermot McDonogh : Thanks David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe most of them have been asked and answered, but maybe just a couple of follow-ups. One, a little bit on that prior question, Dermot, I guess this could be for Robin as well. I think Robin you mentioned, earlier in the call about 15% of staff are in the new operating model. Maybe if you could just talk about your migration plan over time and going back to what you just answered, Dermot, about the efficiency improvement, should we be thinking of this over the long-term as maybe roughly even between expenses and revenue or still more geared towards expenses? Robin Vince : Okay. Let me just start with the platforms operating model. So ultimately, if you just go back to why are we doing -- what it is that we're doing, we've been pretty siloed as a company as we've talked about before. We think that's a bad artifact, at least it's a bad artifact for a company like us, which is inherently a scale platforms provider. It's kind of the nature of our business, diversified many different platforms but largely at scale. And so to have the separation of all of these pieces that are in support of that and in some cases, duplication, it just -- in our opinion wasn't the right way to run the company. So what is platform\u2019s Operating Model going to do? It's going to simplify how we work, it's going to improve the client experience, and it's going to create more empowerment for our employees. It's an opportunity to do things in one place, do them well and elevate the quality of overall execution. And so with that said, it sort of hits on the expense line, as a benefit and it hits on the revenue line as well. And we've done, remember we did a bunch of studies for this before we embarked on it because pretty significant change. We also did some pilots and to some extent we've even built new businesses using this operating rhythm because we built Wove in that way and that wasn't entirely by accident. So we've had some experience associated with all of that and we feel pretty good therefore that we are going to get expense savings and revenue opportunities associated with it. We also think that from a cultural point of view, it's just an opportunity for our people because we think our people, and this is certainly what the data so far has shown, they just feel more empowered working in the model. They can see a problem, they can get on it more quickly, they're more empowered to pull the levers to create change, and they no longer feel that maybe that they're part of a long chain of a bureaucracy to make change. On the efficiency opportunity thing, the thing I would add in answer to your question from what Dermot said earlier on, is just to reinforce that there are short, medium and long-term opportunities for efficiencies and we've talked about it this way for a while now. As Dermot said, we had to bend the cost curve last year. We thought it was very important, so we took a bunch of slightly tactical but nonetheless important and decisive changes. We also laid the groundwork for some medium-term saves. We talked about project catalysts, 1500 ideas, sourced from our employees, essentially delivering savings in \u201923, in \u201824, and \u201825. And then we've got things that are longer-term, like the platform's operating model, which are fundamentally changing the ways that people actually work. That's a longer term opportunity. Probably get a little bit of benefit from that from \u201824, but \u201825 and \u201826 are places where we'll probably see a bit more of that. And then in answer to Betsy's question from earlier on, we've been investing in AI. Now that's definitely not a \u201824 story for benefits, maybe not even \u201825, but a \u201826 and beyond story. So we're layering in these different opportunities, recognizing that we wanted to take swift action, but then we also feel that we're laying the seeds for future efficiencies over time. Dermot McDonogh : And I would just, Brian, just to add on, I would just anchor you in a number. Like last year, when we grew expenses by 2.7%, we invested $0.5 billion in new initiatives within that 2.7%. And we're replicating that again this year. And so as somebody who's very close to the platform operating model strategy, the cultural point is when you walk the corridors of BNY Mellon now, you feel an energy and enthusiasm for our people, as Robin said, from embracing the model that hasn't been seen before. And it is a very, very exciting strategy that's going on at the firm. Brian Bedell : That's fantastic, color. And maybe just one -- last one on the speaking of initiatives, the buy side trading solutions initiative. I know we've had a lot of other initiatives to talk about, so just maybe to get an update on how that's tracking. Robin Vince : Yeah, this was, I'll take this one. This was always going to be a medium-term thing. As we've told you, we sort of have this capability in-house. It's a great example of platform thinking. It was captive in one bit of the company, only looking internally. We essentially made it fit for external use as well. We onboarded, as we told you last quarter, a large client onto that platform, and that's been going very well. I have a lot of conversations with clients about how they could consider part of their trading desks to be outsourced. Sometimes it's all of it. Sometimes it's a region or a product that somebody wants to essentially say, hey, I'm not at scale. You're at scale. You're executing a $1 trillion worth of volumes. Can I rent that capability from you, essentially? We think there's a large addressable market here, but it's going to be, this is a longer sell process. The sale cycle of this takes longer. It's definitely a C-suite conversation, but we continue to be cautiously optimistic about this over time. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks for all the color. Thanks so much. Robin Vince : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. I know we're getting on here. I'll try to ask just a couple quick cleanups. First of all, this is the first quarter that the securities book has actually grown in absolute terms, And I'm just wondering, is part of that an increased confidence in just where you do expect deposits to land, or was it more just opportunity cost of what your options were in the market? Robin Vince : Thanks, Ken. I would say very much the latter. And when you look at the overall portfolio, you think of cash and securities together. And it was really the CIO team just optimizing yield and deploying cash where they see the opportunities. Ken Usdin : Yeah, okay. And then I know you said a little bit of this before, but I was wondering if you could tighten up. You know, last quarter you said, to Glenn's question, you talked about reinvesting at market rates. So last quarter you put that together and said that you would expect that this year's reinvestments to be 150 basis points to 200 basis points on your roll-on, roll-off. And with higher rates, I'm just wondering if you've kind of put that together for us. Like, what do you think that net benefit is now versus that 150 basis points to 200 basis points? Dermot McDonogh : I think it's in the 200 zip code. Ken Usdin : Okay, and then last one, just duration of the portfolio. Can you just give us an update on where that stands? Dermot McDonogh : Roughly, two years, give or take, yeah, but yeah, two years is the best number to give you on that one. Ken Usdin : Okay, so to your point, like still keeping really short and opportunistic. Dermot McDonogh : Correct, yeah. Ken Usdin : All right, great, thanks a lot. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. When you mentioned your comments about commercial real estate, I was just wondering, I don't think you have much exposure, but you highlighted that commercial real estate, I guess, to the industry or are you talking office? You said it's really a 2025 refinancing story and ASCO the 10-year, ASCO commercial real estate. It's just \u2013 if you could provide any color. Why did you highlight that and why do you have that sort of conclusion? Robin Vince : Well, the question, Mike, was more general in nature. It wasn't really applying to us. Dermot talked a little bit about us in particular on commercial real estate, but I think the question that was being asked was just using our vantage point, I think it was from Gerard, just using our vantage point in the world because we're not particularly invested in the space. What do we see in the world, maybe as a slightly less conflicted observer? And so I was just giving my perspective on it. Mike Mayo : Yes, your perspective, what's -- I'm just curious, interested. ASCO to 10 year, it's a 2025 refinancing story. Any color behind that? Robin Vince : Sure, so at the end of the day, as you look at the various different owners of commercial real estate who have refinancings and they're looking at their own occupancy level, they're looking at their own maturity of their own debt stack, and they need to go out and they need to find refinancing, of course, as you know better than anybody, when their debt stack starts to come due. That isn't a Fed funds type of refinancing because they're not for funding of very short dates. And most of them, for understandable reasons, like to lock in funding as well. So they're looking further out the curve, it's not precisely at the 10 year point but my point really is the risk to refinancing in the commercial real estate space is very correlated to the shape of the treasury curve overall. Clearly credit spreads matter as well, but it's a different proposition when you have the longer, call it 10 years, but it's probably a little inside of that, part of the curve at 4% versus 5% versus 6%. That was the purpose of my observation. Mike Mayo : All right. That's helpful. Thank you. Robin Vince : You're welcome. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin with any additional or closing remarks. Robin Vince : Thank you, operator. I'd just like to wrap up by thanking our employees for their hard work to unlock the tremendous opportunity inside of BNY Mellon. We started the year with great momentum, delivered very solid results in the first quarter, and the pace of change continues to pick up. And I want to thank our investors for their continued support. We appreciate your interest in BNY Mellon and thank you for your time today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Marius Merz : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. As always, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com. And I'll note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement, and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July 12, 2024, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin. Robin Vince : Thanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before Dermot reviews the financials in greater detail, I'd like to start with a few remarks about our progress in the quarter. In short, we delivered another quarter of improved financial performance with positive operating leverage on the back of solid fee growth and continued expense discipline. And we continued to make tangible progress on our path to be more for our clients, to run our company better, and to power our culture. Last month, we celebrated our company's 240th anniversary with our people and many of our clients. Even with this rich history of operating across four centuries, I believe that our best days remain ahead of us. That bank with around $0.5 million of capital in 1784 today oversees roughly $50 trillion in assets and powers platforms across payments, security, settlement, wealth, investments, collateral, trading, and more for clients in over 100 markets around the world. As the world changes and global financial markets evolve, so do we. Earlier this year, in January, you heard us lay out our strategy, which maps out what we need to get done and how we need to do it. Last month, we introduced changes to our logo and simplified and modernized our company brand to BNY to improve the market's familiarity with who we are and what we do. This rebranding better aligns the perception of our company to the substance of what we're doing to unlock our full potential as one BNY. Now referring to Page 2 of the financial highlights presentation. BNY delivered solid EPS growth as well as pre-tax margin and ROTCE expansion once again on the back of positive operating leverage in the second quarter. Reported earnings per share of $1.52 were up 16% year-over-year. And excluding notable items, earnings per share of $1.51 were up 9%. Total revenue of $4.6 billion was up 2% year-over-year. This included 5% growth in investment services fees led by continued strength in Clearance and Collateral Management, Asset Servicing and Treasury Services, as well as 16% growth in foreign exchange revenue. Net interest income decreased by 6%. Expenses of $3.1 billion was down 1% year-over-year. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 1%, reflecting further investments in our people and technology while we also continued to realize greater efficiencies. Margin was 33%. And in what is seasonally our strongest quarter, we reported a return on tangible common equity of 25%, 24% excluding notable items. These financial results were against the backdrop of a relatively constructive operating environment. The market calling for a gradual and shallow easing of policy rates, inflation pressures easing, and investor confidence growing. On average, equity market values increased, while fixed income markets finished slightly lower compared to the first quarter. A couple of weeks ago, the Federal Reserve released the results of its annual bank stress test, which once again showcased our resilient business model and our strength to support clients through extreme stress scenarios. The test confirmed that our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement remains at the regulatory floor of 2.5%. And we increased our quarterly common dividend by 12% to $0.47 per share starting this quarter. In May, the transition to T+1 settlement in the US, Canadian and Mexican markets represented one of the more significant market structure changes that our industry has seen in a couple of decades. BNY's critical role in the financial system gives us the opportunity to help clients through major shifts like this, further strengthening their trust in us and deepening our relationships with them. By running the company better, we are starting to capitalize on BNY's truly powerful combination of security services, market and wealth services, and our investments and wealth businesses to serve our clients more effectively across the entire financial life cycle. As an example, this past quarter BNY was awarded a significant mandate by a premier global asset manager with over $100 billion in assets under management. We were selected based on our ability to deliver custody, fund servicing, ETF and digital fund services, Treasury Services, and Pershing. Our holistic offering will power their future growth strategy. In another example, AIA, the pan-Asian life insurance group, announced a new collaboration with BNY and BlackRock as AIA transforms its investment platform. AIA has announced that they will implement BNY's specialized investment operations, data management services, and technology with BlackRock's Aladdin to create a connected and scalable ecosystem to support the company's evolving investment activities. We also continue to be pleased with the growing interest in our wealth advisory platform, Wove. Global Finance recently named Wove as one of the top three global financial innovations as part of its annual Innovators Awards for 2024. At INSITE, Pershing's annual flagship wealth services conference in June, we announced a suite of new solutions on the platform. Wove Investor, a one-stop client portal. Wove Data, a cloud data platform designed for financial professionals at wealth management firms, and Portfolio Solutions, a set of enhancements to the platform that will help advisors move more efficiently from researching investment products, to aligning them to a client's risk objectives and adding them to a portfolio. We also introduced a new ONE BNY offering that enables clients to easily access multiple BNY capabilities, including our managed accounts platform, asset allocation and manager selection, investment management products, customized tax solutions, the interoperable Wove platform for advisors, and custody and clearing services from Pershing. We're a comprehensive unified package leveraging the breadth of BNY to make clients' wealth advisors lives easier. And we have proof points. Example, a fast growing full service regional bank recently selected Pershing to provide custody and clearing services private wealth business. But they are also adopting [Dreyfus Cash Management] (ph), direct indexing, and private banking. As we've said many times, our culture and people are a critical part of being more for our clients and running our company better. We are pleased to see that our actions are enabling us to be a top talent destination for recent graduates and experienced leaders alike. This summer, we're welcoming our largest ever intern and analyst classes, a total of over 3,500 individuals chosen from over 150,000 applications. And we recently announced several new appointments to our leadership team. Shannon Hobbs, our new Chief People Officer joined us in June. Leigh-Ann Russell will join us in September as Chief Information Officer and Global Head of Engineering. Jose Minaya will also join us in September, lead BNY's Investments and Wealth. To wrap up, halfway through the year, we're pleased with the progress that we have made and how it is reflected in both improved financial performance to date as well as our building momentum. One of my favorite quotes comes from Alexander Hamilton, our founder, who famously said that he attributed his success not to genius, but to hard work. We have been hard at work, and we've laid a solid foundation. Our team is in full execution mode and we're starting to demonstrate the power of our franchise and of operating as one BNY for our clients and our shareholders. With that, over to you, Dermot. Dermot McDonogh : Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. Picking up on Page 3 of the presentation, I'll start with our consolidated financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $4.6 billion was up 2% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 4%. This includes 5% growth in investment services fees on the back of higher market values, net new business, and higher client activity. Investment management and performance fees were flat. Firm-wide AUC/A of $49.5 trillion were up 6% year-over-year and assets under management of $2 trillion were up 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values. Foreign exchange revenue increased by 16%, driven by higher volumes. Investment and other revenue was $169 million in the quarter on the back of strong client activity in our fixed income and equity trading business. And net interest income decreased by 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting changes in balance sheet mix, partially offset by higher interest rates. Expenses were down 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items, primarily in the prior year. The increase from higher investments, employee merit increases, and higher revenue related expenses was partially offset by efficiency savings from running our company better. Notable items in the second quarter of this year primarily included an expense benefit from a reduction in the FDIC's special assessment, which was largely offset by severance expense. There was no provision for credit losses in the quarter. As Robin highlighted earlier, we reported earnings per share of $1.52, up 16% year-over-year, a pre-tax margin of 33% and a return on tangible common equity of 25%. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.51, up 9% year-over-year, pre-tax margin was 33% and our return on tangible common equity was 24%. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 5.8%. Average assets increased by 2% sequentially on the back of deposit growth. And Tier 1 capital increased by 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings, partially offset by capital returns to common shareholders. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.4%. The quarter-over-quarter improvement reflects lower risk-weighted assets coming off the temporary increase in risk-weighted assets at the end of the previous quarter, and CET1 capital increased by 2% sequentially. Over the course of the second quarter, we returned over $900 million of capital to our common shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of 81%. Year to date, we returned 107% of earnings to our common shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Turning to liquidity. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 115%, and our consolidated net stable funding ratio was 132%. Next, net interest income and the underlying balance sheet trends on Page 5. Net interest income of over $1 billion was down 6% year-over-year and down 1% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by changes in balance sheet mix, partially offset by the benefit of reinvesting maturing fixed rate securities in higher yielding alternatives. Average deposit balances increased by 2% sequentially. Interest bearing deposits grew by 3%, and non-interest bearing deposits declined by 2% in the quarter. Average interest-earning assets were up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our average investment securities portfolio balances increased by 3%, and our cash and reverse repo balances increased by 1%. Average loan balances were up 4%. Turning to our business segments starting on Page 6. Security Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, flat year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 3% year-over-year. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 4%, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business. We continue to see strong momentum in ETF servicing with AUC/A of over $2 trillion, up more than 50% year-on-year, and the number of funds serviced up over 20% year-on-year. This growth reflects both higher market values as well as client inflows, which included a large ETF mandate in Ireland from a leading global asset manager. In alternatives, fund launches for the quarter continued their recent activity in private markets. Investment services fees for alternatives were up mid-single-digits, reflecting growth from both new and existing clients. And in Issuer Services, investment services fees were up 1%, reflecting net new business across both Corporate Trust and Depositary Receipts, partially offset by the normalization of elevated fees associated with corporate actions in Depositary Receipts in the second quarter of last year. We're particularly pleased to see the investments and new leaders in our Corporate Trust platform beginning to bear fruit. Against the backdrop of a significant pickup in CLO issuance in recent months, we've been moving up the ranks and improved our market share as trustee for CLOs by about 4 percentage points over the past 12 months to 20% in the second quarter. In the segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 16% year-over-year, and net interest income was down 11%. Expenses of $1.6 billion were down 1% year-over-year, reflecting efficiency savings, partially offset by higher investments, employee merit increases, and higher revenue-related expenses. Pre-tax income was $688 million, a 7% increase year-over-year, and pre-tax margin expanded to 31%. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 7. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 7% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 2%, reflecting higher market values and client activity, partially offset by the impact of business lost in the prior year. Net new assets were negative $23 billion for the quarter, reflecting the ongoing deconversion of the before-mentioned lost business. Excluding the deconversion, we saw approximately 2% annualized net new asset growth in the second quarter, and we renewed a multi-year agreement with Osaic, one of the nation's largest providers of wealth management solutions. Pershing has supported Osaic since its founding in 1988, and we are proud to help the company drive its growth strategy for years to come. Client demand for Wove continues to be strong. In the quarter, we signed 12 additional client agreements. The pipeline continues to grow, and we are on track to meet our goal of $30 million to $40 million realized revenue in 2024. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 15%, primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and higher clearance volumes. US securities clearance and settlement volumes have remained strong throughout the quarter, supported by a grown market and active trading. And we are excited about the opportunity to do even more for clients. Having realigned Pershing's institutional solutions business to Clearance and Collateral Management, we can offer clients a choice across a continuum of clearance, settlement, and financing solutions for those that sell clear as well as those seeking capital and operational efficiency through outsourcing. This allows us to not only deepen our relationships with clients, but also drive continued revenue growth. And in Treasury Services, investment services fees increased by 10%, primarily reflecting net new business and higher client activity. Net interest income for the segment overall was down 1% year-over-year. Expenses of $833 million were up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments, employee merit increases, and higher revenue related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was up 8% year-over-year at $704 million, representing a 46% pre-tax margin. Moving on to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 8. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $821 million, up 1% year-over-year. In our investment management business, revenue was down 1%, reflecting the mix of AUM flows and lower equity investment income and seed capital gains partially offset by higher market values. And in wealth management, revenue increased by 3%, reflecting higher market values, partially offset by changes in product mix. Expenses of $668 million were down 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting our work to drive efficiency savings and lower revenue related expenses, partially offset by employee merit increases and higher investments. Pre-tax income was $149 million, up 15% year-over-year, representing a pre-tax margin of 18%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2 trillion increased by 7% year-over-year. In the quarter, while we saw $2 billion of net inflows into long-term active strategies with continued strength in fixed income and LDI, partially offset by net outflows in active equity and multi-asset strategies, we saw $4 billion of net outflows from index strategies and $7 billion of net outflows from short-term strategies. Wealth management client assets of $308 billion increased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 9 shows the results of the Other Segment. I'll close with a couple of comments on our outlook for the full year 2024. Starting with NII, I'm pleased to report that the first half of the year came in slightly better than we had expected, as we saw the decline in non-interest-bearing deposits decelerate, and we continue to grow interest-bearing deposits. While we are cautiously optimistic, we remain humble as we head into the seasonally low summer months, and for now we will therefore keep our NII outlook for the full year 2024 unchanged, down 10% year-over-year. Regarding expenses, our goal remains to keep expenses excluding notable items for the full year 2024 roughly flat. As Robin put it earlier, BNY is in execution mode and we're embracing the hard work ahead of us. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be between 23% and 24%. And lastly, we continue to expect to return 100% or more of 2024 earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Our Board of Directors declared a 12% increased common dividend for the third quarter, and we plan to continue repurchasing common shares under our existing share repurchase program. As always, we are calibrating the pace of our buybacks, considering various factors such as our capital management targets, the macroeconomic and interest rate environment, as well as the size of our balance sheet. To wrap up, we enter the second half of the year on the back of solid fee growth, a better than expected NII performance to date, and continued expense discipline, which gives us incremental confidence in our ability to drive positive operating leverage in 2024. With that, Operator, can you please open the line for Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Good morning. Robin Vince : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Good morning. Just like to go -- just ask Dermot about that NII humbleness for the second half. Can you just walk us through what the moving pieces would be, including the seasonality that you mentioned and any other things that might have been over-earning in the NII in the first quarter so that you would seemingly in your maintain guide still expect a meaningful ramp down in NII, which I don't think is what seems to be the base case given how well the balance sheet has held up so far, as you pointed out, relative to your expectations? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh : Thanks for the question, Ken. I guess the best way to answer the question is a little bit to, in some ways, look back at last year where Q1, Q2, typically strong quarters for us. Q3, typically a seasonally lower quarter, summer months, clients taking their foot off the gas in terms of activity, and then we pick back up again in Q4. Now, as you've seen from this quarter's numbers and the first half overall, we're very pleased with the performance. I guess we've outperformed our expectations for the first half, and that's in large part due to underlying activity within our core businesses, and in my remarks, I particularly called out corporate trust, where we saw like elevated activity in the CLO space which in turn drives deposits. So when our core businesses are doing well, which they've all performed well, that has a knock-on impact in the number of deposits that we have And so we outperformed our expectations in the first half. Notwithstanding that, when I look out at the rest of the year and when we gave the guidance of down 10% in January, the market at that time was roughly calling for six rate cuts. Now we're in the middle of the summer. We had a slowdown in inflation print yesterday. Let's see how Jay speaks on Monday and how he guides out of [Jackson Hole] (ph) and into a September potential rate cut. But we kind of take all of those levers and we just kind of say for now, there's no point in me changing guidance to change guidance again in September or October at the next call. So we're cautiously optimistic. I think I used the word last year in March, askew. So we're playing for the best outcome, but we do expect Q3 to be somewhat seasonally quieter. And that's why we didn't change our guidance. Ken Usdin : Okay, and then just can you -- that follow up, just on the size of the deposit, so you're just expecting the size of the deposit base to decline or is it the mix or just trying to understand what pieces of it would revert given that seasonality? Dermot McDonogh : So when I think about deposits, I kind of -- I think there are three components to it. One is interest bearing deposits where we outperformed plan, NIBs where we outperformed plan. And so pleased with that, but that really reflects clients showing up in a different way with us and we showing up in a different way with clients. So, good. And then the third thing, and I've talked about this a number of times on previous calls, really the strength of the collaboration and teamwork between our treasurer, our CIO, and our global liquidity solutions platform, where we think about liquidity as a $1.4 trillion ecosystem. And we've been very much in offense mode this quarter. And our GLS team has really shown up in a positive way. And we've really managed to gather good, liquidity-friendly deposits, which is kind of fueling the growth of our balance sheet, and that's allowed us to do more loans. So I think in terms of specifically to your question, it's both, I think the overall balance will come down, and as a consequence, I would expect NIBs from here to grind a little bit lower, which is the main driver of the NII change. Ken Usdin : Right. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. Robin Vince : Hey, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : You alluded to the -- hello. You alluded to the higher Clearance and Collateral Management, higher clearance volumes. I'm just curious if you can parse out how much of that is just clients being more active during a more active second quarter versus winning new business and organic growth. It just might help for the thoughts on the go forward and how to model? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh : Thanks, Glenn. I think it's a combination of both. So, clients are for sure doing more. Rate volatility in Q2 was there for all to see. So as a consequence, more activity in the treasury market, more treasury issuance and which feeds volumes. So, overall, very healthy volumes, and we have a high-margin scaled business, which the platform was able to benefit from that increased level of activity. Also, I think as we did last year, we continue to innovate for clients in the domestic market. And as we said on our January call, the international business is also a key growth opportunity for us and our teams are innovating and developing new products and solutions for our clients internationally. And so I think it's a combination of all the factors that we've talked about on previous calls, kind of showed up as a nice tailwind for us this quarter. And for Clearance and Collateral Management, I think I do expect that trend to continue in the near term. Glenn Schorr : Thanks, Dermot. You piqued my interest. In the opening remarks, you all talked about T+1 coming in into the market and that helping -- you helping -- help clients. I'm curious now that it's built, now that it's in the run rate, just a couple of quickies of, is there a cost runoff now or is that not big enough? Does T+1 come with lower spread for you, but does it free up capital with more frequent settlement? I'm just curious what the net impact of it all is. Dermot McDonogh : Hey, Glenn, I would describe it in terms of like the raw P&L impact, which is sort of the second part of your question, is really pretty de minimis. We spent a bunch of time preparing for this over the course of the past couple of years. So it wasn't like there was some big hump in the cost curve in order to really do it. We sort of worked the process over time. But for us, I think the biggest opportunity associated with T+1 is whenever there's a market inflection like this, and this was one of the most significant ones, but we're looking ahead to treasury clearing is another good example of something like that, it gives us the opportunity get closer to our clients. It creates uncertainty for our clients. How is it going to work and they need help navigating it. And so the combination of uncertainty and a need for assistance is really the macro opportunity for us. And we've leant into that. We'll continue leaning into those types of market changes, again, with treasury clearing being another good example. And I would say overall, these types of changes create things that create more efficiency in the market, things that can reduce risk in the market, things that improve efficiency. Sure, they do sometimes call on more of our products and solutions, which, of course, is great, but it's also just a good thing for the market to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of market operation. And I think over time, we're also a beneficiary of that. Glenn Schorr : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : [Technical Difficulty] Robin Vince : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Maybe just one follow-up, Dermot, for you on NII. I guess in response to Ken's question, you talked about Fed policy and that having an impact. Remind us the positioning of the balance sheet if the Fed does decide to cut rates come September and we get 100, 150 bps of cuts? Remind us how the balance sheet will behave, how we should think about NII in that backdrop? Dermot McDonogh : So, thanks for the question. So I will kind of give a couple of different perspectives on that is, one, cumulative betas are roughly unchanged quarter-over-quarter, which feels like I really believe our book to be fairly priced. As you will remember, our book is largely institutional. We pass on the rates and so cumulative betas are in good shape. So for the dollar portfolio, roughly low 80s, 80 range. And then for euros and sterling we\u2019re in the high 50s, low 60s. And so we kind of do a range of scenarios and at the beginning of the year, we're positioned roughly -- we're roughly flat. So if Chairman Powell cuts in September and then cuts again, I guess, which is the general view of the market, we're kind of basically NII, okay, it doesn't really impact the book that much. So for small moves, we're well positioned in terms of expectation. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. And separately, I guess, maybe Robin, for you just in terms of the fee revenue momentum that you talked about at Pershing and elsewhere, just give us a sense around what the drivers we should be thinking as we think about sort of the medium-term outlook on fee revenue outside of just pure markets activity that could drive fees in a world where NII might be stable to lower as we think about sort of momentum on the positive outlook. Robin Vince : Sure. Revenue growth in any given year is somewhat market-dependent because, of course, interest rates, equity fixed income markets, volumes volatility, that stuff all moves around, but our strategy has been, of course, to fuel the organic growth of the company, but also to try to position our businesses to be able to respond as well as they can to growth tailwinds that exist just in markets. And so in answer to Ken -- the question earlier on around the treasury market, we've positioned that business to be able to benefit from what we think is a secular growth in activity in the US treasury market. So that's a place where we're benefiting, yes, from the market, we\u2019re also benefiting from the investments that Dermot detailed. And as we go through what's next for our fee growth, we talked a lot about our ONE BNY campaign quarters ago. And we talked last quarter and in January about the fact that we're sort of operationalizing more and more what started off as a movement of ONE BNY into referrals, into new targets, into our commercial model and our Chief Commercial Officer joining and really then getting into the client coverage, the practices, the integrated solutions, which we talked about in our prepared remarks, the fact that we can now bundle individual products into true solutions for clients. So there are a lot of levers on the fee growth, and we've been working very methodically through our plan to build momentum in that space, but also to position the business to be able to take advantage of macro things going on in the market. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Robin Vince : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning, Robin and good morning, Dermot. Robin Vince : Good morning, Steven. Steven Chubak : So I guess I wanted to build on that earlier line of questioning, but really focusing more on repo activity. It's been a big area of investor focus. You've certainly benefited from recent strength on the repo side. And I was hoping you could potentially quantify the benefit year-on-year from elevated repo activity and just longer term, like, how you're thinking about the durability of the recent repo strength? And what are some of the factors supporting that view? Dermot McDonogh : Thanks for the question, Steven. So I would say in terms of year-on-year activity, it's not a kind of a -- cleared repo is not a game changer for us in terms of the overall year-on-year NII story. It's about -- overall in its totality, it makes up about 5% of our NII today. I think I would just echo our follow-on from Robin's answer to the last question in terms of it's a product. Clients want us we're meeting them where they want to be, we're innovating. This come under the $1.4 trillion liquidity ecosystem. Laide runs that business, does a terrific job for us in the clear repo business specifically, we're a top three provider. And so we have a large installed client base who are looking for products and we can meet them with our cleared repo product. And so it's just another tool in our toolbox. And I would say, again, we're positioned, we're investing, we're a scale player and we can provide automated solutions for our clients. So I do expect that business to continue to grow, but in terms of the year-over-year to your specific question, it's not a material driver of the year-over-year change. Robin Vince : Steven, I would add one thing to it, which is just remember that in the context of our business, we're really the only global solution provider in the space because we're scaled in Asia, we're scaled in Europe, we\u2019re scaled in the United States. And in a world where folks are looking at repo as a collateral tool and an investment tool, the opportunity to be able to help clients navigate the whole world in this product, provide the seamless connectivity between repo and margin and collateral management the connectivity to other things that we do, there's a real appeal, to use Dermot's phrase again about meeting clients where they are. There's a real appeal here for clients in terms of the breadth of what we can offer, but also the innovation that he referred to earlier on in the call where we're creating these new solutions. And so this is another example, along with the US treasury market, but there are so many others in our business of saying there's a macro evolution going on, and we have the opportunity to participate in that as long as we're front-footed with clients and as long as we're innovating. Steven Chubak : Thanks for all that color. And just for my follow-up on the Pershing business. I know that the core underlying strength has been obscure to some degree by some large client departures. I was hoping you can give some perspective on what some of the core organic growth trends look like in that business? What the pipeline looks like in that business given some of the recent excitement of our Wove platform and the offering? And have we lapped those headwinds at this point, or is there still some remaining pressure on the come? Dermot McDonogh : Okay. So I would say nobody is happier to see the ongoing deconversion of the clients to come to an end. So we expect that to be fully out of the portfolio by Q3. As I've said on previous calls, we believe in our ability to earn our way through that deconversion. It happens in life. And so I think the team has been very resilient in terms of earning their way through it and growing. In my prepared remarks, I talked about the re-sign of Osaic on a several year contract. So we're very pleased about that. You take a step back and you look at where we were 12 months ago, we just came off the INSITE conference in Florida where we announced Wove, 12 months later we've announced a new suite of products to support the Wove. We have signed 21 clients so far this year for Wove. The momentum is building, the clients like us. We -- I kind of reiterated my guidance on prepared remarks about the $30 million to $40 million of revenue for this year. And then just I'll remind you that we're a $3 trillion player in the wealth tech space, number one with broker-dealers, top three with RIAs. And in previous quarters, I've kind of guided mid-single-digits of underlying core growth through the cycle. We continue to believe that, notwithstanding on any given quarter, it may be slower or better. But we believe we're in good shape, and there is good momentum in what is a very, very large market, and in which we're a very big player. Steven Chubak : Very helpful color. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Robin Vince : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question is coming from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning Robin and Dermot. Thanks for taking my questions. So we saw the ECB cut rates this quarter. And while I know euro is in a huge exposure for you in terms of your deposit base, curious about what impact you saw that on your deposit costs in that currency. And maybe how does that experience and the market reaction inform your expectations for beta and customer behavior around rate cuts in other currencies? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh : So I would say, overall, euros is roughly 10% of the total portfolio. To -- in answer to the earlier question, I think where we feel very well positioned for the range of outcomes that the forward curve is implying in euros, sterling and dollars, we prepare for it. We talk about it a lot. And so I kind of feel like the way the CIO book is currently set up, where we still have a reasonable amount of securities rolling off into higher-yielding assets. So I just feel like the combination of where our deposit book is in terms of our betas to reiterate again for dollars, low 80s sterling and euros high 60s. And the CIO book kind of still room to grow. And so on rate cuts in terms of how we kind of position the book, we're broadly symmetric in terms of -- on the rate cut side. So I think Chairman Powell has done a job of telegraphing to the market how he wants to do it. So I don't think it's going to be a volatile move in rates when it happens. So he's allowed us time to position and manage and get into the right place. So I think overall, I feel very good about where we're at. Brennan Hawken : Yeah. But what I was asking -- I appreciate that. What I was trying to understand was the actual experience with -- in the actual marketplace beyond like the expectation. Did the 50% to 60% beta, I think you said in euros, did that hold when the cut went through? And did you actually experience that? Dermot McDonogh : So specifically, yes, we did experience that, and it held up. It behaved as expected. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. Thank you for that, Dermot. I appreciate that. Issuer Services very solid. You flagged some CLO trustee gains on the back of a market that's seen solid volume. Could you help us understand maybe how much of the strength and the growth that you saw in that line was attributed to that, which I assume would be in the in the Corporate Trust business and then maybe how to think about the Depositary Receipt fees, just so we're thinking about the right way to baseline and move forward with our models? Dermot McDonogh : For sure. Look, Corporate Trust, I think, is, for us, a good opportunity, a very good opportunity. I actually talked about it at some length at the RBC Conference in March when I was chatting with Gerard Cassidy. And I think over the last number of years, Corporate Trust for BNY is a business that's been underinvested in both technology and leadership. And in both Robin and I\u2019s prepared remarks, we did emphasize leadership has been a continuous change for us. And we've made a very -- couple of very important hires over the last 12 months in Corporate Trust, and we have new leadership overseeing the business. And it's that investment and in technology, products, leadership that is showing up. And specifically, we've doubled our activity in CLOs over the last 12 months. We've improved our market share. And as Robin said, a couple -- in an answer to another question, we really want to position Corporate Trust as a business that really can take the advantage of scale, a lot of manual processes, a lot of room for AI, a lot of room for digitization and we can improve the operating leverage of that business. We can improve how we show up for clients, client service. So we feel like in Corporate Trust specifically, we have a lot to play for. Depositary Receipts, we have good market share. We punch above us and we expect that to continue. Brennan Hawken : Thank you for taking my questions. Robin Vince : Thanks, Brennan. Operator : Our next question is coming from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Robin Vince : Morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Two quick questions. One, just to wrap up a little bit on the T+1 discussion earlier. Could you give us a sense of how much did T+1 drive sequential revenue growth this quarter? And can you give us a sense as to if there's enough revenue growth you're expecting from this to impact the expense ratio since you've already made the investment? And then I have a follow-up on Wove. Thanks. Dermot McDonogh : Hi, Betsy, it's Dermot. So the point I would make about T+1 is not so much a revenue or expense topic. It really is -- it speaks to resilience as a commercial attribute kind of point that we make on behalf of BNY in terms of it's been a large-scale infrastructure change that's been coming to the markets over the last couple of years. And as we are a key player in the financial market infrastructure, it's very important that we execute that to an A+ standard. And what I would say is BNY has shown up for clients and delivering an A+ execution of a very big project. It's not really about revenue or expenses, it\u2019s really about delivering a complicated change project for our clients and the ecosystem at large. That's really, I think, the point we're trying to make on T+1. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Yeah, I just think if you're in a better spot than others, you could pick up some incremental share on the back of that, but that's maybe a couple of conference calls from here. All right. Then separately on Wove, I know you mentioned that you added new clients to Wove. I just wanted to understand, is this new clients of the firm or this is clients who had been yours for a while and they moved to Wove? Dermot McDonogh : So I would say it's both. And so I guess the questions that we've had on previous calls, Betsy, are we cannibalizing existing clients? And the answer to that is most definitely no. And I think it speaks to the point of us innovating. Wove is a very big investment for us in terms of technology over multiple years. Existing clients like the fact that we're willing to put money to work for them and give them better solutions and as a consequence of that, we had over 1,500 people show up to Wove in Florida last year, in Nashville this year. And for those that are there, there's real excitement. And as Robin said in his prepared remarks, it's winning awards. So there's a flywheel effect of, BNY is showing up in the wealth tech space and delivering new solutions for us, we want to see what they have to do. So the network effect of that shouldn't be underestimated. Robin Vince : Betsy, let me double-click on it for one second as well because when we started on the Wove journey, and we announced it, as Dermot said, last year, it was initially really focused on that singular KPI of making advisors' lives easier. And so it was a technology front end that went from wealth planning and help clients with wealth planning all the way through to portfolio construction and then getting into market. Now what's evolved since then and what we talked a lot about this year, one year later in the Wove journey was the fact that now we have the opportunity to link all of these other BNY capabilities to be able to deliver to our Pershing and Wove clients. So you can be a clearing and custody client of Pershing, you can be an adviser taking advantage of that initial set of tooling from Wove, but what you can now also do is you can have that ability to manage and aggregate data, including across multiple custodians. We can connect you to models in the investment management space. By the way, we can fulfill those models because we've got active equity and indexing and all these capabilities that come from BNY investments. And so Wove is becoming a bit more of a delivery vehicle for the various capabilities of the firm and it's also opening the aperture of how clients of Pershing think about us in terms of our ability to solve other problems for them, banking-as-a-service which is a Treasury Services business. But we stimulate the conversation for that because people see us as being more than what we used to be in Pershing. We also, to your question, are attracting people who don't necessarily need the clearing and custody service, but who want to take advantage of these other components, which is why Dermot said both because it's both and delivering the breadth of ONE BNY. Betsy Graseck : Thanks, Robin. Robin Vince : Thank you, Betsy. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Could you put a little more meat on the bones for the ONE BNY initiative in terms of products for customers where you're talking about more bundled solutions. Thematically, I understand it. And I guess you're having higher core servicing fees, but connecting from the higher core servicing fees from the high level, let's bundle, let's have everyone work together. I'm just trying to connect the dots a little more. Robin Vince : Understood, Mike. And you'd asked me a question, it\u2019s probably about more than a year ago now, where you had essentially challenged the fact that in order for something like ONE BNY to be successful, it can't just be hearts and minds, it's got to be deeply operationalized. And we talked at that time about some of our future ambitions for how to really bring it home. So the way that I would now answer your question is, we are rallying around the three strategic pillars that Dermot and I both have talked about a bunch, and this is about being more for our clients. And that's not just words anymore. It's not just a movement. It's just appealing to our people to be able to do -- to be client-obsessed. It's about elevating the effectiveness of our sales organization and the process driving client service differently than we used to. It's about the innovative new products, as we were just talking about Wove, that's a good example. We are being more for clients in that example. And we are also delivering the whole of the company. So it is a great ONE BNY example. Pershing, which used to be somewhat off to the side in the company a few years back, now very much at the heart and benefiting from that integration with all of the other capabilities that we have. And then you hit on a critical word, which is solutions, because that next journey to use the term that Dermot used earlier on of meeting our clients where they are, it's not just about us selling a bunch of great products and client platforms to our clients, it's about the fact that when we look at the challenges that our clients have, they actually need things that cut across multiple parts of our company. And rather than going in disconnected and showing them individually and trying to have them piece it all together, we can now show up and we can actually show them these solutions which bring all the componentry together to solve their needs. And both Dermot and I talked a bit about that in our prepared remarks, and that's the next level of the maturity of that ONE BNY work that we're really doing. That's [involving] (ph) from an initiative and hearts and minds to making everything that we're doing in our commercial organization, the sales practices, the sales targets, the way that we're bringing people together, the account management process, the client service, the digital delivery of tooling and the way that we're thinking about everything that equips our salespeople to be effective across training, we're bringing all of those things together and maturing our commercial model. And over time, we think there's a lot of value both in the process and in what we're actually delivering to clients. Mike Mayo : And so when you wrap it all up, I mean, what wallet share do you have per customer today? Where was it a few years ago? Where do you hope that to go just in terms of a ZIP code of expectations? Robin Vince : Got it. I think some of those metrics as we think about ways in which to show you that story more over time, some of those metrics will be in our future. Right now, I'm going to point you to two things. There are a whole bunch of inputs. I described a bunch of them. And I think over the course of the past couple of years, we've been trying to really show the key inputs, which we think are the leading indicators for performance. And then you have to actually look at the fee growth result, and you saw that in the first quarter. You've seen that in the second quarter, and that's some of the output. But the story that Dermot and I are trying to describe is a story of a maturing of a process, but with still a distance to go and opportunity ahead. Dermot McDonogh : Mike, just to put a metric on us, it's just to give an indication because we need to mature the metrics as we proceduralize all the strategic comments that Robin has just outlined. Year-over-year, the amount of business that we've won that touches more than one line of business has increased by a third of albeit a very low base. So I wouldn't draw too much into the metric, but just the fact that we are showing up in a different way and clients are buying products and services from more than one line of business because we can deliver integrated solutions. And that's the key that over time, we'll be able to track that and communicate that in a more objective way as that strategy takes root. Mike Mayo : Understood. So when all said and done, core servicing fees over time, whether it's aspiration or a specific target, where should core servicing fee growth be? Robin Vince : My answer to that, which I recognize is a little bit unsatisfying, is we're going to keep pointing you back to the positive operating leverage, which is really how we're focusing for our own growth. We think that each quarter, each year has a different composition to it, but higher fee growth over time is a very important part of that combination of solutions. But any individual quarter or a year is going to have a different composition. We're controlling the things that we can control, albeit we're stoking the engine for growth of organic fees over time. Mike Mayo : Got it. Thank you. Robin Vince : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in on this. I wanted to touch on expenses and operating leverage. So, expenses up a little bit year-to-date year-over-year. It sounds like you guys are still targeting flat expenses for the year despite the fact that revenues are obviously shaking out a little bit better than you hoped. So maybe kind of walk us through where you see the flex in the expense base to keep it kind of at that flattish run rate. But I guess more importantly, you guys had a target for pre-tax margin to be at 33% plus recently. You're doing 33% this quarter and obviously you don't want to get too carried away with a single quarter, but it feels like you have an ability to reset the bar. So maybe talk a little bit about what that plus within the 33% could look like a couple of years out? Dermot McDonogh : Thanks, Alex. So I guess I would start with the margin part of this. We need to consistently do it. And so one quarter doesn't a medium-term target make. So I'm very pleased that we've done this, but now I want to see it next quarter, the following quarter, the following quarter. So, execution is key. And just showing up in a very disciplined way every day is really important to delivering out that. We don't want to be known as a one-hit wonder. So while I'm pleased that we've managed to do it, I want to see it repeated on a consistent basis. So that's what I would say on margin. On expenses, you and I talked in Madrid a few weeks back at your conference. And I kind of said a little bit like we're in the ZIP code of flat for the year. It's all about running the company better. It's very important that we have 53,000 people wrapped around the same aspiration that we as a leadership team have and everybody is focused on doing it. So there is a real momentum on running the company better, which is the input to how we show up with expenses were being where they are as opposed to a top-down approach. So very different cultural experience within the firm in terms of how we're doing it. And the reason why we're a little bit above trend in the first couple of quarters this year is what I said to you at the conference is revenue-related expenses. And so I kind of anchor that in overall where we are for positive operating leverage in the year. And in my remarks, I kind of said I feel optimistic about delivering positive operating leverage for the year, which in a down 10% NII environment, BNY hasn't really executed to that level before. And so -- and also, Q2 is a seasonally strong quarter for us, which would feed the margin of 33%. So I feel good about expenses. I feel good about flat, notwithstanding there's pressure to that from a revenue-related expense part, but we're very determined to deliver positive operating leverage to our shareholders this year. Alex Blostein : Excellent. Great. Well, my second quick question around the balance sheet. There's a lot of discussion around deposits, but I wanted to zone in on the asset side of the balance sheet for a second. We've seen pretty nice growth from you guys in both the securities portfolio and loans sequentially. So could you just spend a minute on sort of the sources where you're investing and then your outlook in maybe deploying some of the liquidity that seems to be perhaps a bit more sticky into both loan growth and securities? Dermot McDonogh : So yeah, look, very -- feel very proud of the CIO book team, what they've accomplished over the last couple of years, which is really from Q3 of '22. It really has been just a terrific collaboration with inside the firm. And we're deploying where we think we can see opportunity. Our CIO likes to use the word nibbling, and so we're kind of seeing where the next leg is, and we're deploying where we think we can see opportunity to continue to grow NII. So it's opportunistic at the moment, but we feel overall very good about that aspect of us. We're still rolling off the book into higher-yielding securities. We're picking up to 200 basis points, and so that's feeding NII. And then on loan growth, I think the GLS team is doing a really good job of getting very liquidity-friendly deposits, which allows us to extend credit to our clients. And I think we're showing up in a different way to our clients who are important to us and extending our balance sheet to them as they look to buy products in more than one line of business. So where we need the balance sheet to support business activities, that's what we're doing. And it's a kind of a -- it's a strategic tool in our kit for doing that. Alex Blostein : Awesome. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is coming from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Dermot. Good morning, Robin. Robin Vince : Morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Dermot, can you share with us, now that we're entering into a phase with monetary policy of quantitative tightening easing up a bit, you guys obviously have been through QE, you've seen the initial stages of QT, do you have any thoughts on how this could affect your balance sheet over the next 12 to 18 months? Have you guys done any type of modeling to see what kind of effect the QT as it shrinks could have on your balance sheet? Dermot McDonogh : So, we do a lot of work on that, Gerard. And look, CCAR forces us to do that work as well. And so rates up, rates down, quantitative tightening, quantitative easening. We look at it every which way to Sunday. But the thing that I would kind of remind you and everybody who's listening in is our balance sheet is one of our strengths. In -- this time last year, in Q1 of last year, we kind of -- we called our balance sheet a port in a storm for our clients and you see that fly to quality. So we're kind of very proud of our balance sheet. It's vanilla, it's liquid, it stands stress tests and it allows us to be there for our clients. So it's kind of -- it's short in duration. We repositioned it going into the higher-for-longer rate environment. As you will remember in Q4 of '22, we repositioned it. And so we've taken a lot of proactive steps to make our balance sheet durable and liquid and to withstand a wide range of scenarios. Robin Vince : And, Gerard, I'm just going to add that it's easy to think that just because at this very moment in time, we're looking out, there seems to be some greater consensus than we've had for a little while around what might happen with the Fed in the fall across September and the balance of the year. It's easy to think somehow that the range of risks has somehow narrowed as a result of that. But there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world. We've got all bunch of other types of geopolitical risks out in the world. We're sort of continuing to grind through elections that we've talked about through the course of the year. There are all sorts of other things happening. We've still got wars going on. And so our approach to all of these questions, and Dermot really made the point, is to be prepared for all the different types of outcomes that are possible. And so you can see us, we run conservative on liquidity, we run conservative on capital. You can see it in our ratios that we talked about and that Dermot outlined in his prepared remarks. And that's a very important anchor point for us so that we can be agile according to however things play out because the one thing we can be absolutely sure of is they won't play out exactly the way anybody expects. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just as a follow-up, Robin, you talked about the new business wins in the quarter, and you talked about ONE BNY as well. It appears that you're having success in chipping down or breaking down some of the silos that many organizations always struggle with. Can you share with us some of the tools you're using to break those silos? And how -- I would assume you're not 100% complete breaking them all down, but how far along are you in actually breaking them down? Robin Vince : Well, the company\u2019s been around for 240 years, and we've acquired a lot of different businesses and companies over time. And so these things do build up over a period of time. But the short answer to your question is, we passionately believe as a whole leadership team that the answer to the question is culture. And so I've said before in a slightly pithy way and quoting other people or sort of paraphrasing them, if you will, that culture eats strategy for breakfast, as it was once famously said by Peter Drucker. And we add to that, execution eats strategy for lunch. That's just a long way of saying that the power our culture pillar, which is one of our three pillars, is the thing that's enabling us to run our company better. And that, in turn, is allowing us to be more for our clients. And so the trick to this for us has been investing in our people. It's been creating the benefits, the experiences, the employee experience, the pride, association with the company, the feedback loop that shows that when we do these things, we get better outcomes for our clients, and that translates into better outcomes in the bottom line. And so there's a flywheel effect here that actually builds on itself. And the spring in the step of our employees is now powering that forward, and that's what gives us confidence that we've really turned the corner on it. People want to throw in with the whole because they see that it's not only better for the company, it's actually better for their business because joining their products with other products around the company is allowing us to be more for clients. And it actually feels good to see the benefits in the ultimate results. So that's, for us, the North Star of how we're doing it. And while we've certainly got a distance to go, the early results have been pretty encouraging. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Robin Vince : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Great. Maybe if I could just come back to the -- sticking with the NII guide of down 10%. I'm having trouble getting there. The -- just to confirm, it sounds, Dermot, like what you're saying is it's really almost totally a deposit-driven guide on a seasonal basis. And I just wanted to sort of confirm that given how you've outlined the balance sheet sensitivity to different rate scenarios is pretty strong. And of course, you have the benefit of securities portfolio reinvestment. So is it really simply just the seasonal deposit dynamic? And then if you can just talk about how NIB is factored into that seasonal deposit dynamic. And then, of course, as you move into next year, in 1Q seasonally, of course, that we should be back positive again. I just want to confirm that. Dermot McDonogh : So, I guess, Brian, in the way you've asked the question, in some ways you've answered the question to yourself. So I will kind of confirm, a, how you're thinking about it in terms of the seasonal decline and it's a deposit story. And I would just kind of reference last year as the guide in terms of, in January of last year, we guided 20% for the year. And then we started out the gates well. And, you as a collective, put pressure on me to change the guidance, which I didn't do. And we ended the year at 24%. And so last year, we used the word skewed to the upside but humble about the fact of what lies in front of us. And I would say the percentages are different this year, the environment is different, but the sentiment is the same. I'm humble about what the outcome could be and uncertainty is -- can be -- is there because, as Robin said, for sure, what we think is going to happen is not going to happen. But I would say we're cautiously optimistic and your point is it is a deposit story. And within the deposit story, it really is the mix between NIBs and IBs. Brian Bedell : Right. Okay. Yeah. Fair enough there. And then maybe just back to the operating leverage dynamic, and this can be for both Dermot and Robin. Obviously, you're starting off really well with, like, 100 basis points plus of positive operating leverage as we move into the second half, notwithstanding market movements, that would obviously influence the fee revenue dynamic. But given the traction that you're showing sequentially in your core business growth and core business sales and, I guess, the fact that you've made these investments already, so I just wanted to get a sense of whether you feel like you're able to scale those investments in the second half. And obviously, with your flat operating expense guidance, it would seem that's the case. If the revenue does turn out to be better than expected from an organic growth perspective, would we see the expense base creep up a little bit notwithstanding, of course, you'd still generate positive leverage? Dermot McDonogh : Okay. A lot of questions in that second question. So, I would say, like, when I talk to the teams, right, and this is quite -- you're kind of hitting on a very important point in that I really focus on running the company better, and then we kind of focus on the operating leverage, not expense as a means to an end. And if revenue-related expenses creep up, that we starve businesses of investments to solve for a flat number because that's what we said we were going to do. I think that's quite important. And it's important to get the balance right that investment and running the company better, it kind of is the same thing. And so that's a cultural transformation that's underway with all of our people. And so we really are focused on getting value for money. We spend a lot of money. We spend over $12.5 billion every year. And so we want to get the best value we can for that, and we do that in a number of different ways. So some of the investments that we've made over the last couple of years, we're beginning to see the scale impact in that. And you can see that in our most profitable segment, Market and Wealth Services. It's a mid-40s margin. We continue to invest at the margin, which is what you want to see from us. And we continue to digitize, we continue to automate, we continue to reduce manual process which ultimately will feed into headcount and better quality jobs for our folks and better careers. So, I think over time, if organic growth plays out, it will feed into a better outcome in operating leverage, not us just growing expenses because revenues are better. Robin Vince : And I just want to draw out one additional thing that Dermot said as well, Brian, which is we have a lot of work to do. There's no question about it. He used the term skew and slightly optimistic, but staying humble when it related to NII. This one is just about a lot of hard work and really focusing on this point about running the company better. But as a double-click into the way that we're thinking about it, if you look at the second quarter, I mean, we've talked a lot about the fact that it's been a seasonally strong quarter. But if you double-click into it, and the Market and Wealth Services point that Dermot just mentioned, that's an investment story because, as we've said, we're in a good spot on the pre-tax margin of that segment. So we just want more that's growth. We don't want to dilute the margin, but we're not trying to save expense dollars there. But in Securities Services and in Investment and Wealth, where we said there is, in fact, a margin journey that we have ahead of us, that's where you can actually see negative expenses in both of those segments for the quarter, which is a sign of the fact that we're both investing but we're doing even more discipline in those businesses. And so that's how the whole thing comes together for the company. Brian Bedell : Great. That\u2019s great color. Thank you so much. Operator : And our final question is coming from Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Rajiv Bhatia : Yeah. There was some progress on the Investment and Wealth Management margin in the quarter. I guess my quick question is, are your margins different on the asset management side of the business versus the wealth management side? And do you have a timeline for getting back to that 25%-plus margin? Dermot McDonogh : So I don't think we kind of get into the detail of the split between the two. And so the segment overall, I guess, we've said over the last several quarters, we believe we can go back to the 25% margin over a period of a few years. And, like, just to follow on from Robin's answer to the last question, we've shown, I think, good expense discipline over the last 12 months in terms of, okay, revenues have been a little bit challenged in the segment due to a variety of reasons, and we've taken tough decisions. And so that's allowed us to grow the margin by 200 basis points over the last year, which really is kind of the financial discipline [about it] (ph). And we do believe where we are now with distribution as a platform, very, very strong performance in fixed income and LDI and Insight, that the momentum is there within the segment to grow. And as Robin said, the addition of Jose to the leadership team joining in September, giving his fresh perspective, gives us confidence about what we can do in the future. Rajiv Bhatia : Got it. Thanks. Robin Vince : Thanks, Rajiv. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Robin for additional or closing remarks. Robin Vince : Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for your time today. We certainly appreciate your interest in BNY. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well and enjoy the balance of the summer. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 2 :00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Marius Merz : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm joined by Robin Vince, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com. I'll also note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 11, 2024, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin. Robin Vince : Thanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll start with a few remarks on the quarter, and then Dermot will take you through the financials in greater detail. In short, BNY reported strong third quarter results, reflecting growth across our three business segments and consistent execution on our strategic priorities. Stepping back, on the macro side for a moment. At the beginning of the year, markets had priced in significant monetary policy easing in anticipation of economic slowdowns. Despite numerous shifts in the macroeconomic outlook since then, we've now seen the start of the easing cycle in several markets around the world, including a 50-basis-point reduction in policy rates in the U.S. as the Federal Reserve recalibrates its policy stance to balance employment, inflation and growth. Following increased market volatility and a sell-off in equities in early August, markets recovered, and both equity and fixed income values ended the quarter higher. A little more micro, but relevant for markets. Around the most recent quarter-end, the market saw simultaneous flows into the Fed's reverse repo facility alongside the first meaningful usage of the standing repo facility, both of which we administer. At the same time, sponsored cleared repo volumes increased on the back of higher repo rates, possibly signaling a transition from abundant to ample reserves in the system, with potential implication for the pace of QT going forward. More broadly, while markets have been constructive, there are clearly risks and uncertainties ahead. And so, we constantly prepare and position for the many tail risks that exist from geopolitical tensions and conflicts to fiscal deficits and the impact of impending regulations and elections. Now, referring to Page 2 of the Financial Highlights presentation. As I said earlier, BNY delivered a strong financial performance in the third quarter, with strong EPS growth on the back of broad-based revenue growth and positive operating leverage. Reported earnings per share of $1.50 were up 22% year-over-year. And excluding notable items, earnings per share of $1.52 were up 20%. Total revenue of $4.6 billion increased by 5% year-over-year, and reported expenses of $3.1 billion were flat. Excluding the impact of notable items, expenses were up 1% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in our people and technology, while we also generate greater efficiencies from running our company in new and better ways. Pre-tax margin and return on tangible common equity improved year-over-year to 33% and 23%, respectively. For the first time in our history, we reported over $50 trillion of assets under custody and/or administration at the end of the quarter. Now, custody is not something we are, but it is something important that we do. This number one market position improves our unique vantage point as a global financial services company, and it provides opportunity to drive value across our portfolio of adjacent businesses to deliver more of BNY to our clients. We increasingly see that the true power of BNY's client franchise exists in the combination of capabilities across our leading Security Services, Market and Wealth Services, and Investments and Wealth businesses. We have the ability to enhance this and to deliver more to our clients by bringing new innovative solutions to the market from across the seams of these businesses. As an example, we recently announced the planned acquisition of Archer, a leading technology-enabled service provider of managed account solutions to the asset and wealth management Industry. Archer provides comprehensive technology and operational solutions that allow asset and wealth managers to access one of the fastest-growing investment vehicles in the industry, managed accounts, at scale, expanding distribution, streamlining operations, launching new investment products and delivering personalized outcomes for their clients. The integration of Archer should produce a positive impact across several of our lines of business. In addition to augmenting our asset servicing capabilities for managed accounts, Archer will provide our investments business as well as our Wove wealth advisor platform in Pershing with expanded distribution of model portfolios and access to Archer's multi-custodial network. Buy it once, use it many, if you will. The transaction is expected to close before the end of the year, and we look forward to welcoming the Archer team to BNY. Another one of the fastest-growing areas in financial services, alternatives, also presents a promising opportunity for us to deliver new client solutions across One BNY. We already have relationships with hundreds of alternatives managers as well as roughly $3 trillion of wealth assets on our platforms. We believe there is more for us to do to mine the opportunity and build the technology to reach across our franchise and unlock the fast-growing alternatives market for wealth intermediaries, advisers and the investors they serve. Last month, we introduced Alts Bridge, a comprehensive data, software and services solution built for wealth advisers. Alts Bridge aims to make investing in alternatives easier for advisers through a streamlined end-to-end experience and direct integration into advisers' existing desktops, starting with our Pershing NetX360+ and Wove platforms. As we continue to deliver new innovative products, we are also addressing the significant opportunity from enhancing our commercial model, making it easier for clients to navigate BNY. In order to accomplish this, we are promoting an enterprise approach to client coverage, and we are operationalizing our new commercial model. For example, over the summer and for the first time in recent memory, we brought together several hundred of BNY's client-facing commercial leaders from around the world as well as members of our executive committee for a two-day event we called Commercial Lift Off. This program enabled our top client coverage people and their business partners to take a One BNY view to account planning, creating a shared vision for serving each of our clients holistically across the entire relationship, generating new ideas to meet the clients' objectives and developing action-oriented plans to deliver on those goals. During the quarter, we also made progress toward running our company better, including the ongoing transition to a platform's operating model, enhancing the connectivity across our teams and empowering our people to drive change across the company. In September, we went live with the next step on our multiyear plan to unite related capabilities around BNY and elevate our execution by doing things in one place and doing them well. We now have about 13,000 or about one-quarter of our people working in our new operating model. As we've said before, powering our One BNY culture in order to be more for our clients and run our company better requires not just words, but action. I want to thank our people around the world for their hard work and for collectively pulling together as a team to create the change for our clients, for our shareholders and for one another. To wrap up, the combination of our talented team, our portfolio of leading businesses working together and the strength of our balance sheet gives us a great foundation to deliver more to our clients and drive sustainable long-term shareholder value. While our results in the third quarter demonstrate continued execution against our strategic priorities as well as progress toward our medium-term financial targets, our team remains focused on the work ahead. With that, over to you, Dermot. Dermot McDonogh : Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 3 of the presentation, I'll begin with our consolidated financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $4.6 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 5%. This includes 5% growth in investment services fees, reflecting higher market values and net new business across our Security Services and Market and Wealth Services segments. Investment management and performance fees from our Investment and Wealth Management segment were up 2%, driven by higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. Firm-wide AUC/A of $52.1 trillion were up 14% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, net new business and client inflows. Assets under management of $2.1 trillion were up 18% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar. Foreign exchange revenue increased by 14%, driven by higher volumes. Investment and other revenue was $196 million in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in fixed income and equity trading. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects a strategic equity investment loss recorded in the third quarter of last year and improved results from our seed capital investments. Net interest income increased by 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting improved investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Expenses of $3.1 billion were flat year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items. This reflects higher investment and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Provision for credit losses was $23 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting reserve bills related to commercial real estate exposure. As Robin mentioned earlier, we reported earnings per share of $1.50, up 22% year-over-year. And excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.52, up 20% year-over-year. Pre-tax margin was 33%, and return on tangible common equity was 23%. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 6%. Tier 1 capital increased by 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings and improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returned to our shareholders through common stock repurchases and through dividends. Average assets increased by 1%. Our CEQ1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.9%. CEQ1 capital increased by 5% and risk-weighted assets increased by 1%. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders over the course of the third quarter. Year-to-date, we returned 103% of our earnings through dividends and buybacks. Moving to liquidity. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 116%, a 1 percentage point increase sequentially due to a favorable change in our deposit composition. And the consolidated net stable funding ratio was 132%, unchanged sequentially. Next, net interest income and the underlying balance sheet trends on Page 5. Net interest income of over $1 billion was up 3% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was helped by higher sponsored cleared repo activity [indiscernible] market volatility and increased client demand. Average deposit balances remained flat sequentially. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by 2% in the quarter and interest-bearing deposits were flat. Average interest-earning assets were [up 4%] (ph) quarter-over-quarter. Our investment securities portfolio balances as well as loan balances increased by 1%, and cash and reverse repo balances remained flat. Our broader liquidity ecosystem reached an all-time high at the end of the quarter of over $1.5 trillion worth of client cash across deposits, money market funds, securities lending, sponsor cleared repo and other short-term investment alternatives. Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 6. Security Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 4% year-over-year. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 5%, primarily reflecting higher market values. For the third quarter in a row, the impact of repricing was de minimis. ETF AUC/A of $2.7 trillion was up more than 70% year-on-year, and the number of funds serviced was up 20% year-on-year. Inflows into ETFs on our platform remained strong this quarter with growth across all asset classes. As the ETF industry continues to grow, we are dedicated to scaling our best-in-class ETF service offering. For example, we have successfully onboarded several new liquidity providers to our electronic order execution platform to advance digital adoption. In Issuer Services, investment services fees were up 1%. Net new business and higher client activity in Corporate Trust partially offset by lower deposit receipt fees, reflecting corporate actions in the prior year. Against the backdrop of increased issuance activity, we continue to see strength in Corporate Trust, capitalizing on our investments in people and technology to enhance client service and scalability. In this segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 28% year-over-year, reflecting growth from newly onboarded clients as well as a higher level of client activity. Net interest income for the segment was up 2% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $1.6 billion were down 3% year-over-year, reflecting efficiency savings and lower severance expenses, partially offset by higher investments and employee merit increases. Pre-tax income was $642 million, a 38% increase year-over-year, and pre-tax margin was 29%. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 7. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 7% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment services fees were down 1%, reflecting the impact of lost business in the prior year, partially offset by higher market values. Net new assets were negative $22 billion for the quarter, reflecting the ongoing deconversion of lost business in the prior year, which is now largely behind us. Excluding the deconversion, we saw approximately 4% annualized net new asset growth in the third quarter. Wove continues to see strong client demand. We signed up 14 additional clients in the third quarter and we remain on track for the $30 million to $40 million of revenue in 2024 as we guided in January. Wove is helping us attract new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. For example, Pershing provides custody and clearing solutions for Sanctuary, a large and fast-growing wealth manager servicing the high net worth and ultra-high net worth segments. Sanctuary will also leverage Wove portfolio solutions, trading and rebalancing and reporting for teams that custody with Pershing as well as those that use another custodian. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees increased by 16%, primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and higher clearance volumes. Against the backdrop of a growing market and active trading, U.S. securities clearance and settlement volumes have remained strong. As you may remember, we created our global clearing platform earlier this year through the realignment of Pershing Institutional Solutions. We're pleased to see the pipeline of this platform continue to build for our full suite of institutional clearing, settlement, execution and financing solutions in over 100 markets around the world. In Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 11%, primarily reflecting net new business. The business continues to execute well against the growth agenda we presented in January. And we are seeing our investments in modernizing and digitizing our payments platform pay off in the form of growth in our strategic target markets. Net interest income for the segment overall was up 3% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $834 million were up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was up 8% year-over-year at $704 million, representing a 46% pre-tax margin. Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 8. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $849 million, up 2% year-over-year. In our Investment Management business, revenue was up 1%, reflecting higher market values and improved [seed capital] (ph) results, partially offset by lower performance fees and the mix of AUM flows. And in Wealth Management, revenue increased by 6%, reflecting higher market values and net interest income, partially offset by changes in product mix. Segment expenses of $672 million were flat year-over-year as efficiency savings offset employee merit increases and higher investments. Pre-tax income was $176 million, up 7% year-over-year, and pre-tax margin was 21%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2.1 trillion increased by 18% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar. In the third quarter, we saw strength in our short-term strategies with $24 billion of net inflows into cash, reflecting our leading position and strong investment performance in our Dreyfus money market funds. Long-term active strategies saw $8 billion of net outflows, spread across multi asset, LDI and active equity, partially offset by net inflows into fixed income. And we saw $16 billion of net outflows from index strategies. Wealth Management client assets of $333 billion increased by 14% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 9 shows the results of the other segment. Before I wrap up, a couple of comments on the outlook for the year. Starting with net interest income. Remember, we began the year setting up for positive operating leverage despite an expectation for full year net interest income to be down 10% in 2024. While we're currently forecasting for fourth quarter net interest income to be slightly below what we saw in our strong third quarter results, the resilience of our net interest income over the first nine months of the year has positioned us to outperform our outlook for the full year net interest income growth rate from January by approximately 5 percentage points. Regarding expenses, we continue to work hard to keep core expenses, excluding notable items, for the full year 2024 roughly flat. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be at the lower end of the 23% to 24% range we estimated in January. And lastly, as we said at the beginning of the year, we expect to return 100% or more of 2024 earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And we remain on track having returned 103% of earnings year-to-date. In conclusion, our results this past quarter reflect broad-based growth across our three business segments and continued progress on our strategic priorities. We're pleased with the company's performance year-to-date and we're proud of our people who continue to execute well toward our medium-term financial targets, while we all remain focused on the work and the tremendous opportunity ahead of us. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A? Operator : Yes. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You flagged some of the ETF wins that you had in the servicing side. So, curious about that. Number one, how much of that was the BlackRock business that you've won? And has the revenue from that win, that big win fully turned on? And did those dynamics have something -- or like is the fee rate lower? Because fees in asset servicing were up about 5%, but AUC, 16%, and I know sometimes the ETF fee rates are a little lower, so curious to flush that out a bit. Thank you. Dermot McDonogh : So, thanks for the question. I don't really want to get into the specifics on one client or transaction, but just to take a step back on ETFs generally, it is a growing market. You may have watched Larry from BlackRock on CNBC this morning. It is a secular trend. It is a very big and growing market, and we are a key player on that. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have $2.7 trillion on the platform, that's up 70% year-on-year, and the number of funds serviced is up 20%. That's on the back of strong leadership and a real investment in technology, so we can be best in class. So, without going into specifics, we're there to take advantage of the secular trend and we'll continue to innovate and solve for our clients' needs. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that. Maybe if I could word it a little differently, the strong ETF growth that you have seen this quarter, is the revenue fully reflected this quarter or is some of those wins still have some revenue ramp to come? Dermot McDonogh : I would say it's the latter. It's, generally speaking, strong pipeline. We're always adding new clients to the platform and they -- because of the size of what's been on boarded, they tend to do it in a phased approach. So, some revenue is on the platform, some revenue to come. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. Thanks for that, Dermot. Thank you also for the update on NII, encouraging to see things working better. Could you speak to the deposit beta that you experienced with the first rate cut? And given that we're seeing rates coming down now, is it reasonable to think that deposits could begin to grow from here? Dermot McDonogh : So, the betas, I think, we've said on previous calls, we view it as symmetrical. So, for us, the first rate cut was 100% passed on. So, we feel pretty good about that. I think in terms of where we are in the Fed easing cycle, I think it's probably a little bit too early to see how that's going to feed into the deposit balance story. I think, overall, we've kind of -- we've held in there. We had a strong Q3 for a variety of different reasons. So, I would say, I expect where we are to moderate a little bit on balances in Q4 and we'll see what happens next with the next Fed meeting, but no significant change for us as we kind of sit here right here today. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hey, how are you doing? Robin Vince : Hey, Mike. How are you? Mike Mayo : Good. Look, I'm just -- that's a big number, the $50 trillion of AUC, nice round number. You did beat -- it's factual that you beat expectations for the quarter and the year so far, as you've highlighted. I'm just trying to figure out how much of this is lucky versus being smart. And I imagine it's a bit of both, but the lucky part is record stock market volatility, trading, some other factors in the market that have gone your way. And I don't feel like we have enough information on your client growth, the underlying client growth, the most repeatable part of the company. So, could you give some color on whether it's growth in clients or maybe it's revenues per client or maybe it's products per client or all those adjacent businesses that you talk about, how you're managing the company better versus simply a better environment to operate it? Robin Vince : Sure, Mike. It's Robin. I understand the question and it's obviously a very legit question. We broke through the $50 trillion. By the way, we ended at $52 trillion. So, the good news is we didn't stop at the round number. Look, I'd say that it isn't just fashionable, it's actually old-fashioned traditional just the way that we want to do it in terms of being able to have this deliberate growth and this focus. And so, we've tried to provide as much visibility as we reasonably can into the inputs of what it is that's ultimately driving this progress, because we understand we have benefited from a terrific backdrop in terms of markets. And of course, that's part of our business to be able to be well-positioned to take advantage of those backdrops. We've got parts of our business which respond to asset values, we've got parts of our business that respond to the number of accounts, we've got parts of our business that respond to software sales, transaction volumes, and having that multi-faceted set of business response functions, if you want to call it, that is actually a deliberate strategy so that we can participate in the growth of markets. And so, if you believe that overall debt issued in the world, equity valuations in the world, financial market activities are going to grow, we're trying to hitch our wagon to all of those growth trends. We think that's good. Having said that, to the heart of your question, this is the work that we've really done in the early days since this management team took over, which was to understand the components that we had and to really start to understand how they could work together, to how they could hum together in order to be able to unlock more potential. And so, we rallied the firm around three strategic pillars, this thing of being more for our clients. And that's just not just words, it's being about maturing this One BNY philosophy that we've talked before about. It's about having a different type of dialogue. It's about the movement over time to solutions as opposed to just products. It's like the examples that I gave and Dermot gave in our prepared remarks where clients are coming to us because we can do more than one thing for them. And it's not just that we're selling more things to them, it's that they actually want to take advantage of bundles of things, which actually provide a better solution to their business. And then, our second pillar of running the company better, that's been about sales rhythms and sales targets and bringing our people together and having them understand what it is that we're trying to do. And then, wrapping the whole thing is this culture of wanting to have a winning culture, wanting to push forward, wanting to make BNY of the future more than BNY Mellon was of the past. And those things are all quite deliberate, and we start -- and we believe that we're starting to see the results of that, although it's still early in our results. But Dermot can give you a couple of additional things on this which I think also would be helpful. Dermot McDonogh : So Mike, the way I -- from just thinking about it from a numbers perspective, right, we're up 5% year-on-year in fee growth, and constructive markets, and so, we've been able to take advantage of constructive markets. But a couple of important points that I would draw out is that in all three of our business segments, we've seen solid underlying growth. And in Robin's prepared remarks, he talked about the fact that we're evolving into a platform company. And when we have platforms that we're investing in at scale, so when you have high volume and you have constructive markets, we have the platforms in situ that can take advantage of that. Asset Servicing, we're winning and onboarding new business. We came into the year with a backlog. We onboarded the business throughout the year, and we're beginning to go into the Q4 with a bigger backlog than we came into the beginning of the year. So, Asset Servicing, I feel very proud of. Corporate Trust, Depository Receipts, Corporate Trust, specifically, a good margin business, but something that has been devoid of investment over a number of years and we've put money to work there in terms of leadership and scaling our technology, and that's going to be a business -- an important business for us in the future. And Treasury and Services and Clearance and Collateral Management have really kind of shown was when you have a scale platform with high volumes, strong markets, lots of issuance, lots of payments, you take advantage of that. And then, on just the client specific thing, albeit it's a small base and we can -- we've highlighted a couple of transactions this year where client -- we're able to have a much more sophisticated conversation with clients and clients are now buying from us across more than one line of business, in some cases, four lines of business. That was something that we just could not do a couple of years ago. And Robin's point about bringing the One BNY to bear on clients is really beginning to pay dividends. Mike Mayo : All right. Well, that was very comprehensive. Just last follow-up, are you implying, and by the way, on all the metrics, again, the client growth numbers, and thanks for peeling back the layers of the onion there, but always like even more layers, never enough for us, but in terms of growth in clients and more specifics going down the line. But the expense is clearly, Dermot, the flat expenses, that's very clear, that part of it. Are you implying even lower expenses in the fourth quarter based on your new guide today? Dermot McDonogh : So, look, the thing I would like to convey to you and to our shareholders is that we worked really hard over the last couple of years to build credibility that we are good stewards of our expense base, and we guided flat at the beginning of the year. And broadly speaking, there's been some pressure, I would say, on expenses that, for the most part, are revenue related. And so, if revenues are higher, there's some aspects that you just have to pay more expenses. So, while I've guided roughly flat for the full year, there may be a little bit of pressure over the course of that because of higher revenues. And also, as Robin said in his remarks, we've announced the acquisition of Archer and there'll be some integration costs associated with that. But I feel very good the fact that now we have 53,000 people who understand the importance of financial discipline and that goes to pillar number two of being a really well-run company. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just on -- just sticking with the revenue dynamic, talking about the -- obviously, the commercial lift off and the enterprise approach, the early traction that you're getting, I think, you referenced some clients now doing multiple services. Can you talk a little bit more about how you think that might impact the revenue growth trajectory? And then, also, just if you can just reconfirm the general revenue delta to equity markets? I think it was like 10% equity market moves can have an impact of about 1% revenue. So, I just wanted to sort of break apart those two dynamics, just really kind of showing that you're actually generating this revenue growth aside from markets. Dermot McDonogh : So, if I take the last question first, hopefully, that was your two questions in one go, so, a 5% gradual change in equity markets is roughly $60 million in fees annually, and a 5% gradual change in fixed income markets is roughly 40% -- or $40 million in fees annually. So that's a little bit on the sensitivity analysis. And so, on just the commercial lift off that Robin talked about in his remarks, it really is -- Cathinka Wahlstrom, who's with us now for over a year, spent the first year really on a listening tour and organizing roughly our 1,200 to 1,500 leading client coverage people around the world in terms of what we want our ambition to be, what are the products that we have and how can we educate our total force to be able to [indiscernible] there with clients delivering the whole of the firm. I think -- and also, if you kind of just talk about Archer for a second, I think a couple of years ago, if we were to do that acquisition, one part of the firm would have bought it for its business. And I think, Robin's point in his remarks are really, really important where you buy it once, you use it multiple times, and it's an acquisition that's done for the enterprise that will serve multiple lines of business. And that's how you should think about how our client coverage model is going to work in a strategic way going forward. We're going to deliver holistic solutions for our clients. Clients have a better understanding of the diversified nature of our business franchise, and they're just buying more from us. And it's just going to show up in revenue, and we feel very good about where we are today in terms of planning for the budget season for Q4 and the opportunities that are going to come our way in 2025. Brian Bedell : Great. That's helpful. I'll get back in the queue for another question actually. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, maybe just wrapping some of the comments you made around fee in a bigger picture question, when you guys think about a number of different growth areas you outlined some of the specifics, and obviously, the approach to cross-selling has taken a whole different turn here. So, when you use them out and you look at the business holistically, how do you think about the organic fee growth that the enterprise can generate over time? Dermot McDonogh : So, you're trying -- so we don't guide on fees, haven't done, don't intend to do it here, but what I would say is, and I gave this answer as an earlier question, we are seeing underlying growth across all three of our business segments. Our underlying organic growth this year, we feel quite happy about, and we feel it reflects a really good nine months of the year. And there's no reason to expect that, that momentum won't continue. And I do feel the way we've set up for the back half of this year and into next year, it's a kind of flywheel of innovation, and we have a lot of growth initiatives. And we've come together and we have a group of people who are working on what we call integrated solutions. And so, we have a number of interesting things in the pipeline. Robin talked about Alts Bridge in his remarks, talked about Archer in his remarks. There are things that we're doing within specific lines of business coming together. We talked about Pershing being realigned into Clearance and Collateral Management, and that's driving growth as well. So, the decisions that we've taken over the last couple of years in terms of realigning certain activities into different parts of the firm are showing up in our revenues this year, and we will continue to do that into next year. Robin Vince : And Alex, I'd just add, Dermot really alluded to this in what he just said, but right from the beginning, we've had two approaches. One is to think about this endeavor of fully realizing BNY's potential as a multiyear endeavor, and we recognize that there are going to be different ways in which that will come together in different years. And North Star, as you know, for us, is operating leverage, and that came about in a slightly different way in 2023 than it did in '24, and it could be different again in '25 as we really get into that conversation ultimately when we talk to you in January. But we've simultaneously invested in things that we knew would be important for the shorter term and for the medium term and for the longer term. And so, both Dermot and I have talked about this platform's operating model. That's a great example. There have been some benefits that come early on in that process. We brought like things together across the company. There have been benefits on the revenue side, there have been benefits on the expense side from doing it. But then, the value of having done it creates medium-term momentum because now we're able to be more dynamic for clients. We're able to solve problems more quickly for clients. And so, there's a payoff there. And then, over the longer term, it actually makes it easier to be able to assemble these new solutions that Dermot was just talking about. And again, there's a revenue story there, but there's also an expense story. And that's how we're thinking about it. Notwithstanding, we haven't given you a specific growth target number. Make no mistake, we're invested in creating that growth. Alex Blostein : Yeah. No, fair enough. I appreciate all of that. Smaller kind of tactical question for you guys. So, the repo activity continues to be quite elevated. You mentioned that in your prepared remarks as well. Is it possible to help size how much repo contributed sort of across the enterprise? It hits you in a couple of different ways. Obviously, there's the NII benefit and there's some fee benefits. So, as you think about the more normalized level of repo activity versus what you saw in the quarter, how big of a contributor was that in kind of totality? And as you look forward, given changes in monetary policy expectations, but also some of the client behavior that you mentioned earlier, how sustainable do you ultimately think this more elevated pace of activity in this market? Dermot McDonogh : So, on the repo question, so at cleared repo, for sure, we saw elevated activity, particularly going into the back end of the quarter and in the early part of this quarter. And that, in large part, contributed to the outperformance for the Q3 NII. That has now moderated somewhat. And so, in my prepared remarks, and in terms of the guidance, that's why I kind of feel like roughly for NII, we're about $1 billion for the fourth quarter. In terms of cleared repo, overall, as a kind of contributor to the NII over the course of the year, it's roughly about 5% of the number. As it relates to elevated activity in terms of volume and activity, I think from what we see on our platforms, we kind of see that continuing to be the case in the medium term. There's no reason for the slowdown. It's been a very strong year, very, very active client engagement, product innovation. And particularly on the international side, we said at the beginning of the year in our kind of strategic call in January that international was going to be a key area of \u200b\u200bfocus on the platform, and that's been the case, and that's shown up in the results. So, I think, overall, and I said in my prepared remarks as well, in terms of the liquidity ecosystem in total hit a high for us at $1.5 trillion. That's up from $1.2 trillion a couple of years ago, and that's in the backdrop of liquidity coming out of the system. So, we've grown quite substantially. And that, again, is coming back to connecting the dots across the firm, getting teams collaborating more, being more digital, providing innovative solutions to clients, and that is really powering the growth. Robin Vince : If I could just relate that back to a question that Mike had asked earlier on because I think these things are relevant, you got to remember that the strategy of us having roughly the right ores in roughly the right waters to be able to participate in things that are happening in the world, that's very important. So, if I just supplement what Dermot said, with the additional observation that we're the world's largest security lender that generates repo activity. We're the world's largest collateral manager, so we get to capture fees associated with people doing repo. We, obviously, play this role in the US Treasury market, which participates in the growth of US Treasury repo. We have all of these different touch points. And so, there are different ways in which we can collect across software, in some cases, services that we administer in others, and participation in different, both global markets and also product types, which align in indirect ways to that. So that's an important part of how we look at the overall system and understand how our products and services can help clients navigate those, and we can participate in the benefit of that growth. Alex Blostein : Yeah, that's a helpful framework to discuss it this way, yeah. Thank you, guys, both. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Dermot. Hi, Robin. Robin, can you give us some thoughts with -- obviously, you talked a little bit about the acquisition you accomplished in this quarter. What your outlook is for -- you, obviously, have very strong capital levels, your stock has moved very nicely this year and you get a better currency. What the outlook is for just other types of acquisitions if there are some that could be complementary to what you're currently doing? Robin Vince : Sure, Gerard. First of all, just make a quick comment about Archer. We're looking forward to closing that transaction in the fourth quarter and welcoming the team in. And this relates a little bit to a couple of other things that we've already talked about on the call. One is participation in markets and the other one earlier on, on ETFs. If you just think about the way that we view the world construct, once upon a time, they were mutual funds. More recently in the past decade or so, it's really been the explosion of ETFs. And there's simultaneous thing going on, which is the growth of separately managed accounts. And so, in the same way that Dermot described how we've participated in sort of outsized participation of the ETF migration, Archer is a transaction that prepositions us to be able to participate hopefully in an outsized way associated with the transition to separately managed accounts. So, it relates to that strategic question of growth and participating in different markets that we talked about. Now, stepping back to the other part of your question, really, the heart of it on M&A, look, our primary focus is what we have and how we can improve on it. And Dermot and I both talk a lot about the fact that we've looked very carefully at our businesses and we love our businesses. We think we have a great set of businesses. We think they are great ones to be in, and we think that they have a lot of adjacency to each other. And we think that the spread of those things can provide a lot more services to our clients in more joined up way of solutions than maybe we have before. So, it isn't that we do M&A from a position in any way of needing to do things, it's we're able to be very opportunistic, and we obviously like that a lot. But notwithstanding that we're pleased with what we have, we don't want to be complacent. So, we keep our eyes open, and we look at things, and Archer came about as a result of a strategic business review that we did internally, looking at long-term trends, looking at how we might adapt to those trends. And then, we went out and we looked very specifically for a capability that would do that, with the key emphasis being on the word capability, digestible bolt-on things that accelerate what we're trying to do or derisk delivery of what we're trying to do. And if we can buy a piece of technology that can be more efficient or less distracting than building it ourselves with a great team, great technology, ideally like this one, an installed book of business is also helpful, then we feel very good about it, as long as it aligns with those priorities, it's a good cultural fit, it has a good attractive return. So that's our M&A thought process. And then, if that fits into the overall waterfall, which we've talked about before, which is, if we have excess capital, we're going to, of course, be prudent. And so, we like excess capital. That's not a bad thing in an uncertain world. And so that's a very important consideration. Then, we look at whether or not we could invest it. Good news, as you know, we're a pretty capital-light model, we're very capital generative, so we don't need a ton of capital to reinvest in our business to keep growing it. Then, we look at whether or not we need something -- for some type of additional need, like the Archer example and then we distribute the rest. And this has, obviously, been a good year to see all of that on display. We've been prudent. We've run at elevated capital levels, and, as Dermot indicated, we intend to return 100% plus of net earnings to shareholders, and we've been able to make an acquisition. And so, this is a pretty good model year for how we think about the world. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you for the answer. And then, just as a quick follow-up, Dermot. You gave us that sensitivity analysis about a gradual 5% change in the equity markets and fixed income and the impact it would have on revenue, was that for up markets, meaning if the gradual increase was 5% up, does that also reflect a down market, if markets were down 5%, that's the kind of impact we would expect to see? Dermot McDonogh : That's correct, Gerard, that's correct. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Robin Vince : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : I have a follow-up with some of your responses. I think, I guess, depending how -- maybe starting with just capital allocation, so heard your response to Gerard's question around M&A and such. But just talk to us how you think about means when we think about the valuation of the stock on price to earnings, price to tangible book, at the same time, this year has been pretty good market backdrop wise, and as an investor shareholder, you care about ROE resilience of these firms. So, one maybe, Robin or Dermot, talk to us about your comfort around ROE resiliency? If the market backdrop is unfavorable, what's the flex in the system? And given where things stand today, like how do you think about the stock valuation versus the commitment to return 100% plus in buybacks and dividends? Thank you. Robin Vince : I'll take the second bit first, and then Dermot will reflect on the first part of your question. So, the good news is that we can also pay attention to the way that you all think about the stock and your views of our stock. And we appreciate the fact that many of you have expressed confidence in our forward direction. We believe in ourselves as well. And so, what we do, of course, consider price as one of the many inputs into our capital return framework. We don't view current prices as being problematic in terms of continuing our stock buybacks. Dermot McDonogh : Ebrahim, when I took on the role a couple of years ago, I guess, I got a lot of questions about, is this just going to be more of the same or what's different? And now we're several quarters into the new team, and Robin has really kind of bolstered that team and through the strategic pillars, communication, the principles, the medium-term financial targets has really started to evolve the culture of BNY. And so, it is our commitment to deliver to our shareholders' positive operating leverage through the cycle. And so, if you just take a step back and look at this quarter's financials, 5% revenue growth, flat expense growth, 33% pre-tax margin, upper end of Tier 1 leverage, 6%, 23% return on tangible common equity, and a 22% EPS growth, and what I would say is a solid beast. So, I don't really think about the valuation of the firm on any given day. We just care about delivering for our clients and our shareholders. And if we do that in a first-class way, the valuation will take care of itself. Robin Vince : And you asked about the returns and our sort of comfort with them, look, we've given medium-term targets, as Dermot just said, that's sort of greater than or equal to 23% for ROTCE. And so, we, obviously, appreciate touching that, but doing it consistently over time is how we really view achieving targets. And in terms of the resiliency, remember the very nature of our business is actually got this diversification. We talked about the equity markets and the fixed income markets. I talked about the fact that it is software, its services, platforms and market valuations and transaction volumes. These are all things that we participate in. Capital markets activities has been important to us in 2024. The fact that we participate through our Corporate Trust business through our debt capital markets business, those are things that are participating in the growth of capital markets generally. We participate in scale of markets, and things like the treasury market is a good example. And so, this diversification of our mix helps us to be resilient in terms of the vagaries of any one particular market or cycle. Now, of course, things will move around, and that's why Dermot mentioned the point about our commitment to positive operating leverage in almost all reasonable scenarios that we can imagine because we recognize that NII, which is part of our mix, but so too are the fees and then our ability to control expenses. We could make expenses less than they are now. We've chosen to manage them at the level that they are because we believe that investing in that business for future growth is exactly what we should be doing right now given the environment, but it wouldn't always have to be so. Ebrahim Poonawala : Appreciate that. And if I can sneak one quick follow-up, Dermot, I think you mentioned fourth quarter NII slightly lower than 3Q. We've seen a few rate cuts in Europe, in the US now in September. Is it fair to assume that absent a dramatic change in rates, this $1 billion in quarterly NII is kind of where we are bouncing around at the bottom? And then, if deposit growth picks up, QT stops, that it should go off that base? Or am I missing something? Dermot McDonogh : So, if you look back at our last five quarters, we've kind of toggled between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Q3 was a stronger quarter for us for a number of reasons, principally volatility in the market at the beginning of August and clients held more cash. And then, towards the back end of the quarter, once there was a clear view on where the Fed was going to go at rates, clients started to put money into money market funds, which ended up with us. And so, we kind of benefited from those two principal things. And so, our deposit balances have kind of leveled off here. We expect maybe NIBs grind down a little bit from here. And so, as I kind of said maybe 10 minutes ago, $1 billion for Q4 is the best guidance I can give you today. And for '25, I don't see NII being a kind of a headwind for us. And we've taken extensive action over the last several weeks in terms of repositioning our CIO book to insulate '25. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good afternoon. Robin Vince : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Two quick questions. One is on the buyback question, and I know you said, look, you're very accretive on earnings accretion. You don't need a lot of capital for the business model, of course, as we know, and you're above your target CET1 of 11% and Tier 1 leverage target 5.5% to 6%, you're at the high end of that range. And so, when we think about the 100%-plus, how should we think about the plus part of the 100%-plus? Because it feels like totally 100% makes sense, but there's room to bring these to optimize the capital structure more. So, I'm kind of thinking about -- I'm wondering what kind of timeframe are we talking about to optimize your capital structure, do you feel? Dermot McDonogh : So, thanks for the question, Betsy. Last year, we returned a little north of 120%. This year, in January, we guided a 100% or more. Given the uncertainty in the markets, geopolitical, the U.S. Presidential elections, a wide range of uncertainty with Fed. In January, we thought the year was going to be very different to where it's ended up. And I think, on previous calls, we said we wanted for now stick towards the upper end of our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is the 6% range. And so, when you take that and the Archer transaction, we kind of think we're still on track to do the 100% or more through three quarters, we're at 103%. So, I wouldn't expect that to materially change from here. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Got it. And then, the other question is you mentioned one-third of BNY is now on the platform model. And are you taking 100% of the firm there? And just wondering about implications for the runway for efficiency improvements as you execute on that? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh : So, a quarter of the firm, roughly 13,000 employees are on the platform now. It happened in two waves, March and September, with another wave going live in Q1 of next year. And so, I wouldn't necessarily think about platform operating model as a mechanism just for efficiency. It really is -- it's going to drive top-line growth and it's going to run the company better and it's going to help us have a different culture in terms of more joined-up thinking. So, it really is the mechanism by which we deliver the three strategic pillars. And so, the answer to the question about 100% is, yes. And from probably -- from here, it's probably another 18 months before the firm is fully up there. But by the end of Q1 of next year, we expect about half of the firm will be live on the model. And the feedback so far from our team around the world is extraordinarily positive. So, it's really worked well for us as a firm. Robin Vince : And Betsy, you remember the tail of benefit extends way past the 18-month point because sometimes it's not until folks are in the model and operating in that new approach that they're really able to examine some of the core questions that, that platform is confronted with in terms of how to optimize. So, we expect the benefit that Dermot was describing to be a multiyear endeavor past that 18-month point. Betsy Graseck : Got it. All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello. Just one wrap up for me. Dermot, I love you pointed out the 5% revenue growth, flattish expenses lead to 20% earnings growth. That is the power of the BK model. If you look just -- I know it's just one quarter, but if you look at the sequential numbers, the story changed a little bit with everything about flat and earnings down a little bit. I'm just -- all I'm asking is, does that inform us in any way of how we're looking at as we roll into '25? A lot of your business metrics and balance and client wins are up. So, my gut is, it's no, but I just want to see from that perspective, how you feel about that? Dermot McDonogh : So, I think your gut is correct. It is no, Glenn. And it's all just about timing and when we onboard clients and put people on the platform and when the revenue starts to get recognized. So, it's just in terms of the backlog across all our businesses, strong pipeline continues to grow. And, yeah, so your intuition is correct. Glenn Schorr : All right. Awesome. Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Rajiv Bhatia : Yeah. Just a quick one for me. I guess, on the depository receipts business, and I appreciate it's a small business, but the number of sponsored programs continues to decline. Is that something we should continue to expect to decline? And is it competitive takeaways or something else that's driving that? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh : So, I wouldn't really read too much into that. That's -- we've talked about that for several years about the sponsored program going away and not being around. It's still here. Deposit receipts is a small business in the totality of it, but it is a very, very important business for us because it gives us another opportunity to connect with clients, and it has got a very good margin to it. And we have like very significant market share in that business. So, it's something that we continue to invest in. We think it's very important for our franchise, and we don't see a secular decline in that business from where we see it today. Robin Vince : We also off-boarded some of the smaller clients in that particular business. So, the headline of total number is a little bit misleading actually when -- if you were able to dig under the hood and see some of the clients that made up that decline, you'd see that they disproportionately skewed to the small. Rajiv Bhatia : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Jim Mitchell : My questions have all been asked and answered. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just one more on the margins. You mostly at your 33% target in most areas. So, as you generate more sales from moving to the platform model, and as we move into, say, next year or beyond, I guess, what's the view on spending some of that and investing in the business versus actually generating -- potentially generating margins well above 33%? Dermot McDonogh : So, my response to that one, Jim, would be, we want to demonstrate to you that we can prove that we can deliver 33% margins through the cycle. We gave guidance for the first time in January, and then we just managed to get there pretty quickly. But we want to stay there and show that we can deliver that over a period of time. We're heading into a very -- what's going to be quite an interesting budget season for us because we've done a lot of great things this year. I know the various teams around the firm want to do great things next year. And to offset that balance, we want to be able to deliver positive operating leverage. And so, the next eight weeks and how we set up the firm for next year would inform how we communicate with you in January. But we set out those targets because we believe we could hit them. The positive is we got there earlier than we thought. And now we want to show that we can improve and maintain those margins that we've guided to previously. Robin Vince : Brian, the best clue I could give you in terms of how we think about that, it's sort of a little bit more detail is if you actually look at us on a segment-by-segment basis, you can see us prosecuting the operating leverage journey differently in our three segments. And we told you a year or so ago that, that's what we were going to do. And so, maybe to allay your concerns in terms of growth and investment, if you look at Market and Wealth Services, we aren't trying to grow the margin there. We're very happy with the margin. We just wanted to grow the total size of the business, which is exactly what we've been doing. There are -- the other segments where we said we actually do want to grow the margin towards our medium-term targets for those segments, there, we are really growing the margin. And so, you can see exactly your question at work in our segments. Brian Bedell : Yeah. That's great color. Thank you very much. Operator : And for our final question, we'll return to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. With all this talk of the transitioning of the employees, I guess, half the employees to the new platform over the next one to two years, how much do you see AI playing a role? And can you give any metrics? I mean, keeping expenses flat, I don't know how much you're still investing in AI. When Emily presented at the Boston Bank Conference last November, it seemed like BNY was all in for AI. It was one of those bullish cases made yet you've heard out in the broader world, sometimes you have hit, sometimes you have misses. So, where -- how does AI relate to the whole platform strategy? And how committed are you to AI? And do you have any numbers that you can give us, some concrete metrics? Thanks. Robin Vince : Sure. So, just to reiterate, we've got a quarter of our people in the platform's operating model. And as Dermot said, it's sort of an 18-month trajectory from here. That's really, Mike, the way I think about platform's operating model is this concept of, if you take it that we are, in fact, more and more a platforms company in terms of these large at-scale capabilities often software and services that we deliver generally in market-leading positions, number one, in a variety of different markets. We've talked about things -- the businesses before, I won't repeat them. Then, it follows to us from that it makes sense for us to operate ourselves in a platform's operating model, which is the way that many other platform companies in the world operates themselves. And so that is a strategy around how we organize ourselves in pursuing -- being pursuant to our broader strategy. Now, AI as a -- which is, of course, part of that, we have an AI hub. We have a couple of hundred people in that AI hub. And we are absolutely investing in AI and do believe in the power of AI to be able to help our business in terms of both revenue opportunities over time for clients and also ways to make our people more effective and efficient. And we haven't made a lot of noise about it, but don't misunderstand that for a lack of interest or investment because we haven't slowed down. In fact, we've increased our AI investment. And of course, notwithstanding all of that, you can see that from running the company well on an expense line, we're not allowing that enthusiasm to distract us from the important task of expense management. And this is where -- I don't mean to be pithy, but it's very, very important learning for us is that we, as a company, can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can invest in things that matter and we can manage the company well. We make choices and AI is a choice of something we're leaning into, and we think that's important for the future. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Robin Vince : Thank you. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Robin for any additional or closing remarks. Robin Vince : Thank you, operator. And thanks, everyone, for your time today. We appreciate your interest in BNY. Please reach out to Marius and the IR team if you have any follow-up questions. Be well. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 2 o'clock pm Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Marius Merz : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2024. I'm joined by Robin Vince, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. Robin will start with a strategic update, followed by Dermot with his financial update and outlook. Both will reference our quarterly update presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com. I'll also note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures is available in the earnings press release, financial supplement, and quarterly update presentation, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 15, 2025, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn the call over to Robin. Robin Vince : Thanks, Marius. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get into our results, I want to address the ongoing wildfires affecting parts of Los Angeles. We are heartbroken by the tremendous loss being suffered by the community where we have several offices. As always, our primary concern is for the safety and wellbeing of our employees and clients located in the effective areas. And we have also committed matching employee donations to eligible non-profits, providing relief and recovery to those impacted by the fires. Turning now to our quarterly update presentation. 2024 was an exciting year for BNY and we are entering 2025 with strong momentum on the right path to unlock the opportunity embedded in our company. Building on the solid foundation that we laid in 2023, we accelerated the pace of our ongoing transformation and closed out 2024 with a strong performance, delivering record net income of $4.3 billion on record revenue of $18.6 billion and generating a return on tangible common equity of 23% for the year. Aligned to our three strategic pillars to be more for our clients, to run our company better and to power our culture. At this time last year, we laid out a set of medium-term financial targets as well as our action plan to drive sustainably higher revenue growth over time. We're executing against these plans and targets every day. As you can see on Page 3 of our presentation, we made very tangible progress in terms of delivery in 2024. For our clients, the rollout of our new commercial coverage model was an important milestone. Effectively cross-selling and leveraging the breadth of our business platforms is the single most compelling growth opportunity for the company. And so our commercial model is designed to deliver from across the company at an accelerated pace, improve the client experience and ultimately deepen our relationships. This is the operationalization of One BNY. But our growth is not just about more of the same. Delivering innovative solutions to the market that leverage the powerful combination of capabilities we have at BNY is another important way for us to be more for our clients and drive topline growth. This is One BNY version 2.0. Our acquisition of Archer is a good example for BNY becoming an end-to-end solutions provider, in this case across the entire managed account ecosystem, be it manufacturing and BNY investments, distribution through perching or servicing through Archer. Over the course of 2024, we also developed numerous new client solutions such as CollateralOne, Alts Bridge, a NextGen ETF servicing platform and new capabilities on Wove. This new product momentum is an important investment for the years ahead. Continuing the investment theme, over the course of the year, we further increased our investments to drive both revenues and scalability, and we generated approximately $0.5 billion of efficiency savings as we continue to digitize workflows and begin to leverage new technologies, including AI. We also commenced the phased transition to our strategic platform's operating model in the spring and over the course of 2024 transitioned approximately 13,000 employees or roughly one quarter of the company into this new way of working. Zooming out for a moment, the wrapper for much of our work is culture. Powering our culture remains essential to everything else and we are starting to see the benefits of our people around the world working more closely together. Celebrating our company's 240th anniversary in 2024 with colleagues, clients and many other stakeholders around the world felt even more special at a moment in which our people could start to see their hard work, leaving a positive mark on this iconic institution. Considering the transformation underway at our company, we decided that the time was right last summer to simplify and modernize our brand and logo to improve the market's familiarity of who we are and what we do. The benefits of BNY's improved visibility in the market have also supported our recruiting efforts. Throughout the year, we've been successful in attracting top talents across the firm from recruiting our largest intern and analyst classes to further rounding out our executive leadership team and the targeted investments we've been making in the employee experience across learning, benefits and facilities are being recognized and valued by our people. Another important aspect of powering our culture is to deliver on our commitments. We've worked hard to say what we do and to do what we say. And so, turning to Page 4, I'm pleased that in 2024, we once again met or exceeded our financial goals for the year. We are confident that BNY can deliver positive operating leverage across a wide range of scenarios and so we started 2024 determined to at least breakeven from an operating leverage perspective. That was an ambitious goal at the time, considering that our revenue outlook at the beginning of the year foresaw an approximately 10% NII headwind to largely offset growth in fee revenue. Therefore, we had to set up to keep expenses, excluding notable items roughly flat, while at the same time self-funding incremental investments in the business. Dermot will discuss the financials in more detail, but in summary, in 2024, we delivered 968 basis points of positive operating leverage on a reported basis and 288 basis points, excluding notable items. We grew fee revenue by 6% year-over-year and NII was down 1%, outperforming our outlook from the beginning of the year by approximately 9 percentage points. Despite higher-than-expected revenue, expenses were down 4% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items. And finally, consistent with our outlook, we returned 102% of 2024 earnings to our shareholders. Taken together, we delivered record financial results in 2024. Significant positive operating leverage resulted in pre-tax margin expansion and improved profitability and we delivered attractive capital returns to our shareholders, all of which underscored the execution of a reinvigorated BNY. But now, let's look forward on Page 5. We are entering 2025 with strong momentum and determination to deliver further value for our clients and shareholders. BNY plays a central role in global capital markets with $52 trillion of AUCA, $14 trillion of debt serviced, $3 trillion of wealth assets, and $5.6 trillion of assets on our collateral management platform. We manage $2 trillion of AUM and on an average day, we settle over $15 trillion worth of securities and roughly $2.5 trillion worth of payments for clients around the world. This exceptional client franchise and leadership across our diversified financial services platforms positions us well to capture market beta and capitalize on evolving market trends, several of which we describe on the left hand side of the page. Some of our fastest-growing businesses in 2024, treasury services, clearance and collateral management and corporate trust demonstrate our gearing toward economic growth and higher capital markets activity, both public and private. And through Pershing and Wealth, we are a leader in serving one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services, the US wealth market. Within that market, our wealth business is focused on the faster-growing ultra-high net worth space. Our Pershing business, on the other hand, leverages the size and scale of our platforms to power advisors' businesses, helping them navigate an increasingly complex operating environment using the power of our technology. Relevant for both retail and institutional investors, the trend toward private markets represents an opportunity for BNY to support our clients end-to-end from servicing to distribution, cash investment, FX hedging and lending across traditional and alternative asset classes. Last year also saw the mass adoption of digital assets exchange-traded products in the US, which grew to more than $100 billion in assets under management. BNY has been an early mover in the digital asset space. Today, we provide fund services for the vast majority of digital asset exchange-traded products in both the US and Canada and over the long term, we believe digital assets and the technology underpinnings have the transformative potential to help solve client and market needs. And finally, on this list of important market trends, as global markets evolve and become ever more complex, both buy-side and sell-side firms are looking to outsource certain functions and consolidate providers in order to gain scale and reduce risk, and we expect the strength and connectivity of our platforms to be a differentiator in this regard. As we think about the operating environment in 2025, just a month ago, there were clear signs of optimism with the US election behind us, inflation moderating and the Fed having begun its path toward lower rates. But with the turn of the year, we view the outlook for 2025 as a little more uncertain with persistent tail risks across geopolitical tensions and conflicts, uncertainty about trade and fiscal policies and volatility in markets. Against this backdrop, being positioned conservatively with a strong balance sheet and operational resilience allows us to remain focused on executing our ongoing transformation. While we've made good progress against our strategic priorities over the past 12 months, we have a lot more work ahead of us. As I've said before, strategy is important, actually doing it and how we do it matters the most. And so on the right-hand side of this page is the reminder of our strategic priorities and underneath each are some indicators for the progress that we're making. The makeup of our new business wins in 2024, we highlighted some of them on our earnings calls over the past year, validated for us that there is real demand in the market for the type of integrated solutions that BNY can deliver. For example, last year, we've seen a 30% year-on-year increase in sales from clients buying from three or more lines of business. This remains a work in progress but with real runway ahead. Our commercial model enables our client coverage teams to more effectively deliver integrated solutions from across BNY to our clients and our platform's operating model realigns how we work and organize ourselves across the entire organization in furtherance of that commercial opportunity. 2025 will be a milestone year for BNY's adoption of the platform's operating model. This transition is not just about driving efficiency, it is also about enabling topline growth. By simplifying, streamlining, and collaborating through cross-functional teams, we create more intuitive client journeys, improve our ability to anticipate unmet needs, and accelerate speed-to-market. This quarter, we're planning to activate our largest wave of platforms yet, so that by the end of March, more than half of our people will be working in the model. We believe that our transition into this model will have a meaningful impact to BNY over the years to come, and so we've included in the appendix of this presentation a summary of the program and the timeline for implementation. Next, our investments in digitization and AI over the last couple of years have laid a solid foundation for us to become more efficient and to drive topline growth over time. We're embracing the power of AI to make it easier for our employees to do their jobs and channel their energy towards new innovations. To summarize this broader alpha and beta theme, we believe that we are well-positioned to capture market beta and capitalize on evolving market trends, while we remain focused on generating Alpha through the continued transformation of the company. I'll wrap up on Page 6 by reminding you of the value proposition that we laid out for our clients, our shareholders, and our people at the beginning of last year. Our strategic priorities and financial goals are clear, and we remain focused on consistent execution. Before I turn the call over to Dermot for our financial update and outlook, I'd like to close by thanking our teams around the world. I'm proud of what our people have accomplished over the past two years and grateful for everyone's continued dedication to the hard work that's ahead of us. And with that, over to you, Dermot. Dermot McDonogh : Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm picking up on Page 9 of the presentation and will first touch upon 2024 highlights before diving into the results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue of $18.6 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 6%. Investment services fees grew 7%, reflecting net-new business, higher market values, and client activity across our Security Services and Marketing and Wealth Services segments. Investment management and performance fees from our Investment and Wealth Management segment were up 3%, driven by higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. Despite a year of relatively muted volatility, foreign exchange revenue was up 9% on the back of higher client volumes. Net interest income was down 1%, reflecting changes in the deposit mix, partially offset by higher investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth. Expenses of $12.7 billion were down 4% year-over-year on a reported basis, largely reflecting the net impact of adjustments for the FDIC special assessment. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 1%, reflecting higher investments, employee merit increases, and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. On a reported basis, pre-tax margin was 31% and return on tangible common equity was 23% for the year. Excluding notable items, pre-tax margin was 33% and return on tangible common equity was 24%. We reported earnings per share of $5.80. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $6.03, up 19% year-over-year and we returned 102% of earnings to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2024. Now turning to Page 11 for the financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Total revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 9%. This includes 9% growth in investment services fees, reflecting net-new business, higher client activity, and higher market values. Investment management and performance fees were also up 9%, driven by higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows. Firmwide AUCA of $52.1 trillion were up 9% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, client inflows, and net-new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar. Assets under management of $2 trillion were up 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. Foreign exchange revenue increased by 24%, driven by higher client volumes. Investment in other revenue was $140 million in the quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2023 included a $144 million reduction in investment and other revenue related to a fair-value adjustment of a receivable. Excluding notable items, the year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the absence of strategic equity investment gains recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. Net interest income increased by 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Expenses of $3.4 billion were down 16% year-over-year on a reported basis, primarily reflecting the FDIC special assessment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding notable items, which were primarily severance and higher litigation reserves in the fourth quarter of 2024, expenses were up 2%. This reflects higher revenue-related expenses, employee marriage increases, and increased investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. Provision for credit losses was $20 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting reserve increases related to commercial real estate exposure. Pre-tax margin was 30% and return on tangible common equity was 23%. Excluding notable items, pre-tax margin was 34% and return on tangible common equity was 26%. We reported earnings per share of $1.54 and excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.72, up 33% year-over-year. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 12. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 5.7%. Tier 1 capital decreased by 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income and capital returns through common stock repurchases and dividends, partially offset by capital generated through earnings. Average assets were up 1%. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.2%. CET1 capital decreased by 5% sequentially and risk-weighted assets increased by 1%. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders over the course of the fourth quarter. Moving to liquidity. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 115% and the consolidated net stable funding ratio was 132%. Next, net interest income and balance sheet trends on Page 13. Net interest income of $1.2 billion was up 8% year-over-year and up 14% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by the reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Average deposit balances increased by 1% sequentially. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased by 7% in the quarter and interest-bearing deposits decreased by 1%. Average interest-earning assets were flat quarter-over-quarter. Our cash and reverse repo, loan, and investment securities portfolio balances all remained flat. Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 14. Security Services reported total revenue of $2.3 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 6% year-over-year. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 7%, primarily reflecting higher market values, client activity, and net new business. We're pleased with the broad-based momentum in asset servicing. Clients are increasingly looking to leverage the scale of BNY's platforms and utilize the differentiated breadth of our capabilities and at the same time, we continue to see particular strength in ETF and alternative servicing, validating the multiyear investments we've made into these platforms. ETF AUCA of $2.8 trillion were up over 60% year-over-year with inflows into ETFs on our platform once again outpacing the market and alternatives AUCA were up 20% year-over-year. In issuer services, investment services fees were up 4%. Healthy net-new business and higher client activity in corporate trust was partially offset by lower depository receipt fees, reflecting a higher level of corporate actions and cross-border activity in the prior year quarter. Over the course of 2024, we've maintained our market-leading share in straight stat servicing and by increasing our market share in CLO servicing, further strengthened our number 2 position. In this segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 25% year-over-year, reflecting growth from higher client activity. Net interest income for the segment was up 7% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $1.7 billion were up 1% year-over-year, reflecting higher litigation reserves, employee marriage increases and higher investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was $643 million, a 39% increase year-over-year, and pre-tax margin was 28%. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 15. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 12% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 9%, reflecting higher market values and client activity. Net-new assets were $41 billion, including a large client onboarding in the quarter. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees increased by 13%, primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and clearance volumes. We continue to see strong US securities clearance volumes on the back of US treasury issues as well as trading activity across the platform. And we remain focused on increasing market connectivity by expanding our global collateral platform to new markets. In Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 15%, primarily reflecting net-new business. In November, the US Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service selected BNY as the new financial agent for the Direct Express program. This decision to appoint BNY speaks to our organization's strength in driving commercial outcomes that broaden access to the financial ecosystem. The program leverages our innovative and resilient payment capabilities to provide disbursement services at scale. Net interest income for the segment overall was up 9% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $852 million were up 2% year-over-year, reflecting higher revenue-related expenses, investments, and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings and lower litigation reserves. Pre-tax income was up 28% year-over-year at $806 million, representing a 48% pre-tax margin. Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 16. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $873 million, up 29% year-over-year. In our Investment Management business, revenue was up 41%. Excluding a notable item in the prior year quarter, revenue was up 5%, reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows. And in Wealth Management, revenue increased by 9%, reflecting higher market values and net interest income, partially offset by changes in product mix. Segment expenses of $700 million were up 2% year-over-year as higher revenue-related expenses and employee merit increases were partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was $173 million and pre-tax margin was 20%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2 trillion increased by 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. In the fourth quarter, we saw net outflows of $15 billion. This includes $27 billion of net outflows from long-term strategies and $12 billion of net inflows into cash. Wealth Management's client assets of $327 billion increased by 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 17 shows the results of the other segment. Next, on Page 19, our current outlook for 2025. Positive operating leverage continues to be our North Star and so once again, we have set ourselves up to drive positive operating leverage consistent with our medium-term financial targets. Starting with NII, based on current market implied forward interest rates, we expect full-year 2025 NII to be up mid-single-digit percentage points year-over-year. We expect fee revenue to be up year-over-year and we expect approximately 1% to 2% year-over-year growth in expenses, excluding notable items for the full year 2025. Specific to the first quarter, I would like to remind you that staff expenses are typically elevated due to long-term incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees. And then on taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2025 to be in the 22% to 23% range. And finally, our philosophy for capital deployment and distributions remains unchanged. We anticipate to continue to pursue growth opportunities and deliver compelling capital returns to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Based on what we are seeing today, we expect to return 100% plus or minus 2025 earnings over the course of the year. As always, we will calibrate the pace of our buybacks considering factors such as balance sheet growth opportunities as well as macroeconomic and interest rate environments, which are real considerations in 2025. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio management target remains unchanged at 5.5% to 6% and against the backdrop of continued interest rate volatility, we will continue to manage ourselves to the upper end of that range for the foreseeable future. To wrap up on Page 20, in January of last year, we shared our firmwide medium-term financial targets, which were to improve BNY's pre-tax margin to equal to or greater than 33% and our return on tangible common equity to equal to or greater than 23% over the medium term while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have made solid progress towards these targets over the past 12 months and are excited about the year in front of us as our people harness the momentum and continue to embrace our pillars and principles in order to consistently meet or exceed our targets through the cycle. As Robin said at the top of the call, we're pleased with our performance this past year and we're heading into 2025 with good momentum, confident that we're on the right path to unlock the opportunity embedded in our company. And with that, operator, can you please open the line? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good afternoon. Robin Vince : Hey, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess -- hey, Robin. I guess first question and it's with the lens of -- I'm trying to -- you'll hit your pretax margin ROE targets on an adjusted basis this year. I guess I understand it's equal to or greater than. But I'm trying to get a sense of the resiliency of these numbers as we think about, I mean, you have done a great job executing over the last year or two of what the runway is and is it reasonable for us to assume that those pre-tax margins being higher than where you are today is actually achievable, assuming no big market shock. So maybe if you want to at a very high level, address that, Robin and then I can follow up. Dermot McDonogh : Hi, Ebrahim, it's Dermot here. So I would say as it relates to the medium-term targets that we gave this time last year and I think you collectively as a group liked those targets that we gave you. And since Robin has taken on the role as CEO, we've kind of have eight quarters where we've executed very well. And I'd like to think that we've established a track record of execution and holding ourselves accountable as Robin said in his prepared remarks, say what you do and do is what you say. And so we feel confident that we're going to hit those targets sustainably through the cycle. So you're going to see more of the same from us and what you've seen in the last couple of years into '25 and beyond. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. And I guess if I look at Slide 5 and just this whole conversation around 80% of employees being on sort of the platform model by end of '25, if you could address that in two ways in terms of does that result in a lot more resilience to your fee revenue growth relative to whatever may happen to markets? One, like the resiliency that provides in terms of the synergies you're getting from moving to that model. And again, that flows through in terms of these targets, could you actually do much better than where we've been for the last few quarters on the back of the -- and maybe that's a '26 event. But I'm just wondering if the platform allows for more resilient fee growth and actually an improvement relative to where we are on margins and ROE? Robin Vince : So the way I think about this is if you kind of look at the three pillars of the strategy, be more for clients, run our company better and power our culture and then underneath that, which we talk about less, but are very important in terms of how we run the company internally or the pillars and how we show up in terms of behaviors every day. The platform operating model, which we've laid out a page for you, page 22, really is the mechanism by which we kind of drive the three pillars. So I do really believe quite strongly that the platform operating model will drive incremental topline growth, will make the topline growth more resilient, but also will allow us to run the company better and become more efficient with that. And that then in turn, we used the words over the last couple of years de-siloing, bringing our businesses closer together and that really speaks to on the topline side, the launch of the commercial operating model that we kind of went out with in the middle of last year. So you take all those discrete elements together and you add it together, you kind of go, okay, fee revenue is going to kind of incrementally grind higher from here with the tools that we're deploying and executing. Dermot McDonogh : And, Ebrahim, I'd add one thing to it, which is just this concept that we've talked about before on the call about short, medium and long term and we have consistently been investing both for the topline and also for expense efficiency with all three-time horizons, and we've been trying to do that pretty consistently over the past two years and that's relevant for your question because it isn't just a '26 story, it's actually going to be a '27, '28, and '29 story as well in our opinion, because some of what the platform's model enables is really a foundational point that then allows us to do other things. Retiring systems comes after that. We've retired some, we can retire more. Being able to do more solutioning for clients, we've done some, but we can do even more. So it's quite a bedrock thing for us and given the fact that we won't even be fully into the model until 2026, I think you can expect that there's more payoff to come, '26, '27, '28 through the end of the decade, quite frankly, if we do this well. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And that\u2019s a great slide, the Slide 27. So good job. Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, just two things. One, just to wrap up on that last topic. Given that '23, '24, you got to 25% of the folks in the operating model, the platform model. And in '25 you're putting on an incremental 60%. I get that the benefits of all of this is multi-year but that's a step-up in the percentage of employees that are going to be joining the platform in '25. So should we expect that operating leverage will also increase given this large slug of folks coming in '25? Robin Vince : I would say the two things on a direct correlation in terms of the way that you're linking it because -- Betsy, because as you go back to the beginning of our platform's operating model, we're already three years into this if you include the very thought at the beginning of the process because we started actually looking at this and thinking about this during my transition into the CEO role. We then designed, we then started to test, we then started to actually execute and so the deliberateness with which we've gone about this has been very important because we knew that it was a very fundamental change for the company and we wanted to make sure that we were doing it progressively and although there are some benefits from employee satisfaction and speeding up some of the ways that we work as people go into the model, the real benefits so far we've observed based on the pilots that we actually started doing in 2022 come more like a year or so afterwards as the teams are getting into their new rhythms of working [Technical Difficulty] and then -- so there's a phased delivery. And then you have the benefit of, okay, now you've got a really tight team operating at a higher velocity. Now what can you do with that, better in control of their design of their systems, better in control of the design of their client products, rationalizing the back end in terms of the multiple potentially duplicative things and so we see the lead time associated with it and I think that the payoffs that you and Ebrahim were sort of scratching at are there, but they're not there as immediately as you're talking about. Now notwithstanding that, we've got other things back to my short, medium and long-term observation that we have invested in that we feel quite confident will deliver us the expense benefits in 2025 that are part of our guide. Betsy Graseck : Yeah, it just feels like going from 25% to 60% to 80%, right, in one year should over time bump up that operating leverage rate. Anyway, that's okay. All right. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Robin Vince : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan, your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Sorry, had the mute button pressed. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. So we saw a really solid rebound in net-new assets at Pershing this quarter. So curious if you could maybe compare and contrast how that would look like for net-new assets in prior quarters ex the offboarding, which we were dealing with. And, Robin, I believe you spoke to ultra-high net worth as like a client segment driving or wealth strata driving some of this. But could you speak to maybe what type of firms are driving this growth? Is it RIAs? Is it broker dealers, any particular sources of strength? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh : So thanks for the question, Brennan. Look, '24, it was a noisy year given the large offboarding and we had, as I said in my prepared remarks, a large onboarding in Q4 and look, we kind of -- I guess the way to think about it is, we would like to reiterate our -- we think we have a good ability and the right to win and grow our net-new assets at mid-single digits through the cycle and that's across the space, whether it's RIAs, whether it's broker-dealers, banks, that's -- and we have the team and the technology in place. And if you just look at Wove this time last year, we kind of gave a guide on Wove, we executed the guide on that. We've re-guided higher again this year on Wove. We've now got 36 clients on the platform. We have 41 signed contracts. So all in all, we feel like we have kind of really, really big momentum on Pershing in the forward and it's one of the bigger pieces of business that's going into the platform operating model in Q1. So we [seek] (ph) to see incremental benefits for that. So Pershing continues to be a very, very strong business for us and we continue to see it growing. And like Robin will touch on the wealth tech sector, but that is one of the fastest-growing areas in the market and we are a big player in that space. Robin Vince : Yeah. And the thing that I'd add, Brennan, is just you made the point about ultra-high net worth. That's really in our BNY Wealth business. We like that business. It's been a solid performer. We think there's more upside in that over time and then Pershing is really across the high net worth space and that's got its focus on $1 billion plus RIA firms and that's where we're investing. Together, they're about $3 trillion worth of wealth assets and so when we think about what is the market trend, we think the US wealth market is a big trend and we're actually approaching it through both of those businesses, one ultra-high net worth, one real software and service approaching the broader retail market. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that color. That's helpful. And then shifting gears a bit on the NII expectations. Certainly, our outlook looks better this year than it did a year ago. Could you maybe help us understand what you would think the trajectory would look like? Do you still think you're largely very neutral? So should those -- should that cadence be largely stable? And you made a reference to changes in the deposit mix. Are there any notable shifts in deposit mix that you're assuming as you model out the year? Dermot McDonogh : Okay. So in order to answer the question, Brennan, I'd like to maybe spend a couple of seconds just reflecting on '24 where we kind of gave the guide down 10%, we came in down 1%. When I think back on that year, for me, it was really kind of broken into three years in one. When we sat here at this time last year, I think the market implied forward curve was pricing in about six to seven rate cuts. And then clearly, the Fed was kind of signaling higher for longer that kind of in the spring and that's the way we were kind of positioned at the time. And then clarity over the summer, you had Jackson Hole kind of around the time of the Fed pivot and we kind of were very proactive on the asset side of the balance sheet there in terms of repositioning the book in terms of taking advantage of the higher rates at the time before the Fed started the easing cycle, which we've kind of factored into our guide for this year. And then as we went into the fall and kind of we had a very strong finish to the end of the year and that was really kind of the strength of the franchise, clients doing more with us, which led to higher balances overall, particularly NIBs, particularly in the corporate trust space where we had more clients doing kind of year end activity. Now on balances overall, we've kind of seen that moderate a little bit at the beginning of the year, as you would expect, particularly on the NIB side. And so as you know, like the whole NII is made up of balances, it's made up of the forward curve, it's made up of clients doing stuff with us and it's made up of what we're doing on the asset side. And I've said this many times on prior calls, like I really do believe that we have a unique strength in terms of the tripod in terms of the interaction between our CIO, the GLS leadership and then our treasurer and that team is working really, really well to deliver the strength of the franchise, which shows up in that strong guide of mid-single digits for this year. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for that color. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hey. I'm torn on this financial services platform company transformation. On the one hand, I mean, I guess it's great if everyone's on the same platform, you can have the One BNY. On the other hand, it just seems like a lot of work to go from 25% employees to 80% with all -- looks like you're ripping the guts out of the company, maybe you have to run parallel systems, maybe you have training, and so I'm just -- when you add it all together, in the short term, are you guiding for positive fee operating leverage in '25? And if -- I mean, it's -- when you're going through a transformation like this, it's tough to show any positive operating leverage. So I get that and then what are you really playing for in the end? I mean, I get One BNY, I get one platform. I just -- it's just a little too conceptual. Could you just put a little more meat on the bones? Robin Vince : Absolutely, Mike. Happy to. So to make this a little clearer, let me just take you back for a moment to something that we talked about two years ago on the call when we were describing the work that we had done to really underwrite who BNY was, what we do, who does it, how we do it and we came to this point of view that the essence of the company is that we really provide technology, services and software for clients to build their businesses on. We have these market-leading platforms, number one in collateral, number one in securities lending, number one in issuer services. Yeah, we're the number one -- world's number one custodian as well. We've got this big $3 trillion wealth platform that we just talked about. These things are essentially a combination of technology and software and services. And so, allowing our clients to be able to build business, rent the scale of that platform is the very heart of our growth and you can see it in the numbers because market and wealth services, where we've got a lot of those platforms, not all of them, is the part of the company that is the most profitable with the highest margin and it's the fastest growing. And so with that said, recognizing who we are, we had to do two things around how we approach it. Number one, we had to get serious and organized around the commercial front end of that, that One BNY, the new commercial model, the stats that we gave you in the presentation around how we're driving to do more things for those clients. We're doing more solutions as well as adding new products. But the other thing that we had to do is you just can't run a siloed back-end organization with multiple versions of everything and I'm not just talking about systems platforms, I'm talking about the very organization of the people. We had -- we've joked about this before, we had eight call centers. We had multiple custody pieces of technology. We onboarded clients in every individual bit of the company separately. That just doesn't work for the nature of the company that we are and where we're headed. So we determined that we had to operate and organize differently. That's what platform's operating model is about. But to Betsy's question, we've been very deliberate about organizing it over a multiple time frame. We don't want to create disruption. We don't think we are. We don't think we've had any setback in terms of who we are in grinding through the year because of this. We actually think at the margin, it's been a tailwind each year. It can just be an even bigger tailwind in the out years and with three key metrics in mind, one, employee satisfaction has gone up as people have been in the model and operated in it. The second thing is we've delivered better for clients and the velocity of that new deliver -- delivery has gone up and then the third thing is the efficiency with which we're operating those groups has also improved. So we're in -- you're right, it's a big change. This is not something you drift into. It's not something you do if you've got a kind of quick cleanup mentality for a couple of years. But if you're trying to make BNY the very best that it can be with a medium to long-range mindset, this is the sort of fundamental thing you do. The good news is, we've also been delivering all along the way and that's important. Mike Mayo : And do you have an example outside the banking industry, software-as-a-service, I mean, when I hang out with my tech colleagues, they'll use phrases like you're using. Is there any example or maybe another bank somewhere else around the world or fintech or is it something brand new? Robin Vince : So this is in -- this is borrowed, broadly speaking from the technology industry. I've sat down with CEOs of large tech-titan companies and this is essentially how they've built or reorganized themselves. As you say, if you sit down with the CEO of a technology firm, it might be a fintech, a large fintech firm, it might be a pure tech firm. This is how they've organized themselves and we're not doing it because it's tech and trendy. We're doing it because the nature of what we do is more platforms like. Now there are examples in the bank space of some banks who sort of for little bits of their business have gone after this. There are also examples in the broader fintech space, plenty of examples of firms who've adopted this concept because of who they are. But we think it's a particularly good fit for us. I wouldn't encourage every other bank. I think if you're an investment bank or a big trading house, or a big retail bank, this doesn't necessarily fit. But we're different than that. We are a bank, we have bank form, but the nature of our businesses is quite different and we think quite well-suited to it. And importantly, the early pilots that we've done, remember, we're into this thing already and we've got a lot of measurement of how it's been going and that's what gives us our confidence. It's not just theory. Mike Mayo : And then last follow up, tech spending, '24 compared to '25 and how much -- do you feel better, worse, the same about your AI efforts? Dermot McDonogh : So, like, the zip code of tech spending, Mike, we're in the kind of $3.8 billion range of numbers and we have roughly earmarked $0.5 billion for investment this year. I feel like, yeah, really, really good about where we are on the AI journey. We spent the last couple of years building out the infrastructure. We've got really good relationships at with the West Coast and we have a seat at the table and learning what to do and how to do it. So I think you're going to hear a lot more from us in the coming quarters about how we deploy AI to run the company better. Robin Vince : And as a broader statement, this concept of running the company better has different seasons to it. Season number one has been a lot of blocking and tackling. Season number two is really the platform's operating model, implementation and then harvesting the benefit. That lasts a few years. And then AI and we think AI is very important and so within the mix of that 3.8 that Dermott mentioned, there's a gradual pivot that's occurring under the hood around uplifting basic capabilities and infrastructure, which was the past through to making our systems better through AI and I think that evolution is quite important. So it may feel like a static number, but it's actually not a static composition. Mike Mayo : Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : For our next question, we'll move to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Another one for you guys on operating leverage. So obviously, great progress so far. Here you are loud and clear on 2025 and more importantly beyond. I guess in that context, how important is fee operating leverage to the firm? I know you talk about total, which is right and NII is a helper in 2025, but for whatever reason if the fee outlook falls short, how much wiggle room do you guys have against that 1% to 2%? And again, maybe talk about the fee operating leverage as well as a metric that you care about or not? Dermot McDonogh : Thanks, Alex. So we do talk about total and we're very focused on delivering that consistently through the cycle and I also think about it in terms of fee operating leverage and we're also focused on delivering positive fee operating leverage as well. But look, as I said in my prepared remarks, total operating leverage is the North Star. There are a number of factors that go into that. NII, fees, expenses and with each of those categories, we have multiple levers that we can toggle. So we feel like we have flexibility over the inputs in terms of how we end up with that number and so I kind of think if you kind of take last year, 288 was a very good year and look, there was a reasonable amount of kind of positive contribution to that from NII and so we expect to deliver positive fee operating leverage through the cycle as well as well as total. Alex Blostein : Got it. All right. Super helpful. And then a small nuanced follow up for you guys just around NII. We've seen stronger results in the repo business for a handful of quarters now, and I think there's still some expectation for that to normalize, but clearly that hasn't happened yet. So maybe talk a little bit about the factors that contributed to the stronger performance in that part of the model within the quarter, but also maybe within the year. What could change that given where you are in the sort of the environment and the outlook? And what do you think is the appropriate run rate, I guess, for that contribution to NII going forward? Thanks. Robin Vince : So for Clear to Repo, look, strong performance in Q4. The only context I would give you on that, Alex, is it's kind of -- it's roughly 5% of the overall NII. So how we talk about it, it's still kind of small in the context of the bigger number. We've invested a lot in it in the last couple of years in terms of technology, better products, being more for clients, etcetera. So on balance, expect it to grow, but it's not a meaningful part of the overall number. Alex Blostein : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Good afternoon, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Just on a couple of assumptions on the financial outlook for '25. Maybe just to start with net interest revenue and appreciate all the commentary you made, Dermot, on the factors on that. It looks like it's more based on the asset and deposit side on mix as opposed to growth in deposits and growth in earning assets. So I just want to get your sense of, you know, all else equal, do you -- to what extent do you think you can actually grow the deposit base via all the client initiatives you have? Dermot McDonogh : So for '24, like we kind of -- I think we outperformed on the balance side. But as we look out into '25 and you kind of talk about and if you reflect on Robin's remarks in terms of starting in the year, a little bit more uncertainty in kind of post the election. So for now, we kind of in the way we've come up with the guide, we expect balances to be roughly flat and the mix-shift underneath kind of from Q4 to Q1 expect NIBs to moderate a little bit and kind of touch down. We're kind of in the zip code of kind of $44 billion to $46 billion of NIBs is kind of -- it's what is embedded in the outlook. But we still have a reasonable amount of the book to roll off at kind of 2% and yielding assets into current market rates. So you're correct, David, in terms of like a lot of proactive management of the balance sheet on the asset side is given us confidence around that mid-single-digit guide. Brian Bedell : Okay. Okay, great. And then shifting to the fee side. It looks like this guidance is sort of an alpha guide. You talked about the drivers of being higher organic growth as you make progress on the platform strategy, of course, partially mitigated by -- by current currency headwinds. But does this assume generally flat markets? I guess that would be in line with your uncertainty commentary and then I guess if we do have very strong equity markets, say, if we're up just 10%, what would be the rough delta to revenue on that? Dermot McDonogh : Thanks, Brian. So what I would say is roughly kind of 5% on markets from here is about kind of $70 million in fees. That's the rough sensitivity and to your kind of the first part of your question, we kind of given the last couple of years have, as you say, really strong performance in markets. We are kind of more neutral on kind of market growth in terms of our guide. Brian Bedell : Okay. Dermot McDonogh : [indiscernible] Operator : We'll take our next question from David Smith with Truist Securities. David Smith : Hi, good afternoon. You managed to hold your -- hi you managed to hold your AUCA flat despite a big decline in fixed income markets in the fourth quarter. Can you remind us just how much of that $52.1 trillion might be showing off of the lag and not reflect the full decline in markets we saw later in the quarter? Either way, it seems like inflows to the asset servicing business were really strong in the quarter. Could you comment on the competitive environment that you're seeing there as well, please? Dermot McDonogh : So look, I'll start with the competitive environment. I think very pleased with where asset servicing is in terms of competitive strength, in terms of new business, one over the last year. We came into '24 with strong momentum and we executed very well and we talked about a number of the deals that we won on prior calls. We've invested in the infrastructure. I think we're showing up well for clients and we exit the year feeling very good about the business and I think you know in some ways, asset servicing, everybody looks at asset servicing as the bellwether of the firm and so we kind of enter into 2025 with continued momentum and our right to win and winning our share and the world's largest custodian, I think we're going to do just fine in '25. Robin Vince : And there's not a ton of lag. David Smith : Okay. And then just to clarify, you mentioned $44 billion to $46 billion of NIBs embedded in the outlook. Is that the average for the first quarter or for the full year? Dermot McDonogh : For the full year. David Smith : All right. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Thomas Leddy : Hi, good afternoon. This is Thomas Leddy standing in for Gerard. Aside from the obvious geopolitical risks we all see in the news, what are the primary risks you guys are monitoring for your businesses? Robin Vince : Well, there are a lot of risks in the world at the moment. I've been asked this question a bunch of times over the course of the past few months and as you can imagine, we got wars in and it's essentially two different continents. We've got uncertainty in terms of policy in many countries. We've got some countries, important major economies that have really been struggling to be able to find growth. We've just gone through the great year of elections, and so we've got a lot of new teams in place in countries around the world. There's clearly at some point the risk of a downturn or recession in the US, it's not something that we see around the corner right now. There's the impact of higher rates. If we lock in rates at higher levels, maybe even 10 years at 5%, 5.25%, who knows, certainly possible, those things can create complexity as well. So the market is really contending with a long list of things which today are probably each fairly low probability, but there are a lot of them. So the chances of something happening are probably out there. So we're not in the predictions business. We're just trying to prepare. I think our platforms give us the ability to help clients navigate these uncertainties. And so that's clearly our focus. But that -- if you had to pick a couple, you're going to say geopolitical risk probably curve risk, absolute levels of issuance, which is true for several different countries, and cyber risk. Now on the flip side of that, I should -- I think it's important to mention it, we're a capital markets-oriented company. We're a financial services platform company and so we're pro-growth, we benefit from growth and it's very encouraging, including particularly here in the US with the new incoming administration to hear this pro-growth mantra because growth is A, important for our business and B, it enables so many other things. And so on the flip side of the risks, I think there is this undertone of this sort of sense of possibility of the year, which we certainly haven't lost sight of all the while we're managing for the risks that are out there. Thomas Leddy : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And sort of sticking to the theme of many cross currents, can you give us some color on how increased trading volatility attributed to the dynamic interest rate environment might impact your servicing fee revenue growth? Dermot McDonogh : Well, definitely -- if you just look at last year, if you just pick one business in particular, clearance and collateral management, which really benefits from increased treasury issuance, increased volatility, clients doing more activity and we just process much more volume on the platform and when you hear us talking about increased volume, we mean talking about increased fees and last year, there were a number of times where we had records and records on records in terms of what's going through the pipes. So I think treasury issuance has been a real tailwind for us over the last couple of years. Robin Vince : And there were two things that I'd add just quickly on composition of revenues because to the prior question, the absolute levels of assets does matter in some parts of our business. To your question, transaction volumes matter, elsewhere we have revenues from direct software sales. That's a growing part of who we are and part of this sort of platform's concept. But if you just take something like fixed income and this goes to the gearing to capital markets that we laid out in one of our trends pages in the presentation, take fixed income, what's happening in public markets, private markets, in credit touches so many of our businesses, our clearance business, our collateral management business, our asset servicing business, our corporate trust business, our debt capital markets business, our investment management fixed-income business, our investment management LDI business, our cash strategies and so the firm across the breadth of who we are is really able to capitalize in a lot of different ways back to this point on growth and activity. Thomas Leddy : Thank you. That's helpful and thank you guys for taking my question. Dermot McDonogh : Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks for taking my follow-ups. Just wanted to circle back on Wove. I think, Dermot, you mentioned -- and maybe I missed this, you said you had a revenue guide. I saw the $75 million of exit in exit rate annualized in '24. Did I miss the actual guide for '25 or is that the off-boarding point? And maybe if you can just talk about just general progress that was? Dermot McDonogh : So, incremental revenue for '25 of $60 million to $70 million and I would say we're very pleased 36 clients on the platform, 41 kind of signed contracts and in the prepared remarks, we kind of talked about the proliferation of products that we announced at Insight last summer. So becoming more sophisticated and clients really liking what they're seeing. Brian Bedell : Got it. And then 67 is incremental to the 30 of '24. Is that correct? Dermot McDonogh : Yeah, that's correct. Brian Bedell : Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin for any additional or closing remarks. Robin Vince : Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for your time today. We appreciate your interest in BNY. Please reach out to Marius and the IR team if you have any follow-up questions. Be well. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 4 o'clock P.M. Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day.",
