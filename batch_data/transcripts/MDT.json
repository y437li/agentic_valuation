At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic's first quarter earnings release conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to hand the program over to Mr. Jeff Warren. Please go ahead. Jeff Warren : Thank you, Christie. Good morning and welcome to Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2014's first quarter which ended July 26, 2013. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results, increasing or decreasing, are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone joining us today. This morning we reported first quarter revenue of $4.1 billion, representing growth of 3% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.88. While our results reflect that we are broadly outperforming the medtech sector, they were at the low end of our annual revenue outlook. However, we delivered on the bottom line, overcoming a number of challenges through strong operating discipline. Looking ahead, our assumptions for the full fiscal year remained intact and we are confident in both our outlook for the remainder of the year and our long term competitive position in the changing healthcare environment. We continue strengthen and geographically diversify our business in order to deliver consistent and dependable growth. Overall, our Q1 results varied by business and geography with strong performances in some areas offset by challenges in other parts of our business. While our international operations performed well, growing 9%, our U.S. business declined 1%. This was driven by pressures in three distinct areas, CRDM implants, PAINSTIM and diabetes. We expect full recovery in all three of these businesses within the fiscal year. So let me briefly walk you through the key dynamics. In CRDM we continue to grow our global implantable revenues meaningfully faster than the overall market. But our U.S implantable results were affected by lower levels of bulk sales because of the phase-in timing of our new high power products. Gary will provide details later, but the net outcome was that the bulk sales were the lowest level in six years, affecting not only high power, but also our pacing business. At the same time, overall pricing dynamics improved and hospital inventory levels came down, which should improve our growth through the balance of the year. We fully expect to have our new technology on contract in our major accounts during Q2 at a price that reflects the proven clinical and economic benefits of our latest devices. This should result in a more typical level of bulk sales in the next quarter. Turning to Europe, the business had a mixed quarter, with strong performances in DBS and gastro-uro, both posting at or near double digit growth, offset by declines in U.S PAINSTIM. We received FDA approval for our game-changing MRI system much earlier than expected and made the decision to transition manufacturing in Q1 and observed supply constraints in both previous and new products. This family of products is now launching in the U.S., and while it is still early in the quarter, they\u2019re being well received by our customers, and the PAINSTIM business has resumed its growth. In U.S Diabetes, we had another challenging quarter declining 3%, but this was by no means unexpected. As we mentioned last quarter, the business will remain under pressure until we receive approval of the MiniMed 530G system. We continue to work diligently with the FDA so that we can make this important technology available this fiscal year. Upon launch, we expect our U.S Diabetes business to return to solid growth on the strength of our new products and our ability to recognize revenue we have deferred over the past few quarters. Now, let me discuss the rest of our business with a number of positive highlights. In our spine business, core spine outperformed a relatively stable market as our new products in enabling technologies continued to make a difference. Our U.S. core spine business, excluding balloon kyphoplasty grew 1% this quarter. In BMP, the declines appear to be tapering, and we saw relative sequential stability again this quarter. The independent reviews of Infuse commissioned by Yale University were completed in Q1, providing further evidence that for approved indications, Infuse is a safe and effective treatment option. Later this fall, we are expecting final publication of our retrospective analysis of a large, national payer database investigating the cancer incidents in the real world usage of Infuse. The manuscript of that study was recently published online, ahead of print by the Journal Spine. The authors found no evidence that administration of BMP at the time of lumbar fusion surgery was associated with cancer risk. Looking ahead, if current trends continue, we expect our global FY 2014 BMP revenue to be down in the mid-single digits which would be a significant improvement from the 15% decline last fiscal year and would represent a 40 to 50 basis point improvement to our overall company growth. In U.S coronary, drug-eluting stent sales exceeded our expectations, solidly outperforming the market with 4% growth, despite having annualized the launch of Resolute Integrity. Our international regions continued to deliver solid results. As I mentioned earlier, revenue was up 9%, driven principally by Japan and emerging markets. Our international regions have now grown in the upper single digits for 12 consecutive quarters, which is the type of consistent and balanced performance that we\u2019re looking for. Japan had another outstanding quarter, up 29%, driven by the continued success of our new products, including the Advisa MRI pacemaker, Resolute Integrity DES, and Endurant II AAA Stent Graft. In Western Europe, while our growth was aided by advanced purchases of CoreValve in Germany, we did see another quarter of relative stabilization across the region. Our European team is navigating through the various market dynamics to unlock potential growth opportunities using innovation as well as our breadth and scale to partner with different stakeholders. Emerging markets grew 15%, with strong performances from Middle East and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe regions, partially offset by pressure in Latin America and India. Latin America was softer than expected this quarter as we transitioned from some of our dealers to direct sales. Our India region declined as we faced challenges from government imposed pricing reductions for stents as well as temporary disruption from the termination of a coronary distributor. Looking ahead, we remain focused on high-teens growth in emerging markets in the near term while striving for 20% or better over the long term. We believe these markets will continue to provide an independent growth vector for us, becoming an increasingly significant source of consistent and reliable revenue over time. Let's now turn back to the U.S. region. As I discussed previously, we expect to fully recover from the specific challenges we faced this quarter, but we also have an additional number of exciting growth drivers which should significantly improve our performance in the U.S. over the next seven quarters. And it's worth spending a few moments to briefly highlight them. First, in addition to the recently launched Viva CRT-D, Evera ICD, and Advisa MRI pacemaker products, the CRDM business plans to launch the Reveal LINQ late this fiscal year. This is our next generation implantable loop recorder which would expand our offerings across the patient continuum of care. In endovascular, we are expecting approval of a dissection indication for the Valiant Captivia Thoracic platform along with obtaining an SFA indication for the complete SE Vascular Stent in peripheral. In spine, similar to our SOLERA platform in thoracolumbar, we are planning a complete refresh of our anterior cervical plate family of products. Starting with expected approval of our PRESTIGE LP Cervical Disc, we will launch a series of additional new products over the coming quarters. Cervical makes up nearly a quarter of our U.S. core spine business and these launches should enhance our competitive position. In surgical technologies, we are developing the next iteration of our highly successful O-arm Imaging System which will expand a number of supported clinical applications and therefore increase further its economic value proposition for hospitals. I would also like to note that Cardiocom, the new service and solution acquisition that we announced last week will also immediately start contributing to our growth. I will discuss Cardiocom in more detail in a moment. And finally, we are making excellent progress on three fundamental new therapy areas that meaningfully impact our outlook for FY 2015 and beyond, our CoreValve transcatheter aortic valve, our renal denervation system for treatment resistant hypertension, and our Admiral drug-eluting balloon. These products are market leaders in Europe and we are planning to launch all three of them in the U.S. with CoreValve and Symplicity in FY '15, and Admiral in FY '16. Regarding CoreValve, we have filed with the FDA, all the extreme risk modules for our U.S. pivotal trial, and are preparing for launch in the first half of FY 2015. Extreme risk data will be included in late breaking clinical trials at TCT later this fall, and the high risk data is expected to be presented at the ACC next spring. With respect to Symplicity, we have completed patient randomization in our U.S. HTN-3 pivotal trial, and we expect the results to be presented sometime in the first half of calendar year 2014, while targeting U.S. approval in FY '15. In addition, we expect the FDA and CMS parallel review program to reduce the time between FDA approval and full reimbursement. For the Admiral DEB program, we completed enrollment in our initial SFA pivotal trial and have submitted our first PMA module. Turning now to the rest of the P&L. Our organization delivered at the bottom line despite multiple pressures. Revenue came in a little lighter than expected. We had a higher than expected share count. There were significant FX headwinds, and our gross margins were negatively impacted by specific quality issues. Gary will cover all of these items in more detail later, but on the final point I want to emphasize that while diverting resources to enhance our quality systems can be costly, ensuring the highest level of quality and regulatory compliance has and always will be a personal priority for me and a central focus of everything that we do at Medtronic. At the same time, we continue to make progress in a number of key operating initiatives, including product cost reduction and working capital improvements. We are in the middle of $1.2 billion product cost reduction initiative, which helps us successfully offset pricing pressure and stabilize gross margins. In our working capital improvement program, we have set a goal of increasing our inventory turns by 50% in FY\u201917. Not only does this instill good fiscal discipline, but it strengthens our already robust levels of free cash flow generation. Over the next five years, we expect to generate over $25 billion of free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of this to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, a commitment level we believe is appropriate given our current mix of U.S. and international free cash flow. We are constrained by U.S tax policy which creates a negative incentive for us to repatriate cash to the U.S. The remaining 50% gives us the flexibility to make the necessary investments for sustainable growth. We continue to be very disciplined in how we deploy our capital with a strong focus on returns. As we have said in the past, we expect any M&A transaction to surpass our mid-teens risk-adjusted hurdle rate, and we do not expect these investments to be dilutive to shareholder EPS growth expectations. We have spoken in some detail regarding our ongoing strategic commitment to new therapies. But I want to conclude by noting that we continue to take meaningful actions to realize our transformational opportunities of globalization and economic value. We believe successful execution of both of these areas will position us to win in the changing healthcare marketplace and will be instrumental in establishing durability in our long term performance while creating potential upside to our baseline expectations. Consistent with our focused strategy to generate economic value from multiple stakeholders, we are specifically exploring two areas where we can offer important solutions for healthcare systems around the world; disease management and hospital efficiency. First, in disease management, we announced the acquisition of Cardiocom, a leading developer and provider of integrated solutions for chronic disease management. Cardiocom is an example of how we can pair our existing market-leading therapies with a set of complementary services and technology solutions that treat broader patient populations across the care continuum. Our combined offerings have the potential to concurrently improve outcomes and lower costs by reducing hospitalizations, improving remote clinical management and increasing patient engagement. These benefits are particularly compelling to a wide set of stakeholders, including governments, payers and hospital systems because they provide enhanced clinical and economic value over the long term. Our initial focus with Cardiocom will be heart failure and hypertension, versus building long term plans to offer complete solutions in our key chronic disease verticals of cardiovascular and Diabetes, striving to not only improve individual patient lives, but also ensuring that the overall healthcare ecosystem remains viable. The second area where we expect to generate significant economic value for our customers is hospital efficiencies. As we continue to work closely with hospital administrators around the world, we understand that they are deeply concerned with driving efficiency and optimizing the overall cost of operations. We\u2019re working together to develop innovative solutions for these problems, including implementing process improvements, adopting new financing models, deploying new purchasing and venture management strategies, and outsourcing certain functions. In the coming weeks, you will hear more about our hospital efficiency efforts and I look forward to discussing them in more detail as they\u2019re announced. In closing, I would like to add that the challenges facing healthcare are not easily solved. But we believe we\u2019re uniquely positioned to increase our competitive advantage in the changing healthcare landscape by offering solutions that improve the financial viability of global healthcare systems. Our market leading products, in-hospital systems, healthcare economic expertise, leading (inaudible) resources, and our strong financial position give us unprecedented breadth, global reach and scale, and allow us to offer broad, valuable solutions. We are determined to transform Medtronic from being a primarily device provider today into the premier global medical technology solutions partner of tomorrow. Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results before we take any questions. Gary Ellis : Thanks Omar. First quarter revenue of $4.083 billion increased 2% as reported and 3% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for our $55 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Q4 revenue results by region were as follows. Growth in Middle East and Africa was 24%. Central and Eastern Europe grew 21%. Growth in Asia Pacific was 20% driven by 29% growth in Japan. Growth in greater China was 15%. Latin America grew 12% and western Europe and Canada grew 2%. While the U.S. declined 1% and India declined 7%. The emerging markets grew a combined 15% in Q1 and represented 12% of our total sales mix. Q1 delivered earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.88, an increase of 4%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.93, an increase of 12%. This quarter's non-GAAP pretax adjustments included an $18 million restructuring charge, the final charge related to the initiative we announced last quarter. A $40 million cash charitable donation to the Medtronic Foundation, and a $96 million gain primarily related to the change in fair value of our RDN contingent consideration payments, which are based on annual revenue growth through FY '15. Given the current slower commercial ramp in Europe and the extended U.S. regulatory process, we now expect our contingent consideration payments to be reduced as addition of the RDN business has now shifted beyond the final revenue milestone date. In our cardiac and vascular group, revenue of $2.160 billion grew 4%. The results were driven by solid growth in Structural Heart, Pacing, Endovascular, AF Solutions and Coronary, partially offset by a modest decline in U.S. ICDs. CRDM revenue of $1.193 billion grew 2%. Worldwide ICD revenue of $655 million declined 2%, roughly in line with the market. In the U.S., our ICD revenue declined 4% below the market which we estimate declined 2%. As Omar mentioned, due to the phase and timing of our new products, there were many instances where we were not able to get our new products and their associated pricing premiums on new hospital contracts before the end of the quarter. And we were generally unwilling to offer bulk discounts for our latest technology off the previously contracted price. Concurrently, some hospitals chose to make stocking purchases ahead of our new products being available on their new contract which lead to meaningfully lower levels of bulk sales in the quarter. At the same time, our U.S. ICD implant dynamics changed markedly during the quarter following the mid-quarter release of Viva and Evera with the daily implant growth rate shifting from negative to positive in the back half of the quarter. Our lead differentials remain at elevated levels and our U.S. ICD pricing continues to show signs of relative stability, declining 2% year-over-year as both our Viva CRT-Ds and Evera ICDs received price uplifts in the market. As Omar mentioned, bulk sales were significantly lower in Q1 and were responsible for our entire revenue decline as daily implant revenue actually grew 1%. We believe our top technology tiers and high power are now significantly differentiated in the market place, which allows to minimize pricing pressure and stay very disciplined on new product pricing. We are seeing good market adoption of Viva and Evera. Viva has our proprietary adaptive CRT algorithm which significantly reduced RV pacing and has been clinically proven to improve response rates of CRT therapy, resulting in improved device longevity and a reduction in the heart failure hospitalizations. In addition, our Attain Performa quadripolar lead along with our VectorExpress implant optimization algorithm, is driving differentiated CRT-D market share capture in Europe, and will be available in all major markets outside of the U.S. by the end of the fiscal year. Finally, both the Viva CRT-D and Evera ICD contain enhanced shock reduction algorithm, battery and circuit design improvements to extend device longevity, and the unique PhysioCurve design, which meaningfully reduces device size and enhances patient comfort. Pacing revenue of $474 million grew 6%, outperforming the global market by 450 basis points. Our international pacing business grew 14%, driven by the strong customer demand for our Advisa MRI pacemaker in Japan. AF grew in the mid-teens, driven by over 20% growth of our Arctic Front Advance cryoballoon system as customers continue to adopt this second generation system due to its more efficient, safe and effective treatment for paroxysmal AF. Coronary revenue of $435 million grew 3%. Worldwide, DES revenue in the quarter was $273 million, including $105 million in the U.S and $25 million in Japan. Resolute integrity\u2019s deliverability, positive data regarding early dual antiplatelet therapy interruption, unique FDA labeling for Diabetes, and long term clinical performance is receiving strong customer acceptance globally, despite competitive product launches of next generation products. Resolute integrity is also the one product line that is featured in virtually every one of the CVG multi-line product contracts we execute. In renal denervation, while Q1 revenue continued to be modest, we are investing in developing referral networks, reimbursement, technology development and clinical and economic evidence to further strengthen our leadership position for this large, long term opportunity in hypertension. We are now anticipating CE mark for our next-generation Symplicity Spiral multi-electrode catheter before the end of the fiscal year. On the clinical front, we received IDE approval from the FDA earlier this month for Symplicity HTN-4, which is focused on expanding the indication to include uncontrolled hypertension patients with systolic pressure between 140 mm and 160 mm of mercury. In structural heart, revenue of $313 million increased 13%, driven by strong growth in our transcatheter valves transacts, including a meaningful acceleration of advanced customer purchases of CoreValve in Germany. Excluding the meaningful acceleration of advanced customer purchases of CoreValve in Germany, excluding this impact, we estimate the international transcatheter valve market grew in the upper single digits. In Germany, the Spenser patent injunction ruling has been a significant disappointment to customers who are concerned about having access to our market leading transfemoral technology, and the increased difficulty they will experience in accessing our unique valve size, catheter size and indications for use options. We respectfully disagreed with and have appealed the court\u2019s decision. We ultimately believe that the Spenser patent should be found to be invalid. And we, along with many others, are challenging the validity of the European Patent Office. In Q1 we became the first company with CE Mark approval for valve and valve procedures using CoreValve and CoreValve Evolut. We also continued the launch of our Engager valve in Europe, our entry into the transapical segment, which represents approximately 20% of the European TAVI market. In addition, the first implant of Engager direct aortic occurred in July and we expect CE Mark approval for this product in FY15. In endovascular, revenue of $219 million grew 7%, with solid growth in both our aortic and peripheral businesses. In aortic, strong growth continued in Japan with the launch of our Endurant II AAA Stent Graft system. Our thoracic products grew over 20% on the strength of the Valiant Captivia in the U.S. and international markets. In peripheral, our market leading drug-eluting balloon posted strong double-digit growth. Now turning to our Restorative therapies group. Revenue of $1.554 billion grew 3%. Results were driven by growth in surgical technologies, neuromodulation, and Core Spine, partially offset by declines in BMC. It is worth noting that starting this quarter, Diabetes will be reported as a separate group and is no longer part of the Restorative Therapies Group. Spine revenue of $765 million declined 1%. Core spine revenue of $641 million grew 1%. Excluding BKP, our core spine business grew 3% globally and 1% in the U.S, outperforming the market. The U.S. core spine market continues to show signs of stability, with a low single digit price mix decline and flat procedure volumes. Our new procedures and technologies, including our Solera posterior fixation system, Bryan Artificial Cervical Disk, Premium DBMs and AMT interbody devices are driving growth in our core spine business. We are also differentiating our spine business from the competition through enabling technologies that we leverage from our surgical technologies business, including O-arm imaging, StealthStation navigation and POWEREASE power surgical instruments. Hospitals are investing in our capital equipment for spine surgery as they seek clear value from improved surgical precision and more efficient procedures. We are still early in realizing this large differentiated opportunity in spine which is resulting in increased revenue and share for our spinal implants as well as solid growth of our capital equipment in our surgical technologies business. Our Kanghui orthopedics business in China continues to perform well with its revenue growing in excess of 20% and offsetting the lost revenue from our former Weigao joint venture. Turning to surgical technologies. Revenue of $361 million grew 13% with double-digit growth in all three businesses, ENT, neurosurgery, and advanced energy. The strong performance in ENT is attributable to solid growth in image guided surgery and monitoring, as well as the successful launches of TriVantage EMG Tube and the Indigo high-speed Otologic drill. Neurosurgery, which grew 12%, was driven by capital upgrades of the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system. Advanced energy had another outstanding quarter as it strategies to focus on its four core markets of orthopedics, spine, breast and CRDM replacements resulted in growth of over 20%. Turning to neuromodulation. Revenue of $428 million increased 3% on solid global growth in DBS and gastro uro. DBS delivered another strong quarter driven by double-digit new implant growth in the U.S. In addition, data from our EARLYSTIM trials which was published earlier this year in the New England Journal of Medicine, is generating significant interest in international market. In gastro euro, we had strong mid-teens growth of InterStim therapy in Western Europe. In PAINSTIM, results came in below our expectations this quarter as customers awaited the launch of the RestoreSensor SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system in the U.S. This product launched earlier this month and we expect this innovative technology to drive growth and share gains in the coming quarter. Now turning to our diabetes group. Revenue of $369 million grew 1% and international markets growth was 8% as we continue to see strong adoption of the Veo pump with low-glucose suspend and Enlite CGM sensor. In the U.S. revenue declined 3% as customers continued to anticipate FDA approval of the MiniMed 530G, the U.S. version of this pump and sensor. We have now deferred $33 million of revenue including $11 million in Q1, as some customers plan to upgrade to the new technology when it's available. We have diverted significant people and resources to do everything possible to address the FDA's quality system findings quickly and effectively. This diversion is negatively affecting the timing of our upcoming product launches and we now expect our next generation pump platform, the MiniMed 640G, to launch in international markets in the second half of this fiscal year. Turning to the rest of the income statement. The Q1 gross margin was 75%. After adjusting for a 30 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, the Q1 gross margin on a non-GAAP operational basis was 75.3%. It is also worth noting that the gross margin includes significant spending related to resources diverted to address quality issues in neuromodulation and diabetes, which negatively affected the gross margin by 40 basis points. Looking ahead, we would expect the gross margin for fiscal year 2014 to be in the range of 75% to 75.5% on an operational basis. Third quarter R&D spending of $316 million was 8.8% of revenue. We continue to invest in new technologies and evidence creation to drive future growth. We would expect R&D expense in fiscal year 2014 to be around 9% due to the tradeoffs we are making go partially offset the device tax, as well as shifting R&D resources to resolve pending quality issues, which gets recognized in cost of goods sold. First quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.416 billion represented 34.7% of sales. After adjusting for the 20 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, Q1 SG&A was 34.5%. We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses. In FY '14 we would expect to drive 30 to 50 basis points of improvement, which would result in SG&A in the range of 33.8% to 34% on an operational basis. And it is worth mentioning that we typically see most of our leverage in the fourth quarter. Amortization spend for the quarter was $86 million. For FY '14, we would expect amortization expense to be approximately $85 million to $90 million per quarter. Net other expense for the quarter was $44 million. Net gains from our hedging program were $18 million. As you know, we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. However, recent movements in unhedged currency exposures is creating increased headwind for the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on the current exchange rates, we expect FY14 net other expense to be in the range of $100 million to $220 million, which includes an expected $120 million impact from the U.S. Medical Device tax. For Q2 FY14, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million, based on current exchange rates. Net interest expense for the quarter was $40 million. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $11.3 billion in cash and cash investments, and $11.2 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect FY14 net interest expense to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million. In Q1, we generated $891 million in free cash flow. As Omar emphasized, we are committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. In Q1, we paid over $280 million in dividends and in June, our board approved an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend which puts our payout ratio at approximately 30% and is the 36th consecutive year we have increased the dividend. We also repurchased over $1.3 billion of our common stock. As of the end of Q1, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 81 million shares. First quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.021 billion shares. Our fully diluted share count is higher than expected, primarily due to the recent movements in Medtronic\u2019s share price. Consequently, we have seen an increase in stock options being exercised which has resulted in more shares being issued. However, it\u2019s important to note that the cash we receive from these stock option redemptions which was $560 million in Q1, was used to repurchase shares in the open market to offset some of the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. Let\u2019s now turn to our tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 17.3%. Excluding the impact of unusual items, our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5%. Included in our tax rate for the quarter is $3 million net benefit associated with the finalization of certain tax returns and changes to uncertain tax position reserves for the quarter. For fiscal year 2014, we continue to expect a non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19% to 20%. Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2014 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Based on the stabilization trends in our businesses, as well as our first quarter performance, we continue to believe that full year constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 4% remains reasonable for fiscal year 2014. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movement, to give you a sense of the FX impact, if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the reminder of the fiscal year, then our FY14 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $190 million to $230 million, including a negative $40 million to $60 million impact in Q2. Turning to guidance on the bottom line, we continue to expect FY14 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to 3.85, which implies annual earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% on an operational basis after adjusting for certain tax benefits that we received in FY13 as well as the headwinds from the medical device tax and incremental interest expense in FY14. It is also worth noting that while we do not providing quarterly guidance, when looking at the quarterly earnings per share consensus and the continued uncertainty on the timing of Diabetes MiniMed 530G approval as well as the FX headwinds, we would not be surprised to see some models shift 2 to 3 pennies from Q2 to Q4. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year. I will now turn it back over to Omar, who will conclude our prepared remarks. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Gary. Before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by reiterating that in the end, Q1 was a solid quarter, despite a number of challenges. While 3% topline growth is consistent with the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year, it was softer than we expected and fell just below our mid-single digit baseline goals. However, I also want to emphasize that our team executed well to deliver on the bottom line. And looking ahead, we remain confident in our outlook for the remainder of the year. We continue to focus on strengthening and geographically diversifying our business so that we can deliver consistent and dependable growth. Although there will always be pressures in the dynamic environment, we intend to execute in areas that we can control. Including growing our markets and building our business so that it is resilient enough to offset the variables that are beyond our control. And overtime, we are striving to reliably deliver on our baseline expectation which are, consistent mid-single digit revenue growth, consistent EPS growth, 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue and returning 50% of our pretax growth to shareholders. At the same time, we are positioning Medtronic to play a leading role in global healthcare by executing in our transformational opportunities of new therapy development, economic value and globalization. We believe that crisp execution on both our baseline and long-term growth strategy, combined with strong and disciplined capital allocation, will enable us to create long-term dependable value in healthcare. With that, we would now like to open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I have asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group, and Chris O\u2019Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group, to join us again for the Q&A session. We\u2019re rarely able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, so we respectfully request that you limit yourself to only one question and if necessary, one follow up, so that we can get to as many people as possible. If you have additional questions, please contact our investor relations team after the call. Operator, first question please. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Dodd with Citigroup. Matthew Dodd : I wanted to focus first on pricing. Omar and Gary, you both highlighted CRM sounded a little better in the U.S., down 2%. Can you comment on what pacing was in the U.S., maybe what stents were, and then broadly, how Europe is behaving? I am trying to see if some other comments from your competitors about pricing looking a little better, if you agree with that view broadly. Omar Ishrak : I will let Gary address this. Gary Ellis : Yeah, Matt, overall as you indicated, we saw a little bit of a -- obviously in ICDs, we saw tempering of the kind of decline, down a couple of percent. Pacing was also kind of down at low single-digits and so we saw good improvement there. Stents, I think it has been, it varies kind of around (inaudible) -- they have been probably closer more in the high-single digits as far as some of the declines there depending on what geography you are in. So if we continue to see pricing declines on the drug-eluting stent side that are pretty consistent with what we have seen over the last several quarters. But clearly with the new product launches we had both in pacing and on the high power, we are seeing a little bit of tempering on the pricing pressure. Matthew Dodd : And then just one quick ICD question. When you look at the bulking, Q4 didn\u2019t factor into Q1, is the comments from call, you got a hit in Q1 but you expect to improve in Q2 or do you think Q4, there was some additional bulking on that quarter that impacted Q1? Omar Ishrak : I think largely you are correct. I think it was mostly Q1 isolated the Q1 itself and the dynamics are between Q1 and Q2 as opposed to Q4. Gary Ellis : Yeah, Matt, as we look through, we clearly saw a dip at the end of the quarter. We know inventory levels dropped based on what we saw as far as implant usage and everything else. And so, we don\u2019t believe that there was a big impact from Q4. Obviously, our Q4 was a very strong quarter as you all know, but that -- we don\u2019t think that that had an impact on the quarter. We do believe, we know as we indicated in the comments, that a lot of these new products were not on contract yet, and we weren\u2019t willing to put discounts on the previously contracted pricing. And so as a result of that, we just didn\u2019t see the level of bulk purchases during the quarter that we would normally see. And we know inventory levels are down as a result of that, so that bodes well for the future. We think it bodes well not only for pricing but obviously also we would expect the bulk purchases to come back to more normal levels as we go through the rest of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Maybe just two quick questions. Gary, just in terms of the German injunction impact for CoreValve, it looked to us like about a $25 million impact. Can you kind of give us a sense of what the impact was in your mind in the quarter and how do we think about that number heading into next quarter? Should we assume a significant drop off or still inventory levels are maintaining a relatively high? And then I have a quick follow-up. Gary Ellis : Well, again, I will try to -- we don\u2019t know obviously, David, exactly how much benefit we received in the quarter from the advance purchases. We know that customers were buying in advance of the anticipated injunction. And so, as a result of that, that clearly had a benefit in the quarter. We know that our results were higher than what was going on in the market during that period of time. The numbers are anywhere from (inaudible) is a little high, but overall we\u2019re probably somewhere in that ballpark. The reality is we did have extra revenue during the quarter. As we go into Q2 and Q3 it will obviously depend on as the (inaudible) even in the quarter, we continue to be selling until the injunction is in effect and we\u2019ll continue. So, there will be some impact obviously in the quarter. Whenever the injunction \u2013 when that occurs, if that occurs, then obviously it will have an impact going forward and it will be spread out over that period of time until that exit that \u2013 we get that resolved. But at this point in time, obviously it was an advantage in Q1 we\u2019re aware of. So, inventory levels obviously are higher on that product currently. Inventory levels on CRDM obviously are lower in the U.S., but clearly on CoreValve they are higher as physicians bought in anticipation of a potential injunction. David Lewis : And then maybe, Omar, just more of a strategic question. All throughout the quarter we heard the Chinese government taking greater action to look at price scrutiny in obviously the domestic market. Most of that was directed at pharmaceutical providers, but there has been some around medical device manufacturers. Historically when we've seen this action by the government we have seen an impact on growth rates in China for drugs specifically, but also somewhat for devices. Any sense of what impact some of the government's actions are having on your business or is there any concern that you would see an impact on your business later on in the year? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Look, we\u2019re watching China closely for obvious reasons. Now, the first thing that I\u2019d like to say is that in no way does any of this activity shake our belief that it is a market we\u2019ve got to win and we\u2019ve got to be committed to, and we\u2019ve got to understand locally how it operates. Now, you\u2019re right that the Chinese government is looking at pricing very carefully and probably as they should. But in our view, most of that is directed around go-to-market models using distributors, which we are looking at very carefully. It\u2019s a market where we eventually have to have more direct presence with the customers themselves. Now, the way we have traditionally gone to market, we use distributors for a variety of reasons, a lot of those extremely necessary. And so we don\u2019t want to make any dramatic changes, but we are, as we\u2019re doing in almost every other country in the world, examining our distribution models very carefully. That\u2019s the action that we\u2019re taking, and at the same time we\u2019re working very closely with the government to help put in the investment, so that healthcare in China can be dramatically improved. So again we\u2019re watching the situation closely, particularly on the distribution channels, but we don\u2019t expect at this stage any dramatic moves anytime soon. And again, as I said, we\u2019re just watching it. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : First question is just a follow-up on the CoreValve discussion. When do you expect there to be a validity decision in Europe that would impact Germany? Omar Ishrak : Mike, do you want to take that? Mike Coyle : Our expectation is next spring, we would have a decision in that hearing. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Omar, on our call in June you talked a fair amount about building a comprehensive presence across all of the different platforms at Medtronic; Cardiovascular, Restorative, and Diabetes. Can you maybe just spend a few minutes talking about that and how in particular in Diabetes and Restorative that you think about how you want that business to look over the next let's say three to five years and how you want those to evolve? Omar Ishrak : Yeah. I think that\u2019s a fair question, Mike. Just to give a little background, what I\u2019d said is that our long term strategy as we build the business out both organically and inorganically is to do \u2013 progress along two definitive directions. The first is to build out comprehensively the three big clinical areas that we\u2019ve identified as our focus areas; Cardiovascular, Diabetes, and Restorative therapies. The second was to expand along the continuous care in each of these areas. And so, you\u2019ll see us moving in those concurrent directions as we go forward. Now, in response to the specific question, in diabetes for example, today we\u2019re a niche player so to speak in Type 1 Diabetes and patients who require insulin. We see that we\u2019ve got a platform which enables us to step into a broader range of diabetes patients who largely are of type 2. First, through our call center presence which is very significant, which we can broaden to apply to a broader patient group. And the acquisition of Cardiocom actually helps in that endeavor. Second, through our continuous glucose monitoring technology, which we feel, as we improve its technology, we can expand into more and more patient types. And then thirdly, we continue to look at value products in our expansion into emerging markets, which will enable us to come out with lower and lower cost pumps over time, which should again address a broader set of population. I think in these areas we expect to grow organically as well as inorganically and expand our footprint into a broader range of diabetic patients. In terms of restorative therapies, clearly our strength is our approach into that segment through neuroscience and neurology, which has been our core expertise driven by DBS and other neuromodulation products. From there, we take advantage of the fact that in the U.S. at least, most of the neurosurgeons are spinal surgeons as well. And from that, we have gone into spinal implants as you know and have a built a big franchise there. We are looking around that space both in orthopedics potentially, but also in other areas of neuroscience, in ENT, which have overlapped with that broad category. Again, both organically and inorganically we are looking at these areas to try to fill these gaps and we see considerable opportunity in both of those areas. And at the same time we are also looking for patient continuum of care movements in all three of these areas where we can look at patient management, post treatment, and also diagnostics specifically related to the therapy that we are talking about. Mike Weinstein : One follow-up, if you don't mind, on CoreValve as well. The filing of the extreme risk module, do you know if the FDA has accepted that at this point as an independent filing? Omar Ishrak : Mike, you will take that? Mike Coyle : Well, they certainly accepted the submission. How they are going to treat the approvals they have not decided yet. But as we have said all along, as the data becomes available we would submit it in its modules and we have now completed the extreme risk submissions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : So two quick questions, one on ICDs and one on emerging markets. First just on ICDs, am I in the ballpark in estimating that the issue around bulk purchasing this quarter may be impacted you by $15 million to $20 million, is that roughly right? Gary Ellis : Bob, this is Gary. It's hard to be real specific but the reality is, when you look at below the normal levels, that\u2019s probably even a little bit light, it's probably a little bit more than that in fact, than those impacted. So it's obviously hard to say because there is a range that we have but if we look at kind of a normal level, that\u2019s even probably light. Bob Hopkins : Okay, thank you. And then on emerging markets, I just want to make sure I understand exactly what you are saying because obviously emerging markets are now driving well over half the total company's growth. So could you just go into a little bit more detail on, for example, what happened in India this quarter? And then also what exactly are you expecting for emerging markets growth in 2014? And to the previous question, is 2014 a year given what is going on in China, will you think there is a little bit of extra risk to that growth rate this year and then more confidence long-term? I just would love you to put emerging markets in better perspective. Omar Ishrak : Well, look our outlook for emerging markets overall has not changed. We are confident that we can deliver between 15% and 20% quite reliably, and are striving to make that thing 20% or more. And in certain regions we actually have shown consistency at over 20% for an extended period of time. China, we haven\u2019t been able to do that although our growth rate has consistently been 15% or better and have touched 20% every so often. And China is the biggest market, so we are very focused on driving that up as quickly as possible. Our plans are actually looking at increasing China's performance on a stead basis through the coming quarters and into next year. So if anything, we are expecting that we are closer to 20% rather than the other way around. You know there may well be issues to do with government policy and all of that but in general healthcare is a tremendous need in China and access to healthcare is a big focus of the government. And we are making investments within China. As you know in our Kanghui acquisition, we\u2019ve done the Life Tech partnership as well, as well as put in direct sales people in certain regions to access low tier or second tier cities. So we\u2019re going full board in China and we expect the growth rate in fact to gradually and steadily improve over the next several quarters. So we\u2019re pretty confident about our China outlook as well as overall emerging markets outlook. Now to do with India and a little bit to do with Latin America, I think there were two distinct issues there. Latin America was clearly one in which we\u2019re transitioning from indirect to direct sales in certain countries and that happened in the middle of the quarter and as that resolves itself, which it will, I bet this quarter or next, we should be on track and not really be seriously impacted. In India, the bigger issue other than the distributor transition which we also went through for other reasons, is that the government has imposed a very low ceiling on pricing for some of the stents. Now we\u2019re working with the government and we\u2019re working with our customers there to come up with a clear strategy through which we can address that market, but in the first and then the last couple of quarters I\u2019d say, it was a dramatic change to the system and essentially it forced sales from not only us but all multinationals. We think we\u2019re turning that around and going forward we expect that situation to ease a little bit. On India as well, it\u2019s important to point out that although Coronary being the biggest business suffered a pretty big headwind because of this, the rest of the businesses, all of them, from CRDM to Spinal to Surgical Technologies, all of them actually have been growing strong double digit and area continuing to take a bigger and bigger share of our India business. And over time, that will start to mitigate any volatility that we\u2019d see in the stent market. So again our overall emerging market strategy is not changing. We\u2019re expecting to grow fairly steadily in the high teens, mid to high teens and eventually to 20% and beyond. And we expect to report regular progress as we go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Just wanted to focus in on the Diabetes business. I guess first I was just curious as to why you\u2019re now breaking out from Restorative Therapies, if it\u2019s foreshadowing any potential consideration that you guys might be looking to potentially I guess spin it off or something else? And then secondly, I guess just with the 530G, you had mentioned in the prepared remarks, Omar, that you\u2019re expecting approval in the fiscal year and I had thought previously expectations were for the end of the calendar year. So I just wanted to double check on that and just get your updated thoughts on timing there. Omar Ishrak : First, the separation of the Diabetes, that is driven purely and completely by the consideration of how our customers are situated. And like I said, we\u2019re focused on three customers which Cardiovascular, Restorative Therapies broadly encompasses neurology and orthopedics and associated technologies and Diabetes which is a different customer. That\u2019s the reason why we broke it out into three so that it will give us more focus and clear view distinct areas so that we can drive both inorganic and organic growth in each of the areas in the way that I described. So anything in diabetes is going to fill out the platform and approach more and more patients because we consider that to be a key area of growth for us. So I want to make that very clear, that the purpose of this was just looking at our customer base in a logical and rational way and grouping them around certain types of customers who will look at common components of our technology. And therefore through that we can take advantage of our size and scale in addition to being really focused around those customers. In terms of the approval, we\u2019ve been saying the fiscal year, I think since last quarter, I think prior to that, we were expecting it earlier. We might have said so, but ever since last \u2013 at the end of Q4 we\u2019ve been saying this fiscal year. That has not changed. We think that we in fact can get this on the market before the end of the year. Again, this is not completely in our hands so I cannot say definitively because there is lot of variables here. But we are working closely with the FDA and we are making progress and we are pretty confident that we can get this released within the fiscal year. When we do, we expect immediate traction both from an acceptance of the new product which has had considerable outside the U.S. where it's available, and also from the recognition of all the deferred revenue that we have had for the past -- over two quarters now. So that\u2019s the overall outlook, Kristen. Kristen Stewart : Okay, and then at what point, I guess with the 530G, if that does kind of slip further, where might you make a decision just to perhaps move forward with, I think it's the 640G? Omar Ishrak : No, I think we are not considering that yet. You know we feel that at this stage the 530G is well on its way to approval and we think it's an unlikely scenario that we would have to skip it completely. I think the patient benefits of that have been proven to be quite dramatic, both in commercial use in Europe and as well as some recent papers that have been published in the New England Journal, I think it was last quarter. And so we are pretty committed and the FDA is working together with us to get this to market. So I think skipping it is a very unlikely scenario at this point. Mike Coyle : Yeah, Kristen, just to add to Omar's comment, the FDA's issues are not around the 530G itself, I think they are also very supportive that it's a good product, obviously it's more around our quality systems which is what we are having to do the work on. So I agree with Omar, I mean we have no plans on not launching the 530G. The only question is when and that\u2019s what we are working with the FDA. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. David Roman : Omar, in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about stabilization in Europe but you also highlighted some of the Medtronic specific efforts to leverage your scale across different regions and different product lines. Could you maybe just go into a little bit more detail there on what you are referencing? I think when we met, I remember we sat with Rob at PCR in May, he talked about a few examples of customer contracting. But maybe you could provide just a little bit more detail on how that might impact your business quantifiably over time? Omar Ishrak : Yes, just to give you a perspective on what that is. That is essentially working with major customers, primarily hospital systems in Europe, and contractually managing cath labs for them. And I think that gives us the ability to work with the customer very directly to improve their overall efficiency. We have been making some announcements along these lines fairly soon here. So we will wait to give you more details on that event when we are ready. But again in a nutshell, what this does is that it allows us to work with customers on a much broader basis than before and in fact be their partners in improving the overall efficiency of delivery. And so some degree it certainly helps us get some independent revenue streams as well as build closer relationship with clinical customers or the physicians in those accounts as well. As I have said in the prepared remarks, this includes everything from the efficiency of their cath lab to how [products] are sourced to managing the way in which products are ordered and stocked. And we are building up our technology base to be able to support the various capabilities. There will be some added benefit of our products but the primary perspective here is to provide an overall solution to those customers. David Roman : And then I guess a follow-up just along similar lines. You also talked about on some of the new product launches, particularly in CRM, that you were awaiting new contracts and looking to obtain price premiums on a number of those products you were launching. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about the dynamic in getting price premiums right now? What is the environment like for that? What type of price premiums do you think you can obtain versus historical averages and how are you balancing that with sort of the cross-selling model? Omar Ishrak : Well, that\u2019s two different things. First of all, on pricing, the initiatives that we started on a couple of years ago was to be very granular about the economic value, clinical and economic value for our products. And these products, although the development started long before we started to look at it that way, clearly have got both clinical and economic value for which we have evidence. And so we expect to get pricing that is objectively determined in relation to the economic and clinical benefits that these products have. And I think that is an important consideration that we do not want to walk away from just because the quarter end or stuff like that. I think we work too hard, both in product development and in the generation of evidence to not make sure that that counts. And so that is still part of the issue here that we\u2019re in the process of making that case and we feel confident that we\u2019ll be successful in that we\u2019ll drive up pricing. That\u2019s separate from our overall consolidated approach to customers which is continuing the success. Our growth in accounts with full CBG contracts continues. And this enhancement in the product can only help in that endeavor. I think both Gary and Mike can perhaps -- this is an important question, I\u2019d like both of them to maybe chime in a little bit with any thoughts. Maybe Mike you want to go first? Mike Coyle : So just on the question of price increases, some of the features that we\u2019ve added for example is adapted CRT into the Viva product line for all of our high power CRT devices. That actually can eliminate less ventricular pacing in the patient and has been clinically demonstrated to improve CRT response and reduce heart failure hospitalization. And I think you\u2019re probably aware that that 30-day hospital admission window is a very key area focus for hospitals in the U.S and even longer term the ability to keep patients from coming back into the hospital for heart failure re hospitalizations is a big issue. The fact that we can able to demonstrate this, meaning that we would like to accrue the benefits of that enterprise increase. Now, most hospital systems have put in place technology review committees to rigorously look at these questions because they\u2019re obviously not interested in paying price premium unless it\u2019s for proven benefits. And so that takes some time and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen happen. So for hospitals that have chosen in the past to do bulk purchases of product, they basically are waiting to go through their cycle, don\u2019t want to bulk old product because they know they would rather replace it with a new product, but have to get through their pricing committees in order to get approval. So that\u2019s been one of the main issues in the quarter and the same thing applies to our Evera product line with its shock reduction production technology. So that really is the dynamic that was playing out in the quarter. Gary Ellis : I really don\u2019t have much to add to what Mike just indicated. As he indicated, the biggest issue was getting people on contracts. And that\u2019s the change that\u2019s probably occurred over in the industry over the last several years where what used to be maybe just a little price increase (inaudible) and immediately the doctors to make that call and that decision. Obviously with the buying decisions now in hospitals, these committees are more engaged in that process and ensuring that the products have the technology. So as he indicated, that slows down the process slightly. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get the price increases. It just means that you have to go through certain processes. Jeff Warren : We\u2019ve gone past the top of the hour. Let\u2019s take two quick questions before wrapping up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : So it looks like, excluding the CoreValve stocking, you grew slightly below 3% this quarter. And so I guess, Omar, my question is what gives you the confidence that you\u2019ll be able to grow 3% to 4% in fiscal year 2014, especially if you assume that there is an injunction in Germany with the CoreValve litigation and you\u2019ll lose approximately maybe $40 million to $50 million in sales? So it would be helpful to hear from you how you see the rest of the year playing out and what gets you to the 3% to 4%? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : We tried to lay out the three areas where we had pressures in a very distinct fashion. Certainly Diabetes is pretty straightforward. There\u2019s a pretty big chunk, all of which is probably more than offsetting CoreValve issue that we may be facing in the next three quarters just and we expect even more out of that. So agreed, we need the approval, and if we don\u2019t get approval there\u2019ll be pressure there. But we\u2019re pretty confident that we will. And that\u2019s a very distinct thing that we will all look at very clearly. I think in terms of neuro, we\u2019re already seeing traction. Again as we said, level by itself, at the same level or close to any pressures that we may face in Germany. So that alone again can -- is likely to give us some tailwind if you like in the remaining three quarters, and we are already seeing that. So this is not something that we are waiting for because we have already shifted to the new product in manufacturing and we are launching it as we speak. And although, again, as we said, that it's very early in the quarter but all the evidence points to the fact that we will get what we are expecting out of that. And then finally, we come to CRDM and we explained what happened here. You know the bulk purchases were at their lowest levels and the inventory levels are down. Again, nothing for certain here, but if you just look at this thing in a fairly objective basis over time, we expect those levels to recover and we expect the pricing premiums because we have already experienced that in places where customers have been through the technology review committees and so on. And as we go through next quarter we expect that to come through. So we have go three areas which are very clear in their pickup in the remaining half of the year. Granted there will be some pressure out of CoreValve but we feel that these three alone are sufficient to more than offset that pressure. And in addition to that I highlighted series of other initiatives that will come to fruition with a year for which we expect revenue. So again, we laid all of that out and we in our analysis feel that the guidance that we provided is quite achievable. Larry Biegelsen : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And just lastly for me, Chris, if Chris O'Connell is in the call, I just wanted to ask about the competitive bidding for insulin pumps and just wanted to confirm that you feel that your pumps are pretty well protected by any competitive bidding that could be implemented in January 2014? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : First of all, let me take that. That is correct. We feel pretty protected that that\u2019s not part of the competitive bidding process. It's a much more unique product, it's not commoditized even close in that sense. And we have got support from the physician community and the healthcare agencies in that respect. So we don\u2019t really any serious risk of the pump falling under competitive bidding. Chris, anything you want to add....? Chris O\u2019Connell: No, I think that\u2019s right. It's really about the -- to find the categories of pumps that are going to be subject to competitive bidding. That\u2019s an ongoing discussion with CMS. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays Capital. Matt Taylor : I was just interested to see if you could talk a little bit more about your transition to positioning yourself as really a provider of solutions? And maybe you could help us understand, I know you said you had some announcements coming up, but can you talk about over time what portion of revenue you think you are going to be able to derive from those kinds of services? Is it going to be really small and adjunct or could it to be an actual meaningful revenue piece over time? Omar Ishrak : Well, over time we think it will be meaningful but it is going to take some time. And let me highlight the Cardiocom acquisition. That\u2019s a pretty good example of the sorts of things which you are going to expect from us. Here is a company which is a leader in terms of disease management. It has complementary services to what we already have. It addresses a broader range of patients than the ones we do. And you put the two together, both synergy as well as incremental revenue from an independent source. So that\u2019s the kind of activity that we would like to do, which leverages what we have but is not solely dependent on what we have but in fact grows it independently. And in the beginning we expect just one plus one if you like. In the long-term we expect one plus one and more through the synergies that we expect to derive. And we expect to move in that direction in those two areas in disease management which essentially means looking across the continuum of care and primarily at this stage looking at patient management beyond the therapy of people who have the same kind of disease but without our devices. And have a structure through which we can manage those patients. And hospital systems and payers around the world recognize that managing these patients is critical to us being able to manage the overall cost of care, both in the U.S. and around the world. Hospital efficiency is a different area where we\u2019re looking primarily at making sure that hospitals are working in the most efficient manner as possible. And our initial focus is in the area of cardiology because that\u2019s where we have our biggest strength. And we\u2019ve had some initial success in Europe in not only getting those contracts, but starting to execute them. So we expect that too to become a larger and larger portion of our business. The independent revenue streams will be small to start with. Over time it will grow. I think the impact that it will have to synergy on the sales of our regular devices perhaps will be more and more meaningful. But we\u2019d like to see what we get out of this as we go forward. But that\u2019s potentially the strategy. We\u2019re not taking in big numbers for this stage. That is an area we\u2019re focused in and long term we think in both of these areas there\u2019s big opportunities for us to tap into in terms of available patients who need the care and both from the government and payers for us to be able to provide such solutions. Finally, maybe a lot is going to depend on how quickly the U.S in particular moves from a pay per procedure system to a pay per value system. The quicker that shift occurs, the greater will be the meaningfulness (inaudible) of this revenue. If that happens quickly, you\u2019ll see much quicker growth in that area from us. If that happens slowly, it will take a little more time. so there are too many factors for me to say definitively, but those are some of the considerations. All right, let me conclude right now. Thanks again to all of you for your questions and on behalf of our entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q2 call which we anticipate holding on November 19. Thank you all very much. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator instructions.] Mr. Jeff Warren, VP of investor relations, you may begin your conference, sir. Jeff Warren : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic\u2019s chief financial officer; will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2014 second quarter, which ended October 25, 2013. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter and full year 2013, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning, and thank you, Jeff. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported second quarter revenue of $4.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91, both representing growth of 3%. Our Q2 revenue growth was in line with our outlook for the year, and we are performing at or better than the market in almost every one of our business lines. Q2 also represents another quarter where our overall organization delivered balanced growth with strong performances in some areas offsetting challenges in other parts of our business. Looking ahead, we are confident that our three primary strategies : therapy, innovation, and globalization in economic value will position us well to thrive in the transforming healthcare environment. This quarter, we made significant progress on a number of new therapy growth drivers that we intend to launch over the coming quarters. These, combined with our continued focus on globalization and economic value, will not only help us improve our competitive position and overall growth profile but will also further strengthen and geographically diversify our business, allowing us to reliably deliver consistent growth. As you will recall, in Q1 I discussed the three specific challenges that negatively affected our growth and that we believed would improve going forward : U.S. diabetes, U.S. PAINSTIM, and U.S. ICDs. I am pleased to report that we have made significant progress in all three businesses. First, in the U.S. diabetes, we received FDA approval in late September for our MiniMed 530G system, several months earlier than we estimated in August. Our diabetes team executed well, ramping up manufacturing in a short period of time to start shipping in mid-October. While we are still somewhat supply constrained as we transition our full manufacturing to Puerto Rico, early signs are that the 530G system is going to be a big success in the market, and we expect our U.S. diabetes business to grow in the mid-teens and contribute approximately 100 basis points to overall Medtronic growth in the back half of the fiscal year. Second, in U.S. PAINSTIM, you will recall that we received FDA approval for our innovative MRI SureScan spinal cord stimulator much earlier than expected. While this resulted in the supply constraints last quarter, and for the first two months of Q2, our neuro team diligently worked through these issues and is now executing the full product launch. The early response from the market is impressive. U.S. PAINSTIM grew in the mid-teens in the final month of the quarter and we expect this level of growth to continue, contributing roughly 40 basis points to overall Medtronic growth in the second half of the year. Third, in U.S. ICD, you will recall that our Q1 results were affected by lower levels of wholesales because of the [phase in] timing of our new high powered products, which, as you anticipated, resolved itself in Q2. Customers continue to adopt our latest generation devices, Viva and Evera, helping us, by our estimation, to gain share sequentially. Equally important, our ICD prices, which has been down in the low to mid single digits for several quarters, was actually flat in Q2, based on the strength of our latest generation devices. In addition to these improved performances, surgical technologies delivered another outstanding quarter, growing 11%. All three of these businesses, ENT, neurosurgery, and advanced energy, continue to execute and deliver solid growth. In particular, I\u2019d like to recognize advanced energy, which grew over 20% again this quarter. This is becoming a very important business for us, with cross-selling opportunities in spine, ortho, and CRDM. Advanced energy was formed from the first two acquisitions at the beginning of my tenure as CEO, and the business has been delivering strong double-digit growth in the five consecutive quarters since the first anniversary of these acquisitions. These results illustrate that when we combine diligent strategic rationale, strong integration plans, and solid execution, we can generate significant returns on investment. In Q2, our organization delivered on the bottom line, despite multiple pressures. The most significant departure from expectations was in our gross margin. It is important to note, though, that pricing was in line with expectations and did not affect our Q2 gross margin performance. Instead, we can point to three distinct issues. First, FX pressure negatively affected the gross margin by 50 basis points. Second, the manufacturing ramp of a number of new products caused higher levels of scrap and obsolescence, which had a negative impact of 20 basis points. And third, as we mentioned last quarter, we aggressively continued to reallocate engineering resources to promptly and comprehensively address the specific quality issues outlined in our neuromodulation and diabetes warning letters. This resulted in a shift of spending from R&D to cost of goods sold, thereby negatively affecting our Q2 gross margin by 40 basis points. While diverting these resources is costly, ensuring the highest level of quality and regulatory compliance has, and always will be, a personal priority for me and the central focus of everything that we do at Medtronic. In the first half of our fiscal year, we generated over $1.8 billion of free cash flow, and over the next five years, we expect to generate over $25 billion of free cash flow. Our organization remains focused on improving our already robust levels of free cash flow generation. For example, we continue to make progress on our working capital improvement program, with the goal of increasing our inventory turns by 50% by FY17. We\u2019re committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, a commitment level we believe is appropriate given our current mix of U.S. and international free cash flow. As you know, this mix continues to be constrained by U.S. tax policy, which creates a negative incentive for us to repatriate cash to the U.S. The remaining 50% gives us the flexibility to make the necessary investments for sustainable growth. We continue to be very disciplined in how we deploy our capital, with a strong focus on returns. Our potential M&A transactions must not only be strategically aligned, but they must also stand up to the high standards of growth, surpassing our mid-teens risk-adjusted hurdle rate, as well as minimizing the diluted impact of shareholder EPS growth expectations. As we look ahead, we not only have a number of near and mid-term growth opportunities, but we also have some challenges to overcome. First, in Japan, our team has done an incredible job guiding growth over the past four quarters and the strength of product launches in our cardiac ambassador group. However, we will now be facing a period of difficult year over year comparisons from these product launches, as well as the biennial [unintelligible] zone pricing adjustments that are anticipated to go into effect in April. As a result, Japan, which contributed significantly to our total company growth in the first half of fiscal year is now expected to have closer to flat growth in the second half. Next, our BMC business continues to be challenged, in Q2, this business declined 17%, which is worse than we were expecting. We continue to stand behind this product based on its safety and efficacy profile and improved limitations. However, the product remains under pressure as some surgeons continue the reduce the usage through both patient selection and the use of smaller kits. We continue to analyze the key drivers behind the customer purchasing decisions, post [unintelligible], and we are urgently examining initiatives to optimize the strengths of BMP in both the U.S. and international markets. However, given that BMC has yet to show signs of stabilization, if current revenue trends continue for the remainder of the fiscal year, BMC revenue would decline in the midteens for FY14, similar to the decline we experienced in FY13. Finally, our emerging market growth in Q2 was 13%. While this performance is respectable, and these markets continue to contribute a large portion of our overall company growth, our overall results this quarter were well short of our targeted levels. Across our emerging market regions, there have been a number of region-specific challenges, including product registration issues and distributor conversions, which have held back our growth. We experienced overall slower growth this quarter, with the largest sequential slowing occurring in Greater China and Central and Eastern Europe. In Greater China, our results were affected by the phase-in of new CRDM products, the discontinuation of the distributor relationship in CBG, and slower overall markets in CRDM in orthopedics. In Central and Eastern Europe, this has been tracking above 20% in eight of the last nine quarters. Growth was in the midteens in Q2, primarily due to Russia, where slowing GDP growth, along with some major fiscal funding constraints, are negatively affecting healthcare budgets. Looking at emerging markets in total, I realize that over the past few quarters our growth rates have modestly slowed. However, the fundamental demand in the end markets remains strong, and we have several initiatives in place to capitalize on these opportunities. We remain confident that growth rates will improve and that emerging markets represent a significant long term opportunity. As we look into the future, we\u2019re convinced that our three strategic priorities : therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value, will position us well to thrive in the transforming healthcare environment. I\u2019d like to update you on each of these strategies. Starting with therapy innovation, it is important to note that Medtronic\u2019s ability to create innovative therapies and new markets is fundamental to our overall growth strategy. It is a strategy that is deeply rooted in our culture, one that we\u2019re extremely proud of, and an area where we have a proven track record of executing. As we look ahead, we\u2019re on the verge of bringing a number of new therapies to market over the coming quarters. In addition to our recently launched Viva CRT-D, Evera ICD, and Advisa MRI pacemaker products, the CRDM business intends to launch the Reveal Linq in Q4. This is our next generation implantable loop recorder, which will further expand our footprint upstream in cardiac diagnostics. In spine, we continue to work with the FDA to bring our next generation cervical disc, the [unintelligible], to the U.S. market. And we expect to follow that launch with a series of cervical plate launches in FY15. In neuromodulation, the PAINSTIM business will build upon the U.S. launch of the RestoreSensor MRI by continuing its global rollout with the Q3 launch in Japan. In surgical technologies, we are developing a full pipeline of new power imaging and navigation equipment that improve the economic value proposition for hospitals. In diabetes, in addition to the ongoing U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G system with the Enlite sensor, our next-generation insulin pump system, the MiniMed 640G, remains on track for launch by the end of the fiscal year. And finally, we\u2019re making excellent progress on three fundamentally new therapy areas that meaningfully impact our outlook for FY15 and beyond : our CoreValve transcatheter aortic valve, our Symplicity Flex renal denervation system for treatment resistant hypertension, and our IN.PACT drug eluting balloon. All three of these products are market leaders in Europe, and we are planning to launch all of them in the U.S. over the coming quarters. CoreValve for extreme risk patients is now expected to launch late this fiscal year, CoreValve for high risk patients in mid-FY15, Symplicity Flex in late FY15, and IN.PACT Admiral in early FY16. Suffice it to say, we have set ourselves up to deliver what is arguably one of the strongest launch [unintelligible] of innovative therapies in our industry, and while innovative therapies are central to our success and will fuel our growth in our industry for decades, they are no longer enough. In order to unlock the full potential of medtech in the transforming healthcare environment, we are taking meaningful action in the areas of globalization and economic value. We believe successful execution in both of these areas will position us to win in the changing healthcare marketplace and will be instrumental in establishing durability in our long term performance while creating potential upside to our baseline expectations. With globalization, the key to sustainable growth in emerging markets will be addressing the barriers of access to lifesaving medical technology. We\u2019ve had teams in place for several quarters focused on identifying local opportunities in all of our geographies to remove the barriers to awareness and training. In CBG, programs like Healthy Heart for All are generating results. In RTG, we have four spine product development offices set up and running in Europe, China, Japan, and India focused on adapting spine products for the local market. Additionally, in China, we developed [unintelligible], a cranial plating system that in 18 months went from design in Shanghai to manufacturing in [unintelligible] and is now being launched by our surgical technology sales force under the Kanghui brand. While this is a small product line, it is symbolic of the type of local innovation we want to do across all of our businesses. Likewise, our organization is focused on incorporating economic value into all functions, businesses, and geographies. We are collaborating with a broader set of stakeholders in developing new business models that deliver economic value to these stakeholders. Essentially, we are moving from being accountable for a product to being accountable for an outcome. The industry is still early in this process, but we are leading this effort and have started it in two [unintelligible] areas where we can immediately offer solutions for healthcare systems around the world : disease management and hospital efficiency. In disease management, integration activities of our Cardiocom acquisition are progressing well. With Cardiocom, we intend to pair our existing market leading therapies with a set of complementary services and technology solutions to more effectively treat broader patient populations across the care continuum. These services and solutions offer benefits that are particularly compelling to the broader set of healthcare decision makers, including governments, payers, and hospital systems. One such solution that Cardiocom is developing is called [RE 30], an cost-effective 30-day readmission reduction program that is focused on minimizing heart failure readmission penalties, which hospitals in the U.S. are increasingly focused on trying to address. Another area where we are exploring solutions for healthcare systems is hospital efficiency. And this has led to the formation of our new hospital solutions business in Europe. Hospital solutions is a unique service offering, whereby we enter into long term contracts with hospitals to upgrade and more effectively manage their cath lab and hybrid operating rooms. This is expected to result in wins for all stakeholders. The hospital sees an improvement in cath lab efficiency and profitability, physicians get access to the latest technologies that can lead to better patient outcomes, and Medtronic benefits not only through the increased use of our technology, but also through incremental service revenue, reduced pricing pressure, better inventory management, and more efficient use of our service personnel. While it is still early, we already have five accounts in the long term contracts for cath lab managed services, representing approximately $300 million in revenue over a seven-year time horizon. We are particularly encouraged by the positive reaction in the market to our offering and have built a solid pipeline of potential deals. Ultimately, medical technology has the potential to transform healthcare, from being a cost burden for most societies today to an economic driver. Nations can achieve a long term economic advantage by utilizing medical technology to more effectively and efficiently restore health to the sick and manage chronic disease to keep their populations healthy, allowing more people to be contributing members to society. While we realize this opportunity will certainly be a big challenge, it is one where Medtronic has the capabilities and the intention to lead. Our market-leading products, in-hospital footprint, healthcare economics expertise, Lean Sigma resources, and financial strength give us unprecedented breadth, global reach, and scale, allowing us to offer broad, valuable solutions. We are determined to transform Medtronic from being primarily a device provider today into the premier global medical technology solutions partner of tomorrow. Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results before we take your questions. Gary Ellis : Thanks, Omar. Second quarter revenue of $4.194 billion increased 2.4%, as reported, or 3.3% on a constant currency basis, after adjusting for a $38 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Q2 revenue results by region were as follows. Growth rate in the Middle East and Africa was 21%. Central and Eastern Europe grew 14%. Growth in Greater China was 11%. Latin America grew 10%. Growth in Japan was 8%. South Asia grew 6%, and the growth in other Asia Pacific was 4%. The U.S. grew 2%, and growth in Western Europe and Canada was 1%. Emerging markets grew a combined 13% in Q2 and represented 12% of our total sales mix. Q2 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.91, an increase of 3.4%. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.89, an increase of 41%. This quarter\u2019s non-GAAP pretax adjustments included a $24 million certain litigation charge related to two previously disclosed government investigations in our CRDM and diabetes business, as well as patent litigation in our coronary business. In our cardiac ambassador group, revenue of $2.199 billion grew 4%, with all businesses contributing to growth. CRDM revenue of $1.273 billion grew 5%, which included $11 million from our recent acquisition of Cardiocom that was recognized in our AF and Other revenue line. Worldwide ICD revenue of $713 million grew 4%. We estimate that both the global and U.S. ICD markets grew 3%. If you look at the first half of our fiscal year, we estimate both the global and U.S. ICD markets grew 1%, which is encouraging and reflects continued stability. In addition, we estimate we gained a point of ICD share in international markets and we held share in the U.S. in this time period. Our top technology tiers are now significantly differentiated in the marketplace. Both Viva and Evera feature enhanced shock reduction algorithms, including our proprietary lead integrity alert, which the FDA recently approved for monitoring competitors\u2019 defibrillation leads when connected to our devices. Our Viva CRT-D also has a proprietary adaptive CRT algorithm which has been clinically proven to improve CRT response rates, resulting in a reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. In addition, in a late-breaking clinical trial at the Heart Failure Society of America meeting in September, adaptive CRT technology was shown to reduce the risk of AF in heart failure patients by nearly 50%. Both Viva and Evera also have battery and capacitor design improvements to extend our industry leading device longevity. Pacing revenue of $477 million grew 2%, outperforming the global market by nearly 200 basis points. In the U.S., pacing declined 1% year over year as we continue to see the trend of stabilization in this business. The Advisa MRI pacemaker continues to drive share gains in the U.S. on both a sequential and year over year basis. In a late-breaking clinical trial at the American Heart Association yesterday, results from the Minerva trial were presented, which showed in a large trial of over 1,000 patients, with sinus node dysfunction and a history of atrial tachycardias, that our proprietary pacemaker features, MDP and reactive ADP, significantly slowed the progression to permanent atrial fibrillation by 61% compared to patients with standard pacemakers. Looking ahead, assuming stabilization continues in the back half of our fiscal year, U.S. pacing would add approximately 30 to 40 basis points to overall Medtronic growth in FY14 compared to FY13. AF solutions grew in the midteens, as we continue to gain share in the AF market, driven by our Arctic Front advanced cryoballoon system, which grew over 20%. Customers continue to adopt the second generation system due to its more efficient, safe, and effective treatment for paroxysmal AF. Looking ahead, we intend to launch our next-gen phased RF product, PVAC Gold, in Europe before the end of the fiscal year. Coronary revenue of $427 million grew 1%. Globalized ES revenue in the quarter was $274 million, including $103 million in the U.S. and $25 million in Japan. While GES pricing remains under pressure, we continue to gain the ES share on a sequential and year over year basis, both globally and in the U.S. Our Resolute Integrity\u2019s deliverability, positive data regarding early dual antiplatelet therapy interruption, and unique FDA labeling for diabetes and long term clinical performance is receiving strong customer acceptance globally, despite competitive product launches and next-generation products. In renal denervation, while revenue continues to be modest, we are investing in developing referral networks, reimbursement, technology development, and clinical and economic evidence to further strengthen our leadership position for this large long term opportunity in hypertension. We are anticipating the full launch of our next-generation Symplicity spiral multi-electrode catheter before the end of the fiscal year. On the clinical front, we enrolled our first patient earlier this month in our Symplicity HTN-4 trial, which is focused on expanding the indication to include uncontrolled hypertension patients with a systolic pressure between 140 and 160 mmHg. We expect the results of the HTN-3 U.S. pivotal study to be presented this coming spring. In structural heart, revenue of $281 million increased 4%, driven by strong growth in our transcatheter valve franchise. We had an outstanding showing at [unintelligible] where data for our CoreValve U.S. pivotal trial for extreme risk patients were presented. The trial met its primary and secondary endpoints, and the results were exceptionally positive, with a low rate of major stroke, low rate of aortic regurgitations that improved over time, and no association of mild or moderate residual paravalvular leaks or late mortality. The FDA decided it will conduct separate reviews for the extreme and high risk studies and have also determined that no panel review is necessary for extreme risk approval. Given these developments, we now expect U.S. approval of CoreValve for extreme risk patients by the end of the fiscal year. For high risk patients, we continue to expect FDA approval in mid-FY15. We have also started our CoreValve Evolut R study of our next-generation recapturable [TAVI] system that features the [Envail] in-line sheath, a 14-French equivalent delivery system. On the CoreValve renal front, while our Q2 results were affected by the injunction of CoreValve in Germany, we were pleased that the higher German court ordered the discontinuation of the injunction last week. Our German customers were elated to learn that they would once again have access to our differentiated transfemoral technology with our unique valve sizes, catheter sizes, and indications for use options. In endovascular, revenue of $218 million grew 5%, with solid growth in both our aortic and peripheral businesses. In our aortic business, we grew our AAA share sequentially, both in the U.S. and globally, on the strength of our market-leading Endurant II stent graft. Our thoracic product line posted double-digit growth as our Valiant Captivia stent graft is gaining broad adoption. In our peripheral business, we received FDA approval for an extended indication for our Complete SE vascular stent, which is now approved for the use in the SFA and PPA in the upper leg. It is also worth noting that we divested our Pioneer Plus re-entry catheter product line, which represented $11 million of sales over the past year. Now turning to our restorative therapies group, revenue of $1.602 billion grew 2%. Results were driven by growth in surgical technologies and neuromodulation, partially offset by declines in spine. Spine revenue of $746 million declined 3%. Core spine revenue of $636 million, which includes [BKP], declined 1%. The U.S. cores spine market continues to decline in the low single digits, with flat procedural volumes and positive mix, partially offsetting price declines. Excluding BKP, our core spine business was flat globally and declined 1% in the U.S., relatively in line with the overall market. However, our core spine results were below our expectations as certain underperforming product lines offset the positive momentum that has been building from our new product and procedural innovations. Our thoracolumbar, cervical, and other biologic product lines all grew this quarter, both globally and in the U.S., driven by our procedural innovation and new technologies. Cervical, in particular, had a solid quarter, with product line extensions to our Vertex platform, as well as our new Bryan artificial cervical disc, contributing to growth. Our spine business is also increasingly differentiating itself from the competition through enabling technologies that we leverage from our cervical technologies business, including O-arm imaging, StealthStation navigation, and Powerease powered surgical instruments. Hospitals are investing in our capital equipment for spine and surgery as they see clear value from improved surgical precision and more efficient procedures. And this is resulting in increased revenue for our spinal implants as well as solid growth of capital equipment sales in our surgical technologies business. In fact, we are seeing core spine growth in the upper single digits in accounts that have adopted our O-arm technology. Outside the U.S., we continue to work on integrating our Kanghui acquisition in China, which is offsetting the lost revenue from our former Weigao joint venture. While there are certainly bright spots in our spine business, we continue to face challenges in other parts of the business, including BMP and BKP, as well as some recent challenges in interbody. We intend to bolster our interbody product line with the launch of new products including next-generation expandable cages. In BKP, while we did see a sequential improvement, current trends of increased competition continued, and we are working on new products to address this. Turning to surgical technologies, revenue of $377 million grew 11%, with broad-based growth across all three businesses : ENT, neurosurgery, and advanced energy. ENT grew double digits, with core capital platforms of fusion image guided surgery as well as NIM nerve-monitoring driving growth. In neurosurgery, capital upgrades of the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system contributed to another solid quarter. Advanced energy grew over 20% again this quarter, as we continue to see strong adoption of our proprietary [unintelligible] and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies in the orthopedics, spine, breast, and CRDM replacement markets. Turning to neuromodulation, revenue of $479 million increased 6% on solid global growth in DBS as well as a strong finish to the quarter in U.S. PAINSTIM. Our market-leading DBS business delivered another solid quarter, driven by strong client growth in both the U.S. and Western Europe. The results of our early stim trial, which showed DBS provides superior benefits for patients with early motor complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease is generating significant interest in international markets. In PAINSTIM, while we were supply constrained in the first part of the quarter due to the new product launch, the business did grow double digits in October based on a strong implant growth following the full launch of the RestoreSensor SureScan MRI spinal [unintelligible] system in the U.S. In gastro uro, while the business continues to grow, it has slowed from its previous double digit run rate due to new therapies entering the market. However, we are confident that InterStim is the most compelling therapy available and while we may continue to see some near term pressure, we expect it to continue as a long term growth driver as its value prevails in the marketplace. Now turning to our diabetes group, revenue of $393 million grew 3%. We received approval for the MiniMed 530G with the Enlite CGM sensor, and starting shipping to customers late in the quarter. This is the first system in the U.S. that automatically stops insulin delivery if sensor glucose levels fall below a predetermined threshold, an important step toward our goal of developing a fully automated artificial pancreas. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated the value of our Threshold Suspend feature, including the ASPIRE study and the New England Journal of Medicine, as well as the study out of western Australia that was published in JAMA in September. Every MiniMed 530G pump ships with our new Enlite sensor, which is smaller, more comfortable, and more accurate. Regarding accuracy, our FDA labeling indicates that Enlite, with its 13.6% overall [mar] is comparable to competitors\u2019 sensors. We have combined these improvements with the Threshold Suspend automation feature of the MiniMed 530G system and we believe we have the best system in the market and will be focused on taking share over the coming quarters. In addition, we began shipping to customers that had enrolled in our technology guarantee program, which is the trigger for recognizing some of the revenue that we deferred in the prior quarters. As of the end of Q2, we have $27 million of deferred revenue that we expect to recognize over the next two quarters. Looking ahead, our next-generation pump platform, the MiniMed 640G, remains on track for launch in international markets by the end of the fiscal year. This platform will have a number of innovative features, including a new look and feel, a simplified user interface, and the next step toward a fully automated artificial pancreas, predictive low-glucose suspend. Now turning to the rest of the income statement, the Q2 gross margin was 74%. As Omar mentioned, there were a number of issues that negatively affected our gross margin this quarter by a combined 110 basis points. And, compared to last quarter, we recognized an additional $12 million of manufacturing variances, which had a sequential 30 basis point negative impact. However, our standard gross margin was flat year over year as we continue to successfully offset pricing pressure through our five-year, $1.2 billion cost of goods sold reduction program. Given our ongoing spend to address quality issues, we expect our Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 74.5% to 75% on an operational basis and for a negative FX impact of 40 basis points. For Q4, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 75% to 75.5% on an operational basis. Second quarter R&D spending of $372 million was 8.9% of revenue. We\u2019ve continued to invest in new technologies and evidence creation to drive future growth. We expect R&D expense for the remainder of the fiscal year to be in the range of of 8.5% to 9% due to the shifting of R&D resources to enhance our quality systems, which gets recognized under cost of goods sold, as well as tradeoffs we are making to partially offset the U.S. medical device tax. Second quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.438 billion represented 34.3% of sales. After adjusting for the 10 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, Q2 SG&A was 34.2%. We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses, although it is worth noting that in Q3 SG&A spending is expected to be modestly higher given the accelerated ramp of our U.S. CoreValve sales force ahead of expected U.S. approval. In FY14, we would expect to drive 30 to 50 basis points of improvement, which would result in SG&A in the range of 33.8% to 34% on an operational basis. And it is worth mentioning that we typically see most of our leverage in the fourth quarter. Amortization expense for the quarter was $88 million. For FY14, we would expect amortization expense to be approximately $85 million to $90 million per quarter. Net other expense for the quarter was $33 million, including net gains from our [unintelligible] about $15 million. As you know, we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY14 net other expense to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million, which includes an expected $120 million impact from the U.S. medical device tax. In Q3, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million based on current exchange rates. Net interest expense in the quarter was $33 million. At the end of Q2, we had approximately $12.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $12.3 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect FY14 net interest expense to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 19.2%. Excluding the impact of one-time items, our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q2 was 19.4%. For FY14, we expect a non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19% to 20%. Our forecast does not assume the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expires on December 31, will be extended. Currently, the R&D tax credit provides a benefit of approximately $8 million prior quarter. In the first half of FY14, we generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow. We are committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. In Q2, we paid out $279 million in dividends and we repurchased $713 million of our common stock. As of the end of Q2, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately $68 million. Second quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.009 billion shares. For the full FY14, we would expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 1.012 billion shares, including 1.010 billion shares in Q3. Our fully diluted share count for the remainder of the year is expected to be higher due to the higher current share price. However, it is important to note that the cash we received from stock option redemption, which was $249 million in Q2, will also continue to be used to repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Let me conclude by commenting on our FY14 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Based on the performance through the first half of our fiscal year, we continue to believe that full year constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 4% remains reasonable for FY14. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you a sense of FX impact, if the exchange rates would remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY14 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $140 million to $180 million, including a negative $30 million to $50 million impact in Q3. Turning to the guidance on the bottom line, we continue to expect FY14 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to $3.85, which implies annual earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% on an operational basis, after adjusting for certain tax benefits that we received in FY13 as well as the headwinds from the medical device tax and incremental interest expense in FY14. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year. I will now turn it back over to Omar, who will conclude our prepared remarks. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Gary. Before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by noting that over time we are striving to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations, which are consistent mid single digit revenue growth, consistent EPS growth 200 to 400 basis points faster than the revenue, and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. As I mentioned earlier, over the coming quarters, we are on the verge of bringing a number of new therapies to market, and we are setting ourselves up to deliver what is arguably one of the strongest launch cadences of innovative therapies in our industry. We believe that crisp execution of both our baseline and long term growth strategies, combined with strong and disciplined capital allocation, will enable us to create long term, dependable value in healthcare. With that, we would now like to open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I\u2019ve asked Mike Coyle, president of our cardiac and vascular group, and Chris O\u2019Connell, president of our restorative therapies group, to join us again for the Q&A session. We are rarely able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, so we respectfully request that you limit yourself to only one question, and if necessary one followup, so that we can get to as many people as possible. If you have additional questions, please contact our investor relations team after the call. Operator, first question please? Operator : [Operator instructions.] The first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mike Weinstein : If we look at the ICD market growing 3% this quarter, I don\u2019t think any of us really think the ICD market is going to sustain that type of pace, so help us back out, if you would, the stocking impact for you guys that was a negative last quarter that was a positive this quarter, and maybe help us get to what the underlying market is doing. And second, just on the buildout of the field specialists ahead of the U.S. CoreValve launch, are you assuming in the fourth quarter that you\u2019ll have CoreValve revenues to start to leverage that? It seemed like you were suggesting that you would get some leverage in the fourth quarter. And does that imply that there will be some revenues there? Mike Coyle : Let me start with the ICD market. As you\u2019ll remember, last quarter we talked about the challenge being the new product launches that we had, and trying to get those on contract when we were looking for an ASP increase. And so that led to some destocking of hospital inventories as we worked through the process in hospitals that have obviously put up some larger barriers to agreement to ASP increases. That worked itself out during the course of the second quarter, and I think you can reasonably assume that basically they\u2019re back to where they are comfortable stocking. So that now makes it a pretty reasonable picture to just look at the full first half of the year and say, what does the overall growth profile look like? And that\u2019s where we get to this roughly 1% global market growth. So that, I think, should give you a picture of what we think is happening with the overall market. On the second question, regarding CoreValve, we are not counting on any meaningful revenues coming in the fiscal year, from CoreValve. And we are going to be obviously ramping our field representation in advance of the launch. So that\u2019s in our current set of assumptions. Obviously what FDA decides to do in terms of the approval is up to them. Gary Ellis : Just to add to what Mike said, the leverage we\u2019re talking about in Q4 is not necessarily coming from CoreValve. It\u2019s just our natural leverage. If you go back over history, historically in our fourth quarter, because we have more selling days and it\u2019s our strongest quarter, there\u2019s more leverage in that fourth quarter, and that\u2019s what we were referring to. Mike Weinstein : And then just one followup. Omar, do you want to spend just another minute on China and more broadly the slowdown in emerging markets this quarter and just the confidence in the reacceleration, even if it\u2019s not next quarter or over the next several quarters? Omar Ishrak : I think this quarter we just happened to have a bunch of different regions slow down. Just by coincidence everything happened together. We expect this to rapidly start to reaccelerate, because everywhere I go, the fundamental growth drivers are clearly there. There are patients everywhere who need attention from existing therapies. In addition, we\u2019ve got several very concrete plans in place that will start to sort of deliver real revenue growth over the next few quarters, and we\u2019ll share that with you as they mature. In terms of China itself, I mentioned a few very specific items in terms of distributor conversions and some new products. And the overall environment there, there\u2019s some noise out there, because of different regulatory type concerns, but in general we don\u2019t have any hard data to support anything. Our teams are still calling for good growth going into the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodd with Citigroup. Your line is open. Matthew Dodd : Question either for Omar or Chris. The core spine, it looks like it declined again. The comps weren\u2019t that tough. Your next biggest competitor is having integration issues. You put a lot of money into it, especially focusing on MIS. What parts of the business are underperforming, and why is the big picture thesis you had not coming together quicker? Omar Ishrak : Let me make one brief comment, and then I\u2019ll let Chris talk to that. You know, we look at all our businesses. We look at an overall period of time. And if you\u2019ll recall, last quarter we actually had a pretty strong spine performance. This quarter there were some dynamics, which Chris will talk to, but we\u2019ve got every confidence that, like I mentioned in the commentary, that the cadence of product launches we have in spine actually will deliver over the next few quarters. But I think Chris can answer the question a little more specifically. Chris O\u2019Connell: I think the spine market, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, is really bouncing around flat. And our performance has been flat to slightly up in the core spine business and really separating our core spine from the BKP and the BNP business. I think a lot of the same fundamentals are in place. Maybe the biggest difference this quarter is we had a little less benefit from positive mix, given that we\u2019re in the later stage of our launch cycle on some of the big platforms like Solera. But overall procedural growth rate is quite flat, and our pricing has been stable, down in the low to mid-single digits. And so this quarter was a little bit softer, particularly in the U.S., and then a couple of countries outside the U.S., namely Germany, Japan, and Latin America. But the fundamental drivers are still very much there. It is about the product refresh, first of all. Second of all, it\u2019s about the procedural innovation. We\u2019re getting good uplift from our [unintelligible] program, and our new OLIF procedure. And then as Gary pointed out, the tailwind from our enabling technologies like surgical navigation, we continue to perform much better in accounts that have O-arm, and continue to see uptake in technologies like PowerEase and the nerve monitoring. So there are a couple of holes in the product line, particularly in the interbody space, and there are a couple of small categories like peek rods and IPDs that remain under pressure. But overall I think our perspective is it\u2019s a relatively stable situation and we expect that core spine business to be stable into the back half of the year. As pointed out, the BMP and the BKP businesses are both hurting us right now, although the kyphoplasty business does seem to be showing signs of stabilization in the U.S. and we watch the BMP part closely. So that\u2019s the way I\u2019d characterize it, Matt. Matthew Dodd : And then just a quick one for Gary. I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. When you look at the back half of the year, the gross margin in the third quarter is a little lower than the consensus. You\u2019ve got a tough tax comp in the third quarter. Should we be thinking more about back end loading the second half to the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, since the guidance is unchanged? Gary Ellis : Obviously we\u2019re not going to give necessarily quarterly guidance, but I think you\u2019ve highlighted a couple of issues that the market should take into consideration. Our Q3 last year did include some significant tax benefits. If you factor those out, you\u2019re probably more like at an earnings per share of $0.88, which is kind of similar to where we were last year in Q2. And our Q2 and Q3 tend to be somewhat similar. We\u2019re pretty close. And so where the consensus is right now on Q3, based on the gross margin issues we highlighted, we think we\u2019ll improve in Q3 and as we go into Q4, but it will be a little bit more in Q3 here, with these quality costs we\u2019ve talked about and the launch of the CoreValve product line. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see people moving a penny or two from the Q3 to our Q4. We\u2019re not changing our full year guidance, and we wouldn\u2019t expect the [unintelligible] to change, but seeing some shift occur from Q3 to Q4 would not be unexpected. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Kristen Stewart : Just a quick one, Gary, just kind of following up on the gross margin. You did, it sounds like, moderate the full year gross margin expectations. Can you just walk through what the change is for that? Is it just the higher product [unintelligible], or just maybe some of the warning letter charges perhaps coming in a little bit higher? Gary Ellis : I think it\u2019s a little bit of all of those factors. First of all, clearly the FX impact on cost of sales has been greater than we probably expected even a quarter ago. And we just don\u2019t know exactly how that will play out, but it clearly has been a little bit more negative. But the big surprises really were in the situation that as we\u2019ve ramped up all these new product lines, which the good news is we\u2019re getting additional revenue from that. The bad news is there\u2019s some additional costs in ramping up. You don\u2019t get the initial yields you expect right away, and especially when you\u2019re having to ramp up very, very quickly, the scrap and obsolescence also becomes higher, just due to the fact that, for example, on some of the new products, the older products are no longer as much in demand, so we have a higher obsolescence. So that\u2019s the good news of having some of these products be [unintelligible] in the marketplace. The bad news is it affects gross margin. So those, we actually think are a little bit more one-time, and will start to work themselves off after Q2 here with the launches of a lot of these new products. But the quality issues, as you highlighted, we do expect will continue for at least the next quarter or two as we make significant investments in shifting resources from really the R&D efforts up into addressing our quality compliance issues, both in neuro and diabetes. And so that\u2019s why we pulled things back a little bit. The good news is pricing is actually, if anything, kind of in line with what we expected, maybe even slightly better, and we are offsetting that with the cost reductions we have across our various product lines. But these one-time other product type costs clearly impacted us more than we expected in Q2, and we\u2019re assuming that that will play a little bit into Q3, and that\u2019s why for the full year we\u2019re down. As we go forward, we would expect those obviously would not be as significant going into next year. Kristen Stewart : And then just for you, you had commented in your prepared remarks just around the medium-term outlook of getting back into the mid-single digits. And you talked about the number of new products coming. I guess what is your confidence that - I know you\u2019re not giving guidance for FY15 - but that as we\u2019re exiting out of \u201914, you\u2019re well-positioned to kind of get back to that mid single digit growth rate in \u201915. Or do you think that maybe some acquisitions might be needed to help get you there? Omar Ishrak : First, the main comment here is that like I pointed out in the commentary, the number of new products coming out is really unprecedented, at least for the time being and for several years probably before that. And not only Medtronic, but if you look across the industry, that number of products coming out, with that regularity, across the breadth of our businesses, whether you talk about the different businesses in [TVG] or some of the stuff that we do in spine that we think will accelerate growth there. Or you talk about the [IBT] piece. So if you look across the entirety of our businesses, this is quite a change. And it\u2019s got to have some impact. And right now, we\u2019re close to mid-single digits. If you recall, last year we were there, and we\u2019ve had a few quarters here where we\u2019ve had some pressures, but we\u2019re borderline. So I would expect that these launches will help us. They have to. In addition to that, we\u2019ve got a series of other activities that we\u2019re doing, particularly around globalization, which we expect will also help us. Having said that, we live in a place where surprises are not uncommon, and markets are still volatile across the world. Healthcare is a big issue in terms of government focus and spending. And you know, we always have to be a little cautious about where surprises can come from. But on balance, I think our position at this stage is about as good as it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve been here, in terms of future outlook. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Lewis : Just a few followups here. Gary, I know you\u2019ve had a lot of commentary on gross margins, but if you could go from the second quarter here to the fourth quarter, at the upper end of the range there\u2019s about a 150 basis point improvement. Just specifically on FX and quality, how much of a contribution are those two factors in that 100-150 basis point improvement heading into the fourth quarter? Gary Ellis : Well, the reality is your FX in the fourth quarter is much less than right now. [If the rates] stay where they\u2019re at, and that\u2019s what that\u2019s all based on, the FX impact in the fourth quarter would be relatively minor, and so you pick up almost 40 basis points right there, just through the FX. The other piece would be the [equality] items that we\u2019re talking about, there will also be some costs occurring in the fourth quarter as we continue to focus on addressing the warning letters. But you\u2019re also having that cost on a much higher revenue number. And so that\u2019s what also drives your gross margins in the fourth quarter. If you look back historically, the gross margins in the fourth quarter also tend to be at a higher level, as I mentioned, even with the SG&A, because you have a fixed cost that\u2019s on a much higher revenue number. And so, in general, part of it is just your historical trends. The gross margin is probably 40-50 basis points higher in the fourth quarter. Part of it is related to FX and part of it is related to the quality cost. Should start to minimize as we go through the fourth quarter itself. David Lewis : And then Mike, maybe just two broader cardio questions for you. The first, the outlook for your coronary business, considering you do next-generation stent systems in the market, is that a concern for us on volume, or price, or neither? And then just another question on CoreValve. Should we assume next quarter we see normalized market growth given the inventories? And if there are any pricing concessions given in Germany, should we assume you can get back to your prior pricing? Mike Coyle : We would expect normalization in the German market to take place over the next two quarters, just because of the big volatility that took place over the last two quarters. So I wouldn\u2019t say it will all be back to normal next quarter, but certainly when we get into the fourth quarter I would expect normalization to have occurred. On the U.S. side, what I\u2019d point out is we\u2019re now six to seven questions into the launch of Resolute Integrity. We\u2019ve lapped its launch in every major market around the world, and we continue to show share capture. And I think what that\u2019s about is a couple of things. One is just the performance of the product. The handling of the product, the diabetes labeling, the recent data on [DAPT]. I mean, it\u2019s a great product, and I think the more use it gets, the more physicians are coming to appreciate that. But it also fits very nicely into our broader CVG strategy in that we have moved increasingly toward having Resolute Integrity involved in multi product line bundles across our businesses, which include services and programs in those bundles. And that product line has been the biggest beneficiary of it. So if you look historically, it used to be when you brought out a new stent product your share would move in the first two or three quarters, and then that would be it. What we\u2019re seeing is just a continued growth in our share position in DES, and we think it\u2019s because it\u2019s a great product and it\u2019s fitting into a great broader strategy for CVG. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open. Bob Hopkins : First just a couple of quick questions on the pipeline and the visibility of the pipeline. Just wanted to confirm that the American College of Cardiology meeting will be the place that we\u2019ll probably see the data from your renal denervation trial, the U.S. trial, as well as the next edition of the CoreValve data. And then also wanted to confirm just that the drug coated balloon data is still on track for showing it in early April at [unintelligible]. Just wanted to confirm those dates. Gary Ellis : Those continue to be our operating expectations. Bob Hopkins : And then I was wondering if you could talk just a little bit more about the ICD market and why it\u2019s improving. Understanding there\u2019s some stocking issues, and you made some comments earlier, but I was just wondering, is this uptick in the market purely a function of a lot of new products in the market for the first time in a while and maybe seeing better pricing? Or do you actually think there\u2019s been a unit uptick in the ICD market? Mike Coyle : We\u2019ve certainly seen stabilization in the initial implants for ICDs, which is a good sign, obviously. Something we\u2019ve been looking for, and have now seen. On the pricing side, basically it\u2019s flat overall pricing, and we are seeing price increases tied to the new product launches in our high tier, but we continue to see pricing pressure in the mid tier technologies. You net it all out, it\u2019s relatively flat ASPs, which of course is a nice improvement over the 4% to 5% ASP declines we were seeing at this time a year ago. So generally speaking, it\u2019s market stabilization that we\u2019re seeing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Josh Jennings : Omar, I just wanted to ask you quickly about the Cardiocom business, your venture into the disease management space. How should we be looking at that in terms of is it a growth driver? Is it a service that Medtronic is going to be providing to try and ensure deeper partnerships with hospitals and hospital systems? And how much investment do you need to develop or acquire new technology platforms to really optimize your offering? And then specifically for the important avenue of heart failure rehospitalization prevention, there\u2019s a potential pulmonary monitoring device going to be approved by the FDA. Can you speak to Medtronic\u2019s views on pulmonary pressure or intracardiac pressure monitoring? What role will it play in the important market opportunity and how can Medtronic tap into this, and any internal plans to leverage the Cardiocom platform? Omar Ishrak : Let me give you some perspective. First of all, Cardiocom is an operating business with strong results and strong growth prospects with what it has. It has some unique capabilities and we\u2019re excited about what they\u2019re doing, and they have strong momentum and growth by themselves. Now, when we take Cardiocom and latch that onto our distribution team, which is far bigger than what Cardiocom had on their own, we obviously open up a lot more opportunities for that business to grow and increase their sales of their existing products. But in addition to that, the combination of our devices now, going after a more selected patient pool, together with Cardicom\u2019s support services, offer up a future opportunity that is unprecedented, that no other device company and a cardiac monitoring company has ever really got together in this way. And we expect real improvement in growth going forward as a result of that. Now, with respect to other things that we\u2019re to do, as you know, studies have shown that to move the needle and think like heart failure requires a broad set of services, a broad set of solutions, that have to be executed through multiple stakeholders. We\u2019re in the process of creating that holistic solutions business and leading that effort, and we think Cardiocom is a big asset in that journey. Other things will certainly be required, but on its own, Cardiocom is an extremely good platform for us to base this journey on. It\u2019s really a long term method. I\u2019m going to say as well that in terms of the heart failure rehospitalization, we\u2019ve got evidence already that using the Cardiocom capabilities we can have a measurable impact on the reduction of heart failure in specific hospitals, and we think it\u2019s a very cost effective method through which we can achieve that goal. Sensors will be developed over time that will enhance that capability, but in our experience, just doing one thing in an area of that type is usually not enough, but a broad solution is required. I\u2019ll let Mike comment on specifically the product and technology and his views on that, and maybe our plans. Mike Coyle : I think it\u2019s important to look at heart failure as both a short term issue and a long term issue. The short term issue is the 30-day rehospitalization challenge, which all hospitals in the U.S. agree is something that is a big challenge for them to manage. And that\u2019s where the Cardiocom solution, with this basically very fixed window of time in which to impact, has proven to be very effective. The alternatives that are being looked at are permanent implants that are very expensive solutions, which really are not the right answer for the short term challenge, but the question would be are they the right solution for the long term challenge of heart failure management. And in that case, clearly as Omar just mentioned, there are a lot of variables involved here. It\u2019s not just the availability of the measurement from the device, but also the tracking of that data, the specificity and sensitivity of those data, and the cost of managing that information. And we think that\u2019s a very expensive solution that\u2019s being looked at for the long term. We are really focused on trying to focus in that near term window, not only with Cardiocom, but also with some of the predictive diagnostics that are coming out of our CRDM organization. So you know about Reveal. We talked about the Reveal Linq, which is the next-generation loop recorder that we have, and there are other predictive diagnostics you\u2019re going to see us talk about over the course of the next six months that we think can be very helpful in managing heart failure patients in that window where there\u2019s a very clear economic need. So that\u2019s how I would characterize our approach to the strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Bruce Nudell : Mike, several questions for you. Firstly, common wisdom is that the [Partner One] indication in the U.S. is kind of flattening out. As you enter that market, do you see much opportunity for growth prior to indication expansion? Secondly, I know you guys have had a little sluggishness in enrollings for TAVI, and there\u2019s been talk about extending it to [STS2]. Any progress on that front? And thirdly, given the joint FDA CMS approval track for renal denervation, how should we be thinking of that uptake in the States now that you have definitive evidence relative to what we\u2019ve seen in Europe? Mike Coyle : On the second one, let me just ask Jeff. Do you want to comment? Jeff Warren : On [unintelligible] TAVI, we\u2019re talking to the FDA, but there\u2019s really no update on looking more on the enrollment criteria. Mike Coyle : First, I think it\u2019s important to point out that what we are seeking approval for in terms of the range of sizes and alternative access routes for CoreValve should significantly expand the number of patients who are going to be candidates for TAVI, because currently the current approved competitive devices are certainly limited in terms of their size and also the invasiveness of a transapical approach. So we think that there is still plenty of opportunity to both take share in the existing segment as well as to expand the number of patients who are getting treated within the extreme risk. So we\u2019re confident that what we do in terms of our overall expectation for market size continues to be what we would expect to see. On the third question, obviously this is one of the first that\u2019s on the joint track of CMS approval as well as FDA approval. Our goal would be to have essentially a three month window between those two, the FDA approval and the follow on reimbursement, but again, this is fairly uncharted territory, so we\u2019re going to have to see where that leads, but that\u2019s certainly where we are managing our strategy toward. Gary Ellis : And we would expect that obviously, having had data, we\u2019ve always said you have in the data the proven information in the U.S., we think will actually help accelerate the marketplace, and having reimbursement at the same time or close to it would obviously help. So we expect the uptake in the U.S. would be much faster than what we\u2019ve said outside the U.S. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Weiss from Stifel. Your line is open. Rick Weiss : On CoreValve, can you give us a little more perspective? Mike, do you think you\u2019ve lost share in Germany as a result of the injunction, given what seemed to be some heavy selling into the market in advance of this? And can we assume that you\u2019re shipping normally now? And just remind me, I think you said you have strong growth in TAVI in Europe. Can you quantify that more specifically, with a more specific number? Mike Coyle : On Germany, obviously if you just look at total revenues that we just reported in the quarter, we lost share on a reported basis, because we had no product that we were able to sell other than for the compassionate use side. But as you may recall from the first quarter, when customers learned that they were going to lose access to this product, there was a lot of demand that basically accelerated purchases. So in terms of overall share of implants, it\u2019s hard to say, but I don\u2019t think there probably was a lot of share loss in the quarter. And obviously now that we\u2019ll be able to go back into the market with the full offering, I don\u2019t expect there will be going forward. But it\u2019s going to take a couple of quarters for that to normalize overall. Rick Weiss : And on the [unintelligible] side, just as a follow up, is there any way to size to opportunity for the 530G and any sense, of the patients who are getting the devices, are these patients already on a Medtronic pump and upgrading? Are MDI patients converting, or competitor pumps? Any perspective there would be welcome. Omar Ishrak : Well, it\u2019s a little early to get too much data on this, because we just started shipping it, but I\u2019ll tell you that the principal response has been outstanding, both from patients who receive the device and just in anticipation of what the product can do. So we\u2019re really confident about the outlook and the general acceptance of this product as we see it. I think in general most of our Medtronic patients were upgrading at this stage, but we expect some conversions as well. I doubt if there\u2019s going to be too many MDI patients going to this technology first. But again, it\u2019s very early. We just started shipping this product just about a month or so ago. So let\u2019s wait and see. But like I said, the anticipation from our patients is very high, and a lot of excitement around it. Okay, so with that, it\u2019s time to conclude. Thank you all very much for your questions. And I\u2019d like to briefly note that as you work on filling your 2014 calendars, we plan to host our institutional investor analyst meeting on June 5, which will be held again in New York City. With that, and on behalf of our entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. And for those of you in the U.S., I want to wish you and your family all a very happy Thanksgiving. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q3 call, which we anticipate holding on February 18. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic third quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Warren, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead. Jeff Warren : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic\u2019s chief financial officer; will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2014 third quarter, which ended January 24, 2014. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. With that, I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning, and thank you, Jeff. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $4.2 billion, which represents growth of 4% and Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91. Our Q3 revenue growth was at the upper end of our full year revenue outlook, and was in line with our mid-single digit baseline executions. We remain focused on building a track record of operational execution to deliver consistent and reliable results. In Q3, our overall organization once again delivered balanced growth, with strong performances in some areas more than offsetting challenges in the other parts of our business. Looking ahead, we\u2019re confident that our three primary strategies - therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value - will further strengthen, diversify, and expand our market leading competitive position. As we have recently discussed, we are actively translating these strategies into distinct growth vectors, which when combined with our disciplined capital allocation, position us well to create long term value in healthcare. Looking more closely at our Q3 results, it is important to note that all eight of our primary businesses were stable or growing, with a trend of increasing stabilization in certain businesses continuing to play out. This was particular evident in our spine business. Global spine results were flat this quarter, driven in part by improved BMP sales that were down 1%. While this result reflects sequential stability in underlying demand for BMP, it is worth noting that we did face a favorable year over year comparison, as Gary will discuss later. Our diabetes grew 16%, driven by the strong launch in the U.S. of the MiniMed 530 G system with the Enlite sensor. In addition, surgical technologies delivered another outstanding performance in Q3, growing 11%. All three of these businesses, BMP, neurosurgery, and advanced energy, continued to execute and contribute solid growth. At the same time, we continued to deal with some challenges this quarter. In renal denervation, we announced in January that our HTN-3 trial failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint. The HTN-3 results will be presented at ATC on March 29, and we have convened an independent panel of experts to review the data and provide us additional insights of potential next steps for this business. In our peripherals business, we suffered a setback in our below the knee drug eluting balloon program, where we had some unexpected clinical results. In light of these results, we\u2019ve pulled our below the knee DEB from the market. We strongly believe the issues are unique to below the knee, and remain confident in our SFA program. In fact, multiple studies, 14 presented and 6 published, support positive, consistent outcomes for our DEB in VSFA. Both the HTN-3 and below the knee clinical results did affect the Q3 revenue growth of their respective businesses, and also, when compared to our earlier expectations, have a combined, modest 15 basis point negative impact on our overall Q3 growth. While these clinical trial outcomes are disappointing, it is important to realize that we still have a substantial number of exciting growth drivers in our upcoming product pipeline that can help us deliver on our mid-single digit revenue growth expectations. In emerging markets, our overall Q3 growth was 12%, and now represents 13% of our total company sales. While this is respectable, and contributed a point and a half to our overall company growth, our Q3 results fell short of our targeted mid to high teens growth rate. As in Q2, we faced the most pressure in our central and eastern Europe region, which declined 2% this quarter. This was primarily driven by Russia, where changes in fiscal funding mechanisms are negatively affecting healthcare budgets. We are, however, seeing definite signs of improvement in Russia, and expect our overall central and eastern Europe regions to return to strong double-digit growth in the upcoming quarters. Despite the market challenges we have faced recently, we remain confident in our overall outlook for emerging markets. We\u2019re working on a number of specific programs aimed at reaching our targeted levels of growth. Turning to our P&L, our organization once again delivered on the bottom line. We generated 40 basis points of operating leverage on a year over year basis, after adjusting for the impact of foreign currency. On our gross margin line, we had an 80 basis point sequential improvement in Q3, as we resolved the Q2 issue of higher scrap and obsolescence from the manufacturing ramp of new products. And foreign exchange had less of a negative impact. At the same time, we continue to have elevated levels of spending to address quality system improvements, and expect this to continue for several quarters. While these efforts are costly, ensuring the highest level of quality and regulatory compliance has, and always will be, a personal priority for me and a central focus of everything that we do at Medtronic. Turning to our cash flow, we have generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow fiscal year to date, and over the next five years, we expect to get over $25 billion of free cash flow. While revenue growth is the largest level we have for enhancing our cash flow, we also are driving operational efficiencies such as our working capital improvement program, which is targeting increasing our inventory turns by 50% by FY17. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, a commitment level we believe is appropriate given our current mix of U.S. and international free cash flow. This mix continues to be constrained by U.S. tax policy, which creates a negative incentive for us to repatriate cash into the U.S. The remaining 50% gives us ample flexibility to make attractive investments to drive sustainable growth over the long term. We remain disciplined in how we deploy our capital, with a strong focus on strategic alignment and high return metrics, while minimizing near-term shareholder dilution. As we look into the future, we\u2019re convinced that our three strategic priorities - therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value - will not only increase our competitive advantage in the evolving healthcare environment, but also offer real solutions, namely to improve clinical outcomes, expand access, and optimize cost and efficiency to healthcare systems around the world. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re translating these strategies into three growth vectors, each delivering independent revenue streams. Our first growth vector is our strong upcoming product launch cadence, fueled by our therapy innovation strategy, which represents our core strength and continued foundation for growth. Over the coming quarters, we will bring a number of new products to market. In TIDM, we recently launched Reveal Linq in international markets and are expecting FDA approval any day. Reveal Linq is a significant advancement in device miniaturization, with a size nearly 90% smaller than the previous generation, which allows for a simple, minimally invasive insertion. We believe this discreet device will allow us to further expand our upstream footprint in cardiac diagnostics, especially in AF, syncope, cryptogenic stroke, and heart failure. In Q3, we also initiated the global clinical trial for Micra, the world\u2019s smallest leadless pacemaker. Data from this trial is expected to lead to CE mark by the end of FY15 and will also be submitted for FDA approval. In fact, our first U.S. Micra implant is scheduled for later this week. Micra\u2019s is a true innovation in pacing, and features a novel fixation specifically designed for this new approach to prevent dislodgement while supplementing repositioning and [unintelligible] retrieval. In our structural heart business, we received early FDA approval in Q3 for our CoreValve transcatheter valve for three different access routes - transfemoral, subclavian, and direct aortic - in extreme risk patients, and we continue to expect CoreValve U.S. approval for high-risk patients by mid-FY15. CoreValve is able to treat a much broader range of patients than our competitor\u2019s U.S. offering, as it is suitable for nearly all patient valve sizes, and its low profile 18-French delivery system makes it possible to treat patients with difficult or small vasculature. This is also a uniquely differentiated valve in terms of its self-expanding design, controlled delivery, hemodynamics that improve over time, and lower rates of major stroke and paravalvular leak. In intravascular, we\u2019re expecting clinical results for our Impact Admiral drug eluting balloon for the SFA to be presented at the Charing Cross Symposium in early April, and are targeting a U.S. launch in early FY16. In spine, we expect to launch our Prestige LP next-generation cervical disc in the U.S. this summer. We\u2019re also planning to enhance our interbody and cervical plate offerings with a series of launches in FY15. In neuromodulation, we continue to see strong adoption of our SureScan MRI [pain stimulator] in the U.S. and we are now launching this product in Japan. In surgical technologies, we are developing a full pipeline of new power imaging and navigation equipment focused on improving both clinical and economic value in demanding medical procedures involving Medtronic therapies. In diabetes, in addition to the ongoing launch of the MiniMed 530 G system with the Enlite sensor in the U.S., we are demonstrating our innovation in CGM with our Enlite enhanced sensor, which is now launching in international markets. This sensor will complement our MiniMed 640 G, which we intend to launch in international markets in the first half of FY15. The MiniMed 640 G is our next-generation insulin pump system, featuring a new look and feel and a simplified user interface and the predictive low glucose Suspend algorithm. Looking across the portfolio, we feel that we\u2019re positioned to deliver what is arguable one of the strongest launch cadences of innovative therapies in our industry. While innovative therapies remain central to our success and have fueled growth in our industry for decades, it will no longer be enough going forward. In order to unlock the full potential of medtech, to serve more patients and deliver better value in the transforming healthcare environment, we are taking meaningful action to advance our globalization and economic value strategies. We believe successful execution of both of these strategies will position us to win in the changing healthcare marketplace and will be instrumental in establishing durability in our long term performance while creating the potential for upside to our baseline expectations. With globalization, we are committed to unlocking the large opportunity for our existing therapies in emerging markets, and this effort represents our second independent growth vector. We remain focused on the premium segment in emerging markets, where both the medical technology and the ability to pay already exist. This segment of emerging markets represents a multibillion dollar annual opportunity alone, and these are markets where our margins are comparable to our developed markets. In these regions of the world, we are being creative and resourceful as we continue to pursue traditional local market development activities as well as engaging in new and unique business [unintelligible] innovations such as novel commercial collaborations, strategic channel management, and developing unique public-private partnerships. Each of these has the potential to drive upside to our emerging market growth. Finally, we see a continued drive by many progressive payers, hospital systems, and governments to adopt new value-based systems for healthcare delivery and payment. The formation of new value-based healthcare systems and models requires us to think and act differently in terms of how we engage payers, providers, and governments, and the role of innovation within these models. In the end, we believe this shift to value comes with significant opportunity, and our selective efforts to aim at this shift fall into our economic value strategy. Our response to this shift in models will undoubtedly include the continued focus on delivering proven core technologies, but at the same time, we\u2019re also expanding our offerings to new services and solutions, which is our third independent growth vector. These services and solutions may be combined with our technologies, or they may stand alone. They are focused on a broader set of decision makers, such as hospital administrators and payers, with the goal of delivering low cost, high quality, and better patient outcomes. To begin with, we have targeted two important areas where we can immediately offer solutions for healthcare systems around the world : integrated care and hospital solutions. In integrated care, our Cardiocom acquisition is performing well and delivering strong growth. Cardiocom continues to enlarge contracts, and is a compelling value proposition for a number of different customers including government, hospital systems, and health plans. In Q3, Cardiocom launched [unintelligible], a 30-day readmission reduction program focused on minimizing heart failure readmission penalties for U.S. hospitals. Cardiocom is a proven, cost-effective, noninvasive solution that can easily be applied to all healthcare systems\u2019 heart failure patients. In the area of hospital solutions, we are starting to see good early results from our new cath lab managed services business in Europe. This business provides a unique service offering, whereby we enter into long term contracts with hospitals to upgrade and more effectively manage their cath lab and hybrid operating rooms. This is expected to result in wins for all stakeholders. The hospital sees an improvement in cath lab efficiency and profitability, and physicians get access to the latest technology they need for better patient outcomes. Medtronic benefits not only through the increased use of our technology, but also through incremental service revenue, reduced pricing pressure, better inventory management, and more efficient use of our service personnel. While it is still early, we continue to sign up accounts for long term cath lab managed service contracts. Combined, these contracts now represent over $350 million in incremental revenue over a seven-year time horizon. We are particularly encouraged by the positive reaction in the market to our offering and have built a solid pipeline of potential deals. Another solution that we are now offering hospital customers is TYRX, which we acquired in Q3. This proprietary technology dramatically reduces infections that can result from device implants, which not only improves patient outcomes and hospitals\u2019 quality metrics, but also reduces the significant costs associated with these complications. We intend to leverage this technology initially in CRDM, but ultimately in other businesses such as neuromodulation. Ultimately, medical technology has the potential to transform healthcare from being a cost burden for most societies to an economic driver. Nations can achieve better long term economic output by utilizing medical technology to more effectively and efficiently restore health to the sick and manage chronic disease to keep their populations healthy, allowing more people to be contributing members of society. Furthermore, Medtronic is uniquely positioned to lead the shift in value-based healthcare, directing our products and solutions to help providers, payers, and governments achieve their goals and driving more value to healthcare systems around the world. The new services and solutions offerings that I have described earlier, in conjunction with many other efforts, are being well received and distinguishing Medtronic as a serious, credible partner to those who are committed to transforming healthcare systems. We have a number of advantages to offer, including market-leading products in large, chronic disease spaces, clinical and healthcare economics expertise, Lean Sigma resources, as well as the financial strength that gives us the ability to make capital infusions into providers and enter into risk-sharing business models. I\u2019m pleased with the early work we have done to establish our leadership position and know that there are tremendous opportunities ahead as we transform Medtronic from being primarily a device provider today into the premier global medical technology solutions partner for tomorrow. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our results, before we take your questions. Gary? Gary Ellis : Thanks, Omar. Third quarter revenue of $4.153 billion increased 3.4% as reported, or 4.4% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for a $41 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Q3 revenue results by region were as follows : growth in the Middle East and Africa was 20%, Latin America grew 16%, growth in greater China was 11%, south Asia grew 9%, growth in Japan was 7%, the U.S. grew 4%, growth in other Asia Pacific was 3%. The western Europe and Canada region was flat, although it\u2019s worth noting that western Europe grew 1% and central and eastern Europe declined 2% Q3 diluted earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis, were $0.91, a decrease of 2%. This decline was primarily driven by a difficult comparison due to a prepaid tax benefit we received in Q3 last year associated with the extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit, which also has not yet been renewed this year. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.75, a decrease of 23%. This quarter\u2019s GAAP to non-GAAP pretax adjustments included a $15 million restructuring credit from the reversal of excess restructuring reserves related to our FY13 initiative and a $200 million in-acquisition related item consisting primarily of accounting impairment charge related to certain assets already in the acquisition, partially offset by a gain resulting from the elimination of the previously reported R&D and continued consideration payments. It is important to note that while we are still in the process of evaluating potential next steps for our renal denervation business, an accounting impairment charge was deemed necessary as the majority of the value of the renal denervation intangible assets were tied to the timing of U.S. approval. It is also worth noting that the goodwill related to the acquisition of Ardian is being evaluated at the overall coronary business reporting unit level. Based upon the results of the annual goodwill impairment review performed in Q3, no goodwill impairment existed at this level. In our cardiac investor group, revenue of $2.119 billion grew 2%. Results were driven by growth in structural heart, endovascular, ICDs, and AF and others, which included growth from hospital solutions and Cardiocom, partially offset by declines in pacing. CRDM revenue of $1.184 billion grew 2%, and included $12 million from our Q2 acquisition of Cardiocom. Worldwide ICD revenue of $655 million grew 1%. As we noted last quarter, we believe a better way to view the ICD and pacing markets is on a rolling two-quarter basis, given the variability and quarter to quarter dynamics. Similar to last quarter, we estimate that both the U.S. and international ICD markets grew in the low single digits, reflecting continued stability. In addition, our global ICD share also remained stable, as we gained approximately 50 basis points of share internationally, offset by an approximately 50 basis points U.S. share loss. In the U.S., our differentiated Viva XT CRTD and Evera ICD continued to increase as a percentage of our overall product mix and are helping our overall ICD pricing to remain relatively flat. In international markets, we continue to see strong adoption of our Viva XT CRTD with its adaptive CRT algorithm and Attain Performa Quadripolar leads in Europe and Japan. Pacing revenue of $439 million declined 2%. We estimate the U.S. market continues to decline in the low to mid-single digits, while the international market is growing in the low single digits on a rolling two-quarter basis. In Japan, our share remains over 700 basis points above the level prior to our FY13 launch of the Advisa MRI pacemaker, despite new competitive MRI product launches. In Q3, we received expanded labelling for full-body MRI scans from the FDA, further extending our MR conditional device leadership in U.S. markets. MINERVA data presented at AHA demonstrated our Advisa MRI pacemakers\u2019 exclusive AF features, MVP and reactive ATP, are associated with a significant reduction in progression to permanent AF. AF solutions grew over 20%, as we continue to gain share in the AF market, driven by robust growth from our Arctic Front cryoablation system, which grew over 30%. In Q3, we enrolled the first patient in our VICTORY AF clinical trial which we expect to use to seek FDA approval of our phased RF system. Upon approval, this would be the first product with an FDA indication for persistent and longstanding persistent AF. Looking ahead, we intend again to launch next-gen phased RF product, PVAC Gold, in Europe before the beginning of the fiscal year. Coronary revenue of $436 million was flat. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $280 million, including $97 million in the U.S. and $30 million in Japan. Our DES business grew 5%, outperforming the market as the strength of our Resolute Integrity drug eluting stent continues to drive broad market acceptance. In renal denervation, targeted Q3 revenue had been modest, totaling under $30 million over the past four quarters. Based on our Q3 results, renal denervation revenue is now annualizing at less than $20 million. In structural heart, revenue of $281 million increased 4%, driven by strong growth in our transcatheter valve franchise in international markets. We estimate that the international TAVI market is improving, growing nearly 20%, or over 20% if you normalize for the impact of Germany, where we returned to the market during the quarter. In the U.S., the FDA granted early approval for our CoreValve transcatheter valve for extreme risk patients at the end of Q3. In Q4, we are now beginning a very safe and deliberate commercial rollout, building off our initial 60 U.S. [unintelligible] sites. We will support new sites [unintelligible] with an extensive training and education program that can last a few months per site. Looking ahead, data from our U.S. CoreValve trial for high-risk patients will be presented at ACC on March 29, and we continue to expect FDA approval in mid-FY15. In international markets, we are targeting the launch of the 26 mm and 29 mm version of CoreValve Evolut R, our next-generation recapturable TAVI system with a 14-French equivalent delivery system next spring, and we\u2019ll also start our U.S. [test of this] system in FY15. In endovascular, revenue of $218 million grew 4%. Our [unintelligible] business had mid-single digit growth in the U.S. and Europe, despite the competitive pressure from new entrants. Our global and U.S. AAA shares were stable sequentially, as our Endurant II stent graft continues to lead the market. In thoracic, our sales training efforts resulted in 300 basis points of U.S. share gain. We also just received FDA approval for an expanded initiation of our Valiant Captivia stent graft for treating aortic dissections. Our peripherals business declined 3% in Q3, as a result of the below the knee voluntary product recall. After adjusting for the divestiture of our Pioneer Plus re-entry catheter product line, as well as the impact of removing our below the knee drug eluting balloon in the market, our peripheral business grew 15%. Now turning to our restorative therapies group, revenue of $1.608 billion grew 5%. Results were driven by growth in surgical technologies and neuromodulation. Spine revenue of $744 million was flat. Core spine revenue of $631 million was also flat. Excluding VKP, our core spine business grew 2% globally and grew 1% in the United States. Both the global and the U.S. spine markets appear stable, growing slightly this quarter. Our spine business continues to differentiate itself from the competition through our leading technology, enhanced by our surgical synergy program, which integrated enabling technologies from our surgical technologies business, including intraoperative imaging, navigation, and powered surgical instruments. Hospitals are investing in our capital equipment for spine surgery as they see clear value from improved surgical precision and more efficient procedures. This is resulting in solid growth of capital equipment sales in our surgical technologies business as well as increased spinal implant growth. In fact, in accounts that have adopted our surgical synergy program, core spine revenue growth is significantly higher. Outside the United States, our Kanghui acquisition in China continues to deliver solid revenue growth in the value segments of orthopedics, which is offsetting the lost revenue from our former Weigao joint venture. Kanghui continues to grow its sales in the emerging markets outside of China, with strong growth in its trauma product lines. BMP sales of $113 million declined 1%. While this is an improved performance on a year over year basis, it is important to note that we face a favorable comparison in Q3. Recall that in Q3 last year, our results were affected by the inability to fulfill hospital bulk orders due to a supply constraint of sterile water, which resulted in some sales shifting from Q3 to Q4. While we see signs of sequential stability in the underlying demand for BMP, we face a difficult comparison in Q4 because of this shift. Turning to surgical technologies, revenue of $386 million grew 11%, with strong growth balanced across all three businesses. ENT grew in the high single-digits, with upgrades of the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system and NIM ENT nerve monitoring capital equipment driving growth. In neurosurgery, robust sales of OR imaging systems in the U.S. contributed to a solid quarter of double-digit growth. Advanced energy grew over 20% again this quarter, as we continue to see strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue sealing and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies in the orthopedic, spine, breast, and CRDM replacement markets. In neuromodulation, revenue of $478 million increased 7% on double digit global growth in DBS and PAINSTIM. In DBS, our successful referral development program in the United States and the strength of the early stim data in international markets, which show us DBS provides superior benefits for patients with early motor complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease, is driving new impact growth. Our PAINSTIM business grew double digits, both globally and in the U.S., driven by the ongoing launch of our SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system. Our [gastro-uro] business had mid-single digit growth in Q3, as the business continues to face non-device competition. We are confident in the clinical benefits of InterStim therapy, and [unintelligible] to both implanters as well as referring primary care physicians. In our diabetes business, revenue of $436 million grew 15%, a noticeable acceleration from prior quarters, driven by the U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530 G with Enlite CGM sensor. This is the first system in the U.S. that automatically stops insulin delivery if glucose levels fall below a predetermined threshold, an important step toward our goal of developing a fully automated artificial pancreas. Multiple peer reviewed studies have demonstrated the value of our Threshold Suspend feature, including studies that have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA. Every 530 G pump ships with Enlite sensors, which are smaller, more comfortable, and more accurate. In Q3, we estimate we gained over 400 basis points of pump share and NCGM share on a sequential basis in the U.S. We were inventory challenged throughout the quarter, but these supply constraints are now resolved. During Q3, we recognized the majority of our deferred revenue, as we shipped systems to customers that had enrolled in our technology guarantee program. As of the end of Q3, we had $4 million of deferred revenue remaining from this program, which we expect to recognize in Q4. Turning to the rest of the income statement, the Q3 gross margin was 74.8%. After adjusting for a 10 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, the Q3 gross margin, on a non-GAAP operational basis, was 74.9%. It is also worth noting that the gross margin continues to include significant spending related to resources diverted to address quality issues in neuromodulation and diabetes, which negatively affected the gross margin by 30 basis points. For Q4, we expect the gross margin to be approximately 75% on an operational basis, and before a negative FX impact of 20 basis points. Third quarter R&D spending of $360 million was 8.6% of revenue. We continue to invest in new technologies and evidence creation to drive future growth. We would expect R&D expense in Q4 to be closer to 8%, given our typical Q4 leverage as well as the continued shifting of R&D resources to enhance our quality systems, which gets recognized in cost of goods sold and also the tradeoff we are making to partially offset the U.S. medical device tax. Third quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.454 billion represented 34.9% of sales, and included a 10 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange. As expected, Q3 SG&A spending was modestly higher given the accelerated ramp of our U.S. CoreValve sales force ahead of U.S. approval, which occurred late in the quarter. We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses. In FY14, we would expect to drive 30 to 50 basis points of improvement, which would result in a full year SG&A in the range of 33.8% to 34% on an operational basis. Amortization expense for the quarter was $89 million. For Q4, we would expect amortization expense to be approximately $90 million, with the addition of the TYRX amortization, slightly offset by the elimination of our Ardian annualization. Net other expense for the quarter was $45 million, including net gains from our hedging program of $5 million. We hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. Also included in net other expense is the impact from the U.S. medical device tax. Based on current exchange rates, we expect Q4 net other expense to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $25 million. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $13.7 billion in cash and investments, and $12.2 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect Q4 net interest expense to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 20.2%. Excluding the impact of one-time items, our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q3 was 19.6%. For FY14, we continue to expect a non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19% to 20%. Our forecast does not assume the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expired on December 31, would be extended before the middle of our fiscal year. Prior to expiring, the R&D tax credit provided a benefit of approximately $8 million per quarter. In Q3, we generated $1.5 billion in free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. In Q3, we paid $279 million in dividends and repurchased $100 million of our common stock. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 66 million shares. Third quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.01 billion shares. For full FY14, we would expect to diluted weighted shares outstanding to be approximately 1.013 billion shares, including 1.011 billion shares in Q4. It is important to note that the cash we received from stock option redemptions, which was $239 million in Q3, will also continue to be used to repurchase shares on the open market, to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Let me conclude by commenting on our FY14 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We believe a constant currency revenue growth rate of 3% to 4% remains reasonable for both the full fiscal year 2014 and for Q4. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact, if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday, for the remainder of the fiscal year, our FY14 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $170 million to $190 million, including a negative $35 million to $55 million impact in Q4. Turning to guidance on the bottom line, at this point in the fiscal year, we are comfortable tightening our earnings per share guidance rage. We now expect FY14 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.81 to $3.83, which implies annual earnings per share growth of 6% on an operational basis after adjusting for certain tax benefits that we received in FY13, as well as the headwinds from the medical device tax and the incremental interest expense in FY14. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year. I will now turn it back over to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Gary. Before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by noting that over time we are striving to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations, which are consistent mid-single digit revenue growth, consistent EPS growth of 200 to 400 basis points [unintelligible] revenue, and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Our three independent growth rate vectors, new therapies, emerging markets, and our new services and solutions, will provide the fuel for mid-single digit revenue growth. We believe that our continued effort to deliver consistent and reliable performance, combined with disciplined capital allocation, will enable us to create long term, dependable value in healthcare. With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I\u2019ve asked Mike Coyle, president of our cardiac and vascular group, and Chris O\u2019Connell, president of our restorative therapies group, to join us again. We are rarely able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and only one follow up. If you have additional questions, please contact our investor relations team after the call. Operator, first question please. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : Let me just focus on the cardiovascular side of the business, and I think probably two topics people would like to hear on are, one, how we should think about the cadence of the U.S. CoreValve launch, and if you could just maybe give us the metrics to get our heads around how quickly you can train centers. I know that some of that [was said already], but talk a little bit about the different centers in the U.S. and the expectations for training. And the second topic would be on the drug [critical link] program. You made some encouraging comments relative to your expectations on the program and SFA. Could you just spend a little bit more time on that? What drives your confidence on the SFA side, given [what happened in below the knee], and your expectations for just the timing of that launch in the U.S. Omar Ishrak : I\u2019ll let Mike answer these. I think both of these are interesting topics, and we\u2019re making progress in both, but Mike, why don\u2019t you give some color? Mike Coyle : Sure, on the CoreValve ramp, I think it is pretty much just the way Rhonda Robb laid it out at the TCT meeting in terms of us basically ramping from the 60 centers that we currently have established a presence in. Roughly 20 to 30 centers a quarter for the next two quarters, and then probably adding at 40 per quarter after that. So that basically is the ramp rate we are going to pursue. Obviously, the key here is to have the very effective training of the sites, as we bring out the technology. It has performed excellently in clinical trials, and we want to make sure that performance continues as we ramp through the larger number of centers. On the SFA side, we\u2019ve studied this application of the [unintelligible] product in multiple studies, and have had consistent results. And as you can imagine, we\u2019re now at a stage where the presentation of the data is coming at the Charing Cross meeting, which is in the first week of April, so we\u2019re very closely working with the centers who were involved in the study in preparing the data and are very confident that we\u2019re going to have a good presentation at Charing Cross. Mike Weinstein : Can I just ask one quick follow up? The U.S. market, in aggregate, for procedure volumes, the expectation is that we saw some drop off in volumes in January, with not only the concerns that people had on the ACA going into the year, and then the [unintelligible] deductible, but also the weather we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. Can you just give us any commentary on how your U.S. business has looked November/December versus January? Omar Ishrak : I think you make good point. We do see softness in January, when the volumes were a little slower. And this is on top of a soft January in the past year. In fact, we\u2019ve been discussing here that it looks like increasingly over time January appears to be under far greater pressure than November and December. We\u2019ve seen this pattern, realizing actually over multiple years, it was not that different. You know, there could be many reasons. The introduction of the ACA, obviously we don\u2019t know the precise details of all the causes and effects. And certainly it brings a level of change that we haven\u2019t experienced before. So we\u2019re not really sure as to all the reasons, but we do know that January was a little softer than November and December, and in fact we\u2019ve seen this pattern over the past couple of years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodd with Citigroup. Matthew Dodd : If you look at BRIC, it looks like only Brazil is really doing well. And I know there are some issues in Russia. Can you talk about maybe calendar \u201914, how you see BRIC kind of rolling out? Do you think it will improve? Is there any reason why it should for some of these other countries? Omar Ishrak : I think for us, especially as we look at central and eastern Europe in aggregate, and you\u2019re right, Russia is a dominant part of that, and China, are the two biggest pressure points that we\u2019ve had over the last year, both of those have been traditionally strong growth drivers and both of those have been under some pressure over the past several quarters. And that\u2019s really driven our performance to below 15% in the last few quarters, those two being the main drivers. We\u2019re seeing, actually, you can\u2019t see it for sure, but from the data that we\u2019ve seen so far, a bottoming out in both of those regions. China in particular appears to be stabilizing a little bit. And you know, it still grew at 12%, which is double digits, and we expect to improve on that as the quarters go by here in calendar \u201914. And Russia too, we went through a very unique circumstance where the budgets were not allocated in January as they usually are. They\u2019re now well in the process of allocating those budgets, and they\u2019re moving ahead with that, and we expect to see some progress there. And they\u2019re also changing the way in which they actually fund the budgets between the state and the central government. But in any case, they\u2019re beginning to release the money right now, so we expect that to bottom out as well. What it eventually settles to this calendar year is tough to say, but we do think that it will improve in the next few quarters. As far as Brazil and India go, they\u2019re smaller markets for us. The markets have a lot of room for growth. India, you know, we\u2019ve had some issues to do with the coronary business. We also feel it\u2019s stabilizing, although at a lower price than we\u2019ve had in previous years. Brazil seems to be running okay, and running quite well in fact as we go forward. Any other comments Gary? Gary Ellis : No, I think you hit what we\u2019ve seen here recently, and as Omar said, we do expect it to continue to improve. And overall, we continue to expect that the emerging markets in general will get back up into that high teens growth as we go forward, to 20%. So each of the regions are laying out plans to achieve that, but we have seen a little bit of softness here in the last couple of quarters, but it does appear, basically just [unintelligible] data right now, but that seems to have bottomed. Still at double-digit growth, but it seems to have bottomed and then we\u2019re starting to see the growth come back to what we would expect in those markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. David Roman : I was hoping you could come back a little bit more to the hospital solutions and broader contracting opportunity. Omar, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a number like $350 million over seven years. And given the size of the business, that doesn\u2019t add that much on an annual basis. Could you maybe just go into a little bit more detail about, quantifiably, how you think we can start to see some of the benefits of the service or cross-selling model start to play out? Omar Ishrak : You know, that particular aspect of our services and solutions, which is the hospital solutions part, recall that we only started this program in September of last year. So we\u2019ve only had less than six months. And the traction that we\u2019re getting, and the momentum that we\u2019re building, is pretty good. We\u2019ve already got on the order of 10 accounts signed up, and a pipeline for another 10-15, and so we\u2019ve got a pretty solid pipeline driving this. So we expect this to become more and more important as we go forward. The right way to think about it, though, is that this is revenue that\u2019s, although small compared to our overall business, is still contracted revenue, with known pricing, fixed pricing in the sense that there are rules around the pricing, but essentially fixed, and there\u2019s less uncertainty around it. With committed share as well. So the quality of the revenue here in this aspect of the business is actually quite good. And that\u2019s the way we look at it. In addition, the contracts also deliver some incremental revenue from not only share, but the services business. And so that\u2019s the way we really think about it, that we\u2019re only in the beginning period of this activity, and we expect a larger and larger percentage of our European business to come from this aspect. And remember that we also have integrated care in Cardiocom. This is also delivering revenue that is incremental to what we normally see from our core technologies. David Roman : And for my follow up, on the earnings line, looking to the midpoint of your guidance range, and what you\u2019ve done over the past couple of years, that would imply flattish earnings for the past three years. And understandably, you have the device tax in there and some other one-time items. But maybe just conceptually, Gary, you could talk about what changes as we go forward, whereby we could start to see more leverage on a reported basis. And is that something we can expect in FY15? Gary Ellis : We\u2019re not obviously giving FY15 guidance about at this point in time. We\u2019ll do that as we complete our fourth quarter. The guidance for the current year has been consistent all year as far as where we were expecting to be at, and [tightening it] obviously in the quarter here, based on the fact that we only have one quarter yet to go. We had some headwinds as far as some of the tax benefits that we received in prior years, and so in general from that standpoint, there\u2019s some headwinds on the medical device tax and things that the entire industry has had to deal with in general. And plus, interest component, depending on how you were looking at this previously, whether you were looking at it on a GAAP basis or non-GAAP basis with interest and general, the fact is, we think we are increasing the earnings, the earnings per share. We are getting leverage from the standpoint of where the revenue growth was at, from an operational perspective. As we look into next year, we will provide guidance obviously at our fourth quarter earnings call, but in general, as we highlighted in our presentation, we do continue to expect, as Omar said in his comments, 200 to 400 basis points of leverage on the earnings per share line versus what we do on the revenue line. And we would expect that as we move ahead. I\u2019m not going to get into any more detail at this point, but that\u2019s just generally what you should expect as we move into next year. Omar Ishrak : If I can add to that, from a strategy perspective, we\u2019re trying to get some degree of operational leverage through SG&A, which you\u2019ve seen us deliver quarter over quarter, whether [unintelligible] a little bit to R&D we delivered in the last several quarters and beyond. That, coupled with share buybacks, is the root of our earnings leverage strategy. Now, there are a whole bunch of other variables there, which kind of come and go here, to do with FX and tax and everything else. But those, to a large degree, are somewhat beyond our control, although we can work it the best we can. The things we can control on an operating basis, on a day-to-day basis that our business is really geared around, are the SG&A leverage, holding our gross margins flat, and then driving share buybacks to get additional earnings leverage. That\u2019s the basic recipe that we\u2019re trying to follow, and that will continue into the coming years. And our business is focused around working that. Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : First, I wanted to ask about the strength in the TAVI market outside the United States. Just wanted to get your views on what\u2019s driving that. Is this just an uptick in southern Europe? Just trying to get a sense for how much of this growth you think might be sustainable as we look forward. Mike Coyle : I think basically the strength of the data that was shown at PCC, I think, has really given a shot in the arm to the overall growth profile of the business. And we also have, obviously, a number of other small competitors who are coming in [unintelligible]. Those things combined, I think, are helping to accelerate the market. And we think there\u2019s plenty of headroom for more continued growth, as more data comes out on things like the high risk patients, and obviously as we continue to reenroll patients in the [unintelligible] risk patient population. In addition, we\u2019ve seen some favorable reimbursement moves, for example in France, and those things are helping us to see nice growth in the overall market. Bob Hopkins : Do you think it can be a sustained double digit market? Mike Coyle : I think we\u2019ve provided kind of five-year guidance of somewhere in the 12% to 14% range, so I think we\u2019re going to provide guidance for next year, I think when we have completed our planning activities, which are ongoing right now. Bob Hopkins : And then Omar, a question for you, from a bigger picture perspective. A couple of things. Just wanted to see if you could comment on a few areas of potential value creation for Medtronic longer term. Obviously in the specialty pharmaceutical area, we\u2019ve seen a lot of transactions that have created tremendous tax rate synergies for companies. And I was wondering if you could comment on the potential for tax rate synergies, transactions for medical technology. And then I was also wondering if you could comment on, is there any opportunity that you see over time for investors to realize some value creation from all your OUS cash? Just would love some overview comments on those two topics. Omar Ishrak : That\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s something we wrestle with quite a bit. It\u2019s true that a lot of our cash, in fact the majority of our cash, is being generated outside the U.S. And with the tax laws as they stand, we can\u2019t bring them back. Now, we\u2019ve got a number of strategies. Operationally, we\u2019re obviously trying to free up as much cash as we can in the U.S. through our inventory management programs and so on. And in the scheme of things, that\u2019s still a relatively small number. We have certain programs ongoing with the government in the U.S. to see if we can get some favorable tax rulings. That will probably help us in the short term if they come our way. And then in terms of the OUS cash, there are possibilities that we know that some companies have employed. We do look at that. But you\u2019ve got to remember two things. First, we would never do something like that if it\u2019s not in line with our core strategy. We\u2019ve got certain market segments where we have defined that we will be in, which are cardiovascular, restorative therapy, which is potentially neuromusculoskeletal, if you like, and diabetes. We aren\u2019t going to go do some acquisition just for the sake of doing it, so that we can have a better tax bill. Now, if, within our defined inorganic growth strategy, we find that there\u2019s a fit that is in line with where we want to go, then we\u2019ll certainly look at that. So the main point I want to make here is that the strategy comes first, the tax consequences come second. The other point I\u2019d like to make is that in that whole area there is a considerable degree of uncertainty regarding interpretation and what has been passed back, since it\u2019s not necessarily what future practice is going to be. So we just are very careful before we venture into that. Again, we\u2019re certainly looking at it very carefully, but there\u2019s not something that is an obvious solution to our OUS cash problem. Gary Ellis : You\u2019ve explained it well. Obviously the ultimate answer is that we need corporate tax reform in the U.S. to kind of address the issue and move on. But until that happens, we\u2019re putting other strategies, assuming that we\u2019ll still have the same issue. As Omar said, there are things that can be done, but for a company of Medtronic\u2019s size, they\u2019re relatively limited. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Just on the CoreValve program, I was just wondering if you guys have submitted the clinical data in the PMA filings yet, for high risk? Omar Ishrak : Mike, have you submitted, on the CoreValve, the data for the PMA for the high risk? Mike Coyle : Yes, we have submitted the data for the high risk. And those will be presented at the ACA meeting here at the end of March. Kristen Stewart : And then I guess just kind of bigger picture topic, you guys tightened the EPS range. I\u2019m just curious, why not tighten the revenue range for the full fiscal year? Maybe if you can just talk through some of the puts and takes for the fourth quarter? I know you mentioned BMP has a particularly difficult comp, but just surprised why there isn\u2019t a little bit more confidence in revenue coming in at the higher end. Gary Ellis : The reality is the 3% to 4% that we\u2019ve been consistently saying all quarter, and for Q4, so we said 3% to 4% for the full year and 3% to 4% for the fourth quarter. And so that\u2019s consistent with where we\u2019ve been. We\u2019re at 3.7% or something like that at this point in time year to date, so I think we\u2019re still consistently in that range. And you have to remember, last year in our fourth quarter, we had a very, very strong fourth quarter, and so we have a tough comparison that, on the one hand, we\u2019re looking at here in Q4. So we think 3% to 4% is reasonable. Obviously we can exceed that. We always will, but based on what we\u2019ve done so far this year, where our markets are at, the 3% to 4% seems reasonable, both for the full fiscal year and for the fourth quarter. Omar Ishrak : There\u2019s no implication here that there\u2019s something strange or anything like that. Other than the point that Gary made, that it\u2019s a little bit of a tough comp versus last year. Other than that, like we\u2019ve stated, it\u2019s within the guidance range that we\u2019ve been talking about, and we reiterated that although we\u2019re above the midpoint of that guidance range year to date, we\u2019re keeping the same for Q4. Kristen Stewart : And then just Gary, to clarify, the diabetes deferred recognized in the quarter, was that about $23 million? Is that right? Gary Ellis : That\u2019s correct. We recognized about $23 million of it, and there\u2019s $4 million left to go. Kristen Stewart : And then CoreValve, as that rolls out, are you guys going to do that on a consignment basis? Or will that be stocking? How should we think about that, because I believe your 3% to 4% total revenue growth had always excluded the launch of that product? Gary Ellis : We haven\u2019t discussed the [unintelligible] strategy for that launch. But any revenue is recognized on implant, so we\u2019re not planning on doing a big bulk launch. We\u2019ve actually been inventory constrained, so [unintelligible] right now would be based on implant. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Mike, just to kind of review comments made on the call, we read your comments on U.S. ICDs to reflect more inventory timing than share. Is that the right way to think about it? And can you give us your share outlook in the United States high power market over the next several quarters? Mike Coyle : The way I would characterize it is we really have to look at this over the two quarters, because of the volatility and what happens at the end of the quarters. So on a global basis, we think our share was relatively stable, if you look at that six-month kind of window. We saw share capture, I think, in international, where we basically have the full product set of offerings with the Evera product lines and the Viva XT product lines, including the [unintelligible], the Attain Performa product available in Europe and Japan. We\u2019re obviously still waiting for that product approval in the U.S., so we have seen a little bit of share loss in the U.S., but we would expect there are a number of obviously significant catalysts now that are coming into the market to help us on the share side, including the [adapta] CRT data, which basically is the first clinical feature to show reduced AF and reduced heart failure burden in patients who get LV-only CRT pacing. We also obviously will get the Performa product into the U.S. after the approval cycle has gone through. And as Omar mentioned, the TYRX product is a very exciting one for us in terms of its use in device implants. There\u2019s a 2% to 4% rate of infection, especially in replacements and in high risk patients, that we think we can make a meaningful impact on using these technologies. And that would obviously be added to our over product offerings. So that, in addition to the lead integrity alert that we\u2019ve now gotten approval to use on not only our own, but on competitive product lines, we think is a very valuable feature that is going to help us move share in the market. So all these are new dynamics that we\u2019ll have for us going forward. David Lewis : And then Omar, we talked to investors about your services strategy, which you talked a lot about on this call. There seems to be a sense that to win long term, you\u2019re going to need to go at risk to gain the share, to continue to execute the strategy the way that you like. Is going at risk, is that an accurate view? And if it\u2019s true, when\u2019s the earliest we could see at risk contracts in the U.S.? Omar Ishrak : You know, certainly our Cardiocom business has a services component that is already at risk. We charge on an appropriation basis, and in fact we are at risk with the certain hospital metrics, readmission metrics, with Cardiocom. So to some degree we\u2019ve already started that. I think the longer term at risk propositions will involve bigger pieces of value to do with our technology. I think the TYRX one is one that we will probably go after pretty quickly, because we have good data around its value in infection prevention, and we\u2019ve got other capabilities within the company that add to it, especially in replacing market in CRDM. And combined, there\u2019s a program that we could probably come up with that has a certain degree of risk associated with it. You\u2019ve got to remember that when we say at risk, we are taking risk, usually, that we think that we have data for. So in our mind, it\u2019s really no risk, because we know these things work, through actual clinical data. Now, the system is such that there\u2019s no organized way in which credit is given for that improvement, and so that\u2019s why the best way to kind of [unintelligible] the system into giving credit for that improvement is by going at risk, saying look, we really believe in our data, and we\u2019re prepared to put some money down on it. We\u2019re not going to just take risk on an ad hoc basis on stuff that we don\u2019t have any data on. So I think we have very targeted strategies that we\u2019re developing, and as I said, the Cardiocom and TYRX are probably the two first instances that you\u2019ve already seen and will begin to see come out in some level of scale in the next six to 12 months. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joann Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Joann Wuensch : If I heard you correctly, you talked about sort of a longer term goal of holding gross margin close to the 75% level. Can you talk about what things can be done to sort of expand that over time? Omar Ishrak : You know, our strategy has been that first of all holding it in this environment is quite a challenge, which you can appreciate, because there\u2019s a considerable amount of pricing pressure. And until we get to a value-based system, where people give us real value for the incremental features that we provide, today there\u2019s no mechanism for that, so we\u2019re in a negotiating arrangement, and so there\u2019s continual pressure on price. So the two main ways in which we will, in this case, hold that gross margin, first, is a cost reduction program which we\u2019ve got in place, which we\u2019re using to offset most of that pricing pressure. And second is our means through which we will demonstrate that we\u2019ve got real value for the features that we have, and therefore get some extra pricing results from that. If that second strategy is successful, and we\u2019re able to show the system a financial benefit for the incremental features that we\u2019re adding, we will get some degree of improvement in the long term. But our real strategy here is, we think that the 75% is a pretty good number, and any extra margin that we get, we would much rather [unintelligible] in volume, in a variety of different ways, by [unintelligible] our products and driving growth. That would be our strategy. Joann Wuensch : My second question is, there are a number of new CRM products which are coming out, some of which I know you\u2019re working on also, subcutaneous ICDs and leadless pacemakers. I\u2019d love your impression on how those products will be changing those markets. Omar Ishrak : You know, the one that we\u2019re most excited about is obviously the leadless pacemaker, and obviously I\u2019ll let Mike comment on it. And you know, the key about that product is that its insertion mechanism is much easier and it\u2019s much more targeted as a therapy. And we think that, from an overall procedure basis, this will lead to greater efficiency in the system and probably expand access, because especially outside the U.S., where a greater number of physicians can probably do the procedure, where there\u2019s an issue of the availability of such solutions. So we see that as a fairly fundamental change in the way pacing will be done in the future over the long term. So we think that that\u2019s a big area of change, driven by technology. The other one you didn\u2019t mention, but we just launched the Linq product, which is also minimally invasive, and I mentioned in the commentary about the specific clinical areas where it will make a difference. But in terms of diagnostics, the ease of use with which this thing can be implanted will make a significant difference to the workflow of cardiology and management of certain chronic diseases. So those are the areas where we think there will be the biggest changes. But Mike, can you give more color to that? Mike Coyle : I think you said it well. The ability with the leadless pacemaker to basically eliminate the [unintelligible], you know, pacing is a very safe invention, most of the complications are due to the creation of the pocket and the running of the leads. So the availability to be able to do a very quick procedure with a [unintelligible] delivery is, we think, very exciting. And especially as Omar mentioned, in emerging markets, there are just many more physicians with those skill sets. So the combination, we think, is very exciting for that market. And I think the Linq product, the ability to actually just do a subcutaneous placement of the device, with especially an injection of a device that\u2019s now 90% smaller than the Reveal product that it\u2019s replacing, really is a major advance technologically. But it\u2019s also coupled with some very impressive data we just released at the International Stroke Society on Friday, the CRYSTAL-AF study, that we showed that cryptogenic stroke patients, patients with unexplained prior strokes, who we know are at very high risks of repeat stroke, but it\u2019s difficult to determine how to treat them, that using standard care you\u2019re only going to find AF in 3% of those patients over three years. If you use one of these Reveal devices, though, the Linq device, we\u2019ll be in a position to, as our data showed, identify 30% of those patients as ultimately having asymptomatic AF, who need therapy that they otherwise would not get, who would then have a second stroke. So these things, we think, are really fundamentally new opportunities for growth in that segment. Operator : Your final question comes from Derrick Sung with Sanford C. Bernstein. Derrick Sung : Just to start with a couple of quick follow ups on CoreValve, do your sales this quarter reflect a full return to the German market? Or is there any further opportunity there? And then on your mid-FY15 timeline for high risk CoreValve approval, does that assume a full panel review by the FDA? And can you remind us why the FDA was able to bypass the panel review for the extreme risk data, and maybe the differences between extreme risk and high risk that might or might not lead the FDA to think about things differently? Gary Ellis : On the German market, as we mentioned last quarter, we were still working off of the loads that had been done during Q1 when we knew the injunction was imminent and customers were very much demanding our product. So, as we\u2019ve said, we expected that to normalize by the end of the third quarter. It pretty much has normalized by the end of the third quarter, so we would expect, going into the fourth quarter, we should be back at run rates to implants driving our overall revenue. On the difference between the timing for the high risk data, obviously we continue to expect a mid-FY15 approval. That does assume a panel review. We didn\u2019t have the panel review for the extreme risk data because simply the data was so compelling that the FDA saw no reason to go back for a secondary review. There has been no determination from the FDA on whether or not a panel would be required for the high risk data, and obviously it all depends on the quality of the data. We will be showing those data at the ACC meeting in a late breaking clinical trial session, and then we\u2019ll be working with the FDA to schedule approval of the product. Derrick Sung : And just a quick follow up on drug eluting stents. I think your sales there have been holding up a lot better than we and most investors have been expecting. How much of that is bundling with CoreValve? And looking forward, how much opportunity do you have to try further stent sales through any bundling with CoreValve now that you\u2019re on the market there? Omar Ishrak : I\u2019ll let Mike comment on the bundling, but I\u2019ll say that from what I know, the success of the product itself, the Resolute Integrity and its feature set, is also getting some level of traction. So you know, you\u2019ve got to give that a little bit of credit. But I think on top of that, our [CVG] strategy has clearly demonstrated the success with the drug eluting stent. Maybe Mike, I\u2019m sure you can add some color. Mike Coyle : Obviously the CoreValve approval for the extreme risk came very late in the last week, so it really had no impact in terms of any kind of bundling activities with our OR [DES] product. We did gain about a point and a half of global share year over year with Resolute Integrity, which is very impressive given that it\u2019s been out seven, eight quarters into the market now. First, it\u2019s a great product, and the deliverability of the product has really been very well received by the physician community. The labeling they have for diabetes, its performance in bifurcation, we continue to supplement the data set at every major meeting, and basically that factor is probably the single most important factor in driving the overall share growth. But I would also say that, as I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we have somewhere north of 12% of our total, for example, U.S. CVG revenue in multi product line bundles for CVG, and the Resolute Integrity product is in 98% of those [unintelligible], so it is probably the one that benefits more than any from that overall strategy. So it\u2019s just a great product, and it\u2019s being presented to the marketplace in the right way. And as we get these new catalysts, like the CoreValve, into the market, we expect the power of that story should only increase. Omar Ishrak : I think actually Mike makes a great point, that the bundling strategies, and all of the strategies that we\u2019ve talked about in terms of services solutions, rest on our ability to have market leading technologies in each area. Without that, the other strategies do not work. And so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we have market-leading strategies in our core areas. That, coupled with our breadth and scale, provides us with truly differentiated positioning in the marketplace. So with that, let me conclude the session here. But I\u2019d like to remind you, before concluding, that we do plan to host our initial institutional investor and analyst meeting on June 5 in New York City. And with that, on behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress in our Q4 call, which we anticipate holding on May 20. Thank you.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question \u2013 and \u2013 answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Jeff Warren : Thank you, Lori. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fourth \u2013 quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial Office, will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and FY14, which ended April 25, 2014. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward \u2013 looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward \u2013 looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward \u2013 looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non \u2013 GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at Medtronic.com. And finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly or annual results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth \u2013 quarter and FY13, respectively, and all year \u2013 over \u2013 year revenue growth rates are given on a constant \u2013 currency basis. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported fourth \u2013 quarter revenue of $4.6 billion, which represents growth of 3.3% and Q4 non \u2013 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.12. Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I would like to recap FY14. We grew our FY14 revenue 4%, which was in line with our revenue outlook for the year and within our mid \u2013 single \u2013 digit baseline goal. It represented another year of delivering consistent results. We made solid progress in a number of areas over the past year, including quantifying, communicating, and executing on each of our independent growth vectors. Our first growth vector, new therapies, contributed 180 basis points of growth in FY14, as we launched several significant new products that provide tremendous patient benefit and will serve as important future growth platforms. In our emerging markets, we sustained double \u2013 digit growth, which contributed nearly 150 basis points to our overall revenue growth and represented 12% of our global business in FY14. Finally, on our third growth vector, services and solutions, we sharpened our focus and economic value, translating our efforts into new value \u2013 based business models, including our Cath Lab Managed Services and Cardiocom offerings, which combined contributed 30 basis points of growth and $51 million of incremental revenue. Healthcare payment and delivery systems are changing and evolving around the world. Through these efforts, we feel we are well \u2013 positioned not only to respond to these system changes, but to demonstrate the role medical technology and related services can play in making these healthcare transformations successful. Looking at the P&L, while we delivered a modest amount of SG&A leverage on an operational basis, we failed to meet our SG&A leverage goal for the year due to our Q4 spending, which I will address in a minute. However, on an operational basis, we did deliver 50 basis points of operating leverage in FY14. And looking at our FY14 EPS, we were in the middle of our guidance range for the year, covering for the incremental pressure from the medical device tax. Looking at free cash flow, we had a very strong year in FY14, generating $4.6 billion, as we continue to deliver on our working capital improvement program. This translated into strong shareholder returns, as we met our goal of returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Achieving these financial metrics ultimately reflects the dedication and passion of over 49,000 employees living our mission every day, collaborating with our partners in healthcare to deliver therapies and services to millions of patients around the globe, alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life. Looking at our Q4 performance, while our 3% revenue growth was in line with our full-year revenue outlook, it fell short of our mid-single-digit growth baseline goal. However, it is worth noting that this performance was against a difficult comparison of 5% growth last year. Strong performances from some of our key high growth businesses, including the AF Solutions business with CRDM, DBS business in neuromodulation, surgical technologies and diabetes, helped to offset challenges in other areas. In core spine, the business showed stability again in Q4, consistent with our results all year. We also saw solid growth in our new services and solutions businesses, Cardiocom and CathLab managed services. At the same time, our recently introduced new products continued to drive growth. The MiniMed 530G system with the Enlite sensor is taking meaningful share, resulting in strong US diabetes growth. In CRDM, we had a very successful global launch of Reveal LINQ, a differentiated, miniaturized cardiac diagnostic monitor. This technology has been extremely well received by both patients and physicians, and promises to be an important new tool in cardiac and stroke diagnostics. In structural heart, our US launch of CoreValve is off to a good start, as we treat patients with extreme risk for surgery, with this unique technology. We are excited about the momentum we see in all of these areas and the future growth that they represent. We also faced some challenges in Q4; the US pacemaker and ICD markets were both a little slower than we were expecting. In addition, share gains in the US pacing systems were offset by share pressure in US defibs. In spine, while our core business, excluding BKP, posted modest growth, BMP and BKP declined. Though both continued to show sequential stability. We are continuing to implement our plan to broaden our BKP product line, including adding new products in interventional spine. Chris O'Connell will share details of this with you at our upcoming analyst meeting. In BMP, we pointed out at our last earnings call that we faced a difficult year \u2013 over \u2013 year comparison following the resolution of a supply disruption last year. In neuromodulation, our gastro \u2013 uro business saw weaker \u2013 than \u2013 expected new patient demand in early calendar 2014, which we believe was due in part to insurance changes for elective procedures in the US. We also continued to face some challenges from non \u2013 device alternatives. We have seen some recent improvement in new patient trends and remain confident in our ability to demonstrate the unique value of interest in therapy as the basis for attractive growth in this business. We had four major US clinical data presentations in Q4 : CRYSTAL \u2013 AF, CoreValve for high \u2013 risk, SYMPLICITY HTN \u2013 3, and IN. PACT Admiral DCB. CRYSTAL \u2013 AF was presented at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference in February, where its compelling data demonstrated that our Reveal cardiac diagnostic monitor detected AF better in patients with recent cryptogenic strokes than standard care. At ACC in late March, impressive results from our CoreValve high \u2013 risk US Pivotal Trial were presented, showing superiority over surgical valve replacement at one year. In addition, the low mortality rates of our differentiated CoreValve system in patients considered high risk for surgery exceeded expectations. I was at ACC, and many physicians shared with me their personal excitement regarding these ground \u2013 breaking results. Also at ACC, we shared our analysis of the HTN \u2013 3 data for treatment \u2013 resistant hypertension. While HTN \u2013 3 met its primary safety endpoint, it was disappointing that it did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint. We convened an independent panel of expert physicians and researchers to advice us in next steps for our Ardian program. Based on their input, we decided to continue to provide access to SYMPLICITY in countries where it is approved, and continue to enroll patients in the Global SYMPLICITY Registry. We are not abandoning renal denervation opportunity. We will continue to bring insight from the HTN \u2013 3 trial and map the clinical and commercial path forward in collaboration with the FDA. One week after the ACC the extremely positive results of our IN. PACT Admiral Drug \u2013 Coated Balloon US Pivotal Study represented at the Charing Cross Symposium in London. This study showed patients with peripheral artery disease in the upper leg experienced significantly better outcomes at 12 months when treated with IN. PACT Admiral than those treated with standard balloon angioplasty. We are currently expecting FDA approval of the IN. PACT Admiral about this time next year and believe the global market for DCB could be $1 billion by 2020, a driver of growth not only for our endovascular business, but for overall Medtronic. In Q4, our international business grew 5% and accounted for 47% of our total revenue. Emerging markets delivered improved overall performance, growing 14%. Our Middle East and Africa region, in particular, had a very strong finish to the year, growing 29%. This was driven by strong execution of several tenders in a number of countries across all three business groups. Our channel optimization strategy also added to the performance in the region, as we recently became majority owners in a new collaboration with our largest distributor in Turkey. This transaction not only allows us to work more closely with providers in this important market, but also unlocks incremental margin. We intend to continue to identify and pursue similar channel opportunities to optimize our performance in emerging markets. Also, our results in Greater China were significant, where we experienced a modest improvement in underlying market dynamics and grew 15%. On the other hand, growth remains slow in our Central and Eastern Europe region, driven primarily by challenges in Russia. Healthcare spending has tapered in Russia and did not improve as we expected due to the unforeseen geopolitical events. India also remained under severe pressure, declining 14%, as we continued to face challenges from the previously discussed termination of one of our largest coronary distributors. Going forward, we are focused on developing unique commercial and market development partnerships with different providers, in order to drive rapid improvements in therapy access and improve our performance in India. Despite the challenges in Russia and India, we are encouraged by the improved growth in emerging markets and remain confident in our long \u2013 term outlook. Turning to the P&L, our SG&A expenses were higher than expected in Q4. Some of the additional spending was due to the accelerated field investments that we decided to make, given the strong clinical data that was presented during the quarter; however, there was also a component that was unexpected and, frankly, a surprise. This was clearly an execution issue and something that should be controllable. I take execution lessons of this nature very seriously. I'm disappointed with these results, and I'm taking immediate action with my management team to tighten up our spending control processes. Also in Q4, as in previous quarters, we had elevated levels of spending within cost of goods sold to address quality system improvements in our neuromodulation and diabetes businesses. While we expect these cost to taper over time, we do expect them to continue in FY15. These efforts are costly, but they are nonnegotiable and are critical to ensuring the highest level of quality and regulatory compliance. We will not curtail or minimize these needed investments, to ensure our products meet the quality and performance obligations. Finally, on a positive note, I am pleased with the way our global team executed on our working capital improvement programs, driving strong quarterly free cash flow of $1.2 billion. As we look ahead to FY15, we remain focused on striving to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations. To achieve these goals, we need to continue the momentum we built in FY14 on our three primary strategies : therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value. We are confident that these strategies will further strengthen, diversify, and expand our market \u2013 leading competitive position. As I mentioned earlier, we are actively translating these conception strategies into three distinct growth vectors : developing new therapies; penetrating emerging markets with existing therapies; and building new, independent services and solutions. Starting with new therapies, we are poised to deliver a number of innovative products to the market and expect them to generate 150 to 300 basis points of growth. In structural heart, the ongoing US launch of CoreValve and the European launch of (inaudible) will be significant contributors. We are pleased to announce today the global patent settlement with Edwards. This comprehensive agreement removes uncertainty for the next eight years, allowing us to completely focus on providing access of our important CoreValve technology to patients. We expect additional growth in our cardiac and vascular group to come from Reveal LINQ, direct and AF Solutions, as well as continued growth in endovascular from our Aerotek business and drug \u2013 coated balloons. In spine, we are expecting a number of new cervical and interbody product launches, the ongoing adoption of surgical synergy, as well as continued stability in BMP and improvement in BKP. The RestoreSensor, SureScan MRI in neuromodulation, and new capital products in surgical technologies should also deliver growth performances in FY15. In diabetes, the continued rollout of the MiniMed 530G system in the US and expected launch of the MiniMed 640G in Europe should result in another year of strong growth. It is worth noting that we are working collaboratively with the FDA to accelerate the US \u2013 of our next \u2013 generation insulin pump system, and we are optimistic that we can bring this new technology to the market sooner than previously anticipated. We are mutually committed to advancing access to this important technology with all of the prerequisites \u2013 with all of the requisite patient safety requirements being met, and we truly appreciate the agency's focus in this area. Finally, last week, I appointed Hooman Hakami to lead our diabetes group. Hooman is an outstanding leader, has a track record of driving growth, and I'm confident that he will work to strengthen our core insulin pump and CGM franchises, as well as realize the tremendous growth opportunities in the type 2 market and in overall international expansion. In our second growth vector, which is increasing the penetration of our existing therapies in emerging markets, we should see momentum continue through not only our traditional market development activities, but also new business model innovation in the areas of channel optimization and broader partnerships with governments and private providers. We expect our emerging market growth to accelerate in FY15 and contribute 150 to 200 basis points to our overall growth. Our third growth vector, which is creating value \u2013 based services and solutions, is also expected to deliver incremental growth in the coming year, with a contribution in the range of 40 to 60 basis points. We are expecting Cardiocom and Cath Lab Managed Services, which are reported in our CRDM results, to more than double in size in FY15. Looking at our growth vectors, it is not unreasonable to expect a revenue growth acceleration of 50 to 150 basis points over what we delivered in FY14. However, given the dynamic nature of our marketplace, we feel that our revenue outlook of 3% to 5% is balanced and realistic. Ultimately, our goal is to build a business that is diverse and robust enough to absorb challenges, while still delivering on our baseline expectations, something that we feel we're beginning to do. At our analyst meeting in a couple of weeks, we will share in detail with you how we intend to deliver on our baseline goals. We will lay out for you our full pipeline of innovative therapies across all of our businesses, discuss the efforts we are making to develop and grow in emerging markets, and explain our innovative new business models and partnerships that we believe will help shape the future healthcare landscape. In addition, we will present a detailed look at our financials and update you on the progress we're making on our important product cost reduction and working capital initiatives. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our quarterly results. Gary? Gary Ellis : Thank you, Omar. Fourth \u2013 quarter revenue of $4.566 billion increased 2.4% as reported, or 3.3% on a constant \u2013 currency basis, after adjusting for a $39 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Q4 revenue results by region were as follows : Growth in the Middle East and Africa was 29%; Greater China grew 15%; growth in Latin America was 13%; other Asia \u2013 Pacific grew 5%; growth in Japan was 4%; Central and Eastern Europe grew 3%; and the growth in the US was 2%. The Western Europe and Canada region grew 1%, and South Asia declined 14%. Emerging markets grew a combined 14% in Q4 and represented 13% of our total sales mix. Q4 diluted earnings per share on a non \u2013 GAAP basis were $1.12 , an increase of 2%. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.44, a decrease of 54%. This quarter's GAAP to non \u2013 GAAP adjustments included and $85 \u2013 million pretax net restructuring charge, primarily related to our renal denervation business, back \u2013 office support functions in Europe, and global manufacturing consolidation; a $746 \u2013 million pretax certain litigation charge, primarily related to our global patent settlement with Edwards and our INFUSE product liability settlement; a $13 \u2013 million pretax charge related to acquisition \u2013 related items; and a $63 \u2013 million benefit related to certain tax adjustments from the IRS resolution on certain items related to the FY09 through FY11 audit. Regarding the Edwards litigation settlement, we recognized a $589 \u2013 million non \u2013 cash pretax charge, which is net of the amount previously accrued. This payment will be made using OUS cash. Our ongoing royalty rate will vary between geographies and periods of time, depending on the applicable patents, with higher royalty rates in earlier years declining over time, and the minimum annual royalty payment is $40 million. In our cardiac and vascular group, revenue of $2.369 billion grew 2%. Results were driven by growth in structural heart, endovascular and AF and other, which included growth from hospital solutions and Cardiocom, partially offset by declines in coronary and defibrillation systems. CRDM revenue of $1.346 billion grew 2%, and included $18 million of combined revenue from our Q2 acquisition of Cardiocom and Q3 acquisition of TYRX. Worldwide high \u2013 power revenue of $734 million declined 2%. As we noted last quarter, we believe a better way to view the ICD and pacing markets is on a rolling two \u2013 quarter basis, given the variability in quarter \u2013 to \u2013 quarter dynamics. We estimate the global ICD market is flat to slightly down, a slight slowing from last quarter when low single \u2013 digit declines in the US offsetting low single \u2013 digit growth in international markets. We estimate we gained about 1 point of share internationally, offset by almost 2 points of US share loss In Europe and Japan, we continue to see strong adoption of our Viva XT CRT \u2013 D with its AdaptiveCRT algorithm and Attain Performa quadripolar lead. In fact, in the two quarters since launching Attain Performa in Japan, we have gained 12 points of CRT \u2013 D market share. Attain Performa improves on a competitor's first \u2013 generation quadripolar technology, and we expect to launch this product in the United States in FY15. Late in Q4, we received CE Mark for our Evera MRI SureScan ICD, the first and only ICD system approved for full \u2013 body MRI scans, and also began enrollment in the US Pivotal Trial, for this meaningful new technology. Low \u2013 power revenue of $503 million was flat. On a rolling two \u2013 quarter basis, we estimate the global market is flat, a slight improvement from last quarter, with the US market declining in the low single digits, while the international market grew in the low single digits. In Japan, Advisa MRI continues to perform well, despite new competitive MRI product launches, as our share remains 500 basis points above our pre \u2013 launch level. Another positive driver of results this quarter was the strong global launch of Reveal LINQ, which nearly doubled our diagnostics revenue. In Q4 we continued enrolling patients in our global clinical trial for Micra, including enrolling the first patients in the US and Japan. Data from this trial is expected to lead to CE Mark by the end of FY15 and will also be submitted for FDA approval. Micra, the world's smallest leadless pacemaker, is a true innovation in pacing and features a novel delivery fixation mechanism, specifically designed for this new approach to prevent perforation and dislodgement, while still permitting repositioning and capsule retrieval. AF Solutions grew over 20%, as we continue to gain share in the AF market. Results were driven by robust global growth of our Arctic Front Advanced CryoAblation System, which grew over 30%. Our phased RF product line also returned to double \u2013 digit growth, with the Q4 launch of PVC Gold in the international markets, and we are enrolling our US Pivotal study. Coronary revenue $446 million declined 2%, driven by growth in DES, offset by declines in bare \u2013 metal stents and renal denervation. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $288 million, including $99 million in the US and $33 million in Japan. Our DES business grew 2%, outperforming the market, as the Resolute Integrity drug \u2013 eluting stent continues to gain broad market acceptance. In the US, our DES share improved sequentially, despite a competitor's ongoing product launch. We also saw strong DES growth in Japan, as our long \u2013 link stents drove share gains. In structural heart, revenue of $237 million increased 9%, driven by growth from our CoreValve launch in the United States and continued growth of our transcatheter valve franchise in international markets. We estimate that the global TAVR market is growing in the high teens. In the US, we have had a strong initial launch with center activations tracking to our forecast. Now with the Edwards legal matters behind us, we expect revenue to continue to ramp, as we are able to open new centers and train physicians. High \u2013 risk data from our CoreValve US Pivotal trial were presented at ACC and simultaneously published in the New England Journal in March, showing CoreValve as the first and only TAVR system superior to open \u2013 heart surgery at one year. The FDA waived the need for a panel review, and now we expect US approval for high risk \u2013 patients this summer. In international markets, we are targeting the launch of the 26 and 29 mm versions of CoreValve Evolut R, our next \u2013 generation recapturable TAVI system with a 14 French equivalent delivery system, next spring. We also received IDE approval for our Evolut R US Pivotal study, which we expect to start enrolling this summer. In endovascular, revenue of $240 million grew 3%. Our aortic business had mid \u2013 single \u2013 digit global growth, with solid procedure growth in both the AAA with \u2013 within AAA and thoracic. We also had sequential global share gains in both AAA and thoracic, driven by the continued adoption of our market \u2013 leading Endurant II and Valiant Captivia stent grafts. Our peripheral business declined in the low single digits, as a result of the below \u2013 the \u2013 knee DCV voluntary product recall in Q3. After adjusting for the divestiture of our Pioneer Plus reentry catheter product line, as well as the impact from removing our below \u2013 the \u2013 knee DCV product from the market, our peripheral business grew in the mid \u2013 teens. At Charing Cross, pilot positive results from our IN. PACT Admiral SFA drug \u2013 coated balloon US Pivotal study showed a clinically driven TLR rate of 2.4% at 12 months and 360 \u2013 day primary patency of 89.8% for the treatment arm. IN. PACT DCBs for the SFA had strong double \u2013 digit international growth in Q4, and we continue to target US approval in Q1 FY16. Now turning to our restorative therapies group, revenues of $1.737 billion grew 2%. Results were driven by growth in surgical technologies and neuromodulation, offset by declines in spine. Spine revenue of $786 million declined 2%. Core spine revenue of $662 million was flat. Excluding BKP, our core spine business grew 1%. Both the global and US core spine markets appear relatively flat on a year \u2013 over \u2013 year basis, a slight deceleration from the growth the market saw last quarter. This was principally driven by the US, where we believe some elective surgeries were pulled forward ahead of the changes from the Affordable Care Act at the beginning of the calendar year. Our spine business continues to differentiate itself from the competition through our leading technology and procedural innovation, enhanced by our some surgical synergy program, which integrates enabling technologies, surgical tools, spinal implants, and our expertise. Hospitals are leveraging surgical synergy by adopting flexible integrated procedural solutions for spine surgery. They see clear value from improved surgical precision and more efficient procedures. This is resulting in solid growth in capital equipment sales in our surgical technologies business, as well as increased spinal implants growth. In fact, in accounts that have adopted our surgical synergy program, core spine revenue growth is meaningfully higher. Outside of the United States, our Kanghui acquisition continues to deliver solid revenue growth in the value segment of orthopedics, both in China and in other emerging markets. Turning to surgical technologies, revenue of $438 million grew 9%, with strong growth balanced across all three businesses. This was a solid performance off a very tough prior \u2013 year comparison. ENT grew in the high single digits, driven by upgrades of NIM ENT nerve monitoring and strength in the core ENT power systems. In neurosurgery, upper single \u2013 digit growth was driven by robust navigation sales of StealthStation S7, at seven, Midas Rex power equipment, and Strata vales. In advanced energy, strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue sealing and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies in the orthopedics, spine, breast and CRDM replacement markets, drove solid double \u2013 digit growth. In neuromodulation, revenue of $513 million increased 4%, driven by solid growth in DBS and pain stim. In DBS, our referral development program in the United States and the strength of the early stim data in international markets, which shows DBS provides superior benefits for patients with early motor complications from Parkinson's disease, continues to drive strong new implant growth. In pain stim, the ongoing launch of our SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system continues to garner positive feedback and drive sequential share gain. Our gastro \u2013 uro business declined in the low single digits in Q4. As Omar mentioned earlier, we believe a number of the procedures were delayed due to changes in patients' healthcare plans, but tests and implant trends improve as we moved through the quarter. In our diabetes group, revenue of $460 million grew 13%, driven by the ongoing US launch of the MiniMed 530G system, which includes the Enlite CGM sensor, a smaller, more comfortable, and more accurate sensor. This is the first and only system on the market that automatically stops insulin delivery if glucose levels fall below a predetermined threshold, an important step toward our goal of developing a fully automated artificial pancreas. Multiple peer review studies have demonstrated the value of our Threshold and Suspend feature, including publications in the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA. Since launching the MiniMed 530G system, we estimate we have gained over 500 basis points of US pump share and over 600 basis points of US CGM share. It is worth noting that we recognized in Q4 the final $4 million of deferred revenue from our technology guarantee program. Turning to the rest of the income statement, the Q4 gross margin was 74.4%. After adjusting for the $10 million non \u2013 GAAP adjustment from the restructuring charge, as well as the 20 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, the Q4 gross margin on a non \u2013 GAAP operational basis was 74.8%. Q4 was the first quarter to reflect the impact of the biannual R zone pricing adjustments in Japan, which as expected, negatively affected our gross margin. The gross margin also continues to include significant spending related to resources diverted to address quality issues in neuromodulation and diabetes, which negatively affected gross margin by 20 to 30 basis points all year. Looking ahead, we would expect the gross margin for FY15 to be in the range of 74.5 % to 75% on an operational basis, due to the ongoing quality spend. Fourth \u2013 quarter R&D spending of $385 million was 8.4% of revenue. We continue to invest in new technologies and evidence creation to drive future growth. We would expect R&D expense in FY15 to be around 8.5%, as we continue to see the impact from shifting R&D resources to resolve certain quality issues, which gets recognized in the cost of goods sold. Fourth \u2013 quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.539 represented 33.7% of sales. After adjusting for the 10 \u2013 basis \u2013 point negative impact from foreign exchange, Q4 SG&A was 33.6%. As Omar mentioned, this was higher than expected due to several one \u2013 time items, including the higher levels of legal spending in structural heart and spine; higher \u2013 than \u2013 expected incentive payments due to certain new product launches; and accelerated investments we made in the quarter to support future sales efforts of CoreValve, Reveal LINQ, and drug \u2013 coated balloons in the US. Even with the one \u2013 time nature of this incremental spending in Q4 and FY15, we are planning on delivering not only the 30 to 50 basis points of normal expected leverage, but also the 20 basis points of missing leverage from FY14. Taken together, this would result in FY15 SG& A in the range of 33.7 % to 33.9% and operating leverage of 50 to 70 basis points, both on an operational basis. Amortization expense for the quarter was $87 million. In FY15, we expect amortization expense to remain in the range of $85 million to $90 million per quarter. Net other expense for the quarter was $59 million, including net gains from our hedging programs of $6 million. We hedged the majority of our operating results and developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange; however, it is worth noting that there is a growing portion of our profits that is unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create some modest volatility in our earnings. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY15 net other expense to be in the range of $390 million to $430 million, which includes an expected $125 \u2013 million impact from the US medical device tax, an incremental $13 million over FY14; as well as increased royalty expense of $40 million to $50 million from the Edwards agreement. For Q1 FY15, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million, based on current exchange rates. Net interest expense for the quarter was $10 million. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $14.2 billion in cash and investments and $11.9 billion in debt, after issuing $2 billion of senior notes in February. Based on current rates, we would expect FY15 net interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. Our non \u2013 GAAP nominal tax rate in Q4 was 14.3%, translating into a full \u2013 year non \u2013 GAAP nominal tax rate of 18%. This was lower than the 19% and 20% we expected, due primarily to a favorable profit mix by jurisdiction, the impact of the actual foreign exchange rate fluctuations compared to forecast, and lower \u2013 than \u2013 projected effective tax rates of foreign subsidiaries on a US \u2013 dollar basis. For FY15, we expect an adjusted non \u2013 GAAP nominal tax rate to be back in the range of 18% to 20%, and we expect to be at the higher end of this range until the presently expired US R&D tax credit is reinstated. In Q4, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow, excluding the one \u2013 time items, to shareholders. In Q4, we paid $276 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of our common stock. As of the end of Q4, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 59 million shares. Fourth \u2013 quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.12 billion. It is important to note that the cash we received from stock option reductions, which was $251 million in Q4, will also continue to be used to repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. For FY15, we would expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 995 million shares, including approximately 1.3 billion shares in Q1. Let me conclude by commenting on our initial FY15 revenue outlook and earnings \u2013 per \u2013 share guidance. As Omar mentioned, we believe that constant \u2013 currency revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% is balanced and realistic for FY15. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact, if the exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY15 revenue would be positively affected by approximately $50 million to $90 million, including a positive $20 \u2013 million to $40 \u2013 million impact in Q1. Turning to the guidance on the bottom line, we believe it is reasonable to model earnings per share in the range of $4 to $4.10. Based on current exchange rates, this implies earnings \u2013 per \u2013 share growth in the range of 6% to 9% on a constant \u2013 currency basis, after taking into account the currently expected $0.05 to $0.07 negative foreign currency impact to earnings. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year. I will now turn it back over to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Gary. And before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by stating that we continue to strive to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations, which are consistent mid \u2013 single \u2013 digit currency \u2013 constant currency revenue growth, consistent EPS growth 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue on an operational basis, and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. We believe that our three growth vectors : new therapies, emerging markets, and our new independent services and solutions, will provide the fuel for mid \u2013 single \u2013 digit revenue growth. We expect our continued effort to deliver consistent and reliable performance combined with disciplined capital allocation will enable us to create long \u2013 term, dependable value in healthcare. Medtronic is uniquely positioned to lead the shift to value \u2013 based health care, directing our products and solutions to help providers, payers, and governments achieve their goals in driving more value into healthcare systems around the world. I am pleased with the early work we have done to establish our leadership position, and I look forward to sharing with you at our analyst meeting the opportunities we have ahead as we transform Medtronic from being primarily a device provider today into the premier global medical technologies solutions partner of tomorrow. With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I have asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group, and Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group, to join us again. We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and only one follow \u2013 up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds of Citigroup. Matthew Dodds : Good morning. Omar and Gary, first for you, on the SG&A, if you look at the reasons why it was higher, legal spending, that is hard to control. But incentive payments, accelerated investments, that does seem to be stuff you can control. So, can you give us more color \u2013 what happened, and how do you fix that in FY15 to get the leverage you've been talking about? Omar Ishrak : Yes, I think, Matt, let me take that first, and then maybe Gary can add on. Look, we have got a Company \u2013 first, I view that, like you point out, as controllable, and something that shouldn't happen \u2013 that kind of miss from a expected number and something that can be modeled. But we've got a Company with several layers of management. And although the targets are clear, there was a breakdown in our forecasting process, and, therefore, our control process. We are acting swiftly to plug that hole, and we'll do everything we can to avoid this in the future. But it really is a mismatch between our forecasting process and what we actually got. So, there was a breakdown there; that is all I can say. Gary Ellis : Yes, Matt, this is Gary. To add to what Omar said, you are absolutely right; it is controllable. We've looked back to make sure that \u2013 first of all, we want to make back \u2013 try to understand what did happen, and what caused it. And it's unfortunately a small amounts, but all over the Company that created some of it. Obviously, the legal was a little bit more isolated, but we just had a breakdown in basically forecasting and accruing on the incentives as we went through the year, and that caught us by surprise at the end of the quarter. That is controllable; it's something that we should be managing on a much tighter basis. We've communicated that clearly, effectively for the rest of the Organization, and that's why we are confident that, going forward, it is one \u2013 time, that we will get that leverage back. But we clearly lost it here in Q4 that we had not counted on, and that's unfortunate. That's something we need to manage better, and we put the steps in place to make sure that happens as we go forward. Matthew Dodds : And a quick one for Chris O'Connell, if possible. On OUS spine, Gary, I'm not sure if you said that the market US and OUS was flat. I was wondering if the OUS market in spine flat, Chris, or is it still growing? And then, what is the ASP rate in the US? Is it stable at down low \u2013 single digits? Chris O'Connell: Sure. The international markets are growing a little bit faster. Overall, worldwide, the market was flattish in the quarter. And you may recall in Q4 of last calendar year, the market seemed to accelerate a bit. I think we look across the last few quarters and see an overall spine market that's up in the 1% to 2% range in that period of time, with the US being flattish and international being up in the low \u2013 to mid \u2013 single digits. And certainly that's been \u2013 that represents a somewhat of an improvement pattern over the last four to six quarters. We are seeing market conditions very stable with some gradual improvement, principally coming out of the United States. Matthew Dodds : And then the US pricing range? Chris O'Connell: Yes. US pricing has been pretty stable, down in the low \u2013 to mid \u2013 single digits, which has been offset by mix. We continue to see favorable mix increase in spine. And so, relatively flat procedures, and price and mix offsetting each other. Matthew Dodds : Thanks, Chris. Thanks, Omar. Thanks, Gary. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs. Matt McDonough : Good morning. This is Matt McDonough in for David. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is on emerging markets. I was wondering if you could talk about your expectations for FY15? Given the improvement in the fourth quarter despite those headwinds in Russia and eastern Europe, I'm wondering if you see growth getting back to the high \u2013 teens, 20% level in 2015, if some of those headwinds normalize? Omar Ishrak : Yes, if the headwinds normalize, sure. That's certainly possible. We're trying to baseline this around the mid \u2013 teens; so, around 15% or so. And if those headwinds normalize, like you say, it'll go up from there. And in addition, we are putting together some of these initiatives, which we haven't fully baked into our projection, especially in terms of channel optimization, where there is margin, as well as revenue potential, and some major provider partnerships that we are also working on in self-pay markets around the world. So, we're doing everything we can to drive something above 15%, but given our history and given what we're learning, I think it's prudent to expect something in the mid \u2013 teens. Matt McDonough : Got it. Thank you. And then, maybe as a quick follow \u2013 up, I noticed that free cash flow growth seemed to outpace EPS growth pretty noticeably in the quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about some of those dynamics causing the delta in the growth rates? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Gary, you want to take that? Gary Ellis : Yes. This is Gary Ellis. Just quickly, what you \u2013 historically, you see is our fourth quarter \u2013 the free cash flow is much stronger than the earnings growth; vice versa our Q1 tends to be the other way around. The Q1 tends to be a little bit lower because that's when the incentive \u2013 plan payments, and a lot of the commissions and stuff like that, are being paid out. Those accumulate as we go through the year. So, by the time you get to the fourth quarter, we tend to see an improvement on receivables. We tend to see improvements on inventory levels, as people are focused on that. Not that they're not focused during the years, but there is major efforts across our Organization, and you're starting to see all of that benefit come forward into the fourth quarter. So, it's not unusual for our fourth \u2013 quarter free cash flow to be higher as the Company wraps up the fiscal year. And then Q1 tends to be the softer of all the quarters. So, it's historically the way we see it. Omar Ishrak : I will add, though, that I think our free \u2013 cash \u2013 flow performance for the year was good. I think we've had certain initiatives we put in place, like I've mentioned over the past several years that working capital is a big initiative for the Company. And I do think, as I mentioned in the commentary, that the teams are beginning to execute along those lines. Jeff Warren : Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Jeff Warren : Good morning, Mike. Mike Weinstein : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one is just \u2013 I want to understand the puts and takes of the US this quarter. It certainly looks like the pacemaker business was strong, maybe benefited from some stocking whereas the US ICD business hopes to be the reverse. Can you just comment a bit more on that? Omar Ishrak : Yes. I will let Mike Coyle comment on it. Go ahead, Mike. Mike Coyle : Sure, Mike. There wasn't much change in terms of the relative contribution of bulking versus run rate. In fact, there really wasn't any difference between those at all to speak of. What it comes down to is the product flow that we are seeing. So, on the low \u2013 power side, we are in a very virtuous product cycle right now, with the full \u2013 scan MRI labeling approval that we've received that's unique in the marketplace, as well as the fact that we showed some very interesting data around the use of reactive ATP to treat atrial fibrillation, with our Advisa MRI product line showing meaningful reductions in progression to permanent AF, as well as reductions in heart failure hospitalization, which is catching the attention of physicians. Probably most importantly was the release of the Reveal LINQ. That product has really taken off quite nicely. It offers not only the benefits relative to the old Reveal, of being a much smaller device that can be put in essentially subcutaneously quite easily, but it also allows the device to communicate to a bedside monitor on a 24 \u2013 hour basis without the patient having to interact with the device at all. And as a result, that, coupled with data from the CRYSTAL \u2013 AF study on cryptogenic stroke, has really provided a very nice catalyst and we account for those product revenues in the low \u2013 power product segment. On the high \u2013 power side, obviously, we have a different story in terms of the product cycle. We have, obviously, some pressure resulting from the presence of the quadripolar leads, now two competitors talking about quadripolar leads, whereas we are really trying to position against that with our \u2013 the AdaptivCRT algorithm that's unique to our device. That basically allows an elimination of forced R&D pacing in patients with intact AV conduction, which showed as meaningful reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure and progression in AF, which is something that we are beginning to get messaged at the HRS meeting. But we'll also, obviously, be supplementing our overall product offering with the TYRX approval that we have received, as well as we have submitted our own quadripolar lead, Performa lead, last month to FDA. The data looks excellent, and we would expect by the end of our fiscal year here, in the second half of the fiscal year, to have that approved in the US. And obviously, when you look outside the US, in places like Japan and Europe, we actually are getting very nice share traction in the high \u2013 power segment, where we have all of these products available to us. And really the US is the only place left where we don't have the quadripolar lead. So that's pretty much the status of our implantables business. Mike Weinstein : Okay. And then two quick follow \u2013 ups. Gary, can you talk a little bit about the driver of the tax rate moving down as much as it is, not only in the quarter, but obviously on an ongoing basis? And then, second, how does the settlement with Edwards impact your investment in the transcatheter valve space? It basically sounds like you have these minimum payments of $40 million to $60 million a year going forward. So you've got to cover those payments, so you might as well go ahead and invest in the business, and try and maximize your share as much as possible. Am I missing anything there? I want to understand how you were thinking about that business for you, now that you have this settlement in place. Thanks. Gary Ellis : Well, with respect to the settlement with Edwards, you're correct. The good news about settling this long \u2013 going patent litigation between ourselves and Edwards is now both of us can focus on growing the market and investing in growing the market versus investing in fighting each other. And so, yes, there is a royalty stream that we've agreed to. There's an upfront payment we've agreed to, but basically now \u2013 we've set things at the table; we know what the costs are related to that. And we can now continue to invest and drive the market going forward, which will benefit not only both of us, but benefit obviously the patients and the customers. So, we actually do think this is a positive for us. The royalty rates that we've agreed to, we feel are very good, that we can work within that as far as from an investment perspective going forward, and continue to invest in the technology overall. And the first question \u2013 I forgot again \u2013 was on what? Mike Weinstein : The tax. Gary Ellis : The tax, excuse me. On the tax decline, what we were expecting actually back in Q3, we actually had to increase the tax rate because we had some expectation that there was growing pressure on the tax rate based on what we were seeing in some of the US versus OUS split really in our profit picture. The reality is we looked at that at the end of the year. The split, where it was occurring was in Japan, the US, and some of the other OUS markets. It ended up being that we actually \u2013 there was \u2013 the actual tax rate itself was lower. And a lot of it gets back to \u2013 I won't get into all of the details, but it gets back to, for example, FX, especially in Japan. Even though Japan has been doing very well on a constant \u2013 currency basis, Japan, which is a high \u2013 tax jurisdiction, as you know, obviously on an as \u2013 reported basis with the currency being hit, obviously, is much lower overall as reported tax profits. And as a result of that, there is a benefit on the tax line. That's just one example. So, we were pleasantly surprised by that. We were not expecting that we would see much of a tax benefit. And, in fact, in Q3, we thought there was some pressure, but there ended up actually being a decline. So the 18% for the full year is consistent with what we saw last year for the full year also. As we go forward, we widen the range as a result of that. It's clear that 18% and 20% as we go forward because, obviously, the R&D tax credit is not renewed yet. But if that gets renewed, again, we are seeing that maybe we are experience a little bit lower tax rate at this point in time. Omar Ishrak : Maybe, Mike, I thought maybe Mike Coyle, who is in charge of making investments for the transcatheter valve, just say a few words about our focus on that technology. Mike Coyle : Sure, a couple of comments. First, we've been spending substantially on litigation expenses, which will now go away, which represents a good portion of what those minimum royalties are going to be. Secondly, if you think about the blended rates, and you'll run the numbers yourself, it certainly is a royalty that is consistent with, and probably in the end, less than what we pay on resolute integrity, for example, going forward. So we have substantial capacity in a market that was $1.1 billion in our last fiscal year, growing at 20% \u2013 plus, to be able to handle the royalty component here. But we are aggressively investing in the pipeline. Obviously, we were very pleased with the data coming out of the high \u2013 risk cohort. We have the Evolut R product line that is in clinical studies for CE Mark right now. We've received conditional approval to begin here in the Summer, the US clinical trial on Evolut R with its improvements to design and capturability. And we believe that those product lines are going to give us an opportunity to continue to drive share. And, obviously, we have a very active program in the Micra space that we continue to focus on, in addition to just continued improvements in the delivery systems associated with our core product line. So we view this as one of the most attractive markets in the cardiovascular space going forward, and we intend to drive leadership. And this settlement will only put us in a position to do that more effectively. Mike Weinstein : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could provide any additional details. Mike, I know you were talking about the patent settlement, but are there any conditions in terms of the number of centers that you can expand upon? Or do you really now have freedom to operate as you would like? Obviously, the conditions of CMS is very different. But in terms of the number of centers, is there anything with patent settlement that limits that? Mike Coyle : Nothing in the agreement would limit us from being able to expand centers, expand training. So, this is a freedom \u2013 to \u2013 operate agreement. And obviously, we are paying a lot for that, but we're also now getting complete freedom to drive adoption of the CoreValve technology in the US and globally. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then, regarding the drug \u2013 coated balloon panel \u2013 Bard is going to have there's on June 12. Any updates on timing of when you guys would expect that panel, or if you have submitted all of the final modules with the PMA? Mike Coyle : Where we sit on the drug \u2013 coated balloon is the fourth and final module, which is the clinical module we expect to submit to FDA in the first half of June. We take the addition of Bard's drug \u2013 coated balloon product to the panel here in June 12 or 10 or whatever it is, to be a positive for us from the standpoint that there has not been a panel review on drug \u2013 coated balloon technology. And so, having that take place sooner rather than later is a good thing. We have, in the past, been able to, when we have strong data, use the fact that those data conform to the questions raised during the panel to avoid panels going forward. That, of course, will be up to the FDA. But we think having a panel for drug \u2013 coated balloon technology for SFA sooner rather than later is a good thing for the timing of our release in the US. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then a big \u2013 picture question for Omar. How are you thinking about M&A these days? We've certainly been seeing a little bit more increased activity across the space. Do you feel like you have the right products and exposure to different end markets to really, truly get to that mid \u2013 single \u2013 digit constant \u2013 currency growth rate you strive for over the longer term? Or should we expect to see a little bit more increase in M&A activity? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : I think, Kristen, look, our philosophy around that has not changed. We've got certain \u2013 our big, core market segments in cardiovascular and restorative therapies, which includes neuromusculoskeletal, that's the way we refer to it, and surgical technologies, as well as diabetes, and a broader look at diabetes. And those are the three core areas. We intend to fill those areas out opportunistically over time, either organically or inorganically. And at the same time, we intend to invest in building out our services and solutions areas, as well as value products in emerging markets. So those are the areas of priorities for M&A. We will do M& A transactions. I think our overall goal \u2013 and there are always exceptions under certain circumstances, but our overall goal of trying to provide a non \u2013 dilutive impact of these \u2013 of the inorganic growth is still there. And we hold ourselves accountable to execute and deliver on what we said, both in EPS and the top line. And we will do M&A accordingly. Jeff Warren : Next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Gary, could we come back to margin for a quick second here? And if you think about the last two years, I think we are seeing a consistent trend where GMs are slightly declining, but R&D is also coming down as you re \u2013 prioritize. And I wonder, if we think about 2015, maybe talk about that trend. But also the quality issues you have talked about several quarters now on GM, we thought those issues were beginning to alleviate here heading into 2015. So can you quantify what those issues were, the magnitude in 2014 \u2013 what magnitude drifts into 2015? And as you think about that 8.5% R&D you're saying for 2015, is that the new normal for Medtronic, or can that number still come down as you re \u2013 prioritize? Gary Ellis : Well, as we indicated in the commentary, and as you said, David, obviously, over especially this last year, one of the things we've indicated is on the \u2013 that there's a 20 to 30 basis points of hit that we've taken on the OPC line, what we call the product cost line and our cost of sales that relates to basically quality measures that were taken into place, both especially in neuro and diabetes here in the Organization. That has required actually that those costs actually \u2013 our engineers, et cetera, who are down \u2013 who typically are doing R&D types of projects, who have had to be re \u2013 tasked to basically address past quality documentation types of issues or remediation in our product portfolio within neuro and diabetes. And that's so that since they're not doing R&D work, they are focused on quality. It gets re \u2013 classed out of R&D up into OPC. And so that's why the 8.5%, or 8.4% or 8.5% for the year has been a little bit lower, and we are forecasting that that will continue. As Omar said in his comments, right now, based on what we know, we had hoped that the neuro and diabetes quality issues would be behind us. I think diabetes is getting close. But neuro, we're assuming that basically these ongoing expenses probably continue at least through FY15, that towards the end of FY15 they maybe start to taper off. But we'll have those for the full \u2013 another full year, as we go through that warning letter, addressing the issues in the warning letter for neuro. So in our guidance of 74.5% to 75% going forward, we're basically saying we're not going to see that gross margin jump back up yet here in FY15, because we are still expecting the quality cost to be included in OPC. And we are still expecting our R&D to be down at that 8.5% level as a result of that. Once we get through FY15 and get these warning letters addressed and the quality matters all documented and complete address, then we would expect to go back to a little bit more normal rates. But it's taking us a little bit longer, especially on the neuro warning letter than what we had originally expected to get those costs back in line. Omar Ishrak : I also want to make a comment on the R&D. Look, at the end of the day, we are responsible for certain operating leverage overall, which depends on how much revenue we generate, and we hold ourselves accountable for that. At the same time, we also hold ourselves accountable to build a pipeline of technologies organically, as well as inorganically but funded, so that we can be assured that we can continue to be market leaders in the long term. And so we keep both of these things in mind as we make trade \u2013 offs. And I think you'll agree that over the past four years, past couple of years, yes, R&D spending has been down, but our productivity in terms of the growth that you have seen has certainly been there, compared to where it was before. So R&D, we don't just look at a number and say that is what we will do. We look at the quality of the programs we will invest in, their return rates, our short \u2013 and long \u2013 term pipeline; and based on that, we make intelligent decisions. David Lewis : Okay. Very helpful. And then, Mike, a quick follow \u2013 up on your commentary on the US defib market. I thought I heard you mention that it's really all about product cadence for both your pacer business obviously, and for defib, and that makes sense to us. You also mentioned that there are two players in the US now with quad access in CRTD. I think I heard you correctly. Does that imply that you do believe that second entrant into the market for CRTD in the US, who only has a can, are you expecting that to be a significant impact on the Business here in the US over the next couple of quarters? Thank you. Mike Coyle : My point was you have two different companies now talking about quadripolar technology as being something that they should be interested in using with their patients. And obviously, we are positioning our AdaptivCRT and its proven benefits in terms of heart failure re \u2013 hospitalization reduction and progression to AF reduction as proven alternative to that. Right now, unfortunately, physicians have to choose between those two things, but as soon as we get our approval in the US for the quadripolar lead, then we will have both of those things and nobody else will. So that was my only point. Jeff Warren : Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Omar Ishrak : Yes, we can. Bob Hopkins : Great. So a follow \u2013 up on that for my first question. Mike or Omar, I would love you to comment on what you are seeing in terms of US ICD market trends? Obviously, things have looked a little bit weaker here than we would have thought. Is that a pricing issue? Is that a units issue? If it's units, what do you think is going on there? So a comment on the US ICD market would be great. Omar Ishrak : Go ahead, Mike. Mike Coyle : So basically, since the 1st of the calendar year, we did see some slowing in terms of overall procedure volumes, and that applies to both pacing and ICDs, but it's modest in terms of the slowing. In ICDs, it is mostly replacement cycle that is here; in pacing, it looks more like initials, but those have dropped 1 point or 2 in terms of overall growth. Pricing is pretty stable in the low single \u2013 digit declines for both. And of course on the pacing side, we now \u2013 or the low power side, we now have the addition of the new growth vector in predictive diagnostics, which would be a link to offset that. So that pretty much is the dynamic that we are seeing. Bob Hopkins : Okay. And then I wanted to follow \u2013 up on the comments on the M&A, and Omar, this is a question for you. I wanted to comment in your confidence in Medtronics M&A process. In light of what's going on with Ardian and how CoreValve has given the prices you paid and now this settlement, that makes the initial price paid almost twice what you originally thought. I'm curious \u2013 does that impact your willingness to pursue technology and growth acquisitions? Are you confident in Medtronics process? And again, how does that impact the way you think about potential deal activity in 2015 and beyond? Omar Ishrak : Look, I'm very confident in Medtronic's process. And over the past three years, the acquisitions that we've done have delivered, and we've executed on them. In terms of both Ardian and CoreValve, first of all Ardian. Like I said at the ACC, look, this comes with the territory. You do clinical trials for a reason, and every so often, you are going to get negative results. And we don't give up on strategic opportunities based on that. We continue to strive on them, because we believe in the long \u2013 term need for that kind of therapy. We would have done that acquisition over again based on the data that we had at that time, and I think our team is highly qualified for that. And I actually complement our team \u2013 our Ardian team for executing to the clinical trial probably better than anyone else. So I have complete confidence in our ability to follow \u2013 up on what we say we will do. We got to accept in our modeling that some of these acquisitions may not turn out the way we want it to because of the inherent risk involved. And we have to model that in our overall mapping of opportunities. And in terms of CoreValve, yes, sure, it was a surprise, but I think actually, the overall rate of return, even including the payments that we have to make, is still in the double digits \u2013 in the teens actually. So I think CoreValve overall, again, it's \u2013 I would do over and over again. We're extremely excited about truly groundbreaking clinical results that we are getting with this. And in terms of our mission, what it does to extend life of people, what it means to us, I think that's one that we will do over again. And we will find a way to front. Jeff Warren : Thanks. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Actually I wanted to start with Mike on Reveal LINQ. And then I had one follow \u2013 up on tax. Mike, how big can Reveal LINQ be, and why \u2013 how quickly do you think it will ramp? And then are there any reimbursement issues we should be aware of? It seems based on the feedback at HRS, it was one of the products that physicians were most excited about, and that seems to be an important growth driver for you guys in FY15. Mike Coyle : Larry, we're going to spend some time on this topic at the analyst meeting, because it is something that we haven't really focused a lot on in commentary. I would just say there are multiple applications for these kinds of implantable loop recorders, not only in syncope, which has been the traditional market here, but we also talked about cryptogenic stroke, it's use in AF management, and the fact that we've now mooshed with technology that is so much more attractive to patients, as well as to physicians, in terms of its size, it's ease of implant, and its ability to, without patient interaction, provide a very strong diagnostic analysis, is really creating a new opportunity within this segment. We've always had the Reveal product, but it was more of a pacemaker size implant and procedure. Now we have something that we think is much more attractive to patients and physicians for use in their diagnosis and in the areas that I talked about. We very much consider this a growth driver on scale with our AF investments, in terms of its potential for return. And we'll talk a little bit more about that at the analyst meeting in a couple weeks. Larry Biegelsen : I wanted to ask one on the tax rate. Gary, can you talk about what your guidance assumes for the R&D tax credit in calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015? Because I'm asking because if the R&D tax credit reenacted for calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015, if they reenact it for two years, is it possible that your FY15 guidance would benefit from two years of the R&D tax credit, or roughly $0.08, versus I think $0.00 in FY14? So if you could clarify what your guidance assumes and what the benefit could be, that would be helpful. Thank you. Gary Ellis : The R&D tax credit expired as of December 2013, so we did have eight months of benefit of the R&D ax credit in FY14. And so, it's not $0 in FY14. Going forward, it's hard to say what the government will do on this. Typically, when they do extend it, they extended for a year or two, and so you do have a catch up when that occurs. Our assumption right now, and that's why we have a little bit of a broader range, obviously, on the 18% to 20%. If the R&D credit is not renewed, you would probably be obviously towards the higher end of that range. If it gets renewed, back to your point, with some, in effect, catch \u2013 up from the prior years, that's when the lower end of the range would obviously come into effect. And so the range we've given, in effect, tries to bracket around where do we think the R&D tax credit end up being. But it's not quite as extensive as you indicated, because there was eight months of benefit in our FY14. But we could end up, back to point, assuming it's renewed for all of that, you could end up with 16 months of benefits in FY15, assuming it's renewed. Jeff Warren : Thanks, Larry. We've gone past the top of the hour. We've got time for \u2013 we'll squeeze in two last questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy of Jefferies. Raj Denhoy : Hi. Good morning. I wonder if I could spend a minute on the spine business. It still remains a bit of a headwind, in a sense, or an anchor on you getting back to that mid \u2013 single \u2013 digit revenue growth target. When do you imagine you might be able to see some better performance out of this? When INFUSE could stabilize, or some of the new products might start to contribute? Some view on the outlook would be helpful. Omar Ishrak : Chris, you go ahead. INFUSE stabilization is obviously a big, big driver, so that's one piece. Chris O'Connell: Sure, thank you for the question. We've obviously been suffering through some declines in INFUSE and BKP over the past couple years, and let me quickly address those, because we've been working very hard to try to stabilize, and actually as we look forward, we think there is a very nice story developing. Obviously after the Yale publication on INFUSE last summer, we saw some softening and confusion following that. But now that the market has digested that information, we've actually seen three quarters in a row of sequential stability, which we believe points to a pattern of stability heading into next fiscal year. And so, it's our goal to see the overall INFUSE program be somewhat flattish over the next year. We are also seeing some nice encouraging trends in BKP, principally in the US. As we've continued to diversify our product line and as we look to build a bigger platform of interventional spine off our core Kyphon business, and again, our business has been relatively stable now sequentially for three or four quarters in a row, and we expect that to be somewhat flattish as we head into next year, as well. So if we get BMP and BKP to be flat, then you're going to see the overall spine franchise lift, as our course spine business has actually been reasonably stable over the past four or five quarters with some modest growth in that business. And as I pointed out earlier, the markets are stable and we believe gradually improving in core spine. And so our expectation is that the overall spine franchise continues its transition to positive growth for our overall \u2013 for the overall business. Raj Denhoy : Just a follow \u2013 up on that \u2013 would it be unwise to think about spine in aggregate being positive in terms of growth for 2015? Or is that a bit premature? Chris O'Connell: It's certainly my expectation to see modest positive contribution from spine next year. Raj Denhoy : Okay. Thank you. Jeff Warren : One last question. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital. Joanne Wuensch : Can you hear me okay? Omar Ishrak : Sure. We can. Yes. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you so much. Two strategic questions, please. One is, we are hearing or seeing actually, more companies repatriate OUS cash to reuse it in a better way. Although I do applaud you paying before the Edwards litigation out of OUS cash. Can you give me a view on how you are thinking about that? And then my second question is we've had a couple questions on this call about M&A, but we are also continuing to see companies split \u2013 spin out different divisions. And, Omar, now that you've been there for three years, what is your current thinking on that? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Sure. Thank you. Let me take the second one first. Like I've said before, we are focused around our three strategic clinical areas : cardiovascular, restorative therapies, and diabetes. And in each of those areas, we need to fill out. To the degree that things don't fit in those core areas or don't have any technology linkages with them, and we don't think we can win those markets, they are opportunities for spin outs. And although we haven't done any recently, I can assure you that we constantly look at that, and those will happen over time, but they will fit into a strategic framework. So that's the way we look at that. And the strategic markets that we're going after, as well as the globalization of those markets, and addressing those markets across the continuum of care is the way we look at this. So from an M&A perspective, I would expect us to add more to that rather than (inaudible). But to the degree that things don't fit, sure we'll take those actions and we do look at that regularly. From a overseas cash perspective, I'll let Gary talk about it. We are certainly constrained to a degree there. But Gary, you want to? Gary Ellis : Yes. Again, obviously, as you indicated, Joanne, all US headquarter multinational companies run into this situation that is we accumulate cash outside of the United States, and it's very expensive to bring it back into the US. So we are all constantly trying to figure out ways to effectively utilize that cash as we go forward, and so that's always a challenge for a company like Medtronic. As you indicated, the settlement with Edwards is such that we will be using OUS cash to pay for that, because as you recall, we actually used OUS cash to buy CoreValve originally. So it is viewed as an OUS entity, and we'll use OUS cash to pay for the settlement. The idea of actually bringing back cash and paying the penalty right now, we are not looking at doing that. And I think most companies who have done that have done that for basically, if they needed to for various reasons. And unless you need to, if you can continue to borrow and have effective use of that, it financially does not pay. So there is no incentive at all for us right now to bring back that cash and pay the type of penalty we would have to pay in additional taxes. So we have enough flexibility with our cash generation and our debt, such that we continue to do our capital allocation as we've discussed up to this point in time. So we have no expectation of making any change to that. Jeff Warren : Thank you Joanne. Omar Ishrak : Thank you. Okay. Thank you, everyone, for your questions. And before concluding, I'd like to remind you that we will host our investor conference in two weeks in June the 5th in New York. We look forward to discussing in more detail the progress that we're making at Medtronic. And I would also note that we anticipate holding our Q1 earnings call on August 19. And with that and on behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the Medtronic fourth \u2013 quarter earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Warren. Please go ahead sir. Jeff Warren : Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2015 first quarter which ended July 25, 2014. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Also, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. And finally, today\u2019s earnings call does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval. In connection with the proposed Covidien transaction, Medtronic Holdings Limited has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a preliminary joint proxy statement of Medtronic Inc. and Covidien plc that also constitutes our preliminary perspectives of new Medtronic. The registration statement is not complete and will be further amended. After the registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC, the final joint proxy statement perspectives will be mailed to Medtronic shareholders and Covidien shareholders. You should review materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information about regarding post transaction including information about Medtronic and Covidien, the respective directors, executive officers and certain other members of management and employees who may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxy in favor of the proposed transaction. Please also review the disclaimer page at globalmedtechleader.com for additional information on forward-looking statements and other important information on the proposed transaction. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported first quarter revenue of $4.3 billion, which represents growth of 4% and Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93, growing 6%. Our Q1 revenue growth is in the middle of our outlook range for the year and within our mid-single-digit baseline goal. Our overall organization again delivered balanced growth with strong performances in some areas offsetting challenges in other parts of our business. Significant this quarter was our performance in the U.S. where we grew 6%, the highest growth in this region for five years. We believe mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. can be sustained over the coming quarters based on the momentum of our new products. Therapy innovation contributed over half of our global growth this quarter. When combined with our focus on globalization and economic value, further enhanced by our pending acquisition of Covidien, we are well positioned to further improve our competitive position and long-term growth profile. As we have done previously, we intend to quantify, communicate, and execute in each of our independent growth vectors. Our new therapies growth vector contributed 200 basis points to our overall growth in Q1, which was well within our previously stated expectations of 150 basis points to 350 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, execution on several key new product launches helped drive growth this quarter. And looking ahead, we believe our robust pipeline will contribute significantly to our future growth. Starting with the cardiac and vascular group, our Reveal LINQ miniaturized cardiac diagnostic monitor along with strong above-market performance in AF Solutions are driving clear growth acceleration. This helps propel our cardiac rhythm and heart failure business to 4% growth, a level of performance that we have generally not seen since the core implantables markets slowed down four years ago. Over the past few years, the cardiac rhythm and heart failure team has systematically executed on a strategic plan delivering multiple new attractive growth drivers, including AF and heart failure management products and services, predictive diagnostics and deep miniaturization technologies. All of these growth drivers are clearly resonating in the marketplace more than offsetting pricing pressures in the more mature parts of the business. Another highlight in Q1 was the strong execution by our structural heart team on the ongoing U.S. launch of CoreValve transcatheter valve. With the patent dispute behind us, our team is now laser focused on what really matters ensuring more patients have access to this life-saving therapy. The early results have exceeded expectations as we have been aggressively opening new accounts and have captured over 40% of the U.S. market in just two quarters of launching CoreValve. Looking ahead in our Cardiac and Vascular group, we will launch our recently approved Attain Performa quadripolar lead system in the U.S. in the next few weeks, which coupled with our proven AdaptiveCRT algorithm, is expected to improve while U.S. High Power share as it already has in Europe and Japan. We also continue to make progress in a number of other meaningful products in our pipeline, including our SEEQ cardiac diagnostic patch, CoreValve Evolut R Transcatheter Valve, Resolute Onyx drug eluting stent, IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon, and Micra leadless pacemaker. It is worth noting that in Q1, we realigned our four CVG businesses into three business units organized around disease states with a specific focus on comprehensive disease management. These changes allow us to better capitalize on important trends in our global markets, including the general trend among global reimbursement models to focus increasingly on disease outcomes versus discrete episodes of care, the growing importance of longitudinal patient management in the cardiac rhythm and heart failure space, the increasing level of collaboration between physician specialties and the newly formed heart teams in the coronary and structural heart market, and finally the growing focus on new technologies for peripheral vascular disease management in the aortic and peripheral market. Turning now to our Restorative Therapies group, strong growth in neuromodulation and solid performance of surgical technologies offset modest decline in spine. In neuromodulation, the RestoreSensor SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system and Activa DBS system continued to drive growth. We also saw resurgence of growth in Gastro/Uro due to improved procedure volumes. In surgical technologies, our team has balanced performance across ENT, Neurosurgery, and Advanced Energy. We are excited about the recently launched NuVent sinus balloon system. NuVent marks our first entry into the attractive sinus balloon dilation market, and we expect it to steadily take share in what is currently a $200 million opportunity. We also strengthened the breadth of our neurosurgical portfolio through the acquisition of Visualase last month. Visualase\u2019s MRI guided laser ablation technology is an important addition to our portfolio of therapies for neurosurgeons and broadens our overall market leading RTG neuroscience portfolio. In spine, while revenue declined 3%, we believe factors weighing on Q1 were temporary and our plan to return to growth in FY15 remains on track. Spine\u2019s overall performance in Q1 was primarily affected by U.S. core spine which faced short-term pressure from inventory rebalancing and the timing of new product launches. In addition to our recently approved PRESTIGE LP artificial cervical disc, we are expecting to completely refresh our anterior cervical plate portfolio and launch new interbodies with advanced materials and functionality over the coming quarters. Our spine performance was also affected by year-over-year decline in BMP. However, we have not seen four quarters of sequential stability and underlying demand for BMP, which should provide easier comparisons starting in Q2. In diabetes, the strong U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G system with Enlite is driving solid double-digit growth in both insulin pumps and CGM. Our focus in selling and supporting the pump and sensor as an integrated system is translating into global share gains in insulin pumps and U.S. share gains in CGM. The MiniMed 530G is the only system in the market that automatically stops insulin delivery if glucose levels fall below a predetermined threshold, an important step towards our goal of developing a fully automated artificial pancreas. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated the value of our threshold suspend feature including publications in the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA. Looking ahead, we are preparing to launch the MiniMed 640G and MiniMed 620G in international markets in Q2. Our next growth vector, emerging markets contributed 130 basis points to our overall Company growth, which fell 20 basis points short of our minimum 150 basis points expectations. The main issues this quarter were in China and India. Our Greater China region grew 6% as we dealt with some near term challenges in the distributed channel and management changes. We expect China to quickly return to double-digit growth for the remainder of the fiscal year. India also had a difficult quarter declining 7% as we face disruption from distributor terminations and inventory rebalancing. We\u2019re executing a definite plan for optimizing our India distributor channels, but this will take the remainder of the fiscal year before we return to double-digit growth. In both India and China, we are developing direct partnerships with healthcare providers of all sizes. In the long term, this will result in the highest levels of business conduct standards, give us more direct contact with our end customers, and unlock significant margins. While India and China fell below expectations, our Middle East and Africa region continues to be an impressive source of emerging market growth with the result up 30% in Q1. We have a strong strategic plan in EMEA executing on both large tender wins as well as Channel optimization opportunities. Latin America also had a good Q1 with strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Columbia and Mexico. And in our Central and Eastern Europe region we were encouraged to see that Russia return to growth in Q1. Despite the short term challenges in certain regions, we remain confident and enthusiastic in the long term outlook of emerging markets. We continue to focus in developing new public-private partnerships. For example, I was recently in China finalizing an agreement with a large sub-province. Over the past nine months, we met frequently with local government officials there, quickly aligning around the need to dramatically increase access to Hemodialysis therapy. Our discussions resulted in the comprehensive partnerships whereby we will manufacture Medtronic Hemodialysis products locally in return for manufacturing and commercial incentives including guaranteed purchases and support for accelerated regulatory approvals. As we execute in these public and private partnerships, as well as market development and channel optimization strategies, we expect our emerging market growth to steadily improve and consistently contribute to 150 basis points to 200 basis points to our overall growth. Finally, services solutions are third growth factor, contributed 50 basis points to our overall growth which is within the 40 basis points to 60 basis points annual range that we have targeted. Our Cath Lab Managed services business continues to grow in Europe with numerous long term contract representing over $0.5 million of revenue. We continue to grow this business both within Europe and in other regions around the world and are in discussions with an additional 150 healthcare systems. Our Cardiocom business also continues to deliver strong results, driven in part by growth of over 50% in patient access support services for providers. We view Cardiocom as an important healthcare services platform to deliver comprehensive integrated care solutions in the future. Turning to the P&L, we made appropriate business trade outs in Q1 to deliver on the bottom line. Non-GAAP EPS growth was approximately 200 basis points above our revenue growth in line with our targeted expectations. In addition, we delivered $1 billion of free cash flow in Q1 after adjusting for certain litigation payments. And we increased our dividend by 9%. We remain focused in reliably delivering on our base line financial model, mid-single digit revenue growth, EPS growth 200 basis points to 400 basis points faster than revenue growth and returning 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. To achieve these goals, we\u2019ve continued to execute on our three primary strategies; therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value. We believe the Covidien acquisition will accelerate these strategies, bolstering our long term market competitiveness as well as the sustainability and consistency of our financial performance. In therapy innovation, Covidien\u2019s impressive array of industry leading products enhances our existing portfolio, offers greater breadth across clinical areas and create exciting entry points into promising new diagnostic therapies. We believe Medtronic\u2019s deep clinical regulatory reimbursement and market development expertise will help accelerate the rapid adoption in markets around the world. Our globalization strategy will also benefit from the power of our combined companies. From a financial perspective, we will have a $3.7 billion emerging markets business that we are confident can sustain double-digit growth over an extended period of time. Covidien has extensive emerging market R&D and manufacturing while Medtronic has well established clinical expertise. These capabilities applied across a much broader product offering will significantly increase the number of attractive solutions that we can offer to governments and major providers. Finally, this transaction enhances Medtronic\u2019s ability to deliver economic value to a broader range of stakeholders. The value proposition of Covidien\u2019s technologies primarily delivers hospital efficiency. While the value of Medtronic\u2019s chronic disease therapies are generally realized in post-acute settings. When combined, these complementary solutions will create a robust and unmatched integrated health franchise. We feel that our industry leading products, clinical economic expertise, global footprint and financial strength will position us to be the preferred partner for physicians, hospital systems, patients, payers and governments around the world. In addition to being highly strategic, the Covidien acquisition is also extremely attractive financial with achievable cost synergies that are expected to make the transaction accretive in the first year on a cash basis and within two years on a GAAP basis. The combined company will also generate significant free cash flow which can be deployed with much greater flexibility. While there has been a lot of media and political noise about inversions, let me clarify that when the transaction closes, Medtronic will continue to pay significant U.S. taxes and increase our investments in the U.S. On taxes we will continue to pay federal, state and local income taxes on all U.S. earnings as well as our social security taxes, property taxes and the medical device tax. Cumulatively, these taxes represent more than 45% of U.S. income and we expect to pay a similar rate post close. In addition, this transaction will put us in an even playing field with foreign companies regarding use of internationally generated profits. This structure will allow us to invest much more aggressively in the U.S. and based on that we have committed to investing in incremental $10 million over the next 10 years. These investments will result in more high-paying U.S. job. We have a proven track record of creating U.S. jobs with our past acquisitions. For example, with Sofamor Danek, AVE and MiniMed, we have created nearly 10,000 U.S. jobs since acquisition. More recently with Cardiocom, we have more than doubled the work force in just 12 months. We also expect additional job creation with our recently completed acquisitions of Visualase and Corventis, two U.S. based companies. Our level of U.S. job creation will only accelerate following this transaction. In our view, acquiring Covidien is good for Medtronic, for our shareholders, for patients and for the med-tech industry and ultimately good for the U.S. economy. We remain fully committed to the Covidien transaction which we expect to close in calendar fourth quarter of 2014 or early 2015. Our integration planning efforts are well underway led by Geoff Martha who is reporting directly to me. The integration team is staffed with top talent from both Covidien and Medtronic and they are actively developing our comprehensive integration planning. In the end, we understand the success of this transaction will depend on our ability to execute this integration plan upon closure. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our quarterly results. Gary? Gary Ellis : Thanks, Omar. First quarter revenue of $4.273 billion increased 5% as reported or 4% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for a $34 million favorable impact of foreign currency. Q1 revenue results by region were as follows; Growth in the Middle East and Africa was 30%; Latin American grew 14%; Growth in U.S. was 6%; Greater China grew 6%; Growth in Central and Eastern Europe was 5%; Other Asia Pacific group 4%; with Western Europe and Canada region declining 2%; Japan declined 5% and South Asia declined 7%. Emerging markets grew a combined 11% in Q1 and represented 13% of our total sales mix. It is worth noting that results in Western Europe were negatively affected by our difficult comparison in Germany where customers made advanced purchases of CoreValve product in Q1 last fiscal year in anticipation of the since resolved CoreValve injunction. Japan\u2019s performance was also affected by difficult comparisons from strong product launches in the prior year as well as the biennial R zone adjustments. Q1 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.93, an increase of 6%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.87, a decrease of 6%, driven primarily by the favorable change in fair value of contingent consideration payments in the prior year. This quarter\u2019s GAAP to non-GAAP pretax adjustments included a $30 million net restructuring charge, the final charge related to the initiative we announced last quarter and a $41 million charge for acquisition related items primarily associated with transaction cost in connection with the pending Covidien acquisition. It is worth noting that on a cash basis, Q1 diluted earnings per share were $0.99, an increase of 5%. In our cardiac and vascular group, revenue of $2.254 billion grew 3%, results were driven by growth in low power, structural heart, aortic and peripheral and AF and other partially offset by declines in high power and coronary. In Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure formerly known as CRDM, revenue of $1.256 billion grew 4% and included $19 million of combined revenue from our Q2 acquisition of Cardiocom and Q3 acquisition of TYRX. High power revenue of $627 million declined 5%. As we have noted over the last several quarters, we believe the best way to view the high and low power markets is on a rolling two quarter basis given the variability and quarter-to-quarter dynamics. We estimate that the global high power market growth profile is flat to slightly down with low single digit-growth in international markets offsetting low single-digit declines in the U.S. We estimate we gained about a 1 point of international market share on a rolling two quarter sequential basis, driven by the success of our Attain Performa quadripolar CRT-D lead system which was offset by CRT-D share loss in the U.S. Our U.S. growth is also affected by difficult comparisons given where we are in our high power replacement cycle. Going forward, we expect our U.S. High Power performance to improve as we launch the recently approved d Attain Performa system into the U.S. market during Q2. This system was differentiated AdaptiveCRT algorithm has performed very well in international markets. In fact the markets where we have launched the Attain Performa system are CRT-D share is up a 160 basis points. Low Power revenue of $525 million up 10% driven by the strong global launch of Reveal LINQ in our diagnostics business. In June, data from the CRYSTAL AF trial were published in the New England Journal, which showed our Reveal monitor detected AF better compared to our standard care in patients with recent cryptogenic strokes. We continue to make progress on our global clinical trial for Micra. And expect CE mark by the end of this fiscal year with U.S. approval to follow in FY \u201917. Micra, the world\u2019s smallest leadless pacemaker is a true innovation in pacing and features a novel delivery in fixation mechanism specifically designed for this new approach to prevent perforation and dislodgement while still permitting repositioning in capsule retrieval. Recently, at Cardiostim, one and three-month data were presented on the first patients to receive Micra showing successful implants in all patients with no major post-implant device related complications. AF solutions grew over 30% as we continue to gain share in the AF market. Results were driven by robust growth of the Arctic Front Advance CryoAblation system which grew over 30% as well as strong double-digit growth from the international launch of our PVAC Gold Phased RF System. We continue to enroll VICTORY AF, our U.S. pivotal study of phased RF technologies in patients with persistent AF. In our coronary and structural heart business which is the consolidated legacy coronary and structural heart business unites revenue of $766 million grew 1%. Coronary declined 2% although this performance was above market driven by 2% growth in drug eluting stents on the continued strength of our Resolute Integrity DES. Worlwide DES revenue in the quarter was $279 million, including $101 million in the United States and $24 million in Japan. In the U.S., our DES share remains stable sequentially at approximately 30% despite the competitors\u2019 ongoing product launch. Reported revenues in our structural heart business grew 6%. However, after adjusting for the difficult TAVR comparisons in Germany that I mentioned earlier, our structural heart business grew in the upper teens, driven by exceptional performance from our transcatheter valves. Making the same adjustment, we estimate that the global TAVR market is growing around 30% including over 30% growth in the U.S. Our global transcatheter valve revenue in the quarter was $131 million. The U.S. launch of CoreValve is proceeding extremely well with our U.S. share exceeding 40% in the second quarter of the launch. We received FDA approval for high risk patients in June adding to the extreme risk indemnification we received in late Q3. Our team is aggressively activating new centers with a presence now in a 160 U.S. centers well ahead of our original plans. In international, we have completed enrollment in our CoreValve Evolut R CE mark trial and are expecting approval of this differentiated next generation recapturable system with its 14-French equivalent delivery system later this fiscal year. In addition, we expect to start enrolling U.S. IDE study for Evolut R later this summer, a 250 patient single-arm study with 30-day follow-up. In our Aortic and Peripheral business, formerly known as endovascular, revenue of $232 million grew 5% or 7% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Pioneer Plus product line and the voluntary product recall of the below the knee DCB. Aortic revenues grew 7% as our market leading Endurant II and Valiant Captivia stent grafts have each gained 2 points of share in the AAA and thoracic markets respectively. Reported revenues for our Peripheral business declined in the mid-single digits in Q1. However, after adjusting for the discontinued product lines just mentioned, our peripheral business grew in the high-single digits with strong double-digit growth in SFA DCB products. During the quarter, we submitted our final data to the FDA for the IN.PACT Admiral SFA drug-coated balloon and we were recently informed by the FDA that this PMA updation will be granted expedited review status. We now expect U.S. approval for IN.PACT Admiral by the end of this fiscal year. Now turning to our Restorative Therapies group, revenue of $1.603 billion grew 3%. Results were driven by growth in neuromodulation and surgical technologies offset by declines in spine. Spine revenue of $743 million declined 3% with declines in Core Spine and BMP offsetting growth in Interventional Spine. Core Spine declined 2% with U.S. declining offsetting international growth. Both the global and U.S. CoreSpine markets appear relatively flat. Our U.S. CoreSpine business is expecting to launch a number of new products in FY \u201915 but only limited set quantities of a few of these products were available in Q1. We believe these new products will help drive a return to growth in our Spine business in FY \u201915. In addition to developing leading spine technology, our business continues to focus on procedural innovation and our surgical synergy program which integrates enabling technologies, surgical tools, spinal implants and our expertise. Interventional spine which primarily consists of our balloon kyphoplasty product lines grew 4%. The U.S. interventional spinal growth was boosted by stabilizing trends in the use of BKP as well as our increasing participation in more segments in the market. In the international markets, double digit growth was led by strong performances in both Germany and Japan. While there is still lot of work to do in this business, we are encouraged by these results. Turning to surgical technologies, revenue of $381 million grew 5% with steady growth across all three businesses. ENT grew to mid-single digits driven by growth in monitoring and powered systems. ENT recently launched the vent EM Sinus Dilation System which is generating strong customer acceptance and is expected to contribute to growth going forward. Neurosurgery grew 3% with solid growth in Midas Rex power equipment partially offset by fewer upgrades in large capital equipment. In advanced energy, strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue sealing and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies in the orthopedics, spine, breast and cardiac device replacement markets, drove solid double-digit growth. In neuromodulation, revenue of $479 million increased 11%, driven by solid growth in pain stim, DBS and gastro/uro. In pain stim, our SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system continues to show strength in the market, including positive surgical feedback on lead durability and adaptive stim automatic stimulation adjustment. And DBS, our neurologist referral development program in the U.S. and the strength of the early stim data in the international markets, which shows DBS provides superior benefits for patients with early motor complications from Parkinson's disease, continues to drive double digit new implant growth. Our gastro/uro business had solid growth in Q1 driven by a rebound in the implants in the United States. In our diabetes group, revenue of $416 million grew 12%, driven by the ongoing U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G system, which includes the Enlite CGM sensor, a smaller, more comfortable, and more accurate sensor. In Q1, we started the limited launch in Europe of MiniMed Duo with combined CGM sensor and insulating fusion set. Early feedback has been very positive due to the enhanced comfort in single insertion site. At the ADA Scientific Sessions in June, we announced a new strategic alliance with Sanofi focused on developing novel type 2 drug device combinations in care management devices. In July, the results of our OPTIMIZE trial were published in Lancet which show that Medtronic insulin pumps deliver better glucose control for people with insulin dependent type 2 diabetes than multiple daily injections. Looking ahead, we plan to launch our next generation MiniMed 640G system with predictive low glucose management in international markets in Q2. Our MiniMed 620G Japanese language system is also expected to launch in Q2 which will be the first integrated system in Japan. In addition, we are making good progress in our sensor pipeline as we continue our advancement towards a close loop system. Turning to rest of the income statement, it is worth noting that all of my forward-looking comments on outlook and guidance do not contemplate the expected closings of the Covidien transaction. The Q1 gross margin was 74.1% after adjusting for a 30 basis point negative impact from foreign currency the Q1 gross margin on a non-GAAP operational basis was 74.4%. The gross margin continues to include significant spending on additional resources mostly diverted from R&D to address quality issues in neuromodulation in diabetes, which negatively affected the Q1 gross margin by approximately 40 basis points. The Q1 gross margin was also negatively affected by product mix shifts in cardiac rhythm in heart failure as well as the R zone pricing adjustments in Japan, two items that will likely affected gross margin for the remainder of the fiscal year. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the gross margin for fiscal year 2015 to be in the range of 74.5% to 75% on an operational basis with Q2 expected to be at the lower end of this range. First quarter R&D spending of $365 million was 8.5% of revenue. We continue to invest in new technologies as well as generating clinical and economic evidence to drive future growth. We would expect R&D expense in FY15 to remain around 8.5%. First quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.506 billion represented 35.2% of sales. After adjusting for the 10 basis point positive impact from foreign exchange, Q1 SG&A was 35.3% driven by investments to drive CoreValve sales as well as higher incentive payments due to the outperformance in new product launches. We continue to expect FY15 SG&A to be in the range of 32.7% to 33.9% implying leverage of 50 basis points to 70 basis points on an operational basis. For Q2, we expect SG&A to be around 34.5% on an operational basis. Amortization expense for the quarter was $87 million. In FY15, we continue to expect amortization expense to remain in the range of $85 million to $90 million per quarter. Net other expenses at quarter were $51 million including net losses from our hedging program of $9 million. This result was favorable to our prior expectations due to net certain litigation gains, milestone income from diabetes meter partnership and the accounting treatment on TAVR royalties. We hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility on our earnings from foreign exchange. However, there is a growing portion of our profits that is unhedged especially emerging market currencies which can create some modest volatility in our earnings. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY15 net other expense to be in the range of $335 million to $375 million which includes an expected $125 million impact from the U.S. medical device tax, an incremental $13 million over FY14 as well as increased royalty expense from the Edwards agreement. For Q2, FY15 we expect net other expense to be in the range of $80 million to $90 million based on current exchange rates. Net interest expense for the quarter was $5 million. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $14 billion from cash and investments and $12.8 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect Q2, FY15 net interest expense to be in the range of $5 million to $15 million. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q1 was 19.1%. For FY15, we continue to expect our non-GAAP nominal tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 20% and we expect to be at the upper end of this range until the presently expired U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated. In Q1, we generated $1 billion from free cash flow net of certain litigation payments. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow excluding one-time items to shareholders. In Q1, we paid $304 million in dividends and repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock. In June, Medtronic Board of Directors increased the dividend by 9%, the 37th consecutive year of increased dividend payments. As of the end of Q1, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 42 million shares. First quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.5 billion shares. It is important to note that the cash we received from stock option redemptions which was a $154 million in Q1 will also continue to be used to repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. For FY15, we would expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 998 million shares including approximately 994 million shares in Q2. Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2015 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We continue to believe that constant currency revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% is balanced and realistic for fiscal year 2015. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you a sense of the FX impact of exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year then our FY15 revenue will be negatively affected by approximately $40 million to flat, including the negative $20 million to nearly zero impact in Q2. Turning to guidance on the bottom-line, we continue to expect FY15 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $4 to $4.10. Based on current exchange rates, this implies earnings per share growth in the range of 6% to 9% on a constant currency basis after taking into account the currently expected $0.05 to $0.07 negative foreign currency impact of earnings. As in the past my comments and guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, our outlook and guidance do not contemplate the impact of the expected Covidien transaction. I will now turn it back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Gary. And before opening the lines for Q&A let me briefly conclude by stating that Q1 was another successful balanced quarter. We continue to strive to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations. As we presented at our Investor Conference in June, we expect our continued efforts to deliver consistent and reliable performance combined with disciplined capital allocation, will enable is to create long-term dependable value in healthcare. And looking ahead, we believe this will be further strengthened and diversified by our Covidien acquisition. With that we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I will ask Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac & Vascular Group, Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We are really able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and if needed one related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator first question please. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe, I can get a couple in just on the product front. First is the 40% plus share comment in transcatheter valves, I'm sure caught people's attention? Can you just talk about how that progressed over the quarter. I ask because obviously you were dealing with the potential injunction overhang in the first part of the quarter and you resolved that with the settlement with Edwards in late May. Can you just talk about that commentary? Was that 40% plus comment true for the whole quarter or was that particularly true in the back half of the quarter? And then the second product was hoping to get an update on was the IN. PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon. I believe you submitted the data in the final module at the end of May. Do you have any update from the FDA on whether you will need to go to an advisory panel? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Mike can you take both of these? Mike Coyle : So, the transcatheter valve side, of course that comment about 40% market share is a U.S. statement, that\u2019s we basically have been proceeding with the launch as we\u2019ve described it, actually a little bit ahead of schedule in terms of the total number of accounts that have been opened and the training of those accounts, and we actually are getting a little higher share in the accounts we\u2019ve activated than we were expecting when we were talking at the analyst meeting. So we think our overall market share position\u2019s in the low 40s depending on how you want to treat the royalty income, which our competitor treats as revenue we tend to exclude it for purposes of that calculation on overall market share. On the IN.PACT Admiral that we have heard from FDA in terms of the fileability of our PMA. They have accepted it for filing with no major deficiencies. They have told us they are going to treat this as an expedited review. They have not yet given us the definitive answer on whether a panel is going to be required or not. Mike Weinstein : Perfect. Let me ask one follow-up. Can you just comment on the regulatory path for the Covidien transaction, how things are progressing with China, the US, and the other geographies of note. Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Things are progressing, Mike, as we have thought. I think the schedule for the end of the calendar year in early -- or early calendar \u201915 is what we expected when we started the process, and it still holds. The China approval is a little slower, it takes a little longer and often times after the process starts after we\u2019ve made some progress in the U.S. and Europe. Things are going along just as we had expected. There are no major surprises, and I think we still expect this to close as I said towards the end of the year or early next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds from Citi. Matthew Dodds : Good morning. If we look at the expense side on gross margin SG&A, you came in a little lower than we thought on gross margin and higher on SG&A. The full year guidance is really unchanged. You've got a big improvement, it looks like in the back half of the year. I guess for you, Gary, for the gross margin, are a lot of these issues going to linger or are some temporary other than FX? And then on SG&A, how much of the CoreValve launch and this incentive pay was front-end loaded, meaning that it won't -- it was really focused on the first quarter and it will drop? Omar Ishrak : Gary. Gary Ellis : I can take both of those Matt. I mean as far as the gross margin goes, we do expect the gross margin will improve as we go through the year. As we indicated, it was a little lower here in the first quarter due to some things that we have known about, which are the quality costs in Neuro and diabetes. We also ended up having just with the mix, the product mix having a little bit lower ICD revenue in this quarter before the new product has been launched, and with LINQ, which is a little bit lower margin product that had a mix issue into Q1, but as we go forward and ICDs pick up again, we should be back up in the 74.5% to 75% range as we indicated. We also expect the issues to be addressed on the quality side within neuro and diabetes as we go through the year that will also start to come down. And as you indicated, FX, we obviously assume will start to become a minimized issue as we go through the rest of the year. So 74.5% to 75%, Q2 improving but it\u2019d still be kind of at the lower end of that range, and continuing to improve as we go through the year. SG&A was a little more here in Q1, we kind of had expected that, we knew we are launching a lot of these new products with LINQ, CoreValve, and we just knew we\u2019re going to have some higher expectations around expenses on those items. But it was in line with basically our expectations and as we go through the rest of the year, both investments obviously will start to leverage as we go through, as the revenues continues to build in both of those product lines, and so we\u2019re expecting that the guidance we gave for SG&A and total that still remains on track and we are not concerned about at this point. Matthew Dodds : Just a quick follow up to Mike. Omar Ishrak : Yes, go ahead. Matthew Dodds : So Mike, now that the litigation's over, can you say on CoreValve are you still capacity constrained or is that not an issue, because it was a good quarter out of the chute in the US. Mike Boyle Well, we have been staying ahead of the demand, it\u2019s been challenging for our operations in the group to stay ahead of the demand, but they have been doing that and we have not done any bulking of product or advanced purchase of product. So we are essentially selling as we implant, and we expected that will continue here during the next quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Maybe just one for Omar, maybe a quick follow-up. Omar, I appreciate your comments on the deal and the commitment relative to Covidien. I wonder if you can comment at all on, this transaction under various different transaction structures whether there may be remedies proposed by treasury or congress or pursuing this deal without an inversion structure. You talked a little about that on the day of the deal announcement. I wonder if you could update us on your views about the commitment to this transaction under different scenarios. Omar Ishrak : Yes. Well, as I\u2019ve mentioned repeatedly and consistently, the strategic benefits of these transaction are very clear which I laid out today and earlier. We are excited about that. We feel, as we go through our integration planning process, we feel even more confident and excited about the strategic benefits of this combined company. So that\u2019s the driver for the whole thing. We can only plan a deal structure based on facts and what the current regulations and law are. And so that\u2019s why we structured it the way we structured it. Those things change before the close then we\u2019ll have to take a look at what those changes reflect and see what we can do to structure a new contract and so forth. But in all cases the strategic benefits do not go away and are clearly not affected by any legislative or regulatory changes. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at it. it\u2019s pointless to speculate in what those new changes could be to give priority of things if any. So, we prefer to stay away from that and stay focused on getting the regulatory actions taken care of as quickly as possible and then get this transaction closed, and structuring the strategic benefits. David Lewis : Great, very helpful. And then one other important element of the strategy obviously is emerging markets and I know you talked about it in your prepared remarks, but maybe just help us understand two things. It sounds like there are underlying distribution changes in both India and China. Maybe help us understand why you're undertaking those distribution challenges. Is it really for greater long term revenue growth? Was it to respond to recent revenue depression? That would be very helpful. Do you think this quarter or sometime in the next two quarters we could see a trough in the growth rate in either India or China? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Yes, thanks David. First of all distribution changes as you correctly point out, we\u2019re making are long term in nature. Look, we view emerging markets like I\u2019ve said before, as a key growth driver, not just for the next few years but for decades. Literally decades, because that\u2019s the nature of the opportunity, we\u2019re only addressing the premium segment when we get to value segment, the underserved; this is going to go on for a very long term. And as a result if you really talk of the long term the revenues from these regions will be big and certainly it probably will get from developed markets and we cannot have in that kind of a scenario go through indirect channels of -- we do not have direct control as with respect not only to business conduct standards but also and more importantly with respect to direct connection with our customers because we have to develop these markets. So, these are changes that we have to undertake. In addition, some of the management changes reflect upgrading some of the people because the nature of the business is more sophisticated than it once was. So these really are platform changes that we\u2019re making they\u2019re necessitated by our long term aspirations. And we feel we can cover it within our present business profile. And so we\u2019re going ahead and making these changes which we feel will have a positive impact not only in our relationships and long term growth but also on our margin in these regions which already is good but can improve further. So that\u2019s essentially the outlook in the strategic thought process behind emerging markets. In term of our trough, we are projecting both India and China to be double digit growth. The China, certainly in the mid-teens and India maybe even close to that by the end of the year, in other words for the full year. And so that will require an acceleration in the second half I think it will be different between the India and China. I mean there is still some variables in this, so I can\u2019t be certain but that certainly our projection as of today that going into the second half of the year we\u2019ll start to see a noticeable acceleration of growth in both of those regions. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Omar was wondering if you could just maybe comment a little bit about some of the revised numbers that Covidien put out within your proxy, just in terms of the outlook. What gives you I guess the confidence in the longer term growth profile there and what if anything have you learned or makes you more confident in the revenue trajectory or perhaps even the cost synergies with some of the early integration or early I guess work under your belt, the transaction? Omar Ishrak : Well, I\u2019ve been visiting many of the sites and understanding the products. And number of early observations that I have. First of all, Covidien has a track record and it builds a track record of revenue growth in the mid-single digits. And they have a diversified enough revenue pool, both geographically as well as from a product and customer basis. That appears to me that it\u2019s quite sustainable and fairly tolerant of one-off market dynamics in there whether it\u2019d be product or geography. So that is reassuring, I mean we knew that going in but deeper dive confirmed that. Equally importantly, as we go through the different sites, the future growth platforms if we can build by accelerating some of the technical, technology integration or channel integrations, there appear to be a lot of possibility. I think our biggest challenge will be to focus and make sure you prioritize the ones which will have the right returns and not go after ones that are potentially big but have perhaps returns which are more risky or even longer term. So, I think the prioritization exercise will be our biggest challenge. We have already stated that the two areas which will be the highest priority are in peripheral, vascular and in neuroscience and those are like many integration teams progressing and going ahead in those areas. The others will be longer term and surgical technologies and their surgical solutions is clearly opportunity both in terms of product integration for common co-points as well as technical and technology integration in future products. In addition, some of the capital equipment products and their monitoring products have longer term synergy in fact both our hospital solutions teams as well as our home monitoring business in Cardiocom. I think that\u2019s about all I can say Kristen at this point. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then just on the cost synergy side, do you still feel confident that that at least 850 number is the right number? Omar Ishrak : Yes, I doesn\u2019t think there was any sort of doubt around that. I think all the work that we are doing is confirming that that\u2019s an achievable number. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Great. Good morning. So I wanted to ask two quick questions. First, on the CRM market outlook, excluding LINQ which obviously is going very well, it looks like the CRM market is just a little bit worse than we thought this quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little about the market dynamics in CRM. Is pricing a little bit worse than you thought? What at this point is your outlook for CRM market growth as you look forward? Omar Ishrak : I think the overall low power market actually looks quite encouraging, I think we have seen stabilization of the market demand and although we are seeing obviously some renewed pricing pressure, I mean we are now looking at sort of 3% to 5% declines in ASPs in the U.S. and both pacing at ICDs currently and that\u2019s because we basically have anniversaried the major launches that we had. However, obviously we are about to enter a new launch cycle with high power side with CRT-D and we think that\u2019s going to help us in terms of improving the overall pricing dynamics. In terms of the overall unit market growth, we are seeing essentially flattish unit growth in the ICD market with low single-digit increases in initial implants are being offset by declines in the replacement cycle, mostly because of where we are in our replacement cycle. So, we believe the market going forward is flattish and that\u2019s what we are planning for otherwise encouraging from my perspective to see overall U.S. implantables growth for us at 4%. I mean we haven\u2019t seen that in quite some time and so obviously it\u2019s a good time to have a product like LINQ being added into the overall mix for implantables. Bob Hopkins : All right, that's helpful. And then Omar just wanted to ask one question for you as a follow-up on the emerging market commentary that you made thus far. Specifically on China I was wondering if you could just provide just a little more detail on the specific changes that you're making in China currently so we can get a better understanding of the outlook of China long-term and understand why those changes are being made. Omar Ishrak : I think this is harmonizing our distribution channels and also making sure that we have got processes in place, so the inventory levels are right. And thirdly, to make sure that specific programs have allowed us to go direct to certain major customers to start with. And maybe one of the point, we are also starting a program to go after tier 2 cities in China where there is a lot of opportunity and there we are thinking of certainly some combined products into a single channel around cardiology primarily. So, those are the changes that we are making. The biggest impact ones are really sort of fine tuning our distribution channels themselves, the specific distributors and harmonizing them, streamlining them, more focused fewer of them because that\u2019s essential to be able to maintain control both from a business conduct perspective as well as end-customer reach perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse. Bruce Nudell : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Omar, regarding the transaction, some people on the buy side have a little bit of consternation about the prospects for the minimally invasive surgery franchise of Covidien. On the other hand, you're going to have a broader playground to work in, more applications that you could tailor this. But specifically people are somewhat concerned about resurgence, robotics, et cetera. How do you view the long-term prospects of that series of applications? Omar Ishrak : I\u2019ve had a chance to visit two of their plans to work in these areas both in terms of the minimally invasive area as well as the advanced energy businesses and you really have to look at the two together because some of the tools integrated with the minimally invasive some products to create actually a more integrated offering than many of the competitors have. So I left those visits with a clear sense that there is a lot of focus on innovation, on next generation products and from a position of strength, not from a position of catching up which actually in these areas make quite a difference because some of these product lines require a lot of clinical expertise and clinical know how and clinical intervention if you like in the development. And I felt that the teams that I visited had a very strong experience in those areas. Good product positions today and very exciting technology plans for the future. So there is competition always and J&J is a good competitor, but I\u2019ve got every confidence of the teams that are in place in Covidien and the people that I\u2019ve met are absolutely capable of not only competing against anyone both from an edge and attitude perspective but also from a technical and clinical know how perspective. Bruce Nudell : Thanks. And I guess my follow-up; either you or Gary could speak to. Clearly administration wants some changes in the inversion attractiveness. And one of the things that's difficult to model or at least more challenging for us to model is if the law does change, how will you kind of assess the value of access to ex-US cash? I mean, just schematically, how should we be thinking about that value if worse in fact does come to worse. Omar Ishrak : Look, this is difficult for us to model too. We don\u2019t know what is going to be and it\u2019s pure speculation, at this stage we just did the model based on the current law and we\u2019re really not wasting our time trying to figure out five different iterations that may or may not happen. So at this stage we\u2019re just sticking to what we know. Gary Ellis : Yes, Bruce just to add, I mean obviously we\u2019ve been clear that all the advantages outside the strategic benefit of Covidien is that we do get access to the our O-U.S. cash and that\u2019s the question we are happy addressing, if there are changes to any rules and regulation we\u2019re going to happy determining how do we get access to that, because that\u2019s the benefit of it. But as Omar said it\u2019s just -- right now it\u2019s just the pure speculation on our part and we are not even doing any modeling because we have no idea of whether there will be any changes at all as move ahead. Omar Ishrak : We\u2019re just close on the transaction. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor from Barclays. Matthew Taylor : I wanted to ask one on emerging markets. You talked a little bit about some of the changes in China and India. There has been a couple reports about China looking to really source some more products locally. I wondered if you could talk to how that could impact your strategy longer term and whether it just means you need to change some of your structure, some of your partnerships and how you may be able to continue to win there if the market goes more towards local products. Omar Ishrak : There hasn\u2019t been any broad move of that nature in China that\u2019s consistent across the whole country for all products. So I am not sure that will be driven by broad-based regulation. However, China is a big enough market on its own with unique customer requirements that local manufacturing of various sorts will be something that\u2019s going to happen in China and then so we are committed to that as you know. We already have strong local manufacturing through in orthopedics and spine where we\u2019ve established over many years and accelerated by our recent acquisitions. We have also just last quarter finalized an agreement with LifeTech which will allow us to manufacture pacemakers locally and then finally we as I mentioned on the call, building a very promising partnership with one of the sub-provinces for the manufacturing of dialysis -- hemodialysis equipment and that platform also grow to include other products. Covidien by the way also has strong manufacturing and R&D capabilities in China. So put together, we will have enough options to be able to go local in China depending on what the regulations maybe but we hope that we don\u2019t have to wait for regulations, but on the leading edge of this and doing it because of true customer demand that we sense so that we can fulfill local needs in the most appropriate fashion. So I think we\u2019re very well positioned to take advantage of any change or otherwise in China for manufacturing. Matthew Taylor : Thanks and I know you're focused on closing the transaction. You can't speculate on what's going to happen. I think it's been a little bit surprising to see some of the rhetoric; some of the things that are being said by politicians are erroneous. What has surprised you most about some of the potential changes that are being talked about? And do you feel like your message about investing in the US and tax is resonating with Capitol Hill? Omar Ishrak : Look, I think it\u2019s great to see that our message around reinvesting in the U.S. has been positively received by everybody and I think that\u2019s fair. And I think in the mix of this is beyond Medtronic is just an overall number of transactions that are potentially is causing some consternation I guess again we there is not much we can do about those things we\u2019re going to put our message out as accurately as possible in general in the fashion as we know how. And then focus on the strategic benefits and make sure that we know how to dial those in. I think that\u2019s all we can do at this stage. I am not prepared to comment in any political sentiments that may be there. Jeff Warren : Thanks Matt. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve gone past top of the hour but we\u2019ll take two last questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Two quick ones for Mike Coyle, a follow-up on Bob's question on the CRM business. If you think about the US business being one of the anchors to corporate-wide growth, you do have a new quad pole system that's been approved. Can you help us, Mike, take us through some of the puts and takes of the pressures that you've been experienced. You did mention in one of your previous comments about the replacement cycle for Medtronic specifically. I think Chris O'Connell, one of the other anchors to top line growth has been the spine business, the projection is to get back to growth in FY15. Can you talk about the path to get back to at least market growth rates for the US ICD business? Omar Ishrak : Before Mike and Chris jump in, I do want to point out that although those are both important markets, the level of diversification that we now have across our entire business mix is much more resilient due to changes in just those two market segments. And we continue to go ahead in that dimension not because those two markets aren\u2019t important but because there are several others as well and to the degree that we can diversify overall business and continue to do so it is a very important initiative for us. So, with that I\u2019ll let Mike go ahead and talk about the ICD the market. Mike Coyle : First, relative to ICD, is I think if you the challenges in the quarter are U.S. challenges. So again if you look internationally, back at market share capture and overall market growth and so we expect the CRTD product entry is going to be a big aid to that issue. But as Omar pointed out, the fact that we actually are able to see growth in the overall implantable segment because of the addition of the new product category essentially and link is really going to help drive growth there and you\u2019re obviously now looking at a lower power segment that is in this reported quarter is showing market growth in sort of both the 3% to 4% range which we haven\u2019t seen in that segment for quite some time. So, we have a very diversified product portfolio across CEG with number of new growth drivers to offset areas of flat performance and obviously that showing up in the numbers this quarter. Omar Ishrak : Chris you want to comment on spine\u2026 Chris O'Connell: Sure. Josh on spine as Omar stated the U.S. core was a little soft in the quarter and we were expecting some of that really due to the timing of some of the new products launches as you know we just got FDA approval on PRESTIGE LP which is a really exciting development. We have some revenue for that modeled in Q1 that we\u2019re now into Q2 on. We also mentioned the BMP which was down in the quarter but we\u2019ve just anniversaried the Yale results. And as Omar pointed out, we\u2019ve had four sequential quarters of underlying stability. So those factors and some other real positives international spine particularly the developed markets is doing well and growing better than it has in recent quarters and we had a positive Kyphon quarter and are encouraged by that. So when you put all that together particularly the new product cadence in the U.S. we think we have a good pathway towards growing the U.S. spine business this fiscal year. Josh Jennings : And just want a quick follow up on the IN.PACT franchise. Jeff Warren : One last one? Omar Ishrak : Go ahead. Josh Jennings : Just a quick one on the IN. PACT franchise, two data sets on drug coated balloons have, at least top line data for IN. PACT and a full data set for Lutonix, can you talk about the international marketplace there for peripheral balloons? It sounds like you grew double digits. And then also when we may see a publication from the IN. PACT study. Thanks a lot. Omar Ishrak : Yes, just keep in mind, right now, the overall drug coated balloon market is like a $50 million to $60 million global market. So we have that very nice growth with the SFA indication outside the U.S. north of 20%. But we hadn\u2019t yet published to-date and that we are expecting to happen here in the fall which we think will be a nice catalyst for international market growth. And obviously as we\u2019ve seen in a lot of market segments the U.S. PMA approval tends to be a catalyst for global growth as the data really gets validated and then published and assessed. And obviously that\u2019s the kind of data that we have with the IN. PACT Admiral SFA. So we are anxious to see the US approval. We think that will be a catalyst not only for growth in the U.S. but also internationally. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : One big picture question. In the second calendar, Q2 calendar year, all of the public hospital companies saw an improvement in procedure volume in the US but that didn't show up in most med tech companies' Q2 results except yours, and yours seemed to have been driven largely by new products. So can you talk about what you're seeing from a procedure standpoint in the US through July? And then just for my follow-up, I'll throw it out now. I'm sure the TAVR market -- worldwide market growth numbers caught people's attention. I think you said the US and worldwide was growing over 30%. So can you talk about what you're seeing and what's causing that acceleration since you launched CoreValve? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Let me take the first one, I think you are right in fact I know you are right. Our growth in the U.S. was driven by innovation, by new products and their launches and their uptake as opposed to general procedure volume growth which was sort of low single-digit if not flat overall. So, I think as we expected the impact of more patients coming into the system is not something that affects the med-tech companies because we are generally focused on acute care and the level of patients that eventually flow through to acute care from the increased coverage that\u2019s in place now, is relatively small. And so that\u2019s why we are not really seeing any dramatic change in procedure volumes. However, we are very encouraged and excited by seeing the impact of new products which goes to show that innovation in this market, no matter how flat it maybe and whatever people may share about it, if you have true innovation you can get growth in the U.S. so that\u2019s exciting for us. Do you want to take this? Mike Coyle : And then on market growth, obviously there have been a number of important catalysts that\u2019s taken place over the last six months with the data obviously on the extreme risk and high risk patient populations, I mean the mortality benefit in the high risk patient population is itself a catalyst. The approval by FDA of those expanded indications. The entry of one of our competitors into Japan and the fact that there are just more companies out talking about TAVR in Europe because of the essential trialing of their new products. All of those things are basically validating the broader role that TAVR can play in the treatment of aortic stenosis and that\u2019s what is driving the overall market growth. Omar Ishrak : Okay, so thanks everyone for all your questions and we look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q2 call which we anticipate holding on November the 18th. And with that and on behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank you all again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jeff Warren : Thank you, Jackie. Good morning. And welcome to Medtronic's second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2015 second quarter which ended October 24, 2014. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Also, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. And finally, today\u2019s earnings call does not constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval. In connection with the proposed Covidien transaction, Medtronic Holdings Limited has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a preliminary joint proxy statement of Medtronic Inc. and Covidien plc that also constitutes preliminary perspectives of new Medtronic. The registration statement is not complete and will be further amended. After the registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC, the final joint proxy statement perspectives will be mailed to Medtronic shareholders and Covidien shareholders. You should review materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the proposed transaction, including information about Medtronic and Covidien, the respective directors, executive officers and certain other members of management and employees who may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxy in favor of the proposed transaction. Please also review the Disclaimer Page at globalmedtechleader.com for additional information on forward-looking statements and other important information on the proposed transaction. With that, I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning. And thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported second quarter revenue of $4.4 billion, which represents growth of 5% and Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96, growing 5%. Q2 was a strong balanced quarter, where revenue growth was at the upper end of our outlook range for the fiscal year and within our mid-single-digit base line goal. Our performance was well-balanced across our three groups, with our two largest groups CVG and RTG, both delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth, and diabetes achieving double-digit growth. Our Q2 results were also balanced from a geographic perspective, with 5% growth in both the U.S. and in International markets. Looking ahead, we expect that our three primary strategies; therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value, coupled with our increasing market diversification will enable us to consistently deliver dependable growth in healthcare. In addition, we believe our pending acquisition of Covidien will further strengthen and balance our growth profile. As we have done previously, we are quantifying, communicating, and executing in each of our independent growth vectors. Our new therapies growth vector contributed 310 basis points to our overall growth in Q2. This is over 100 basis points higher than last quarter and at the upper half of our previously stated 150 to 350 basis point expected range. Our organization continues to bring forward new products and services, which are being received enthusiastically by our customers around the world. Let me now discuss some of the innovations that have boosted our overall revenue growth by delivering meaningful clinical and economic value to the market. Starting with our Cardiac and Vascular Group, we launched our Attain Performa quadripolar lead system in the U.S. in September. This next-generation system coupled with our Adaptive CRT response improvement algorithm and efficient VectorExpress programming technology drove a step change in our CRT-D implant volume intra-quarter. Attain Performa also continues to drive sequential CRT-D market share gains in Japan, where we have picked up nearly 20 points of incremental share since launch. In our low power business, our Reveal LINQ miniaturized cardiac diagnostic monitor continues to deliver significant revenue growth well exceeding our expectations for this product. The business also launched our new SEEQ Mobile Cardiac Telemetry System, which is intended for patients who require up to 30 days of monitoring. The SEEQ sends important cardiac data to Medtronic monitoring center, a dedicated data center staff by certified cardiographic technicians to drive earlier detection. In AF solutions, we continue to take market share with our Arctic Front Advanced Cryo System and are also beginning to ramp up our redesigned phased RF product line. In structural heart, the U.S. launch of our CoreValve transcatheter valve continues to drive growth with over 200 sites now trained to implant this innovative and differentiated technology. Looking ahead, our CVG pipeline remains robust with several meaningful therapies poised to launch over the coming quarters, including our CoreValve Evolut R transcatheter valve, Resolut Onyx drug-eluting stent, IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon, Endurant IIs Aortic Stent Graft, and Micra Transcatheter Pacing System. In our Restorative Therapies group, we also see an innovation driving growth. RTG continues to execute on its neuro science strategy, as evidenced by our recent acquisitions of Visualase and Sapiens. These two advanced technologies are expected to further bolster our strong leadership position in a rapidly growing field of neurosurgery. In spine, we are in the process of launching a number of new therapies, including the PRESTIGE LP artificial cervical disc, the Divergence Anterior Cervical Fusion System, and our new pure Titanium-Coated Interbody Fusion Devices. As expected, the sequential stability in BMP for five quarters is now being reflected in our year-over-year growth comparisons. We expect that our new product launches -- combined with continuous stabilization in BMP will lead to modest growth in our overall spine business in FY \u201915. In neuromodulation, InterStim therapy for bladder and bowel control, and Activa DBS System continued to drive growth. In surgical technologies, our recently launched NuVent Sinus Balloon System is off to a great start and taking share. Customers appreciate NuVent\u2019s general ease-of-use, and navigation-enabled rapid target identification and confirmation. In our Diabetes Group, the strong ongoing U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G System with the Enlite Sensor is driving not only solid growth in insulin pumps but outstanding growth in CGM. Our focus in selling and supporting the pumping sensor as an integrated system continues to translate into global share gains in insulin pumps and U.S. share gains in CGM. The MiniMed 530G is the only system in the market that automatically stops insulin delivery if glucose levels fall below a predetermined threshold, an important step toward our goal of developing a fully automated artificial pancreas. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated the value of our Threshold Suspend feature, including publications in the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA. Regarding our next generation system, the MiniMed 640G and 620G, we have completed successful user evaluations and our now ramping manufacturing in preparation of broadly launching in international markets later this fiscal year. It is also worth noting that in Q2, we realigned our Diabetes Group into three specific business units focused on transforming diabetes care. The first business, intensive insulin management, will concentrate in type 1 and intensive type 2 diabetes management. The second business, non-intensive diabetes therapies will focus on type 2 solutions across the diabetes care continuum. The third business, diabetes service and solutions will focus on improving their customer experience by bringing together data management and customer support solutions, including consumables, supplies, and financial services. We believe that collectively these businesses can leverage Medtronic\u2019s technology and services to expand, access, integrate care, and improve outcomes, collaborating with patients, providers, and peers to change the management of diabetes. Our next growth vector, emerging markets contributed 145 basis points to our overall company growth. This is an improvement from last quarter and roughly in line with our minimum 150 basis point expectations. Greater China returned to double-digit growth in Q2 as expected. We continue to have impressive growth in our Middle East and Africa region which delivered the ninth consecutive quarter of growth above 20%. Latin America also had a good Q2, driven by another quarter of growth exceeding 20% in Brazil. In our Central and Eastern Europe region, while we continue to monitor the situation closely, we are encouraged by rebound in Russia\u2019s growth profile to the upper single digits in Q2. In India, we continue to optimize our distribution in our complex market environment. And they are focused on capitalizing on this major market opportunity in what is one of the most underserved regions in the world. We remain confident and enthusiastic in the long-term outlook of emerging markets. We continue to invest in these markets, aligning our strategies with our customers, with market specific initiatives. We also remained focused on developing new public partnerships, private hospital partnerships and channel optimization strategies. We expect our emerging market growth to steadily improve and consistently contributed 150 to 200 basis points to our overall growth. Finally, services and solutions, our third growth factor, contributed 45 basis to our overall growth. Within the 40 to 60 basis points annual range that we have targeted, our cath lab managed services business continues to grow in Europe. In order to strengthen and grow this business, both within Europe and in other regions around the world, we completed the acquisition of NGC Medical Institute, a privately held Italian based manager for cardiovascular suites, operating rooms and intensive care units. NGC brings significant expertise in material management and managed equipment services, infrastructure design and turnkey installation that it has developed over the past 30 years. We believe these core competencies will further enhance the momentum of our cath lab managed services offering, making us an ideal partner for hospital that seek to drive up operational efficiency and contain costs. In fact, we now have almost 40 long-term agreements with hospital systems, including 21 agreements added this quarter from our NGC acquisition, which in total represent over $900 million of committed revenue over an average contract period of five to six years. As part of our broader integrated health solutions portfolio, our Cardiocom business also continues to deliver strong results with over 80,000 patients in our service, driven in part by the growth in government accounts, home health providers and hospital system. Similar to our cath lab managed services business, Cardiocom has multiyear agreements with our customers that provide and produce an attractive stream of high-quality recurring revenue. In addition, Cardiocom serves as a foundational healthcare services platform to which we expect to strengthen our ability to deliver new more comprehensive integrated care solutions in the future. Turning to the P&L. Non-GAAP EPS growth is 140 basis points above our reported actual revenue growth but shorter for annual leverage expectation of at least 200 basis points. Our gross margin rate were short of our expectations but despite this short falls, we delivered in our EPS objectives, driven in part by 70 basis points, sequential improvement in SG&A spend. Gary will walk through some of these dynamics in greater detail shortly. Our growth continues to fuel strong free cash flow generation after adjusting for a multiyear donation we made to the Medtronic Foundation and certain litigation payments. We delivered nearly $1 billion in free cash flow in Q2, of which we returned over $850 million to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. We remain disciplined in how we deploy our capital, selecting M&A investment which we believe are attractive and in line with our growth strategies and offer high return metrics while minimizing near-term shareholder dilution. As we noted at the Analyst Meeting in June, the acquisitions we have done since FY \u201809 have provided $1.4 billion in revenue in FY \u201814 without any net dilution and collectively we expect these will begin to contribute to earnings going forward. We continue to see this strategy playing out successfully. Just this quarter, we made three additional acquisitions, NGC Medical, Sapiens and Visualase, that met our acquisition guidelines. We are actively making the necessary trade-offs to offset any dilutive impact to earnings. We remain focused on reliably delivering on our baseline financial model, mid-single-digit revenue growth, EPS growth 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue growth and returning 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. To achieve these goals, we continue to execute on our preprimary strategies, therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. We believe our acquisition of Covidien will meaningfully complement and accelerate all three of these strategies, strengthening our long-term market competitiveness as well as driving further sustainability and consistency in our long-term financial performance. As we move through the Covidien integration planning, regulatory approvals and the closing process, we continue to become more excited about the potential of Medtronic-Covidien combination everyday. And we remain fully committed to the transaction, which we expect to close in early calendar year 2015. We believe the acquisition remains extremely attractive financially, even following the updated financing plans we announced in October. We've identified achievable cost synergies that are expected to make the transaction accretive in the first year on a cash basis and neutral to accretive within three years on a GAAP basis. We also expect the combined company to generate significant free cash flow which could be deployed with much greater flexibility. Our joint integration planning efforts continue to move forward. And we are actively developing our comprehensive integration strategy that is guided by four clear priorities, preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. Our first and highest priority is to preserve. Both Medtronic and Covidien have been consistently executing, meeting our individual growth projections and strategic plans. First and foremost, we must preserve the ability of both companies to continue to deliver these reliable mid-single-digit revenue growth results and EPS accretion. This means that our organizations must stay focused, minimizing unnecessary distractions that could potentially risk delivering in our existing commitments as we come together as one company. Our second priority is to optimize, specifically this means that we will focus on achieving our projected cost synergies, optimizing our two organizations is expected to result in a minimum of $850 million in pre-tax annual cost synergies by FY \u201918. For the most part, Medtronic and Covidien are very complementary in terms of the customers we call on, the products we sell and the markets we serve. However, we know we have ample opportunity to find cost synergies in non-customer facing areas such as facility duplication, administrative redundancies and other back-office functions. Our integration planning teams are working well together to ensure that we reach these projections. Our third priority is to accelerate among the several opportunities that we are currently assessing and prioritizing to accelerate our market presence and drive increased revenue. There are two very specific identifiable items within our individual strategic plans that we expect to accelerate. First, linking the Medtronic drug-coated balloon with the Covidien Peripheral Vascular sales channel and achieve growth beyond what each individual company had planned. Second, we expect the integration of Covidien\u2019s neurovascular business into our Restorative Therapies Group will significantly enhance our neuroscience strategy through a more comprehensive product portfolio for neurosurgeons and interventional neuroradiologists. Finally, our fourth priority in combining Medtronic and Covidien is to transform. This applies to both, how we innovate and build new value-based offerings to the market, as well as how we partner with others throughout the healthcare industry worldwide to drive new transformative business models and solutions. We have an opportunity to truly meet the universal needs of healthcare, improving clinical outcomes, expanding access and optimizing cost and efficiency in a way that no other company can. We believe that our industry-leading products, clinical and economic expertise, global footprint and financial strength will position us to be the preferred partner for physicians, hospital systems, patients, payors and governments around the world. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look with our second quarter results. Gary? Gary Ellis : Thanks, Omar. Second quarter revenue of $4.366 billion increased 4% as reported, or 5% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for a $38 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Q2 revenue results on a geographic basis were as follows. Growth in the emerging markets was 12%, and represented 13% of our overall sales. The U.S. grew 5% and represented 56% of our overall sales, and growth in non-U.S. developed markets was 2% and represented 31% of our overall sales. Q2 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.96, an increase of 5%. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.83, a decrease of 7%. This quarter\u2019s GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments on an after-tax basis included a $64 million multi-year donation to the Medtronic Foundation and a $60 million charge for acquisition-related items, primarily associated with transaction costs in connection with the pending Covidien acquisition. It is worth noting that on a cash basis, Q2 diluted earnings per share were $1.02, an increase of 5%. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2.286 billion grew 5%. Results were driven by growth in Low Power, Structural Heart and AF & Other, partially offset by declines in Coronary and High Power. In Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, revenue of $1.320 billion grew 5% and included $18 million of combined revenue from our acquisitions of NGC Medical, Corventis and TYRX. High Power revenue of $670 million declined 5% after difficult prior year comparison but sequentially grew 7%, as reported on the strength of the U.S. mid-quarter launch of our Attain Performa quadripolar CRT-D system. Our daily CRT-D implant volumes were flat prior to the launch but jumped to mid-teens growth post launch. In fact despite having Attain Performa available for only part of the quarter, our Q2 in total represented our highest level of average daily CRT-D implants in over three and a half years. As we have noted over the last several quarters, we believe the best way to view the High and Lower Power markets is on a rolling two quarter basis, given the variability in quarter-to-quarter dynamics. We estimate that global High Power market growth is flat to slightly down with low single-digit growth in international markets, offsetting low single digits declines in the United States. Last week, we announced the launch of our Revo MRI SureScan ICDs in Japan. We expect Revo MRI, which allows for full body MRI access to be well received by the Japanese market, given their preference for MRI technology. Low Power revenue of $524 million grew 11%, driven by the strong global launch of Reveal LINQ. In June, data from the CRYSTAL AF trial were published in the New England Journal, showing that in patients with recent cryptogenic strokes, our Reveal monitor detected AF better when compared to standard care. We continued to make progress on our global clinical trial for Micra and expect CE Mark by the end of this fiscal year, with U.S. approval in FY \u201917. AF solutions grew over 30%, as we continue to take share and grow the AF market. Results were driven by robust growth of the Arctic Front Advance CryoAblation system which grew over 30%, as well as strong double-digit growth from the international launch of our PVAC Gold phased RF system. We continue to make progress in bringing our phased RF technologies to the U.S. market, as we are enrolling our VICTORY AF pivotal study for patients with persistent AF. In our Coronary & Structural Heart business, revenue of $743 million grew 6%. Coronary declined 2% percent, although our drug-eluting stent share remains stable in the United States and was up slightly in international markets. The business executed on a strong global launch of our NC Euphora Balloon, which gained market share in an area where share is usually very sticky. Our agreement with ACIST, where we co-promote their FFR technology in the United States also continues to go very well. We also just received CE Mark for our Resolute Onyx DES and are preparing to broadly launch in Q3. Resolute Onyx builds on a superior deliverability, improving clinical performance of Resolute Integrity, with thinner struts to improve deliverability even further and is the first stent to feature our core wire technology, which markedly enhances visibility. Structural Heart grew 19%, on a continued strength of our U.S. CoreValve launch. Our global transcatheter valve revenue in the quarter was $131 million, representing growth of over 60%. We estimate that the global transcatheter valve market is now annualizing at over $1.5 billion. Our team is aggressively adding new centers, with a presence now in over 200 U.S. centers. We are executing to the launch as plan, with focus on training and strong procedural results. Our share was stable and our experience accounts. In international, the launch of CoreValve Evolut R 23 millimeter valve is well underway with very strong customer reception to the platform. We are expecting to broaden this platform with the approval of our 26 and 29 millimeter valves in early calendar year \u201915. Evolut R is our next-generation recapturable system, with a differentiated 14 French equivalent delivery system. In addition, our U.S. IDE study for Evolut R, our 250 patient single-arm study with 30-day follow-up is now enrolling. In our Aortic & Peripheral Vascular business, revenue of $223 million grew 3%, or 5% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Pioneer Plus product line and the voluntary product recall of the below-the-knee DCB. This is the last quarter we faced the negative effect of these two discontinued product lines, which should lead to improved reported growth in this business going forward. Aortic revenue grew 3%, driven by double-digit growth in thoracic with Valiant Captivia stent grafts achieving strong share gains. In AAA, we received CE Mark and FDA approval for our Endurant IIs in the last week of Q2. Endurant IIs, a unique three-piece version of our market leading Endurant platform, will launch in Q3. Revenues for our Peripheral business grew 4% in Q2. However, after adjusting for the discontinued product lines just mentioned, our Peripheral business grew in the mid-teens, with strong double-digit growth in SFA DCB products. Looking ahead, in the first calendar quarter of 2015, we are expecting U.S. approval for our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon as well as the major medical journal publication of IN.PACT SFA one year results. We expect our IN.PACT Admiral DCB to drive growth in Peripheral in the coming quarters. Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group, revenue of $1.650 billion grew 4%. Results were driven by growth in Surgical Technologies, Neuromodulation and BMP. Spine revenue of $746 million grew 1%. Core Spine growth was flat year-over-year, a modest improvement from last quarter. We are encouraged that both the global and U.S. Core Spine markets continue to stabilize and are beginning to show bias towards low-single-digit growth. Our Core Spine business is launched in a number of new products this fiscal year, which are expected to return our overall spine business to modest growth in FY '15. In addition to working with surgeons develop the leading technology in spine, our business continues to focus on procedural innovation and our surgical synergy program, which integrates enabling technologies, surgical tools, spinal implants and our expertise. Interventional Spine, which primarily consists of our balloon kyphoplasty product line, declined 5%. While we saw good underlying procedural volumes, we were affected by a product supply issue related to our Cement Delivery System. BMP sales of a $120 million grew 9%, with stable underlying demand. Whiles sales of BMP bounced round a bit, we do believe we have turned the corner and would expect BMP sales growth to be slightly positive going forward. Turning to Surgical Technologies, revenue of $410 million grew 10% and included $3 million of revenue from our acquisition in the quarter of Visualase. Surgical Technologies had balanced growth across Neurosurgery, ENT and Advanced Energy. Neurosurgery grew in the upper-single digits, driven by growth in Midas Rex power equipment, capital equipment service revenue, as well as revenue from Visualase. ENT also grew in the upper-single digits, driven by solid results in ENT power systems due to the recent launch of the M5 Microdebrider and monitoring disposables. The recent launch of our NuVent sinus balloon also drove growth in ENT. In Advanced Energy, strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue sealing and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies drove solid double-digit growth. In Neuromodulation, revenue of $494 million increased 4%, led by upper-single digit growth in Gastro/Uro and DBS businesses. Gastro/Uro results were driven in part by the success of our Care Pathway program, resulting in solid new InterStim implant growth in the United States. We also received the FDA approval and launched the Verify Evaluation System, which is used to provide advanced filing of our InterStim system. In DBS, our global focus on neurologist referral programs and the strength of the early stim data in international markets, which shows DBS provides superior benefits for patients with early motor complications from Parkinson's disease, continues to drive solid new growth. Our DBS business also acquired Sapiens in Q2, a developer of advanced DBS lead technology that features 40 individually programmable stimulation points that can more easily -- can more precisely stimulate the intended target in the brain. We expect to finalize development and initiate clinical studies to bring this technology to market. In Pain Stim, recent reimbursement changes have softened the U.S. market. However, we gained modest share globally on the strength of our SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system, with its proprietary adaptive stim automatic stimulation adjustment. In our Diabetes Group, revenue of $430 million grew 10%, driven by the ongoing U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G system, which includes the Enlite CGM sensor, a smaller, more comfortable, and more accurate sensor. Globally insulin pumps grew in the mid-single digits and CGM grew over 40%. Looking ahead, we are planning a limited launch of our next-generation MiniMed 640G system, with predictive low glucose management in international markets in Q3, followed by a broader Q4 launch. Likewise, our MiniMed 620G, the first integrated system optimized for the Japanese market has begun its limited rollout and will also broadly launch in Q4. In addition, we are making good progress on our sensor pipeline as we advance towards a close loop system. Last month we announced the first enrollment in our U.S. pivotal study of our predictive low glucose management technology, which includes the study of our new insulin pump design in fourth-generation CGM sensor. This sensor has new intelligent diagnostics that are expected to result in enhanced accuracy and is 80% smaller than the Enlite sensor currently sold in the United States. Looking ahead, it is worth noting that in Q3 diabetes will play to difficult comparison due to the $23 million in deferred revenue that was recognized in Q3 last year. Turning to rest of the income statement, please note that all of my forward-looking outlook and guidance comments do not contemplate the effect from the expected closings and related financing of the Covidien transaction. The Q2 gross margin was 73.8%. This was below our expectations due to several factors, including a product mix shift in CVG, the outperformance in BMP sales and our acquisition of NGC Medical. As we have noted in the past, BMP is one of our lowest gross margin products due to the profit sharing arrangement with Pfizer. NGC Medical, which we acquired in the quarter, also have a gross margin that is significantly below our corporate average. However, both BMP and NGC have operating margins that are similar to the corporate average due to lower spend in SG&A and R&D. The gross margin also continues to include significant spending related to resources to address quality issues in neuromodulation and diabetes, which negatively affected the Q2 gross margin by approximately 40 basis points. Looking ahead, we would expect our gross margin to improve sequentially on an operational basis, driven in part by positive manufacturing variances that have already occurred flowing through in the back half of the fiscal year as well as continuing execution on our cost of goods sold reduction program, resulting in gross margins around 74.5% on an operational basis in the second half of FY '15. However, based on current exchange rates, we would expect to have a negative 50 to 60 basis foreign exchange impact in Q3 and Q4, which would result in reported gross margins that are similar to our Q2 reported gross margin. Second quarter R&D spending of $374 million was 8.6% of revenue. We continue to invest in new technologies as well as to generate clinical and economic evidence to drive future growth. We expect R&D expense in FY '15 to around 8.5%. Second quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.507 billion represented 34.5% of sales, both on as reported and operational basis and in line with outlook we provided. We continue to expect FY '15 SG&A to be in the range of 33.7% to 33.9%, implying leverage of 50 to 70 basis points on an operational basis. Amortization expense for the quarter was $89 million. In FY \u201815 we continued to expect amortization expense to remain around $90 million per quarter. Net other expense for the quarter was $63 million. This result was favorable to our prior expectations due in large part to changes in FX, which resulted in $12 million gain in Q2 from our FX hedging program. We continue to hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. However, it\u2019s worth noting that there is a growing portion of our profits that is unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create some volatility in our earnings. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY \u201815 net other expense to be in the range of $180 million to $210 million, which includes an expected $120 million impact from the U.S. Medical Device Tax, as well as increased royalty expense from the Edwards agreement. In Q3, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $30 million to $40 million based on current exchange rates. Net interest expense for the quarter was $8 million. At the end of Q2, we had approximately $14.5 billion in cash and investments and $13.7 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect Q3, net interest expense to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. This forecast does not include any potential impact from the planned financing of the Covidien acquisition, which we would expect to exclude in our Q3 non-GAAP net interest expense. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q2 was 19.5%. For FY \u201815, we expect an adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 20% and we expect to be at the higher end of this range until the presently expired U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated. In Q2, we generated $951 million in free cash flow after adjusting for the Medtronic foundation, donation and certain litigation payments. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow, excluding one-time items to shareholders. In Q2, we paid $298 million in dividends and repurchased $555 million of our common stock. As of the end of Q2, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 34 million shares. Second quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 993 million shares. It is important to note that we expect that the cash we received from stock option redemptions, which was $158 million in Q2 will also continue to be used to repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. For FY \u201815, we would expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 998 million shares, including approximately 995 million shares in Q3. Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2015 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We are tightening our constant currency revenue growth outlook to 4% to 5% for FY \u201815. And based upon our current forecast for the back half of the fiscal year, we would not be surprised to be at the upper end of this range. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year then our FY \u201815 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $280 million to $320 million, including a negative $130 million to $150 million impact in Q3. Turning to guidance on the bottomline, we continue to expect FY \u201815 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $4 to $4.10. Based on current exchange rates, this implies earnings per share growth in the range of 7% to 10% on a constant currency basis after taking into account the currently expected $0.08 to $0.09 of negative foreign currency impact to earnings. While we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, we would point out that Q3 typically had modestly lower revenue and similar earnings per share to Q2. Given this and the fact that the U.S. R&D tax credit has not yet been reinstated, we would not be surprised to see some model shift to few pennies of earnings per share for the Q3 to Q4. As in the past, my comments and guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year. In addition, as I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, our outlook and guidance do not contemplate the impact of the expected Covidien transaction. Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to remind you that we will have an extra selling week in FY \u201916, which will occur in the first quarter. This means that Q1 will have a total of 14 weeks, an anomaly due to the way our fiscal years are structured with this catch-up week occurring every six years. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Gary. Before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by stating that Q2 was a strong balanced quarter. We continue to strive to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations. And looking ahead, we believe our three primary strategies, therapy innovation, globalization and economic value, coupled with our increased market diversification will enable us to consistently deliver dependable growth in healthcare. And we believe our pending acquisition of Covidien will further strengthened and balance our growth profile. With that we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I will ask Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac & Vascular Group, Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We are really able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and if needed one related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan. Mike Weinstein : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So Gary, I would hope we could -- I\u2019m hoping I could get you to talk about a couple of item. First, as we think ahead to the Covidien closing, can you just talk a little bit about how you view your debt load post the closing given the borrowing in the U.S.? And what your comp levels are going to be with your debt ratios going forward? And then second, really where I\u2019m headed is also I want you to talk about your capital allocation strategy post closing given your access to Covidien\u2019s cash flows and how that shifts with much greater cash flow opportunity post close? Gary Ellis : Okay. Well, with respect to the debt levels, I think everyone\u2019s well aware to finance the transaction at this point. We\u2019ve changed instead of using our o-US cash and bringing that we\u2019re using that as part of the transaction, we will finance the entire cash component of the transaction, which is basically about $16 billion that we\u2019re going to need to finance now. That will be both through some bank debt and obviously going to the capital markets. We\u2019ve thoroughly had the discussions with the rating agencies around that. We\u2019ve taken a look at the finance and that\u2019s well within our ability to do. We don\u2019t think that should be any issue. Obviously, it will result in slightly lower ratings from the agencies but still well inline with our expectations. We expect over time that we\u2019ve kind of committed to the fact that we want to maintain, get it done kind of a three times leverage, which I think will occur over the first few years as we get the synergies and as we drive the growth in the business. We think the leverage levels will be -- probably we can maintain kind of with those levels and be very, very comfortable going forward and give us the financial flexibility we need as an organization. So obviously, as much as we prefer to be using our own cash with the transaction, the ability to go and use outside debt to finance this transaction fits very well into the financials and our expectations moving ahead. So that -- we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to have much of an impact on our overall cash flexibility. As far as the capital allocation goes, as we indicated, when we did the transaction, we still are committed to return the 50% free cash flow to shareholders, that\u2019s where our commitment still remains. But as we indicated, when we talk about the transaction, just getting access to the Covidien of both U.S. and o-U.S. cash improves our cash availability in the U.S. dramatically from around 35% to 40% that we have right now to above 60% as we go forward. And so that clearly improves our flexibility and gives us the ability as we take a look at the combined companies going forward on what we might do with capital allocation or reinvesting back in United States. And as we indicated, that was one of the key factors for the transaction and the structure we came up with is to improve that overall flexibility as we move ahead. So, we have not changed our capital allocation, but obviously we\u2019ll have increased flexibility as we move forward after the transaction closes, and we\u2019ll have to evaluate that as we get together as a combined company. Mike Weinstein : Let me ask one to Omar then I\u2019ll jump. So Omar this has -- it grew 5% this quarter, which makes your first quarter in four and a half years since the company has done so. And it\u2019s really on the back of new products and new therapies in the U.S. market. The emerging markets business grew 12% this quarter, and it\u2019s still growing I think below which your targets are internally? So can you talk a little bit about that incremental engine, how do you get emerging markets to go from 12% to 15% plus? I know it\u2019s really where you are targeting? Omar Ishrak : Well frankly I am targeting even higher than that Mike, but it\u2019s true that we\u2019ve said that mid-teens is our baseline expectations. And I think we\u2019ve had a little bit of a tough couple of quarters in emerging markets in relative terms because of some changes we made in distribution and also some difficult comparisons as well. We expect to get to mid-teens in the emerging markets quite shortly because there is a balance here. Some of the emerging markets are doing very well, others are under pressure, and it so happened that Central and Eastern Europe, which was a big driver of growth had a lot of pressure in the past three or four quarters that\u2019s coming back. China had to return to double digit this quarter, and we expect China to continue in that range. India has been a problem, and it\u2019s going to take a little while to sort out. It\u2019s primarily around our distribution channels, but that has a fairly small impact right now on our overall numbers. And Latin America is coming pretty strong, growing well over 15% in fact so. This is a balance of different countries here, which have different profiles. I think it\u2019s fair to look at this in a yearly basis as opposed to a quarterly basis. And I think that\u2019s the way we are looking at it, and we are pretty confident that on an annual basis getting around the mid-teens is a realistic objective. But as I have mentioned earlier in all seriousness, I\u2019ll challenge the team that the opportunity there in terms of the under penetrated market amongst people who can afford the care really deserves growth higher than that. So, it\u2019s not quite that simple though to get all those different constituents together, and it\u2019s going to take a little while. But the opportunity is clearly there. I think mid-teens is still a very realistic and achievable annual goal. We\u2019ll have quarter-over-quarter fluctuations simply given the breadth of geographies we\u2019re dealing with. Mike Weinstein : Yeah. Thank you, Omar. Congratulations on the quarter. Omar Ishrak : Good. Thanks. Mike. Gary Ellis : Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions, I guess the first question just talking about consistency of growth, Omar, has been a huge focus of the business and as you head into Covidien and you reiterated, you want to be a more consistent business, and certainly on the topline that looks like the case here in the quarter. Maybe for both of you, just thinking about gross margins, this is sort of in a third straight quarter where GMs have been a little soft and there has been one-time issues. But I think investors, I think are looking for sort of conviction around whether you really can deliver to 200 to 400 basis points of leverage to a much stronger topline number? I think based on the last three quarters, Gary or Omar, there is a view that maybe there are some structural forces weighing on gross margin. So can you talk about why you are still confident that you can deliver from a Medtronic individual perspective better leverage on that topline, which is obviously improving here in the last few years and then I have a quick follow-up? Omar Ishrak : Yeah. First, you are right to point out that the gross margin has been under pressure for a variety of reasons over the past several quarters. And although the range that we talked about is still the range that is realistic and we think achievable. I\u2019d like to point out that given the mix of products and the mix of businesses that we are now -- that\u2019s now in our current planning, the operating margin number on which the leverage is build is a more reasonable metric to look at as opposed to the gross margin. The gross margin is really only a portion what contributes to the overall operating margin. And now given our services and solutions business scale that we are getting in NGC, the lower SG&A that will result from that with a lower gross margin, will result in positively growing operating margins. So that\u2019s the number that we are more increasingly focused on looking at. We are not losing side of the gross margin from a pricing perspective in our products, which we will absolutely still monitor. But the operating margin itself is probably some more meaningful indicator for us. And going forward, Covidien, we\u2019ll have to take a look at the combined company, which we are beginning to do. I think clearly as our growth rate goes higher, significantly higher then the leverage is something we\u2019ll have to look at as to what\u2019s reasonable amount. I think the absolute EPS leverage is the number perhaps to look at that stage, but right now we are still sticking to our commitment, which we still have to prove that we can deliver, that grow consistently at mid single-digits, deliver the leverage that we\u2019ve talked about and only after we\u2019ve reliably established that and are confident that the growth rate can reliably be higher than that, can we talk about different kinds of leverage. So those are the two points. First, let\u2019s focus on operating margin on an overall basis. Second, let\u2019s deliver a few more quarters of what we\u2019ve talked about as our baseline expectations and then we\u2019ll think of change profile potentially and then the Covidien adds more mix of that. Yeah. Go ahead. David Lewis : Okay. Omar, very helpful. And then execution obviously is the second thing. I think you\u2019ve been very focused on here in the last several quarters. Maybe just talk about two points of execution in the U.S. market in this quarter, one, high powered market\u2019s been softer for several quarters, how much of that is product mix for you guys? And how much you think can really be improved through better execution, better management? And then just secondarily, TAVR roll out, obviously still a strong number but flattish sequentially based in your commentary. What do you think you share with TAVR market share and how happy where you with the results there this quarter? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : I am going to let, Mike Coyle talk about the dynamics. What I will say that from my perspective, when I look at the overall execution of our businesses in terms of this new product launches. I really, I'm encouraged and quite pleased. I think the team has by and large met their commitments, not only in terms of dates but in terms of the traction that these products have achieved. Their inter quarter dynamics, there are other factors here which relate to the exact share position or the growth numbers on a short-term basis. But the real meaningful indicators that I looked at and the team has clearly executed so. But, Mike, may be you can give some more color to the market. Mike Coyle : Just specifically on the two markets that you mentioned on the High Power side, obviously despite the fact that we have a year-over-year decline of 5% in the High Power number, that really has more to do with the prior year than it does in the current quarter from the standpoint that there were some unusual dynamics in the prior year second quarter. Because of the fact that we had this meaningful destocking in the first quarter a year ago, as we brought on the new what we call the Blackwell platform or the Evera Viva/Brava product lines. So if you look at the prior year number, it was an unusually high because of the quarter end dynamics in the second quarter. But when you now look at the actual performance on a run rate basis, especially since the second half introduction into the U.S. of the new quadripolar Attain\u00ae Performa system, we are actually seeing very nice growth dynamics and I think in the text, you heard mid-teens kind of growth in implants for the second half of the quarter, which obviously reflects very good execution and matches frankly what we saw in other geographies like Japan for the differential performance of the product life. So we think there is very good execution going on there. In the TAVI product line, obviously from a performance perspective, the rollout is going just as we had envisioned it would in terms of new centers being opened and revenues generated. Obviously, what was a little different in the quarter was the fact that there were some positive competitive dynamics going on with new product introductions. And we have to remember this is the market that is in its infancy is going to respond to new technology introductions. So one of our competitor obviously brought in the product line that allowed them to compete in the larger valve sizes, which gave them an opportunity to differentially grow in and catch where they are. While we are in roughly 200 accounts, they are in almost double that. And so that set a big opportunity for them to grow in accounts where we are not there yet. And obviously there is also a reaction to new products comings into the market, where there is trialing and then accounts are going to decide what they are going to settle on in terms of overall share. Fortunately for us, we\u2019re now heading into that cycle with the Evolut R product. We will have our CE Mark for that product. We have it for the 23-millimeter valve. We will be adding the 26 and 29 by the time we get into the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. And then by midyear next year, we will have that availability of product in the United States. So we think this is going to be a competitive market. The good news is it looks like it\u2019s going to be growing faster than we had projected at the time of Analyst Meeting, and we\u2019re happy to participate in it. I think the important thing from a CVG perspective is no single product line dominates our growth profile. As you heard from the number of new product innovations, whether we\u2019re talking about the diagnostics area, the new products in CRT-D, whether we\u2019re talking about the drug-coated balloon, or the refresh on the Evolut R, or the additions of our new Onyx drug-eluting stent, we have a large number of therapy innovation growth drivers that are taking place throughout the world and will help us get and sustain balanced growth. David Lewis : Okay. Thank you very much. Nice quarter. Omar Ishrak : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Wondering if you could just focus on with the Covidien transaction, just with respect to accretion that you\u2019re talking about, FX definitely has an impact on Covidien\u2019s results. So I was wondering if you could just weigh in on how you guys are thinking about FX moving ahead as you bring that company into the Medtronic fold and how will hedging I guess look like? Omar Ishrak : I will clearly let Gary take this one. Gary Ellis : All right. Well, as we indicated, obviously, as far as the transaction goes, the combination of Medtronic and Covidien, our expectations as we look at this have been as we indicated and it will be basically cash earnings per share neutral to accretive in the first year and obviously GAAP accretive by the third year going forward, and we still -- that's assuming the synergies and everything else that we played out. So we still have that expectation. To be honest with you, as far as beginning and exactly what the impact of foreign exchange is on the combined entities, we\u2019re just starting to get into the details that really put together our detailed FY '16 types of plans and trying to assess what that will be mean as we go forward, obviously fine tuning the synergies and all those details. So to have -- to indicate what the FX impact is, I don\u2019t have an answer for that at this point in time as we move ahead. But you\u2019re absolutely right, I mean, clearly FX and where it\u2019s at right now both for Medtronic and for Covidien, for any company obviously that\u2019s operating internationally, it\u2019s a headwind that we\u2019re going to be have to be facing and dealing with. We obviously have had a hedging program in place which is more than what they\u2019ve done, they have done some, but not as much as we\u2019ve done. And we\u2019ll have to evaluate that and determine what the impact is as we get into, but I don\u2019t have any detailed answers at this point in time to give any specifics on what that impact could be for FY '15 or obviously FY '16. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Omar Ishrak : One comment that I can make on this is that look with Covidien, given the breadth of manufacturing facilities, again we don\u2019t want to kind of just create one just for FX. But if it makes sense, given the diversity of manufacturing locations and the spread of cost globally, I think over the long-term, this is not a short-term, I mean over the long-term, we can plot, not a hedging, but a more balanced strategy on FX that will give us some protection. So I think the addition of Covidien actually gives us that added flexibility, which over the long-term if you plan it carefully might help us. Gary Ellis : More of a natural hedge. Omar Ishrak : It provides more of a natural hedge. Kristen Stewart : Great. And then, just a clarification on the tax rate given the change in finance, you\u2019ve talked about 2% lower, I guess, off the blended tax rate? Is that the blended tax rate as we see it from a non-GAAP basis today or should we be thinking about that as a blended tax rate, if we adjust both your tax rate and Covidien\u2019s tax rate onto like more of cash earnings, so it would be certainly lower than what the non-GAAP number is today? Gary Ellis : No. It should be on non-GAAP number, is what you should base on. What we have done is, we\u2019ve assumed that, based on what our non-GAAP normal tax rate is in there, if you blend those together and then assume, as we indicated approximately 2% benefit from the financing, that\u2019s kind of a roughly where we expect. But, obviously, there is a lot of moving parts there that are outside even our control. I mean, what happens if the R&D tax credit, all these different things will have impact on where their rate is. But generally just take our two rates blend them together and it\u2019s a 2 percentage point improvement on the top of that. Kristen Stewart : And that\u2019s going to be on a new cash basis tax rate? Gary Ellis : That\u2019s on the non-GAAP rates. Kristen Stewart : Okay. All right. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Kristen. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Bob Hopkins : Great. Thank you and good morning. Omar Ishrak : Hi. Bob Hopkins : So two questions, some product question for a Mike, but first for Omar or Gary. Now that we are closer to the close of the Covidien deal, I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more of a detail update on this synergy target as you guys have expressed, the minimum of $850 million, just as your closer and getting started with the planning, your confidence in that $850 million? If there is a potential for upsides where might that come, just want to get some comments for you -- as you close to the close? Omar Ishrak : I think, first of all, the planning is going very well. We\u2019ve got detail list now of when the -- when we are going to expect to get some of these savings. We\u2019ve risk assessed difference levels of savings and we feel pretty comfortable with the $800 million number. I think it\u2019s premature for us to talk about upsides at this stage to that number. We do have a good funnel of opportunities. But our basic priorities around preserving the two businesses and their growth profiles, their R&D expenditure, the commercial presence, I think that remains and that\u2019s important for us to protect. As you go further and further away from the customer and non-customer facing areas. Clearly there are opportunities and we are building a list, some of this will take a little longer to translate, they\u2019ve got more risk associated with it. We don\u2019t want to do anything that creates any supply disruption of our products, so we should be a little careful. So, again, I\u2019m sorry, it just a little premature to talk about upside specifics. Only to say that we feel pretty good about the baseline number that we\u2019ve committed and we\u2019re looking further areas. Gary go ahead. Bob Hopkins : Great. Gary Ellis : No. I mean, I think you said it well, I mean, the teams are clearly are down in the detail, so versus something that was kind of high level estimate when we put together. Obviously, we have much more detail plans around that number at this point in time as Omar indicated. We feel comfortable still about getting to the $850 million, there is upside, we will communicate on that when we get to that point. But we -- there is nothing gives us any pause on $850 million at this point. Bob Hopkins : Okay. Great. And then on the product side for Mike. Mike, I was wondering if you could comment on two things. First on, LINQ and then on your U.S. quad pole CRT-D lead launch and on LINQ, is that again over $100 million this quarter and could you give us any revised thoughts on how big you think that opportunity might be beside sort of the obvious comment that it could be bigger than you originally thought? And then just some qualitative comments on the quad pole launch would be great? Omar Ishrak : Sure. I think, the diagnostic area is one that we are particularly focused on as a potential growth driver, not only for the product revenue that come with LINQ and with the SEEQ patch that we have, but also because its sort of the door for improving diagnosis of patients and then also getting actively involve in patient management. And so, we see service revenue opportunity associated with those products, as well as obviously, the product revenue. So, I\u2019m not prepared to give you a quantification of how fast update the numbers that we talked about at the Analyst Meeting here earlier in the spring, but it clearly is going to -- have the potentially to be a $1 billion market, we will talk about at what time period that that\u2019s going to play out. I think the thing that is very interesting about it is, well, it\u2019s not only, obviously, the revenues that we are getting off of this particular product, but the fact that by essentially more than doubling the number of patients who are getting diagnosed for syncope. We typically get 8% or 9% pull-through on devices, pacemakers that get diagnosed, because these patients are getting effectively diagnosed with the LINQ product. So it\u2019s helping us in multiple ways creating service revenue, creating product revenue and then actually driving devices revenue of which we get a differential share. And now on the quadripolar lead system, I think it\u2019s important to sort of understand that this is a lead, but a device system that offers significant advantages over what was available in the market prior to its approvals from the standpoint that the Adaptive CRT algorithm, which minimizes biventricular pacing has been demonstrated to provide better outcomes in heart failure and now physicians no longer have to choose between having a quadripolar lead being able to select that algorithm. Secondly, the design of the lead itself, where we have this narrow dipole that some have been referring to as a tripole system, actually that narrowed dipole, is limiting the dispersion of current which is lowering the amount of phrenic nerve stimulation, which has been a problem with prior generation quadripolar lead. In addition, the fact that we have steroid on H1 gives us much better patient threshold for improving of longevity of the overall product. And then our 16 vector selection process using the VectorExpress program, basically allows high degree of efficiency to be brought into the procedure by in two minutes being able to tell what optimal vector is across 16 different options. So it really is a better product and that\u2019s why we have seen share movement that we have seen in Japan and why we expect to see share capture here in the United States. Bob Hopkins : Great. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks. Thanks, Bob. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Ben Andrew : Good morning. If you could talk a little bit more about the diabetes space, that\u2019s exceptional growth. I was hoping you could maybe talk about what you think the market is doing and then what the persistency is of patients on CGM as you start them up on the products here in the U.S.? Omar Ishrak : Sure. I\u2019m going to ask Hooman to take this question. Hooman, why don\u2019t you go ahead? Hooman Hakami : Sure. Look, the overall market for pumps is growing in the mid-to-high single digit range. Our performance there in the U.S. internationally continues to be very, very good. So we\u2019re encouraged by what we saw in Q2. In the U.S., we grew 12% overall versus prior year. And from an emerging market standpoint, we\u2019re growing exceptionally fast as well, 27% growth. So we feel good about what we see and it\u2019s really driven by the strength of our 530G System in the U.S. And that obviously drives the pump revenue but also the sensor sales as well because this is a system. And I think we can continue to see that kind of strength as we think about the second half of the year. Ben Andrew : And what about that kind of continued usage of CGM as patients go out over time. Do you see a high persistence and consistent use of the sensors, once patient start on it? Omar Ishrak : We do, actually, yeah. The fact that if the system helps, it\u2019s not a standalone sensor. But the fact that if the system and the system is regulating based on the sensor values, helps with that. So we really have here what is the therapy versus just a standalone component. And I think that helps drive the adoption of the CGM sensor. Ben Andrew : Okay. And last question, you keep talking about share gains in the U.S. but your competitor is growing over 60%. Is that consistent with the sensor growth you are seeing? How do you calculate that? Omar Ishrak : Yeah. Our sensor growth in the United States, actually, if you take a look at our overall sensor performance, just in the U.S., our sensors grew about 59% in Q2 and higher than that actually in Q1. So for the second consecutive quarter, we\u2019ve been calculating share gain in the United States for sensors. Ben Andrew : Okay. Thank you. Jeff Warren : Thanks Ben. Hey, we\u2019re past the top of the hour too. We\u2019ll take our two last questions. Operator : Our next question comes in line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Hi. Good morning. Can you guys hear me okay? Omar Ishrak : Yes, we can. Glenn Novarro : Okay. Thanks. First, for Omar, it looks like the Covidien deal is on track. And in the past quarter, Covidien announced divestiture of their drug-coated balloon. Do we anticipate any more divestitures going forward? And I had two follow-ups. Gary Ellis : I don\u2019t want to go into specifics on their regulatory process here other than to say that as far as we are concerned, they are all on track. We haven\u2019t got an approval yet. So there are still steps to kind of go through. But the fact that we called the shareholders meeting, we\u2019ve got a date for it says that we\u2019ve got some confidence that this will flow according to our original projections but it isn\u2019t done yet. So we will have to kind of see how it progresses. Glenn Novarro : Okay. And then two quickies on the legislature front. It seems like there is some growing momentum in Congress to repeal the med dev tax, so your thoughts there and then any thoughts on the R&D tax credit? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : We clearly welcome the repeal of the medical device tax. We have been close to this before and there is several compounding factors that haven\u2019t allowed that to happen. Although I agree that right now, at least from what we hear, there is a fair amount of momentum and consensus to get this one through. I mean, I really cannot comment any further than that on that aspect. As far as the R&D tax credit is concerned, we expect an extension but it has to happen. I mean, I think we are hearing all the noises that that should happen shortly. But again, I mean, these things until they are absolutely done you cannot really guarantee it. So that\u2019s where we stand. And in both cases, we are optimistic, perhaps more confident on the R&D tax credit because that\u2019s happened before. With the medical device tax, it looks better than before but we will see. There are still many variables left here. Glenn Novarro : Okay. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Time for one last question. Operator : Our final question comes from line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Brooks West : Hi. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, a quick one for you, just on the quality spend that\u2019s hitting the gross margin line, that just seems like it\u2019s dragging out a little bit further than you had anticipated. Can you talk about a resolution timeline there and how we should think about that going forward, then I have a follow-up for Omar on diabetes? Thanks. Gary Ellis : Yeah. As we indicated, obviously the biggest impact on the quality and it is basically obviously converting resources into the quality area to focus on it, from both in neuro and diabetes. We continue to make sure that we are making all the investment necessary to get that accomplish this. It\u2019s a high priority across the organization and so it\u2019s top of mind. And as a result of that, my expectation right now is I would say diabetes, I think is probably getting closer to having theirs kind of resolved and completed. And so I think that will probably start to lessen, as we get in here probably even in Q3 and Q4. I think neuro will continue probably for the rest of the year as our expectation because then as we get into FY \u201916, I think you will start to see that dropping as they continue to implement their various programs. But I think, Neuro will continue for a period of time at least for the rest of fiscal year until we get into next year but they\u2019re making progress. I think the teams feel good about where they\u2019re at but it has been costly and something that we give a high priority to as we move ahead. So I think you\u2019ll see some improvement as you go in the back half of the year. But I think that headwind still need to be part of this year and then obviously improvement as you get into FY \u201815. Brooks West : Thanks. And then Jeff, can I ask a question, a follow-up on the diabetes there? Jeff Warren : Okay. Go ahead. Brooks West : Yeah. Okay. For Hooman, I thought the structural comments on the diabetes franchise were interesting. And I\u2019m wondering how much of this is reorganization? How much of this might you need to build or acquire? And then specifically on the service and solutions, data management is interesting, is that Cardiocom? About how deep might you get into supplies and some of the other tertiary products that especially, type II diabetics might use? Thanks. Jeff Warren : Yeah. The genesis of the structure is really for us to become a much more holistic diabetes company, not just a type 1 pump and sensor company but a true global diabetes care organization. And that's really the impetus behind the organizational changes that Omar talked about in the text. If you take a look at the three business units that we\u2019ve created, the first one the intensive insulin management, this is really our core business where we\u2019re going after the type 1 patient and the intensive type 2 with product and solutions. The second one, the non-intensive diabetes therapy business is really our step into type 2 in a broad way. And this starts with the Sanofi partnership but I think you'll see from us that it\u2019s going to extend. And with Sanofi, I think, we\u2019ve got some really innovative thing on the horizon that we\u2019re both excited about. And then service and solution, this I think, absolutely can leverage Cardiocom. There is asset both within diabetes, with CareLink and across Medtronic with Cardiocom that can be leveraged as we think about patient management and data management. And you\u2019ll see some additional activity from us along these lines later this year. But I think you can even extend beyond those types of things. So I think its going to be a mixture of both organic and inorganic activity as we look to build out particularly non-intensive and also service and solution. Brooks West : Great. Thanks so much. Jeff Warren : Yes. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Well, thanks everyone for your questions. And with that and on behalf of our entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. And for those of you in the U.S., I want to wish you and your families a very happy Thanksgiving. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q3 call, which we anticipate holding on February the 17. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Vanessa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Warren. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Warren : Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning. And welcome to Medtronic's third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of Medtronic Inc.'s fiscal year 2015 third quarter which ended January 23, 2015. The acquisition of Covidien closed at the beginning of Q4 on January 26 and did not affect the Q3 operational results. Thus our comments today on Q3 results cover legacy Medtronic only. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. First, a few comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by business summary. We also updated our combined historical Covidien-Medtronic financial statement presentation to include combine financials for Medtronic\u2019s third quarter. You should note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in Medtronic\u2019s periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. With that, I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning. And thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported third quarter revenue of $4.3 billion, which represents growth of 8% and Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.01, growing 11%. EPS on a cash basis which we will be officially transitioning to in Q4 was a $1.07 and grew 10%. Q3 was a very strong quarter with revenue growth well above our outlook range for the fiscal year and exceeding our mid-single digit baseline goal. All three of our groups contributed to our robust performance with our largest group Cardiac and Vascular delivering impressive double-digit growth. Restricted therapies and diabetes also had solid quarters, both growing in the mid-single-digits. Our Q3 results were balanced from a geographic perspective with 8% growth in the U.S. and 7% growth in international markets. Our teams are executing on important product launches around the world and our customers are responding to our differentiated healthcare solutions that seek to demonstrate both clinical and economic value. Looking ahead, while our results were especially strong this quarter, I want to emphasize that our goal remains to deliver strong and consistent mid-single digit revenue growth. We believe therapy, innovation, globalization and economic value are not only the right strategy to achieve growth but that are our diversification, differentiated approach and competitive advantages will enable us to deliver dependable growth in healthcare. Importantly, following the close of Q3 we completed the acquisition of Covidien, a significant milestone in Medtronic's history. We believe that the combination of our two company's meaningfully accelerates our strategies, diversifies our growth profile and increases our financial flexibility. Over the long term we feel that our collective organization can become the leading integrated health technology and solutions partner to healthcare systems around the world. Looking now at our Q3 results we continue to quantify communicate and execute on each of our independent growth factors. Our new therapies growth vector contributed 550 basis points to our overall growth in Q3. This is over 240 basis points higher than last quarter and well above our previously stated expected range of 150 to 300 basis points. Our organization continues to develop and launched fundamental new therapies innovative new products and the related referral programs which are being received enthusiastically by our customers around the world. Gary will highlight these when he discusses our detailed business results later, but it is worth noting that CVG, RTG and diabetes all have significant ongoing product launches that are contributing to our results today as well as strong innovation pipelines to fuel our future growth. Our new therapy growth vector will be further bolstered with the addition of Covidien which has the best in new complimentary clinically and also provides two key strategic [subjects] Peripheral Vascular and Neurovascular which are expected to accelerate growth in our CVG and RTG portfolios. Our next growth vector emerging markets contributed 150 basis points to our overall growth just within our expected range. Greater China, Middle East and Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America all delivered double digit growth. The Middle East and Africa region in particular had another impressive quarter with 22% growth. This region's performance is driven in part by execution in our channel optimization strategy as we continue to connect directly with customers and align our priorities to the origin challenges of the local healthcare systems. In Turkey and Saudi Arabia we're serving more patients as these countries rapidly develop and fund healthcare infrastructure, other countries in the region are also taking large steps to improve their healthcare system and are looking for partners like Medtronic to help to achieve better quality and value. Overall we remain confident and enthusiastic in the long term outlook of emerging market we are focused in developing new public and partnerships as well as executing our channel optimization strategies. We also expect Covidien to further strengthen our presence in emerging market as we leverage or combine infrastructure customer relationships and breadth to products and services. This should enhance our ability to consistently contributed 150 to 200 basis points the Medtronic's overall growth from emerging markets. Finally services and solutions are third growth factor contributed 50 basis points to our overall growth within the 40 to 60 basis points annual range that we have targeted. We have more than doubled our services and solutions revenue over the past year. But strong growths in Cardiocom and cath lab manage service. Cardiocom grew over 20% as we've continue to develop and offer solutions to manage the broad population of heart failure patients resulting in clinical and economic benefits for the healthcare system. Cardiocom has multi-year customer agreements that produce and attractive stream of high quality recurring revenue. In cath lab managed services we continue to generate rapid growth in Europe as we are fast becoming an ideal partner for hospitals that seek to drive operational efficiency. In addition we are actively expanding our cath lab managed services business model globally with several new accounts in Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Canada. As of the end of Q3 we had over 50 long term agreements with hospital systems representing a billion dollars in revenue over the life of the contracts which have an average span of five to six years. As we look ahead we're working and converting a full pipeline of cath lab managed services contracts with hospital providers around the world. Turning to the P&L Q3 non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 11% or 13% on a constant currency basis which was above our baseline expectation to grow EPS 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue growth. Year to date we are broad EPS by 9% on a constant currency basis, 400 basis points above our constant currency revenue growth. Our organization delivered a strong operational quarter and our bottom line was further enhanced by the tax rate benefit from the extension of the U.S R&D tax credit for 2014. Gary will walk through some of these dynamics in greater details shortly. Our growth continues to feel strong free cash flow generation delivering $1.7 billion in Q3. The acquisition of Covedian gives us increased financial flexibility providing an opportunity to assess our mix of dividends and share buybacks going forward which our Board typically valuate in June. In addition it's solidifies our ability to deliver in our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. We have a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation remains extremely important we will prioritize potential M&A investments that are aligned with and strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies while at the same time offer high return metrics minimizing near term shareholder dilution. Before turning the call over to Gary I would like to discuss the integration of Covedian. We decided to complete the acquisition in early Q4 and immediately began executing the comprehensive integration plans that our two companies have developed over the past seven months. Throughout the planning process and now into the integration we\u2019ve had four clear priorities that are guiding our two organizations. These priorities are, preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. Our first and highest priority is to preserve. Both Medtronic and Covidien have been consistently executing and meeting our individual growth commitments. It must preserve the ability to both companies to continue to deliver reliable mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth as well as EPS leverage. Medtronic and Covidien are highly complementary in terms of the customers we call on the products we sell and the markets we serve. Our customer facing commercial and R&D organizations was therefore largely affected by the integration. We will be focused in minimizing our necessary disruption and delivering in our commitments has become together as company. Our second priority is to optimize to optimize our non-customer facing functions cost structures specifically we will target facility duplications, administrative redundancies, indirect cost and other back office functions. We structured detailed cost savings plans which we have already started implementing and Gary will provide more details later in the call. Our third priority is to accelerate. While there are numerous potential revenue synergies we are currently assessing and prioritizing we are focused in realizing two immediate opportunities. First, we intent to leverage Covidien\u2019s Peripheral Vascular sales force to drive sales of the recently approved IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon in addition to the entire breadth of our collective CVG Peripheral Vascular platform including Directional Atherectomy. This throughput will also continue to develop clinical evidence to support this growing area of medicine, building upon the Medtronic IN.PACT SFA and Covidien\u2019s DEFINITIVE AR studies. Second, we expect that mining Covidien\u2019s Neurovascular with our Vascular Therapies group will significantly enhance our neuroscience strategy within a comprehensive product portfolio for neurosurgeons, interventional neurologists and interventional neural-radiologists. One of Covidien\u2019s Neurovascular products worth noting is the Solitaire Revascularization Device during the International Stroke Conference last week four significant stroke products were presented that Solitaire the trials MR CLEAN, EXTEND-IA, ESCAPE and SWIFT PRIME confirmed effectiveness of stent thrombectomy and were noted some to be the most significant advancement in this space in over two decades. The findings of three of these studies have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine providing evidence to the standard of care for the treatment of stroke should be changed to stent thrombectomy as primary treatment in addition to IV-tPA. Finally, our fourth priority in combining Medtronic and Covidien is to ultimately transform healthcare. This applies to both how we innovate and develop new value based offerings to the market as well as how we partner with key stakeholders throughout the global healthcare industry to drive new transformative business models and solutions. We believe we have an opportunity to truly meet the universal needs of healthcare, improving sales outcomes, expanding access and optimizing cost and efficiency in no way -- in a way that no other company can. Our industry leading products clinical and economic expertise global footprint and financial strength position us to be the preferred partner for physician's hospital systems patient's payers and governments around the world. I have confidence in our team\u2019s ability to executive in these priorities and I am truly excited about the potential to the collective talent and expertise of our new organization to live and fulfil the Medtronic mission. Together with our partners we can alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of people around the world. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our third quarter results. Gary? Gary Ellis : Thanks Omar. Third quarter revenue of $4.318 million increased 3.7% as reported or 7.5% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for our $158 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency. On an organic basis, revenue growth was 7% after adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Q3 revenue results on a geographic basis were as follows; growth in the U.S. was 8% and represented 57% of our overall sales; non-U.S. developed markets grew 5% and represented 30% of our overall sales. And growth in emerging markets was 12% and represented 13% of our overall sales. Q3 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.01, an increase of 11%. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.98, an increase of 31%. This quarter\u2019s GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments on an after tax basis included; a $66 million charge for acquisition related items, primarily associated with transaction cost in connection with the Covidien acquisition; a $25 million gain on the micro divestiture within our Surgical Technologies Division; a $62 million gain on the sale of our remaining equity investment in Weigao which is earmarked to fund the Medtronic foundation and a payment that occurred back in Q2 and a $49 million in interest expense related to debt issued in advance to finance the Covidien transaction. It is worth noting that on a non-GAAP cash basis, Q3 dilutive earnings per share were $1.07, an increase of 10%. In our Cardiac and Vascular group revenue of $2.224 billion, grew 10%. Results were driven by strong double-digit growth on Low Power, Structural Heart, and AF & Other, along with mid-single digit growth in High Power and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular, partially offset by a modest decline in Coronary. In the Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure division revenue of $1.269 billion grew 12%, High Power revenue of $650 million, grew 4%. We estimate the global High Power market is growing modestly with low single-digit growth in international market offsetting low single digit declines in the U.S. In the U.S., we estimate we have several percentage points of High Power share since launching our Attain Performa quadripolar CRTD system. Our CRTD implant volumes which were flat prior to this launch grew nearly 20% in Q3 as the U.S. market continued to show strong preference with a combination of our AdaptivCRT algorithm and next generation quadripolar technology, which includes steroid on every electrode to reduce capture thresholds, short middle electrode spacing to reduce peripheral nerve simulation and fast vector express programming. In the quarter, the FDA approved two additional versions of our quadripolar leads the Straight and S-shape giving even more options to electro physiologists. U.S. High Power growth also benefitted from accelerating adoption of the TYRX anti-envelop technology for use in high risk implant procedures. We assigned our first TYRX risks sharing agreement and have a strong pipeline of U.S. hospitals interested in partnering in this innovative business model. In January, we started enrolment in our 7,000 patient rapid trial which is assessing the clinical and economic defectiveness of TYRX. We expect results from this trial in FY18. In Japan, we launched Evera MRI SureScan ICD in the quarter. Evera MRI, which allows the full body MRI scan is garnering strong adoption of the Japanese market resulting an 13 percentage points of ICD share gain in Japan this quarter. Low Power revenue of $489 million grew 17%, driven by continued strong global launch of Reveal LINQ. We continue to see strong adoption of this innovative diagnostic with daily implant growth up in the high single-digit sequentially. Looking at the U.S. pacing market, we were pleased to see improvements in both initial implant volumes and our overall market-share driven by the continued mix shift toward Advisa MRI and growing pay sneaker pull through from the expanded use of Reveal LINQ in patients with unexplained sympathy. In Japan, we continue to see good traction of our Advisa MRI pace maker, while our share remains over 250 basis points above prelaunch levels despite competitive entrance. Looking ahead, we have completed the enrolment basis of our U.S. and CE Mark clinical trials for our micro transcatheter patient system and expect CE Mark by the end of this quarter with U.S. approval to follow in FY17. AF Solutions grew over 30%, globally driven by continued robust growth of our Arctic Front Advance CryoAblation System. Leveraging the increasing body of clinical and economic evidence on safety, efficacy and procedural efficiency of Arctic Front, we continue to take AF ablation share growing nearly twice as fast as the overall AF market, despite new competitor product introductions. Turning to our Coronary & Structural Heart division, revenue of $737 million grew 8%, our Coronary business declined 2% with our global drug-eluting stent revenue share declining slightly as we began to enter our next new product introduction cycle. The international launch of our Resolute Onyx DES occurred late in Q3 and is off to a good start. Resolute Onyx builds on a superior deliverability and proven clinical performance of Resolute integrity, with finished drugs to improve deliverability even further. It is the first stent to feature our core wire technology, which markedly enhances visibility. In our broader Coronary product portfolio, Q3 saw the continued rollout of our new NC Euphora Noncompliant PTCA Balloon family, as well as strong sequential growth in U.S. revenues from our FFR co-promotion alliance with Acist Medical Systems. In renal denervation, we remain confident in our leadership in this field. Since the results of HTN-3 we have analysed compounding factors of that trial performed, ground rating preclinical research and engaged numerous expert physicians to stakeholders. In the coming days, we plan to formerly submit the U.S. IDE to our global clinical program and we look forward to providing further details in the future. Our Structural Heart business grew 22% driven by another strong quarter in transcatheter valves which grew over 60%. Our U.S. launch of CoreValve continues to drives growth and we estimate this resulted in U.S. sequential share gains. In addition, hospital customers are reacting positively to the new TAVR DRGs which were established in October and in general resulted in improved reimbursement and hospital economics for institutions looking to establish TAVR programs. Enrolment in our CoreValve Evolut R U.S study is well underway and we continue to plan for U.S launch in mid FY16. Evolut R is our next-generation recapturable system, with a differentiated 14 French equivalent delivery system. In international markets we receive CE Mark for the Evolut R 26 and 29 millimetre valves broadening our size offerings for this innovative platform into the largest segments of the market. Looking ahead we expect the global TAVR market to grow on the 20% or 25% range over the next year. In our aortic and peripheral vascular division revenue of $218 million grew 5% aortic revenue grew 3% led by strong growth and in thoracic. In AAA the launch of the Endurant IIs a unique three piece version of our market leading Endurant platform is off to a good start. Revenue for our Peripheral business grew 16% in Q3. During the quarter we received U.S FDA approval for our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon for use in the upper lay. While this did not contribute revenue in Q3 as first commercial U.S implants occurred earlier this month. In addition 12 months results of the landmark IN.PACT Admiral DCB study were published online in the journal circulation in December showing the highest rate of primary patency and lowest rate of clinically driven TLR ever reported from a study of interventional treatments for peripheral artery disease in the upper lay. We expect our IN.PACT Admiral DCB to drive growth in peripheral in the coming quarters and we plan to broaden the launch and have our Covidien peripheral sales force start selling the product later this month. Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group, revenue of $1.645 billion grew 5% with all three divisions contributing to growth. Results were driven by double digit growth in Surgical Technologies, mid-single growth in Neuromodulation and low single digit in Spine. Spine revenue of 740 million grew 2% both the global and U.S Spine markets grew at the low single digits, the third quarter in a row of modest sequential improvement. Our core Spine business grew 1% in Q3. We are seeing good option of our recently launched Pure Titanium Coating inter body fusion devices, the PRESTIGE LP artificial cervical disc, and our new Divergence Anterior Cervical Fusion System. We recently received have FDA approval for our divergence standalone system and [Zibo] anterior fixation system. FY15 is an important for product and launches in our core spine business and as we have noted all year we expect this to support a return to modest growth for our overall spine business in FY15. In addition to working with surgeons to develop leading differentiated technologies in spine our business continues to focus on procedural innovation. Sales and product to perform our OLF25 procedure grew nearly 30%, this innovative minimally invasive procedure utilizes an oblique trajectory to avoid nerve bundles psoas muscle providing an alternative to lateral approaches that are depended on nerve monitoring. We also continue to evolve and deploy our differentiated surgical synergy program which integrates our enabling technologies, surgical tools spinal implants and expertise to improve surgical outcomes and efficiencies, we now estimate that 16% of our thoracolumbar procedures use our proprietary PowerEase system, of power surgical instruments and over 20% use our StealthStation surgical and navigation technology. Interventional Spine, which primarily consists of our balloon kyphoplasty product line, had stable sales in Q3. The business had low single digit growth in U.S and mid-teens growth in Japan offset by declines in Europe where the business experienced pricing pressure in Germany. BMP sales of $122 million grew 9% with stable underlying demand we do believe we have turn the corner end but expect BMP sales growth to be slightly positive going forward. Turning to Surgical Technologies, revenue of $418 million grew 11% Surgical Technologies had solid balanced growth contribution from all three of its businesses Neurosurgery, ENT and Advanced Energy. Neurosurgery had double digit growth with strong sales of Midas Rex power equipment and O-arm Surgical Imaging System. ENT grew in the upper single digits driven by the recent launches of a StraightShot M5 Microdebrider in the NuVent sinus balloon. In Advance Energy strong adaption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue sealing, and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies drove solid mid-teens growth. In Neuromodulation revenue of $487 million increased 5% led by upper single digit growth in our Gastro to Uro and DBS businesses. Gatro or Uro had a strong quarter InterStim sales worldwide. In DBS our global focus on neurologist referral programs and the strength of the early stim data in international markets continues to drive solid growth. In Pain stim we estimate the U.S market is declining in the mid-single digits as slower travelling activity is effecting new implant growth. However we estimate we gained modest U.S market share and maintained our global share on the strength of our RestoreSensor SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system with its proprietary AdaptiveStim automatic stimulation adjustment feature and access to MRI scans anywhere in the body. In our diabetes group revenue of $449 million grew 6%. However, after adjusting for the $23 million in deferred revenue that was recognized in Q3 last year, the group grew 12%. Diabetes had a strong quarter in international growing 12% including growth of 36% in emerging markets. In the U.S. we continued to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 530G System with Enlite CGM sensor. We recently announced the results of a retrospective analysis from over 20,000 MiniMed 530G users in the Journal of Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics which found that the pump's Threshold Suspend feature reduced hypoglycemia by 69% with even greater benefit at night without significantly increasing hypoglycemia. We were also pleased that the U.S. FDA lifted the warning letter on our diabetes business in late December. In international, we began the limited launch in select markets of our next generation MiniMed 640G System with the Enhanced Enlite CGM sensor. In addition to incorporating a brand new insulin pump design and user interface, the MiniMed 640G System features SmartGuard technology, which automatically suspends insulin delivery when sensor glucose levels are predicted to approach a low limit and then resumes insulin delivery once levels recover. We continue to make progress in bringing this technology to the U.S. and plan to submit the PMA to the system later this calendar year. The predictive low glucose management clinical study associated with this PMA is underway which is studying our next generation insulin pump and fourth generation CGM sensor. This sensor has new intelligent diagnostics that are expected to result in enhanced accuracy and it is 80% smaller than the Enlite sensor currently sold in the U.S. Turning to the rest of the income statement, in addition to commenting on our Q3 results I will also make some forward-looking comments which are based upon the combination of both Medtronic and Covidien P&Ls and also reflect a number of reclassifications that we have made to the Covidien P&L in order to be consistent. Information on each re-classes is available on the footnote section of the combined historical Covidien Medtronic financial statement presentation on our investor Web site. The Q3 gross margin was 73.9% and included 20 basis points of negative impact from foreign currency. The gross margin continues to include significant spending related to resources diverted to address quality issues in neuromodulation. The Q3 gross margin was also negative impacted by product mix shift toward diagnostic and AF products in CRHF and the acquisition of NGC Medical. NGC Medical which was acquired in Q2 has a gross margin which is similar to our existing cath lab managing services business and is significantly below our corporate average. However, NGC and cath lab managing service have operating margins that are closer to corporate average due to the lower spending on SG&A and R&D. Looking ahead for the newly combined company after taking into account the Covidien reclassifications I mentioned earlier we would expect gross margins to be more in the 69% to 71% range on an operational basis. This outlook does not include the impact of the Covidien inventory step up arising from the purchase accounting rules. Third quarter R&D spending of $373 million was 8.6% of revenue. We are pleased that are past R&D investments are resulting in faster organic revenue growth and we continue to invest in new technologies as well generating clinical and economic evidence to drive future growth. When you combine Medtronic and Covidien we would expect R&D expense to be more in the range of 7% and 7.5%. Third quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.487 million represented 34.4% of sales. Q3 SG&A on a constant currency basis was 34.3%. Looking ahead in addition to the reclassifications this is the line item that will reflect most of the benefits from our cost synergy initiatives. Taking this into account as well as the pre-existing leverage initiatives of both Medtronic and Covidien combined SG&A in the range of 32% to 33% on an operational basis seems reasonable in Q4. Amortization expense for the quarter was $89 million. For Q4 we would expect the combined company amortization expense to be in the range of $450 million to $600 million reflecting the impact of the Covidien acquisition. This is a wide range as the preliminary purchase accounting and related amortization of intangibles have not yet been determined and likely won\u2019t be until the end of the quarter. It is worth noting that we will be shifting in Q4 to cash earnings per share and thus will exclude this expense from our non-GAAP earnings. Net other expense for the quarter was $24 million including net gains from our hedging programs of $54 million. We hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. However a growing portion of our profits are un-hedged especially emerging market currencies which can create some modest volatility in our earnings. As I will talk about in a moment the mix of our earnings that are un-hedged will increase further with the addition of Covidien. Based on the current exchange rates as well as the reclassifications of the combined company net other expense in the fourth quarter for the combined company is expected to be in the range of 35 to 60. Q3 net interest expense on a non-GAAP basis was $4 million, after adjusting for the $77 million incremental net interest expense related to our December 2014, $17 billion bond offering used to fund the Covidien acquisition. While we excluded this incremental interest expense from our non-GAAP earnings this quarter because of the difference in timing between the debt issuance and the closing on the acquisition, we will include the incremental interest expense on our non-GAAP earnings going forward. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $31.1 billion in cash investments and $28.8 billion in debt, subsequent to Q3 there are number of items that will affect our year-end cash and debt balances including revision of our $3 billion term loan, the approximately $16 billion cash consideration paid for Covidien, the addition of approximately $5.5 billion in previously held Covidien debt at fair value and $2 billion in cash and the $1.2 billion in debt maturing in March which will entire using existing cash. Based on current rates, we would expect Q4 net interest expense for the combined company to be in the range of $195 million to $250 million. Our non-GAAP, our tax rate in Q3 was 17.1%, included in our -- this quarter tax rate is a $29 million benefit associated with the extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. It is worth noting that on a combined company basis, the non-GAAP normal tax rate excluding amortization has been running in the range of 18% to 19%. And as we have noted in the past, the combined tax rate going forward could be approximately 2 percentage points better. In Q3, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. In Q3, we paid $300 million in dividends and there were no share repurchases giving restrictions related to the Covidien acquisition. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 34 million shares and we intent to restart our share repurchase program later in Q4 pending Irish core administrative approval which we expected in early March. Third quarter average shares outstanding on our dilutive basis were 996 million shares. It is important to note that we expect the cash where you see from stock option redemptions which was a $165 million from Q3 will also continue to be use to repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. For Q4 we would expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 1.440 billion shares reflecting the shares issued in the Covidien acquisition. Next I would like to comment on our revenue outlook for the fourth quarter, which will be our first quarter reporting combine Medtronic-Covidien results. For the fourth quarter, we believe constant currency revenue growth of 46% on a combined pro forma basis is reasonable and we expect to be in the upper part of the range. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you a sense of the FX impact if the exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, our Q4 revenue will be negatively affected by approximately $420 million to $480 million which will result in reported revenue on an actual FX basis of approximately $7 billion to $7.1 billion. Taking into account our revenue and P&L comments that I have already covered, it would not be surprising to see models from our Q4 cash earnings per share somewhere in the broad range of a $1.08 to $1.13. Next I would like to provide some high level framing comments on fiscal year 2016. While we intent to give our revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance for our normal practise in our Q4 call, given the changes result in from the addition of Covidien here are some items to keep in mind as we think about our next fiscal year. First on revenue growth, while we are not formerly providing our FY16 revenue outlook, we believe it is reasonable to think about our revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis consistent with our baseline expectations. Next keep in mind that we will have an extra selling week from the first quarter of FY6, which we would estimate to have an impact of approximately 100 basis points to 150 basis points of incremental revenue growth for the full fiscal year or approximately 400 basis points to 600 basis points in Q1. This gives us increase confidence that we could be in the upper half of the mid-single-digit revenue growth baseline expectation in FY16. Regarding foreign exchange, the significant strengthening of U.S. dollar represents a strong potential headwind in FY16, even though our legacy Medtronic businesses continue to realize the benefit of our hedging program on major developed market currencies, it is not possible to completely hedge FY16 and FY15 rates given to-date exchange rates. This would result in our legacy Medtronic businesses to experience a negative impact from foreign currency albeit somewhat mitigated by the benefit of our hedging program. At the same time the legacy Covidien business does not have the same benefit today. Taken together if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday's broad FY16, our combined FY16 revenue will be negatively affected by approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. On a bottom-line based on today\u2019s rates, this could translate into our $0.30 to $0.40 negative impact to earnings per share. Turning to our focus on cost synergies as Omar had mentioned cost synergy activities are underway and we are in the process of finalizing our FY '16 targets. We are targeting over $850 million in cost synergies to FY '18, in terms of timing it is reasonable to straight line these statements over the three years and our organization will be working hard to exceed this goal. Also looking ahead I will like to note that we anticipate holding our Q4 earnings call before market opens on June 2nd. This is two weeks later than our normal timing as this will the first quarter where Covidien results will be combined in our financial reports. However we do believe we will have an earlier view on our revenue results and we will plan to pre-release revenue on May 19. I will now turn the call back over to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Gary and before opening the lines for Q&A let me briefly conclude by reiterating that Q3 was a strong quarter for Medtronic. And as we look ahead we're excited to welcome Covidien in to our organization the operational momentum of both organizations is moving in the right direction giving us increased confidence in the future. This does not happen without a lot of hard work and discipline. I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to both the Medtronic and Covidien teams for staying focused, avoiding any distractions and delivering on their commitments during this transition period. While there are a number of moving parts in the financials as we combine the two companies and we are facing increased headwinds in the near term for foreign currency. Our priorities to sustain the operational performance of the company striving to reliably deliver in our baseline financial model mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth constant currency EPS growth 200 basis points to 400 basis points faster and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. To achieve these goals we continue to execute in our pre-primary growth strategies therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. We believe our acquisition of Covidien were meaningfully compliment and accelerate all three of these strategies strengthening our long term market competiveness as well as driving further sustainability and consistency in our long term financial performance. With that we will now open the phone lines for Q&A in addition to Gary I've asked Mike Coyle President for Cardiac & Vascular Group, Chris O'Connell President for Restorative Therapies Group and Hooman Hakami President of our Diabetes Group top join us. In the future we intend to have Bryan Hanson the new leader of the Covidien Group and in earnings call. We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions so please limit yourself to only one question and if needed only one related follow up. If you have additional questions please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please? Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein. Mike Weinstein : Good morning, Omar, and obviously congratulations on a very strong quarter for the Company. Let me start with a couple of items now that the transaction has closed. One, was hoping you could give us an update on your thoughts on capital allocation. You talked about the 50% return commitment and that is still in place. Can you give us updated thoughts on the split between dividend and buyback? And second, there is a number of drivers this quarter really over the last couple of quarters that have been from new products but also in some cases your market is getting better and you are gaining share in those markets. Can you just talk about the sustainability as we think about FY16 and start to think about our pro forma models? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Let's take both your points, first of all in terms of the recurring to shareholders like we mentioned earlier our commitment remains first to sort of firm up our commitment and almost guarantee the fact that we can return 50% of our cash flow to shareholders. So that\u2019s an important element of the Covidien transaction it enables us to do that. Now within that as you point out the mix between dividend and share buyback and something we've been considering we will think about changing that ratio. We think we have the capacity to do that. However, lots of moving parts right now and we need to kind of settle on exactly what we have, we've got we need board approval, the board meeting happen in June. So really until then we cannot make any firm pronouncement, what I will say is that our intention is to make a commitments that we can stick to that we will say something in a balanced fashion that you can rely on in the future and we're certainly looking at changing the mix to increase amount of dividend. Gary do you want to add to that. Gary Ellis : No I think that\u2019s right, as we've indicated there is a process we need to go through, we needed to kind of see over the next couple of quarters how things play out in the normal process as the Board will look at this split in the June timeframe and that\u2019s when we would intent to discuss with them. Omar Ishrak : With respect to your second point Mike I agree that there were lots of new products that helped us and so we had revenue growth actually overall mid-single digit targets fuelled by lot of the new products and improving markets like you point out. Now we have a pretty rich pipeline if you think about it the drug coated balloons going to come out, in diabetes we have the 640 G in Europe which has just launched we've got a series of new products that are coming out. So we have some level of sustainability in terms of the product releases. But let me just say that the more important point here is the mid-single digit growth. There will be quarters where you go hopefully only up rather than down but our real goal here is to sustain this mid-single digit trajectory through diversification of our product lines and businesses diversification of our geographies where we get the growth from particularly from emerging markets and diversifying within emerging markets as well and finally diversifying as to the nature of the revenue more service revenues. And so if you do all of that we think we can get a business that can deliver consistently in the mid-single digits. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re reviewing on rather than swings one way or the other that may happen from quarter to quarter. Mike Weinstein : Gary, from your FY16 commentary, there was a number of puts and takes there and the challenge with the Street as you have seen with other companies over the last several weeks has been to stay on top of FX and the impact that has on each companies' earnings. Right now the Street seems to be aggregating around roughly 445 for FY16. Any preliminary thoughts on whether that is roughly the right range? Whether FX is appropriately reflected in that type of number? Gary Ellis : Obviously we\u2019re not giving guidance yet for FY16 and so I don\u2019t want to comment unnecessarily on whether the 445 is right or now. But I do think back to your point Mike I think what I have seen is many people are updating their models for foreign exchange and challenging that. I mean that\u2019s the biggest thing as we go through -- we\u2019re going right to our planning process as we speak and so we\u2019re trying to get a handle on this and understand as we go forward. I think most models seems to have a pretty good sense on it and kind of that as I indicated in my comments now that the $0.35 to $0.40 range is kind of where I think most people are landing somewhere little bit lower than that. I mean the issue that we have to understand is based on today\u2019s rates and the reality is that foreign exchange rates I mean they have weakened another 5% versus additionally impact on that especially until we can get Covidien into our hedging program as we move forward because Covidien in effect for all intents and purposes is not hedged and that\u2019s going to increase our volatility until we can get that into our own program here. So I think right now many models have an updated for foreign exchange which I think is appropriate and that\u2019s reflected in the models and as a result of that I think in all the other parameters assuming that they put in the right interest expense and assume the kind of the operational growth and synergies that we\u2019ve talked about I think you\u2019re probably getting the range here discussing but again we\u2019re not giving any guidance right now for FY16. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis. David Lewis : Gary, I wonder if we could come back to margins for a second here. Your gross margins have been under pressure the last couple of quarters but actually this quarter they reversed that slide. I wonder if you could shift focus from gross margins to operating margins and specifically on two points. If you think about your organic growth rate, that is the highlight of this quarter, organic growth has doubled for Medtronic the last four quarters but EBITDA is still flat to down. I wonder if you could walk us through kind of EBIT commentary in your mind the last four quarters as you have for gross margin the last couple of quarters. And secondarily, as I think about your pro forma guidance with Covidien for the fourth quarter, SG&A is actually stronger or there is more leverage than what we would expect so maybe talk to us about that $850 million synergy number what we can imply about that $850 million number and how conservative it may be based on your stronger than expected fourth-quarter SG&A guidance? Gary Ellis : Yes, well overall I mean first of all you have to understand as we go forward on lot of these things there is going to be re-classes between how Covidien has been classifying their numbers and so to be consistent with Medtronic and so it\u2019s even harder to take a look at some of the percentages and versus where Medtronic historically has been and to make some sense out of that so I would just encourage all of you to go their investor Web site where the IR team has tried to laid out on a pro forma basis give you kind of perspective on what it looks like when you get the re-classes in there and look at the combined companies. As you indicated I mean gross margin overall which has been under a little bit of pressure especially within Medtronic itself we\u2019re starting to see some improvement in that area overall we still expect there is more there we\u2019re getting some favorable manufacturing variances being generated we\u2019re getting -- and we\u2019re seeing some of the quality cost for example that\u2019s declining now in diabetes where we\u2019ll expect that to occur over time here in nueromodulation. So from a Medtronic legacy perspective the gross margin as we expected we would expect to see a kind of improving with the exception of the mix issue that I mentioned also in my comments which is the fact that as NGC and some of these service businesses become more and more prevalent those are going to have a negative impact on the gross margin but not necessarily the operating margin. Back to your exact point what we really think we need to do is start focusing more as a company on the operating margin of the organization because that\u2019s where really where the profits are going to be generated and Covidien has lower margins in some of their businesses clearly their service model has a different or gross margin I should say but the operating margins of all these organizations are basically consistent with where Medtronic is at. And back to your point that\u2019s where our focus is, is to increase and drive operating margin improvements in performance. That is going to come from the standpoint primarily of the SG&A leverage as we discussed. Fourth quarter is always a lower percentage just on the standpoint that we have as our highest revenue month and just as a percentage of revenue the spending tends to be better in that quarter naturally, as you look historically that\u2019s normally what you would see. You put that on top of the fact that we go forward we will start to see some of the synergies industry starting to play out some in Q4 although not as much as we get into FY16 as we initiated right now we kind of straight-line those that $850 million kind of in for the FY16 we're still detail finding exactly how that will play out but that's a good assumption right now and obviously we can accelerate and drive the $850 million more we will do that. I mean that\u2019s the commitment we have at this point in time but we will -- and that\u2019s on top of the synergy of the organization both Covidien and Medtronic already had as far as synergies we\u2019re going to try to focus on. So the operating margins of the organization especially on a combined basis going forward with those initiatives that both companies had plus the synergies will continue to improve as you go forward into the next several years. You have to be little careful taking a look and saying what\u2019s happened to operating margins or EBIT margins right now, that currency has an impact on this because the gains and losses are -- those dollar are non-operating expense or other income and expense line items the gains are back down there, so you just -- you have to pull although into consideration and taking a look at this what's really happening with our even operating margins. But in general we\u2019re happy earnings per share is growing very nicely and currently exceeding our leverage targets that we\u2019ve indicated as we go forward. So, we\u2019re achieving the overall objectives and we\u2019re managing the business on bottom line growth. David Lewis : And Gary the other area that helps to offset some of the currency pressure, next year obviously could be taxed, could you just give us an update on where Medtronic or core Medtronic sits with the IRS tax settlement and timing there? And secondarily can we assume the fourth quarter tax number is a good predictor of 2016 or not necessarily? Thank you. Gary Ellis : Yes, as far as the tax case, we're really in the past right now the case is being heard, this is the Puerto Rico transfer price dispute that we have with the IRS, heard as we speak. We expect that will continue over the next several weeks before the trial will be concluded. And then it will depend on how much time after that it takes for the court to reach a decision and make a decision where we\u2019re at, but we would expect that could be anywhere, I mean that could be several six to 12 months, I mean that could be a while out before we actually get a response from the decision on that one. So, we\u2019re not necessary expecting anything in FY16 at this point in time, obviously that will be a positive if that happens, but we\u2019re not expecting anything currently in FY16. The tax rate for the Q4 and kind of general direction that we gave you, that\u2019s probably directionally still what we would say is where we're expecting that as we go forward, the combine rates of the two companies on a cash tax rate basis have been kind of in that 18% to 19%. We expect -- still expect that there is at least 200 basis point improvement on that just releases the financing cost as we get a better sense of that -- as we go into FY16 we\u2019ll give more updates, but right now that\u2019s still a good assumption to use. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Congratulations on the quarter and closing Covidien. Just wanted to return to some of the comments that you had made earlier just on the growth profile of being mid-single digits and driving 200 to 400 basis points of leverage. I am just curious given some of the tax advantages that you will see next year as well as the cost synergies, why can't Medtronic be more of a mid-single digit, double-digit EPS growth profile company at least more in the medium term? Omar Ishrak : Well a number of things, first of all we want to stick to mid-single digits and we did say there's 200 basis points to 400 basis points of EPS leverage on top of that. To deliver that in a sustained basis is you got lots of variables you're going to take into account, you\u2019ve got market surprises and other things that could absorb, so we just want to be a little cautious as to what we put out there. We also think that the total shareholder return it includes the return that you get from the dividend actually takes into double digit total return, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at, anything beyond that at this point is premature for us, I realize that there is synergies which we will get -- which will give us some enhancement of our operating leverage, but at the same time we\u2019ve got variables to do with increasing our dividend versus what we do in terms of share buyback which we will look at. So there is lots of moving parts Kristen that we\u2019re going to look at before we make a pronouncement and we think that overall double-digit total shareholder return is a pretty attractive proposition for company of this size especially if you can rely on that consistently. So again we think that that\u2019s a reasonable sort of goal that we can have again reliability, consistency, sustainability comes first in mind before we get too eager about trying to bug these numbers up too high. Kristen Stewart : And then just I guess a more micro question, just on the CRM market I was wondering if we could just kind of walk through and balance some of your commentary around the success that you have been having on the high-powered side and yet it looks like your US growth rate was just about 1%. So maybe just share your view on the overall market. And then also just on the low power side, what you think the pacemaker market is doing? Obviously LINQ has been a big driver to the performance there. Maybe some comments just around that underlying business as well. Mike Coyle : On a high power side we think globally it's still fairly flat in terms of the overall growth of the market our growth at 4% obviously represents some market share capture and the three primary drivers that will were kind of highlighted in the script the adaptive CRT and the Quadripolar lead release that we've had in the U.S has been driving market share. We think on an initials basis we're up roughly 10 points in initial market share in the CRT-D segment of the market here since the launch of those products and those have been having a nice effect on our overall growth, in addition in international in Japan the MRI safe ICD market entry has been driving significant initial market share as well. And then the TYRX product line, the anti-effective coating, it actually impacts pacing and ICD has a bigger impact on ICDs in terms of our ability to use it to both drive ASP and to drive share in replacement. So those have been the primary drivers on a high power side. On the lower power side the overall market using our kind of two quarter averaging convention is up roughly 5% inclusive of diagnostics but frankly diagnostics is the driver there and if you looked in just core pacing, the therapeutic pacing you'd see a low single digit decline on a constant currency basis for the overall market. We're obviously driving that diagnostics revenue growth and even within the pacing side we are taking market share on a mix shift towards the advice MRI pacing products in the U.S and it basically is also helping us drive growth in that area. So those are primary drivers on the implantable size. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Just as a follow-up, I guess, if you've take nearly 10 percentage points of share in CRT just in the US, I guess I would have thought that the high power business would have been up more than 1% this quarter. Is there a comp issue or is there something else moving the numbers within there? And how big should we expect diagnostics to really be? It seems like you are going to far exceed the number that you put out at the investor day back in June. Mike Coyle : On the question prior quarter comps we have been for the last several quarters deliberately trying to take down the number of products solid in quarter end bundles, because obviously there is discounting associated with those that we would rather not be doing. And so we have seen in each of the last couple of quarters a fairly significant destocking of hospital inventories that\u2019s included in the numbers that was particularly pronounced last quarter which is why you saw 5% growth even that we were really on an underlying basis closer to 7% growth for CBG. So that continued in this quarter not as dramatically as it was last quarter and we think we're coming to the end of that where the comparables will be fairly flat year over year going forward. The other question was diagnostics, so we said we believe this is sort of the next billion product segment for us we obviously see three patient populations driving the penetration rates we've seen. We have seen syncope, atrial fibrillation, cryptogenic stroke all of those are very under penetrated and in fact most of the revenue growth we've seen in that product segment has been concentrated to U.S and Germany and UK. So we think that there is plenty of opportunity to continue penetrating into those patient populations as well as to continue to growth of that its other geographies. So again we're going start to run into tougher comps going forward the linked product which we released mid quarter fourth quarter last year as well as frankly CoreValve with the U.S. So those are going to become tougher comps but on the other hand we have obviously numerous new product drivers that Omar mentioned including the DCB in the U.S the ability to use that to drive share of Covidien products in the Peripheral space. The Onyx product and DES in Europe the 26 and 29 CoreValve products in Europe and as I said the continued penetration of things like LINQ and TYRX into other geographies beyond the U.S. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs. David Roman : Good morning, everybody. I wanted just to start, Gary, if you could go into a little bit more detail around cash access. I know what you have disclosed so far is that you should be able to get about 60% of your annual free cash flow in an unencumbered manner post the Covidien transaction. But I also think you've talked about that number potentially raising over time. Can you maybe just help us understand the mechanics of what drives that number higher and where that could ultimately go directionally speaking over time? Gary Ellis : Yes as we've indicated before the transaction now being completed. What we basically have is the -- where we about 35% of Medtronic legacy cash flow was in effect available and 65% was in effect unavailable for use in the U.S that now with Covidien we pull all Covidien in effect is available. So just normal numbers to open 35% of Medtronic to basically about 60% of the combined company will have cash that is un-trapped and available going forward. This as a result of combining the two organizations and the two companies. And that\u2019s the legacy Medtronic trap fees continues to be that way going forward based on how the tax rules work. And as a result of that what occurs over time however will be as over time as you have more and more the cash flow being generated from in effect un-trapped subsidiaries or un-trapped parts of the organization then your cash flow will start to improve from that 60% to whether it 65%, 70%, 75% over time. But that occurs as that basically product shift and you get cash coming from basically un-trapped locations. You can\u2019t just make changes without making basically product shifts and making some decisions that really organizationally and operationally shift where the cash is being generated. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to take time as you\u2019ve heard as the organizations -- both organizations continue to grow and as we make investments in new product innovation going forward. David Roman : Okay, that is helpful. Then maybe just a follow-up on the more strategic side. Omar, I know you have talked a lot about the opportunity that exists to sell products like the drug coated balloon through the Covidien peripheral salesforce. But as I think about other product categories that you haven't highlighted as much, maybe you could talk about the opportunities in neurovascular for example given your presence with the neurosurgeon whether it is through neuromodulation or spine? And then also the potential to pull through some of the general surgery technologies that are used any way in the vast majority of the procedures that Medtronic is performing across the entire suite? Omar Ishrak : We just wanted to take this whole thing a step at a time and like I mentioned we\u2019ve had two clear businesses which are separable which we are integrating into the RTG and CVG group so you -- obviously we understand the drug coated balloon but also the Neurovascular business is being integrated into our RTG group which will enable us to have a more comprehensive offering into the neuroscience departments. And I\u2019ll let Chris comment on that in a minute. With respect to the other areas sure in concept there is lots of pieces where we can sell together. But right now if the two businesses simply preserve their growth trajectories and we get the benefits from these two kind of tuck-ins so to speak we\u2019ll create a pretty good business which is reliable which can deliver consistently and we don\u2019t want to risk any distractions through any complicated cross selling methods and sales teams incentives getting even different from what it was before in the short term because the risk of distraction and losing momentum in those areas can be very high. So therefore we think that a step at a time, over time some of those technologies show that there are opportunities for one sales force to have a broader basket of products depending on who the customers are. What I will point out is that our philosophy here starts with the customer and the physician and then works back to the technology we don\u2019t start with the technology. So if customers require us, require products that come from some other group or division, that makes sense for the usage we will put it through that channel. We don\u2019t want to force that technologies into places where customers aren\u2019t necessarily using them. And if you really look at this slew of surgical technology products although in principal there is a lot of shared technology their usage amongst customers is actually quite separated. And we want to understand that carefully before we start doing any sorts of integration. But I\u2019ll let Chris actually comment on the neuroscience strategy which I think is shorter term and quite exciting. Chris go ahead. Chris O'Connell: Sure, thank you. Yes, the Neurovascular opportunity is really exciting for Medtronic really the first priority as we get into that though is to help the Neurovascular organization get off the ground with the mechanical thrombectomy market growth and therapy penetration given the new clinical evidence that\u2019s come out into the market that Omar referenced earlier. And obviously we have a lot to contribute to that given our depths of expertise in market development. So that\u2019s really priority number one. But clearly the opportunities to leverage that therapy in our broader neuroscience strategy is there just a reminder of three main users of mechanical thrombectomy number one is the interventional neuroradiologist, number two is the neurosurgeon who is trained in endovascular techniques and the third just smaller one is interventional neurology. The market particularly in the U.S. is trending towards the neurosurgeon and as you know we have seven major product categories serving the neurosurgeon today across RTG of which we\u2019re number one in every segment. This is the one category we\u2019re not -- we\u2019ve not been present in and so the opportunity to cross sell and partner with neuroscience centers is obviously very strong and we\u2019re just in the early phases of that and we look forward to providing more information on that opportunity going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Congrats on a very strong revenue quarter. A question for Gary. It looked like it was also a really good free cash flow quarter for you. I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense as to as you close the transaction, what is the free cash flow generation of the combined entity as you sit here today? I know it obviously improves over time but just right out of the chute, what is the free cash flow coming out of this combined entity in your view? Gary Ellis : Well, we did have a very strong free cash flow of this quarter now that\u2019s historical our Q3 tends to be one of the highest free cash flow quarter generations for us. And so Q1 starts out little slower and Q3 tends to be the strongest and so we saw that again this quarter and was very strong. There are some other things in the quarter, I mean obviously for example I would tell you one thing that helped our free cash flow is the hedging contract that we do have, we get hedge accounting from the P&L perspective, but basically those hedge contracts are collateralized and so actually we\u2019re receiving cash on those as we have gains obviously on some of the contracts going forward and that was a couple of hundred million dollars of impact in the quarter which was a positive obviously from a cash flow perspective but it really relates to gains that will be recognized in future quarters as we go forward, but in general your come as right Bob that it was a very strong free cash flow and we\u2019re comfortable that both Covidien and ourselves continue to generate a very strong cash flow. I mean I think the number that we\u2019re looking at right now on a kind of a combined basis just kind of starting off to shoot if you look to both companies is you are somewhere in the ballpark of $7 billion of kind of a free cash flow going ahead. Now that\u2019s obviously going to be impacted a little bit by this FX issue I mentioned that we have to understand exactly the impact of the foreign exchange on the cash flow, but in general if you just look at the two companies in the cash flow generation and the increase you would normally expect from that, I would say you are somewhere in that kind of around that $7 billion\u2026 Bob Hopkins : And then as a follow-up real quickly, why wouldn't the tax shield kick in right away relative to that 18% and 19%? Omar, I was wondering if you could just comment on which markets in the US do you think are improving? A lot of your growth is Medtronic product driven but it does feel like especially in the US certain markets are improving and getting better here. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : I think you're right look in general the overall sense that we get in the U.S. is improving across the board actually, but clearly given where the CRM market has been, I think there is clear improvement in some of those areas, on top of that you got to remember we\u2019re a fairly big player here or the biggest player in certainly the CRM market and as our products are successful it actually grows the market up with us and things like the LINQ product, we don\u2019t know for sure, but we\u2019re pretty confident that it's bringing in increased sales of other implantable devices along with it and that will reflect on a stronger market. So because of our share position and I think if we succeed to pull that market with us, so I\u2019ve got to say that from an overall market perspective if I were to buy in any way in the U.S. it's got to be in the CRM that we probably see an uptick in the market growth. But overall you can read the provider earnings just like we can and they appear to be strong that means the overall procedure of volumes are stabilizing to improving in the U.S., so that gives us confidence for the future and I think just general confidence the economy is helping us with any electric procedures as well. Gary Ellis : Yes, just quickly on the tax rate Bob to clarify, I mean what we are saying is the combined company if you took our combined tax rates on a cash earnings per share basis, it's kind of in that 18% to 19% range what we've historically been at and we would expect that 2 points of improvement just in the financing of the transaction would be kind of immediately. So I mean basically going forward, we would assume kind of for Q4 and on that will be more in the 16% to 17% range just based on those parameters at this point. Again we\u2019ll get more guidance as we get in to FY16, but those numbers right now are still what we would expect and back to your point -- that should start happening right away here in Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung from Bernstein. Derrick Sung : Omar, I wanted to go back to the top line growth profile here and I think you have been very clear about what the growth drivers will be kind of from a product category perspective on the Medtronic side to get you to that mid-single or even above mid-single digit growth in the near future, DCB in the high-powered new launches, etc. Could you spend some time talking about your view of the Covidien business now and what do you see as kind of the key product category growth drivers on the top line that will drive kind of that mid-single to high single-digit growth going forward on that side of the business? Omar Ishrak : Yes, look the question is based on next quarter we\u2019ll have Brian on the call as well and he can give you a little more specifics, but our initial understanding is the following; obviously the two key strategic tuck-ins are important although in the neurovascular side it's more for product, Covidien products related growth driver that we will see. Now aside from that we see continued strength in surgical solutions within Covidien, the operating room tools, Covidien has a strong position and we see continued growth with actually very modest pricing pressure which is like less than we normally see in our other businesses. We also think that sort of their newer technologies in -- the early stage technologies also which are just being created will also have some traction the emerging markets in Covidien especially with their value products that I think the emerging markets will want before the legacy Medtronic products will have traction little longer term because those products are just being developed but those are important. And finally there is a big strategic push which I'll really let Bryan comment on next time or in future calls around an acceleration of moving to minimally invasive technologies and I think this movement open to MIS is a pretty big push that will be a focus for the Covidien group. Finally the procedural growth that we see over all in the U.S the sorts of products that Covidien has will benefit most from that much earlier than the Medtronic products because they're hospital base and the value proposition like I mentioned several times this hospital base. So that\u2019s my attempt kind of describing some of the areas that we particularly excited about. But if you can just hold off till next quarter and you'll hear Bryan and I'm sure you'll get a lot more detail and be more specific about some of these growth items. Derrick Sung : Sure, that is great. Thanks, Omar. As a follow-up if I could just follow-up on one of the points that you mentioned there which is emerging markets both Medtronic individually and Covidien together. So this quarter your emerging markets growth improved to 12% from I believe it was 10% for so last quarter. Can you talk about the pathway to get to mid-single-digit EM growth if not higher? And then in the context of Covidien, does Covidien give you synergies that could lead to one plus one equals three type of benefit on the emerging market side or do you also view the emerging market side of Covidien as separate similar to your prior comments on Covidien where you talked about just sort of trying to preserve growth rather than initially rather than look at the synergies? How do you see that playing out? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : First of all just get the numbers straight, I think our emerging market growth in the last quarter was also around this 12% number. But the point is that we're below at least the 15% benchmark that we set ourselves and a lot of that and Covidien is actually in the same range. We'd like to get this thing up to at least 15% if not higher that\u2019s our goal, I think we have every expectation that we can get there and we should have every expectation as we've get there given the opportunities that exist. However and we've laid our strategies though which we'll achieve it which is channel optimization, public and private partnerships, some government deal. So there are things that we're doing that will make this growth sustainable in that range. The other thing that we're doing which I think with Covidien will help us enormously is it diversification within the emerging markets. Right now in a legacy Medtronic basis China represents about 50% of our total emerging markets. So the whole rate just depends on China going up and down in China although we've grown in the double digits in the sustain fashion is a market where the distribution channels have to be optimized overtime and there will be pluses and minuses and if we can diversify more that will help stabilize our emerging market growth to the mid-teens if you like. With Covidien China will give our 30% we'll have Middle East and Africa and Latin America in particular which will be big contributors a bigger proportion than where it was at legacy Medtronic. So the diversification with Covidien will help us. To your point about -- how do we -- are there any real synergy type things with Covidien from a revenue perspective, we haven\u2019t built anything concrete into our thinking today but clearly the scale that Covidien will give us in emerging markets our joint sales will give us, will allow us to penetrate into new geographies much more rapidly than we could if we were alone and that means to countries that otherwise we wouldn\u2019t go to because it will cost the same to set up an office and all that whether you are Covidien and Medtronic together that size or just Medtronic alone. And so that scale helps us fund going into new geographies. This also includes going into new regions of existing geographies like China. So I think that\u2019s where you'll see the maximum benefit. The other area that I have also mentioned in the past that we expect to see fairly rapid traction is that through Covidien we have an entr\u00e9e into hospitals because the nature of the products that we sell. And moving those hospitals building on those relationships and taking them to our chronic disease management therapies because of our relationship and credibility with them we expect that that will accelerate. So we've have lots of directional reasons why we expect emerging markets to be enhanced fairly soon with this merger as opposed to some of the other areas that we've talked about Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuench from BMO. Joanne Wuench : It is Joanne Wuensch from BMO. Quickly, the LINQ starts to annualize in the fourth quarter somewhat tougher comps. But this thing seems to have a ton of momentum behind it. Should we think of it as the gift that keeps on giving as you push further and further into patients and grab more and more cardiac rhythm management market share with it? Omar Ishrak : Certainly I can think of it as a gift that keeps on giving and I mean to be fair if you look at the patient populations that Mike described they are still highly underpenetrated in those disease state, so there is a growth. But obviously the nature of that growth would be different from the comps that we had last year. But an expectation that this is a market that is still highly underpenetrated I think that\u2019s just actually true and we need to execute to capture that. But Mike I'm sure you'll have any more comments on that Mike? Mike Coyle : No I think as you say there is plenty of momentum in terms of the penetration rates going forward they\u2019re low in every one of the three categories that I talked about again we\u2019re going to be looking at 300% year-over-year growth but we will be looking at meaningful especially dollar growth associated with this. But I think the other point that Omar referenced earlier that\u2019s important to keep in mind is this is really helping us with our device revenue as well from the standpoint that if you look at think of these patients with review LINQ we are now treating about two and half times as many this past quarter as we did a year ago in the third quarter and roughly 8% of those patients will wind up getting a pacemaker or ICD in the first year and over three 3.5 year life of a review LINQ roughly 20% of those patients will be identified as being appropriate candidates for device therapy. So, this is not only helping us within its own revenue it\u2019s also helping us in terms of getting patients who need these therapies identified and appropriately treated and obviously if we get differential market share of those patients because we are the ones who found them. Joanne Wuench : And then my second question has to do with renal denervation. You sort of gave us a teaser at the beginning of this call starting your IDE shortly or filing the IDE shortly. What will be different this time than the last time you worked through the FDA process on the product? Thank you. Mike Coyle : So actually a lot will be different obviously we\u2019d be using a different device from the standpoint that the spiral device of choice we will be actually ablating a different location and with a different protocol, a lot of work went into the study design itself obviously to see if we could increase the treatment effect in the treatment arm which I\u2019ve just referenced on how we plan to do that lower the effect in the control arm which basically we\u2019ve been working with numerous experts in the field to identify what drug regimens and comparators should be used and they will be meaningfully different in this proposed study than what we used before. And obviously we\u2019re going to be trying to really tighten the variability that we saw on both the treatment and control arms and we have a number of ideas and protocol to be able to deal with that. So we are meeting with FDA on a specific proposal on how we would restart this study obviously it\u2019s going to be up to them to accept that protocol so we still have work to do but I think we know what we want to do with the next IDE study and we will see if we can come to agreement with the agency on moving forward on. Omar Ishrak : Thanks to all of you for your questions. And with that on behalf of the entire management team I\u2019d like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We\u2019re obviously very excited about the future and we look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q4 call which as Gary mentioned earlier will be on June the 2nd. And with that I\u2019d like to say my final words of thanks and have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeff Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir? Jeff Warren : Thank you, Maria. Good morning. And welcome to Medtronic's fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015, which ended April 24, 2015. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments, earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by business summary, which finalizes the preliminary revenue we issued on May 19, 2015. We also updated our combined historical Covidien-Medtronic financial statement presentation to include FY15 comparable revenue, as well as combined P&L for the past eight quarters. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly or annual results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter and full year 2014, respectively, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Covidien Plc and the prior year comparison and aligns Covidien\u2019s prior year monthly revenue to Medtronic\u2019s fiscal quarters. With that, I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning, and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, which represents growth of 7% and Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.16. Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I would like to recap the fiscal year. FY15 was a transformational year for our company, with the announcement of the Covidien acquisition in Q1 and the subsequent closing of this transaction in Q4. We believe the combination of our two companies meaning accelerates our strategies, diversifies our growth profile and increases our long-term financial flexibility. I will cover the Covidien integration in more detail in a moment. Our FY15 revenue grew 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid single-digit baseline goal and represented a 230 basis point improvement from FY14. FY15 was a strong year for therapy innovation at Medtronic, with our new therapies growth vector contributing 410 basis points for our full year growth, well above our stated goal of 150 to 350 basis points. All four of our groups launched meaningful innovations in FY15, including those that make advances into disease areas, innovate in our existing market-leading technologies or enhance our diagnostic, therapy and monitoring products with key wraparound programs. Gary will discuss the technologies that drove our results, as well as our future pipeline in more detail shortly when he recaps our business results. Revenue in emerging markets our second growth vector grew double digits again in FY15 and contributed 150 basis points to our full year growth. Our third growth vector, services and solutions nearly doubled in revenue in FY15 and 30 basis points to our full year growth. While legacy Covidien businesses were no doubt contribute to this vector in the future, we feel for FY15 it is more appropriate to look at this vector using the legacy Medtronic revenue as the base given all of the revenue in Q4 came from legacy Medtronic businesses, under this methodology the services and solutions group vector contributed 50 basis points within our FY15 goal of 40 to 60 basis points. We continue to add additional services and solutions offerings. In addition to our existing Cardiocom and Cath Lab Managed Services platforms, we were excited to add Diabeter in Q4, a unique diabetes integrated care solution. We also initiated our first pilot of our Operating Room Managed Services, which combines the capabilities we have developed in the Cath Lab together with Covidien\u2019s breathe pf operating room technology and expertise to provide a full service or our offering to hospitals. All of these efforts are focused in addressing the evolving needs of our customers regarding delivery system efficiency and more integrated connected care models for patients around the world. We feel we are well-positioned to demonstrate the role medical technology and related services can play in improving system efficiency and care integration in key disease states and to serve with the key partner and collaborator with healthcare systems spares, governments and governments for working to deliver better patient outcomes at lower costs. Looking at the FY15 P&L, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.28. While it is difficult to compare EPS to the prior year, given the acquisition of Covidien, we are looking at some key operating P&L line items in an approximate combined constant currency basis in order to better assess our operating performance. We also feel that these would be the appropriate P&L metrics to evaluate our operating performance as we move through FY16. In FY15, our operating margin percentage improved by 60 basis points, including an 80 basis points improvement in SG&A, offset by 50 basis point decline in gross margins all on a combined constant currency basis, which corresponds to a 200 points of operating leverage and was in line with our baseline expectations. While Gary will cover our earnings guidance in a moment, it is clear that FX is a major headwind in FY16. Despite that headwind, I want to emphasize that the management team is focused on driving significant operating leverage this year. Looking now at free cash flow, we had a very strong year in FY15 and met our commitment to return 50% for our free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Our FY15 results ultimately reflect the dedication and passion of over 85,000 employees collaborating with our partners in healthcare to deliver therapies and services to millions of patients around the globe to fulfill our mission of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life. Now moving to our Q4 performance, Q4 was another strong quarter, the first as a combined company with Covidien. Our 7% revenue growth was a result of solid performances across all of our groups and geographies. Geographically, we had double-digit growth in emerging markets, strong upper single-digit growth in the U.S. and mid single-digit growth in developed markets outside the U.S. CVG had another quarter of impressive double-digit growth, diabetes delivered strong upper single-digit growth on both MITG and RTG had solid mid single-digit growth. In RTG, we recently reorganized the structure of our sales teams, aligning sales management to disease states. We expect this to further optimize our focus on our neuroscience, integrated pain solutions and surgical synergy strategies. In particular we believe this should help our performance in spine, as we believe it will allow us to take better advantage of our overall breathe. Q4 was a first quarter of integration with Covidien, while it has only been one quarter, I'm proud that our combined organization is staying focused and delivering on our commitments, avoiding any distractions during this transition period. As I\u2019ve stated several times before, our first objective with the Covidien integration is to preserve the state of growth objectives of both companies. As we look ahead, we believe that our baseline goal of delivering mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth on a consistent basis is still appropriate and reasonable over the long-term. Although, similar to this quarter that could well be times when we exceed our baseline expectations. We continue to focus in executing on our three growth strategies, therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. These strategies are designed to create a competitive advantage for Medtronic by capitalizing on the three long-term trends we see playing out in healthcare. Namely the desire to improve clinical outcomes using technology, the growing demand for expanded access to healthcare in developing countries and the optimization of cost efficiency in healthcare systems, including the move to value-based healthcare. In therapy innovation, we continue to deliver above goal performance in Q4, as the new therapies growth vector contributed 560 basis points to our total company growth. This is a result of strong execution on product launches, as well as decisions we have made over the past few years to select the right products that solve not only our customers clinical needs but their economic needs as well, and as we look ahead, our pipeline remains full with the number of new therapies and services expected to come market over the next few years. In globalization, emerging markets delivered 140 basis points to our Q4 total company growth, just below our stated expectations. We continue to implement changes aimed at improving our emerging market growth profile, including making progress in our public and private partnerships. On my most recent visit to China, I met with several private hospitals CEO\u2019s and discussed potential opportunities to work together. In addition to partnerships, all of our emerging markets are focused on our channel optimization strategy, strengthening our customer relationships to better meet our customers\u2019 needs, while also recognizing the unique challenges of the local healthcare systems. In countries like India and China, where we have a vast number of distributors, we are consolidating logistics to platform distributors in order to meet more stringent supply chain policies. In the Middle East, we are building strong joint venture partnerships with local distributors to accelerate therapy adoption in the local markets. In economic value, our services and solutions growth vector contributed 50 basis points to our growth in Q4 on the legacy Medtronic basis, within the goal of 40 to 60 basis points. In Cardiocom, we signed an additional 14 commercial contracts in Q4 and continued to increase patient enrollment in our existing hospital and home care provider accounts. In our CRHF Diagnostics business, we have begun penetrating the mobile cardiac, outpatient telemetry and NuVent report markets using our unique SEEQ based diagnostic service. We have now started adding the heart failure diagnostic data provided by CRHF implantable devices into Cardiocom creating a comprehensive heart failure management service. We also started offering Cardiocom as part of a broader bundle offering to our CVG customers. In Cath Lab Managed Services we are generating rapid growth, as we are fast becoming the ideal partner for hospitals that seek to drive operational efficiency. While this business started in Europe we are now expanding our Cath Lab Managed Services business globally. At the end of Q4, we had 50 long-term agreements with hospital systems, representing $1.1 billion in revenue over the life of these contracts, which have an average age -- average span of about five to six years. And we also have a full pipeline of potential contracts at various stages of negotiation with providers around the world. Turning to the P&L, Q4 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.16. Despite the incremental moving parts due to the Covidien transaction and increased headwinds from foreign exchange, our operating results were in line with our expectations, with our organization controlling spending effectively as we ended the fiscal year. Our gross margin continues to reflect ongoing elevated levels of spending to improve our quality systems in Neuromodulation. This quarter, we entered into a consent decree with the FDA, which provides a part to resolution of our issues in this division. We take the responsibility that has been instructed to us to provide quality products very seriously and ensuring the highest level of quality and regulatory compliance has and always will be a personal priority for me and a central focus of everything that we do at Medtronic. We delivered $1.7 billion of free cash flow in Q4. We remained in allocating our capital with a focus on creating long-term shareholder value. As a result of the Covidien acquisition, we have increased ability to deploy our cash in the U.S., solidifying our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. With this increased financial flexibility, we are in the process of reevaluating the mix of share buybacks and dividends. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we remain focused on delivering dependable long-term dividend growth. In addition, we remained disciplined when evaluating potential M&A opportunities, any investment we make must be aligned with and ultimately strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies, while at the same time offer high return metrics and minimize near-term shareholder dilution. As we look ahead to FY16, we remain focused on delivering on our baseline financial expectations as we continue to integrate Covidien into Medtronic. We have four clear priorities guiding this process, preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. I mentioned preserve earlier, our first and highest priority, and we expect to continue to meet the financial commitments of both companies. Our second priority, optimize, is focused on achieving the detailed cost savings plans that are expected to result in a minimum of $850 million in cost synergies by the end of FY18. Our third priority, accelerate, is related to assessing and prioritizing the numerous revenue synergy opportunities, which today include leveraging Covidien\u2019s peripheral vascular sales force to drive sales of drug-coated balloons, as well as leveraging Covidien's Neurovascular division to enhance our Neuroscience strategy in RTG. We are creating the industry's first true comprehensive stroke management business, leveraging our transformative therapy innovations, the solitaire mechanical thrombectomy product in Neurovascular and CVG LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor, with its clinically proven role in the management of cryptogenic stroke patients. Our fourth and final priority is transform, as we observe and interact with healthcare systems around the world, we continue to see a push for experimentation with new models of delivery system operations, new payment schemes and integrated patient care as a critical mechanism to balance their cost and access challenges. Each of these efforts seek to drive higher levels of patients and system value, to move to this value-based healthcare models around the world presents a unique opportunity for Medtronic because we believe medical technology can play an increasing larger role in delivering higher levels of value in healthcare, the proper application of medical technology with and the adapt use of data and information associated with these technologies can be paired to help when the cost curve in healthcare and produce better clinical outcomes at the same time. This is pushing our organization to develop technology offering, services and business models that bring new forms of value across a given patient care continuum and within the delivery system itself. This continues to drive our organization to move beyond medical devices to create integrated health solutions that complement and enhance our devices value, through traditional wraparound services and solutions. By addressing these trends now, we believe we will also uniquely position Medtronic to participate in the emerging bundle payment and risk sharing models focused in very specific disease states. We are actively partnering and collaborating with hospital systems, payers and governments who are working on these new models and we intend to continue to do so as leader intent and leveraging our industry-leading products, deep clinical and economic expertise, global footprint and financial strengths. Ultimately, we believe this is what will differentiate Medtronic and uniquely positions us to succeed in the ever-changing global healthcare marketplace. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results. Gary? Gary Ellis : Thanks, Omar. Fourth quarter revenue of $7.34 billion increased 60%, as reported or 7% on a comparable, constant currency basis after adjusting for a $483 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Legacy acquisitions and divestitures from both Medtronic and Covidien contributed 80 basis points to growth. Q4 revenue results on a geographic basis were as follows. Growth in the U.S. was 8% and represented 55% of our overall sales. The non-U.S. developed markets grew 5% and represented 32% of our overall sales and growth in the emerging markets was 11% and represented 13% of our overall sales. Q4 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.16, a decrease of 2%. We will breakeven on a Q4 GAAP earnings basis after several significant charges primarily related to the Covidien acquisition. In addition to the $362 million adjustment for amortization expense, the Covidien related non-GAAP adjustments on an after-tax basis included a $455 million charge related to the inventory purchase price step-up, a $286 million charge for acquisition-related items and a $157 million net restructuring charge. We also had a $349 million charge related to certain tax adjustments, the majority of which related to the proposed agreement reached with the IRS, resolving all proposed adjustments associated with the Kyphon acquisition, a $61 million CVG product technology upgrade commitment charge and a $27 million net litigation charge, primarily related to provision for additional INFUSE clients. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2,596 billion grew 10%. This was a result of strong performance in all three divisions -- Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, Coronary & Structural Heart, and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular. In Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure or CRHF, revenue of $1,398 billion grew 11%. This performance was driven by low-teens growth in Low Power, mid-single digit growth in High Power, strong growth of over a 30% in AF Solutions, as well as nearly doubling our revenue in services and solutions, which includes Cardiocom and Cath Lab Managed Service revenue. We estimate the global CRHF market is growing in the low to mid-single digits and the strength of our new product introductions is resulting in share gains and generally improved pricing dynamics. Low Power growth continues to be driven by the global adoption of Reveal LINQ, which resulted in diagnostics revenue growth of over 40% sequentially as well as solid pacemaker implant growth in U.S. LINQ is resulting in not only increased diagnostic sales but also pacemaker pull-through, as LINQ is resulting in more re-cardiac diagnosis in syncope patients. Looking forward -- looking ahead, we look forward to the launch of the Micra Transcatheter Pacing System in international markets this summer, followed by a U.S. launch in FY\u201917. In High Power, we continue to see strong market adoption of our Attain Performa, CRT-D system with its differentiated next-generation Quadripolar technology, AdaptivCRT algorithm and time-saving Vector Express programming. High Power also had a strong quarter in Japan, where we have now gained over 20 points of ICD share since the launch of our Evera MRI SureScan ICD in Q3. We expect to launch the Evera MRI ICD in the U.S. in this fiscal year. Our AF Solutions business continues to take share in the AF market and the continued strong growth of our Arctic Front Advance Cryoablation System, which is growing at more than double of the overall market growth rate. Turning to Coronary & Structural Heart or CSH, revenue of $792 million grew 9%. Our coronary business grew in the low single-digits driven by solid mid-single growth in drug-eluting stents. In Europe, our launch of the Resolute Onyx resulted in a 400 basis points of DES share gains sequentially and a sequential slowing of pricing declines. Resolute Onyx feature enhanced visibility and thinner struts to improve deliverability. We began the U.S. pivotal trial for Resolute Onyx in March and are currently forecasting an FY\u201918 FDA approval. In our broader coronary product offering, we are also seeing increased strengths, particularly in balloons where we gained 400 basis points of share on the successful rollout of our differentiated Euphora PTCA balloon family. In renal denervation, we announced in April, the initiation of the SPYRAL HTN global clinical trial program, which includes two global, prospective, randomized, sham-controlled trials studying uncontrolled hypertension patients both on and off medication. Based on the outcome of these two initial studies, we will then evaluate next steps for our pivotal study. Our Structural Heart business grew in the upper teens, driven by another strong quarter in transcatheter valves, which grew nearly 50%. In the U.S., our continued rollout of CoreValve is driving growth and resulting in both sequential and year-over-year share gains. We added approximately 40 additional new centers in the quarter and now have more than 275 U.S. centers trained since launch. In late March, we received the FDA approval for the use of CoreValve in a failed bioprosthetic also known as valve-in-valve implantation and these further contributed to our U.S. growth. As CoreValve is the only TAVI product approved for this indication, it makes CoreValve an indispensable offering for every practicing TAVI center. In international markets, our business took share sequentially due to the strong adoption of our CoreValve Evolut R. We are seeing strong customer enthusiasm for this next-generation self-expanding platform with its options to recapture and reposition the valve during the procedure. It\u2019s differentiated 14 French equivalent delivery catheter, allowing access to smaller amenities and as we design inflow and skirt to help promote annular sealing. Evolut R is receiving tremendous feedback on its clinical outcomes, overall ease-of-use and procedural efficiencies. The FDA submission of Evolut R is complete and we are targeting the first half FY\u201916 approval in U.S. launch. The FDA also recently allowed us to begin implanting Evolut R in a SURTAVI Trial and to reduce the enrollment of requirement for the trial to 1,400 patients, which we believe brings in the timeline for the U.S. Intermediate Risk approval by at least a year. We have already enrolled approximately 1,250 patients from SURTAVI and we expect to complete enrollment over the next several months. In Japan, we received PMDA approval for CoreValve in March and plans are underway for a full launch this fall, following anticipated reimbursement approval in October. In our Aortic & Peripheral Vascular division or APV, revenue of $406 million grew 9%. The Aortic business grew in low-single digits and the peripheral vascular business grew the mid-teens, driven by the successful U.S. launch of our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon. We estimate that the IN.PACT Admiral is the leading DCB in the U.S. market in just its first quarter of launch. This leadership position was attained without the benefit of having a full quarter of a combined Medtronic and legacy Covidien peripheral sales force. We expect this DCB to drive growth in our APV division over the coming quarters through both its individual revenue contribution, as well as its ability to drive share across our broader peripheral vascular product line through the use of multi-line contracting. Looking on our DCB pipeline, we expect to obtain FDA approval for our 150 millimeter IN.PACT Admiral balloon in Q4 FY\u201916, or early Q1 FY\u201917. In addition, we expect to file for expanded indications for IN.PACT Admiral with a PMAs U.S. filing in the second half of FY\u201916 for in-stent restenosis indication, as well as the CE Mark filing by the end of FY16 for AV [indiscernible] indication. We are also finalizing bench testing now on our redesigned DCB for use below the knee, which we expect to submit for CE Mark in FY\u201916. Now turning to our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which consist of the majority of legacy Covidien businesses, revenue of $2.387 billion grew 6%, which included a net 140 basis point contribution from acquisitions and divestitures. MITG\u2019s revenue performance was driven by double-digit growth in Surgical Solutions and lower single-digit growth in Patient Monitoring & Recovery. Surgical Solutions revenue of $1.293 billion grew 10%, with high single-digit growth in Advanced Surgical, low single-digit growth in General Surgical and growth of over 40% in Early Technologies. Advanced Surgical had a strong quarter with balanced low double-digit growth in both Stapling and Energy. Stapling results benefited from the continued rollout of new products, including the Endo GIA Reinforced Reload. In Energy, we are seeing strong procedural growth, particularly in Vessel Sealing. Our Early Technologies business also had solid growth across all three product lines : GI Solutions, Advanced Ablation, and Interventional Lung Solutions. Geographically, in Surgical Solutions, both the U.S. and China had strong quarters, delivering double-digit growth. Surgical solutions continues to focus on driving minimally invasive surgery adoption globally. Patient Monitoring & Recovery revenue of $1,094 billion grew 2%. The division was led by strength in the patient monitoring business, which grew in the mid-single digits as well as both Nursing Care and Airway & Ventilation, which grew in the low-single digits. This offset low single-digit declines in patient care. Growth in the patient monitoring business resulted from our strong U.S. flu season, which drove pulse oximetry sales. Now moving to our Restorative Therapies Group. Revenue of $1,854 billion grew 5%. Results were driven by growth in Surgical Technologies, Neuromodulation and Neurovascular, partially offset by modest declines in Spine. Spine revenue of $743 million declined 2%. Low single-digit growth in BMP was offset by low single-digit earnings in Core Spine and interventional. Both the global and the U.S. Core Spine markets grew in the low single-digits, consistent with last quarter. In our Core Spine business, both TL and cervical declined. But both of these businesses are expected to improve as we continue to launch innovative technologies into the market and these new products become a larger part of our sales mix. In PL, we are expecting FY\u201916 rollouts of new technologies for our OLIF25 and the 51 procedures, our new alleviate expendable cage and Solera Voyager, our new minimally invasive lumbar pedicle screw system. In cervical, we continued to see adoption of our PRESTIGE LP Cervical Disc and innovative ANATOMIC PTC interbody spacer. We are also now beginning the launch of our Divergence Stand-Alone Interbody Cage and ZEVO Anterior Cervical Plate System. Our spine division also continues to develop and deploy our differentiated surgical synergy program, which integrates our enabling technologies, surgical tools, spinal implants and expertise to improve surgical outcomes and efficiencies. This includes utilizing O-arm imaging and StealthStation navigation in spine procedures. And a strong growth from these two enabling technologies is recognized in our Surgical Technologies division. In Neuromodulation, revenue of $518 million increased 6%, driven by double-digit growth in DBS and mid-teens growth in Gastro/Uro. In DBS, our global growth focused on neurologist referral programs and the strength of the EARLYSTIM data in international markets continues to drive solid growth. In Gastro/Uro, we continue to see strong growth in sales of the InterStim system. Our Pain stim business was flat this quarter, reflecting a continued decline in the U.S. market, resulting from a negative reimbursement change that affected trialing activity and new implant growth. However, we grew our global pain stim share sequentially on the strength of our RestoreSensor SureScan MRI, spinal cord stimulation system, with its proprietary AdaptiveStim automatic simulation adjustment feature and access to MRI scans anywhere in the body. Turning to our Surgical Technologies division, revenue of $461 million grew 9%, driven by solid, balanced growth across all three businesses. Neurosurgery grew in the mid-single-digits, reflecting record worldwide O-arm surgical imaging unit sales, continued strength in StealthStation navigation service revenue, and the contribution of Visualase MRI-guided laser ablation. ENT low-double digit growth was a result of continued strong customer adoption of our StraightShot M5 Microdebrider and NuVent sinus balloon, partially offset by the MicroFrance divestiture, which occurred in Q3. In Advanced Energy, strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue sealing and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies drove upper-teens growth. In Neurovascular, revenue of $132 million grew 23%. The division, formerly part of legacy Covidien, had strong double-digit growth across coils, stents, flow diversion and access. In stents, we saw strong adoptions of our SOLITAIRE FR revascularization device following the presentation of four meaningful clinical trials at the International Stroke Conference in February and subsequent publication of three of these studies in the New England Journal of Medicine. These studies provided evidence that the standard of care for the treatment of stroke should be changed to include stent thrombectomy as primary treatment in addition to IV-tPA. In our flow diversion portfolio, we also saw a strong growth as a result of continued U.S. launch of the Pipeline Flex embolization device. In our Diabetes Group, revenue of $467 million grew 8%, with solid upper single-digit growth from the continued adoption of our CGM sensor augmented insulin pump systems in both the U.S. and non-US developed markets. In U.S., we continued to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 530G with the Enlite CGM sensor. In non-U.S. developed markets, growth was driven by the launch of our next-generation MiniMed 640G system with the enhanced Enlite CGM sensor in Australia and Europe. In addition to incorporating a brand new insulin pump design and user interface, the MiniMed 640G System features SmartGuard technology, which can automatically suspend insulin delivery when sensor glucose levels are predicted to approach a low limit and then resume insulin delivery once levels recover. We continue to make progress in bringing this technology to the U.S. and plan to submit the PMA for this system later this calendar year. In Q4, we continue to advance the development of artificial pancreas technology through a minority investment in DreaMed Diabetes, which included licensing their MD-Logic artificial pancreas algorithm. We also continue to make progress in our Diabetes Services and Solutions division with three business development announcements in Q4. First, we made a minority investment in Glooko, a developer of unified platform for diabetes management. Second, we announced a partnership with IBM Watson Health to develop a new generation of personalized diabetes management solutions. And third, we acquired Diabeter, the Netherlands-based diabetes clinic and research center, which has developed a truly unique, integrated care model for people with diabetes that we intend to expand globally over time. Taken together, these announcements signify that we're focused on transforming our diabetes group from a market-leading pump and sensor company into a holistic diabetes management company focused on making a real difference in outcomes and costs. Turning to the rest of the income statement. After adjusting for certain non-GAAP items mentioned earlier as well as the 10 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, our Q4 operating margin was 29.6%, which included non-GAAP operational gross margin, SG&A and R&D of 70.8%, 32.6%, and 6.9%, respectively demonstrating the leverage we normally see in the fourth quarter in SG&A and R&D. Also included in the operating margin was net other income of $20 million, including net gains from our hedging program of $139 million. We hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. In addition, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create some modest volatility in our earnings. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY16 net other expense to be in the range of $215 million to $275 million, which includes an expected impact from the U.S. medical device tax of approximately $205 million. For Q1 FY16, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million based on current exchange rates. It is worth noting that in Q4 we hedged the majority of the expected FY16 legacy Covidien operating results in developed market currencies, consistent with Medtronic\u2019s practice at recent market rates. Overall, we expect FY16 operating margins to be in the range of 28% to 29% on an as reported basis, which includes over 100 basis points of improvement or approximately 400 basis points of operating leverage related to cost synergies offset by an expected FX impact of approximately 70 basis points. The majority of the operating margin improvement will come in SG&A as a result of the realization of cost synergies from our Covidien acquisition as well as continued execution on legacy leverage initiatives of both Covidien and Medtronic. We would expect operating margins in the first half of the year to be below this range improving in the back half of the year as the foreign exchange headwinds lessen and cost synergies accelerate. Below the operating profit line, Q4 net interest expense was $186 million, a significant increase from prior quarters as we are now including the incremental interest expense from our December 2014 $17 billion bond offering used in Covidien acquisition. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $19.5 billion in cash and investments and $36.2 billion in debt. In Q1, we expect to retire $1 billion of maturing debt using existing cash. Based on current rates, we would expect FY16 net interest expense to be approximately $750 million, including approximately $210 million in Q1. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q4 was 15.4%. This was lower than expected due primarily to the finalization of profit mix by jurisdiction, which resulted in a favorable catch up as we reduced our annual tax rate. We would expect our FY16 non-GAAP nominal tax rate on the cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 18% as we expect to be at the higher end of the range until the presently expired U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated. In Q4, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow, excluding one-time items, to shareholders. In Q4, we repurchased $300 million of our common stock and paid $435 million in dividends. While a portion of our dividend paid in April was treated for U.S. tax purposes as a return of capital, our expectation is that we will increasingly accumulate profits at the Medtronic plc level and move over time toward a dividend that is treated completely as a return of their earnings. As of the end of Q4, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 30 million shares. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.441 billion shares. It is important to note that the cash we received from stock option redemptions, which was $172 million in Q4, will also continue to be used to repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. For FY16, we would expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately 1.433 billion to 1.437 billion shares, including approximately 1.439 million shares in Q1. Let me conclude by commenting on our initial fiscal year 2016 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We believe that underlying operational revenue growth in the range 4% to 6%, plus incremental expected revenue from our Q1 extra selling week of a 100 to 150 basis points all on a comparable constant currency basis is reasonable for FY16. This operational revenue growth expectation is consistent with our stated baseline financial goal of consistently delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth. Our revenue outlook assumes that CVG, MITG, and RTG grow in the mid-single digits and diabetes grows in the upper-single to low-double digit range all on a comparable constant currency basis and including the expected benefit of the extra week. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you sense of the FX impact of the exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY16 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, including the negative $540 million to $600 million impact in Q1. Turning to guidance on the bottomline, we believe it is reasonable to model cash earnings per share in the range of $4.30 to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.40 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates and approximately $300 million to $350 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition. As you think about your FY16 models and quarterly gating, it is worth noting that this FX impact to earnings per share is $0.10 more negative than we estimate given on our Q3 earnings call as well as the fact that a higher percentage of the negative FX impact is in the first half of the year while more of the value capture synergies occurred later in the fiscal year. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year. I will now turn it back over to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Gary. Before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by stating that Q4 was another strong quarter, a good finish to a successful and transformative year. As we look ahead, while we are facing increased headwinds from foreign exchange, we must remain focused in the operations of the company striving to reliably deliver on baseline financial model, mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth, EPS growth 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue on an operational basis, and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. To achieve these goals we continue to execute in our three primary strategies, therapy innovation, globalization, and the economic value. We expect our efforts to deliver consistent and reliable performance, combined with the disciplined capital allocation, will enable us to create long-term, dependable value in healthcare. With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We are really able to get to everyone's questions so please limit yourself to only one question and only one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : Good morning. And thanks everybody for taking the question. So Omar as a starting point, if I look at your U.S. business, this is certainly one of your better quarters in quite sometime at the company. And I was hoping you could touch on your view of the health of U.S. med device end markets. You obviously have at Medtronic a number of products to drive in specific Medtronic growth and linked to CoreValve across the portfolio. How do you feel about the health of the overall U.S. med device market? Do you think that it\u2019s picked up over the last few quarters? Omar Ishrak : Yes. Of course it has, because if you just look overall the number of procedures, look at what hospital systems are reporting in terms of their procedures and our own experience, certainly the market has picked up. But I would add, like three factors, some of which you mentioned already, which is some contributed to our performance. First is that there is an overall pick up and stabilization in fact of the market and now I think so correlating directly with the increased expectation from demographics. So that\u2019s certainly there. I think in addition, like you pointed out a convergence for our new products coming altogether at roughly the same time has given us a boost and there is no question about it. And finally, we haven't fully quantified it yet, but there is a pull-through effect of some of our implantable devices from very strong diagnostic monitoring sales, our LINQ device sales. We don\u2019t know how much that is, but I think the three of these put together, probably the main factors driving this increased growth in the U.S. Mike Weinstein : Gary, let me get to the FY16 guidance. So the incremental impact on EPS from FX, the $0.10, is that in part because you hedged into quarter the Covidien exposure, at some point were less favorable rates? And then I assume from your commentary just about the timing of the impact of FX, the timing of the benefit of synergies, as well as your tax rate still and one more item that as we think about the earnings cadence over the course of 2016 that we probably should expect it to be more back half loaded? Thanks. Gary Ellis : Yes, Mike, back to the -- on the foreign exchange, yes the majority of the $0.10 change from what we have previously estimated on the FX is primarily related to the fact that as we hedged Covidien in the fourth quarter, the rates were even lower than where we provide guidance originally on the $0.30 to $0.40. So yes, I mean, the fact is we did -- as get hit Covidien with our hedging program, but unfortunately by the time we got them in our hedging program, we were at probably -- the rates were similar to where we are at currently and that generated an additional loss from the standpoint of foreign exchange overall. So that\u2019s the majority of the $0.10. So the rest of it is, there is some slight impact just from the standpoint that we don't hedge up to 100% of our even the Medtronic earnings, it\u2019s more like 80%. And so there were still some impact on the foreign exchange getting bit worse since their earnings call previously even on the Medtronic and their hedge component, but the majority of it was locking in Covidien under contracts that basically increased the potential negative hit going forward. Now the good news is they are locked in. So we need further change as we go forward obviously which should be minimized as a result of that. As you indicated, as we look forward I think right now from what I have seen out there for some of the models, I think people have it probably little bit too much front-end loaded. There is going to be more based on the results as we go forward here. Foreign exchange is pretty much heavier hit in the first half of the year and assuming the rates stay the same will be less in the back half year. As you said the tax rate, they will be a little higher in the first until we get the R&D credit approved. And the value capture is going to occur as we go through the year. So that\u2019s clearly going to be escalating and we will have more benefit on value capture in the back half of the year. So I think some of the models are need to be shifting probably a little bit more from the first half to the second half on earnings per share guidance. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Perfect. I will let some others jump in. Thanks, guys. Gary Ellis : Thanks, Mike. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs. David Roman : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to start with some of your comments that towards the end of the call regarding capital deployment. I know in the February call you had started to talk about a potential shift as it related to the mix of dividends and buybacks, the anticipation of the dividend update in June. I guess, A, is that so the case? And, B, any additional color you could provide around the major that shift at this point in time? Omar Ishrak : Well, first, yes, we clearly are more flexibility as we have talked about several times with the increased access to overseas cash. And I think also our increased operating productivity that we will get from synergies is the factor that we have to consider. And so based on that, we are examining our overall capital allocation strategy and we are going to update you shortly on this in a pretty short timeframe. That\u2019s I think all I can share at this point. David Roman : Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on spine. I mean, this is a business that has ebbed and flowed over the past several quarters, but it does look like the overall end market has shown some signs of improvement at least over the past call it 12 months, so that\u2019s not something in which Medtronic has necessarily participated. Can you maybe go into a little bit more detail on exactly what the turnaround plan is for spine? And at what point you start to think about more significant changes in that business either the senior management or sales level? Omar Ishrak : Well, number of points, first of all, from an overall perspective you are right the business itself, spine taking in isolation, hasn\u2019t quite kept up with the way the markets have trended at least in the last 12 months I would say. But there is a short-term strategy to this, which is probably related to the timing of some of the new products which we will see it play through in the coming quarters here in the short-term. Then the longer-term aspect of this and that we have always said that our strategy in that space is really an integrated strategy that uses our overall capabilities in capital equipment and in surgical tools together with spine to give us the competitive advantage. And to that effect, we\u2019ve reorganized our commercial teams at the regional management level, that\u2019s already in placed. We\u2019ve done that both in the U.S. and in Europe, and we are going to -- we have to see how that plays out. I think that\u2019s really our strategy and we\u2019re going to monitor how we deliver on these two aspects in the coming quarters very closely. Gary Ellis : Okay. Thank you, David. David Roman : Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Thanks. Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, as maybe if you could just go into a little bit more on the tax rate, you\u2019d mentioned that during the quarter you had settled some related to Kyphon, I am not sure if that\u2019s all of the IRS settlement that you were referring to at the Investor Day last year? And then also just on the guidance for the full year of 16% to 18%. Maybe just walk us through how you get there just given the fact that at least I was expecting the tax rate to be a little bit lower given some of the commentary that you had with Covidien post close with the rate dropping by about 200 basis points, not sure if it\u2019s related to those settlement there with the IRS. Gary Ellis : Yeah. Okay. With respect to, first of all, the Kyphon aspect and the charge we took in the quarter related to Kyphon. This relates to an issue we\u2019ve had that was raised by the IRS related to our acquisition of Kyphon several years ago and which we used a combination of basically OUS cash and U.S. cash, the comparison there. There was a dispute on how much of that was taxable, et cetera. So as you recall, we used about $3.3 billion of OUS cash to do that transaction. What we\u2019ve ended up agreeing with preliminary decision, the Board still has to approve this, but we agreed basically the settlement with the IRS where we ended up paying about $275 million to settle that and then interest on top of that gets you to the charge we took for the quarter overall. This is not the transfer pricing, put it for transfer pricing issue that we\u2019ve talked about in some of the other previous meetings where which we\u2019ll have a significant impact on the cash flow going forward, this is kind of more of a one-off item related to the acquisition. But it was a major outstanding issue we had with the IRS and we\u2019re happy to get this when settled and move beyond it. As far as the tax rate going forward, 16% to 18%, that is basically in-line with what we\u2019ve expected. If you went back and looked at Medtronic previously and remember this is all now on cash earning and so it\u2019s actually a lower rate that you put in the amortization impact. So it -- you got to make sure you're looking at apples-to-apples when you look at this, Kristen. But, overall, I mean, Medtronic previously was kind of in -- we\u2019ve been in that kind of 18% to 20% range, Covidien had been kind of in that 16% to 17% range. And then as we basically pull this all together, you leverage those and as we indicated is we\u2019re going to get about 200 basis point drop as we come forward related to that. So as a result, we end up on that 16% to 18% range, I mean, is it 15.5% to 17.5%, I mean, that\u2019s kind of how we get to the overall number. So it\u2019s in line with what we've expected and been guiding towards overall. Obviously, there is still lot of moving parts with respect to the tax planning and strategies as we go forward, but we think that range is right in line with kind of what we saw here in Q4 as we went forward. It\u2019s all depends on R&D tax credit, getting renewed, all those types of things. So as we go forward, we feel confident that that\u2019s we are kind of in that range than we\u2019ll have to see where that ultimately ends up, but that\u2019s kind of our current expectation. It is in line with what we\u2019ve been saying previously. Kristen Stewart : What\u2019s the impact on the R&D tax renewal for that number and what is the updated timeline or resolution on the transfer pricing issue? Gary Ellis : Well, the R&D tax credit, probably, has an impact of 50 basis points or so to the overall rate as far as where that is. So it\u2019s not huge but it does have an impact on it. And it all depends obviously when they comes in and how much -- how it plays out as far as how much catch up you have when it occurs. On the transfer pricing issue at Puerto Rico, the cohort is the case. We\u2019re waiting for the judge\u2019s decision on that and that will be whenever the judge decides. I mean, it\u2019s probably going to be towards -- closer towards end of FY or a fiscal year before we hear anything on that, but it\u2019s all based on their timing. Omar Ishrak : As the judges said they want at least the year to review it. Gary Ellis : So it\u2019s all based on the timing. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Thanks very much. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Kristen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Just two quick questions. First for Bryan, surgical solutions business continues to remain above market growth, even though you\u2019re getting a much more concerted effort from your chief competitor? So you keep might getting these questions of sustainability in that business despite in a very consistent performance. So, I guess, you could focus on what's driving that success and what gives you the confidence and above market growth going forward and then I have a quick follow-up. Bryan Hanson : Yeah. I appreciate the question. Yeah. I feel pretty confident, you have got a first kind of reconcile though the fourth quarter, it was very strong for surgical solutions, but we did have some portfolio moves in that. If you pull that out, we\u2019re more in the 7% growth range organically, which is still very strong versus market? And we have noticed a little extra effort by our chief competitor, but we have a lot of confidence in our plan as well. So I feel that we can continue with that above market growth. We\u2019ve got strong momentum as you\u2019ve already referenced. We have what I believe to be very differentiated technologies both in advance stapling, as well as advanced energy and we continue to launch products in both of those areas. Matter of fact if I look across the surgical business, somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 products that we\u2019re going to launch in FY16 and that will drive somewhere in the neighborhood of $60 million to $70 million of revenue, just in those products launched in FY16. So the momentum is there. We\u2019re not getting extra days on our approach there, just because we've been winning we\u2019re very intense in launching products that matter and executing policy when we do. David Lewis : Okay. And then, Omar, I guess, for you. You\u2019ve been very focused on in this three-prong strategy. And I guess, as I think about certain business lines within patient monitoring and recovery, they seem little less strategic or perhaps not fitting with every piece of your strategy? Do you see these businesses as it kind of important to Medtronic strategy and can you comment on sort of the likelihood of targeted divestitures now that you\u2019ve got the deal at least to close? Omar Ishrak : Look, the way we look at these businesses is, first, are they in line with our mission or not. And second, if they are and in this situation the way we define that is that these businesses collectively impact patient outcomes through elevating pain restoring health to extending life. Second thing we look at is there room to improve that further, is there technology capability there that can help us drive the outcomes and better outcomes in a more meaningful way, then we look at, is the market space is attractive, can we grow it and is our key capable of delivering. And then finally, we look at that in combination with everything else that we have from a broad value-based healthcare perspective. So within that we led this thing play out, I mean, this is we just beginning to put this new structure together with that kind of thinking in the business groups and then overtime we\u2019ll evaluate what fits and we are constantly looking at our overall portfolio and we do divestitures of certain items that we feel does not fit into that overall strategy. So we\u2019ll look at these businesses just like any other business in that context. But certainly, the main question are they in line with our mission or not, can they make a difference for technology, we think, yes. Gary Ellis : Thanks, David. David Lewis : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Thanks. Can you hear me, okay? Good morning. Omar Ishrak : Good morning, Bob. Gary Ellis : Good morning. Bob Hopkins : So, first question for, Gary, just on 2016 guidance as it relates to free cash flow? Can you give us a sense as to what you expect for 2016 global free cash flow? And then maybe also an update on the percentage of that free cash flow that you think you\u2019ll have access to? I think from some of your slides recently suggested between $7 billion and $7.5 billion of free cash flow in \u201916, but just wanted to confirm that? Gary Ellis : No, I mean, I think the free cash flow, if you just take and even use our fourth quarter free cash flow here of a $1.7 billion and kind of talk, is that is going to annualize that. Your time more in that $6.8 billion to $7 billion range is kind of what we\u2019ve been talking about overall. Now the reality is however foreign exchange has a big impact in that free cash flow also. And so just like the kind of our annual rate overall that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019d be at and you\u2019d have as back to Omar\u2019s point earlier, you have some synergies coming into play, the cost of value capture synergies are benefited. But FX is going to be a headwind on cash flow also. So my guess is right now our numbers are probably clearly was based on FX rates, are clearly below $7 billion, probably closer to between $6.5 billion and $7 billion with all the moving parts are going on just because the foreign exchange. And as we indicated, we do think right now that based on those rates, we\u2019re probably going to be closer to somewhere around 60% of that cash is accessible in the FY16 timeframe would be our current assumption based on the numbers that we see rolling in. And that\u2019s why our 50% commitment to return cash to shareholders, obviously we have much more flexibility around that with that 60% kind of mix that we\u2019re expecting at this point. The other thing that\u2019s one on Bob, that\u2019s all based in kind of what I\u2019d call on operating basis, including the FX piece. There obviously are still some one-time items that do affect cash flow and that free cash flow I just talked about is really coming from our operating results and that\u2019s where we based all of our assumptions on. But I do have to think about the fact that there are going to be -- so there will be some additional restructuring and things like that and capital investments we\u2019re going to have to make as we go forward with Covidien acquisition. So that\u2019s all taken into account as we kind of think through our overall free cash flow here for the current year. But in general, I would use right now -- I think it\u2019s less than $7 billion that we\u2019ve previously kind of been talking about. You\u2019re probably down more in the $6.5 billion to $7 billion just based on what\u2019s going on with foreign exchange. Bob Hopkins : Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then one also for Omar, now that you\u2019ve had Covidien for obviously just a few months, but we\u2019d love to hear your updated thoughts on where that you think you can leverage that acquisition beyond just the cost synergies. And I'm thinking specifically about M&A and leveraging your access to your global cash flow and leveraging your low tax rate. And so just wanted to kind of get an update on where that you think you can really leverages as Covidien transaction and the degree to which that helps you with an M&A strategy going forward? Omar Ishrak : Well, the first thing is that beyond the cost synergies, I just want to remind you that there are two very specific areas that we\u2019ve called out, in drug coated balloon and in neurovascular where we\u2019re getting immediate benefit and we expect some growth acceleration as a result of that. Beyond that, we've begun to explore at a pretty much grassroots levels of engineers, sort of other opportunities where we can leverage each other's technologies. Now from an M&A perspective, which is using that access to that extra -- using extra access we have to that cash, we stated that we\u2019re going to look at early technologies in the U.S. primarily where there maybe opportunities which we haven't been able to participate into the degree that we\u2019d like to, to create a long-term technology pipeline of early stage technologies that we think can make a difference. We\u2019ve begun to look at it. We\u2019ve actually already -- in the interior for example, we\u2019re already kind of executed on some of these and we\u2019ve got a good pipeline of other activities that we\u2019re looking at closely. But beyond that, the Covidien or the MITG business has had a history of doing acquisitions to supplement their business with regularity and we\u2019ll certainly continue to encourage that process and in fact focus it even more according to the way in which we\u2019ve organized overall business. So the M&A activity from us, certainly from a technology perspective is very sort of close to what we\u2019re focusing on. Bigger deals, obviously opportunistically, we\u2019ll look at it, but that\u2019s a matter of our overall financial bandwidth and our management bandwidth. So that\u2019s the way in which we\u2019re approaching this. Bob Hopkins : Great. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor of Barclays. Matt Taylor : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask one about your emerging markets strategy. You talked a little bit about some partnerships there that you\u2019re pursuing and some things you\u2019re doing to try to get the current rate higher. I guess so I was just curious to see whether you changed your views on what that growth could be sustainably and whether or not Covidien integrated into Medtronic structure could help you to grow faster in EM? Omar Ishrak : Well, number of points. First of all, our confidence and our belief and really share it if you like, in the long-term opportunity in emerging markets is completely unchanged and we\u2019re not tolerating on that. That\u2019s just matter of fact. The way in which we approach that market to tap into that opportunity, particularly in the short-term, actually it\u2019s been more complex and more difficult than we first envisaged. And so the growth rate has been slower than what certainly we had originally thought. I think having said that there is certainly, fairly respectable double-digit growth that we can expect reliably, but we want that to be higher. And we\u2019re looking at methods which we continually actually looking at methods which we can do that sooner rather than later. And as we\u2019re learning, channel optimization is a key factor, partnerships with government is a key factor. And finally, referral chain development is something that we need to approach with far greater scale than we\u2019re had before. These are all important factors. As far as Covidien goes, there are number of things that make us optimistic that this combination will help us. One, there is a complementary strength in certain markets. In the Middle East and Latin America, where between Covidien and Medtronic, we were complementary strength. As a result, we now have our emerging market profile diversify between China, Middle East, and Africa, and Latin America as a big three kind of centers within the emerging markets while previously on a standalone Medtronic basis it was dramatic China. So that gives us a little bit diversity in this markets that we didn\u2019t have. And finally as we\u2019ve talked about before, simply the scale that we now will allow us to penetrate more geographies much more efficiently than we could before and just adding more sales team around the world either in underpenetrated regions within countries or in brand new countries will have to contribute. So we haven\u2019t pieced all of that stuff together yet, then we are in the process of prioritizing some of those investments. And again, we are trying to accelerate the growth profile in emerging markets with actually pretty great sense of urgency. Matt Taylor : Thanks for that. And I guess on your synergies you talked about at least 850 million, again in the past you referenced some opportunities to further that number through some network consolidation in your plans. When you think you will be in a position to give us quantifiable update on what you think the synergies could be between the two companies in combination? Omar Ishrak : I think number of things. First of all, as we go forward, this is going to reflect in our overall productivity. I think that\u2019s the best way to do it, although we will keep track of our value capture efforts with very detailed and granular programs. I think at some point new efforts that are results of the combination versus efforts that were already in place that get accelerated gets very kind of mixed up. And since we\u2019re trying to divide those things up, we\u2019re going to sort of commit to certain levels of productivity that we get out of different line items in our P&L. And that\u2019s the way to do it. We feel good about a long-term productivity that we can get out of this that the value capture, the synergy sort of effort is going to eventually morph into a long-term productivity benefit, extending way beyond the three years that we projected. I think that\u2019s the correct way to look at it, that this becomes a productivity engine of significant magnitude that we didn\u2019t have before and to some extent, we are pretty excited about. Jeff Warren : Thanks. We\u2019ve got past the top of hour but we will take two last questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong quarter. Hey Gary, one clarification. It\u2019s still not clear to me, is the R&D tax credit assumed in the guidance or not assumed? Gary Ellis : On the tax rate, it\u2019s assumed in the guidance, Larry. But what we are saying is that it\u2019s probably towards the higher end of the range until the credit has approved but assuming it gets approved and that we could be in that range. Larry Biegelsen : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Gary Ellis : It\u2019s basically assumed in there, yes. Larry Biegelsen : All right. And then for my real questions. First to Gary, the guidance, just bear with me on some numbers here. The guidance implies constant currency EPS growth of about 5.6% to 10% and your sales guidance is about 5% to 7.5%, if you include the extra week. So therefore, the EPS guidance at the low end of the range doesn\u2019t imply any leverage. Another way of looking at is the EPS guidance is implying the 4% to 6% underlying sales growth, adding the benefit of the extra week and then adding the 200 to 400 basis points of EPS leverage, that gets you to 7% and 11.5% constant currency EPS growth. And as I said you are guiding constant currency EPS growth of 5.6% to 10%. So, sorry for the long-winded questions, but just curious to know why the EPS guidance appears conservative and I just have one product question? Thanks. Gary Ellis : Well. I can\u2019t go through all the number you just laid out, Larry, because I don\u2019t have those in my mind. Let me look at it from the way. You are right. Our revenue growth overall as we indicated is expected to grow, plus the 1% to 1.5% related to the extra week. So just taking the midpoint of the range of 5%, you are seeing somewhere around 6%, 6.5% revenue growth. What do we indicated on the comments overall? From the operating margin perspective as we looked at it, we know from the standpoint of what we are driving there as far as the 100 basis point of improvement on the operating margin as we go forward, we are driving about 400 basis points of leverage and the operating income line on a operational basis before foreign exchange. And so the point is yes. We are getting that 400 basis points of leverage that we talked about in the calculation. That\u2019s offset, that\u2019s measurably impacted by foreign exchange and so it\u2019s all going to get back. The foreign exchange is offsetting the majority of the overall operating leverage that we\u2019ve talked about and that we are trying to drive towards. So the rest of numbers get a little bit more difficult as we think about the number of shares that had been issued and in the various tax rates are going on between various years as we go forward. But the guidance is kind of in line with what we were expecting from the overall standpoint of earnings per share growing. Again, as we talked about that 200 to 400 basis points faster than the revenue but unfortunately with $0.40 to $0.50 of FX hit, you take the 430 to 440 and add $0.40 to $0.50 to that, I think you are going to get to the point that it is on a constant currency basis is significant leverage over and above the revenue growth. Larry Biegelsen : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the Reveal LINQ for Mike, it\u2019s annualizing now at about $500 million. It seems like Q4 was very strong with over 20% sequential growth on. So where are you in the adoption of that product and how should we think about the growth maybe in the near-term and perhaps the next three to five years? And do you see any headwinds from either new competition or reimbursement pressure? Thanks for taking the questions. Mike Coyle : So on LINQ overall, you have to think about it in terms of its three indications for use of syncope, cryptogenic stroke and atrial fibrillation. On the syncope side, we are probably in the low to mid 20s, penetrated 0.22%. Again, I\u2019m just talking about the U.S. and Europe because that really is the place, currently where it is generating the very significant revenues and we\u2019re still building up reimbursement in other places around the world. In cryptogenic stroke, it's more like 5% penetrated. And then when you look at atrial fibrillation, it\u2019s more like 1% to 2% penetrated. So there's still plenty of growth opportunity left obviously in the product. Now, we don\u2019t expect competitors who are looking, who have basic capabilities in electronics, are going to looking at this and ignore it. So, we expect that at some point, we are going to see competitors but frankly, we haven't seen anything yet. I think we're now at a point, as we look at our five-year plans where we think this will be a billion dollar contributor to the overall product company in terms of just its diagnostic sales. And as Omar pointed out, when you look at the syncope patients, you put one of these devices and roughly 8% to 9% of those patients will end up with the pacemaker within a year and by the time you get out to year three, it's more like 20%. So it is really the source of the Low Power growth that we have seen in the United States in terms of growth in units. So, we think it is an important product line in terms of what it does for us on product sales but it also provide us now with service revenue opportunity longer term to monitor patients. And so we will be updating that as our plans develop. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. Jeff Warren : Thanks, Larry. And now time for one last question. Operator : Our final question will comes from the line of Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse. Matt Keeler : Hey, guys. This is Matt in for Bruce. Thanks for taking the questions. First for Mike, just in your press release you highlighted to have a growth of 50% worldwide, 30% in the U.S., which implies pretty significant growth, ex-U.S. 60% year-over-year, I think a $30 million step-up according to our math. So are numbers reasonably correct and can you give us any color, kind of on what drove the gains there. Was there any stock, destocking ahead of, or with the launch of the new sizes or anything else there? Mike Coyle : Just to be clear, the 30% number is the heart valve therapies numbers. So it\u2019s a combination of our transcatheter valves and surgical valves. So actually the TAVI growth in the United States is faster than the international growth. Matt Keeler : Okay. That makes sense. Can you give us any color on kind of how those split out? Mike Coyle : So, our growth in overall was about 50% in the U.S. We almost doubled our revenues in TAVI during the quarter on a year-over-year basis. So, U.S. is considerably faster in terms of its overall growth. Matt Keeler : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one follow-up on the [indiscernible] spacer launch you talked about this summer. Can you talk about when you will have reimbursement in place? It\u2019s sort of when you expect that product to be fully launched and do you see that more of a source of unit share gains, or is the opportunity therefore a more premium pricing? Mike Coyle : So, I just didn\u2019t want to finish up with the -- we don't do any meaningful stocking of transcatheter out in the U.S. just to finish your first question. On the trans continuous pacing product line, obviously, we are talking about O-U.S. now and Europe with the CE Mark that we now have. And there is no separate reimbursement in the sense of this product line obtaining different reimbursement in Europe. So it basically is being targeted at a specific set of patients who might be at risk for infection and single chamber of patient population. Although, you do see opportunities this year, a makeshift towards more single chamber pacing because of the benefit this product line offers in terms of a lower expected complication rates. So, we think it\u2019s an important breakthrough but you will see us to be deliberate in the rollout of this product. It requires very different implant technique than what the standard pacemaker has and so you will see us doing very significant training and education as we roll this out and that will gage some of the speed with which its grows. Matt Keeler : Okay. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Thanks everyone and thanks to all of you for those great questions. And with that on behalf of our entire management team, thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q1 call, which we anticipate, holding on September 3rd. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. More instructions will be given at that time. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Sir? Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Maria. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2016 first quarter, which ended July 31, 2015. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments, earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by division summary. We also updated our combined historical Covidien-Medtronic financial statement presentation. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are adjusted for the extra selling week in the first quarter and given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes Covidien Plc in the prior year comparison aligning Covidien\u2019s prior year monthly revenue to Medtronic\u2019s fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. In addition all foreign currency translation calculations are done on a comparable basis. With that, I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning we reported first quarter revenues of $7.3 billion, which represents growth of 12% at the upper end of our mid single digit range after adjusting for the extra selling week in our first quarter. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.02. Q1 was another strong quarter where our employees around the world executed and delivered results that were at the high end of our objectives. The underlying fundamentals of our business remain solid with robust contributions from all four of our groups. CVG and diabetes were in the high single digits while RTG and MITG grew in the mid single digits after adjusting the growth rates for the extra selling week this quarter. From a geographic perspective, our performance in the U.S. was particularly strong with high single digit revenue growth again after adjusting for the extra week. Our teams continue to execute on important product launches and our customers around the world are responding to our differentiated healthcare solutions that seek to demonstrate both clinical and economic value. We remain focused on our three growth strategies; therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. These strategies aim to create a competitive advantage for Medtronic by capitalizing on three long-term trends we see playing out in healthcare; namely the continued desire to improve clinical outcomes, the growing demand for expanded access to healthcare and the optimization of cost and efficiency in healthcare systems, including the move to value-based healthcare. We believe our three growth strategies are the right ones to achieve long-term growth and the resulting diversification, differentiated approach and competitive advantages will enable us to deliver on our baseline financial expectations. We've translated each of our strategies into three independent growth vectors with clearly stated near term objectives for each one. We continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals on a regular basis. In therapy innovation, we delivered above goal performance again in Q1. With the new therapies growth vector contributing approximately 1,020 basis points for our total company growth, including the benefit of the extra week. But even after adjusting for the extra week, this result was well above our goal of 150 to 350 basis points of growth. We're seeing strong acceptance for our new therapies across all groups. In addition our pipeline remains full with a number of new therapies and services expected to come to market over the next few years. In our cardiac and vascular group, the recent launches of our CoreValve transcatheter valve, IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon and Micra Transcatheter Pacing System combined with the continued growth of Reveal as well as the upcoming U.S. launch of Evera MRI ICD are all expected to drive strong growth this fiscal year. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group is driving growth with its differentiated Endo GIA Reinforced Reload and LigaSure Maryland Jaw and also has a full pipeline of minimally invasive innovations that are expected to launch over the coming quarters. In Restorative Therapies, we're building momentum from new products in Neurovascular such as the Pipeline Flex device for intracranial aneurysms and Solitaire FR stent thrombectomy device. In RTG surgical technologies division, a number of new imaging and navigation products are expected to drive growth over the coming quarters. Our Diabetes Group is realizing growth from its MiniMed 530G and 640G systems and has a number of advancements in the pipeline as we continue to drive towards an artificial pancreas. Taken together we feel confident we can deliver sustained growth from new therapies, contributing significantly to our baseline goal of mid single digit revenue growth. Turning to globalization, our emerging markets growth vector contributed approximately 190 basis points for our Q1 total company growth including the benefit of the extra week. After adjusting for the extra week, this result fell below our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points from the emerging market growth vector. This was largely due to a planned delay in distributor sales in Saudi Arabia in preparation for our channel optimization move. We have a controlling interest in the newly formed joint venture with our largest distributor in Saudi Arabia. Starting in the second quarter, this joint venture is expected to deliver incremental revenue and improved margins over our historical performance in Saudi Arabia. While the Middle East and Africa region was weaker this quarter owing to the delayed distributor sales we did see notable improvements in China, India and Russia. Mainland China grew in the low double-digits above our estimated growth of the China medical device market. Our China results benefitted from the initial implementation of our channel optimization strategy in the region, which is focused on transitioning our distribution channel to include consolidated platform distributors. We also saw improvements in India, which grew in the mid teens and Russia, which grew in the upper teens and over the long term, we believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in Medtech. In addition to standard market development activities, our differentiated approach of local channel optimization, government contracts and private partnerships are all aimed at unlocking this opportunity. Turning to economic value, our services and solutions growth vector contributed approximately 50 basis points to our growth in Q1 on a legacy Medtronic basis or 30 basis points in an overall Medtronic basis. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points we intend to grow into our goal of services and solutions are adopted by the Legacy Covidien businesses. In Cath Lab Managed Services, we're generating rapid growth as we're fast becoming the ideal partner for hospitals that seek to drive operational efficiency. We\u2019re now expanding our Cath Lab Managed Services business globally with new accounts in Eastern Europe, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Since the program is launched two years ago, we have completed 59 long-term agreements with hospital systems representing $1.3 billion in revenue over an average plan of six years and we have a large number of potential contracts at various stages of negotiation with providers around the world. In addition we\u2019ve now signed the first three operating room managed services deals in Europe each spanning nine years. ORMS applied the CLNS business model to an operating room setting, utilizing the breath of MITG\u2019s products and expertise. In diabetes, Q1 was the first full quarter of operating Diabeter, a Netherlands based diabetes clinic and research center that we intend to expand across Europe. With the Diabeter and our continued strong progress with partnerships such as IBM, we continue to transform our Diabetes Group from a market leading pump and sensor company to a leading providing of holistic diabetes management solutions that we believe will expand access, integrate care and improved outcomes so that people living with diabetes can enjoy great freedom and better health. We continue to focus on providing solutions to providers that go beyond purely medical devices including taking a leadership position in aligning our solutions to new value based payment models that are emerging in healthcare. We were pleased to see the U.S. center from Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed bundle payment initiative for hip and knee replacements. While Medtronic does not participate in hips and knees, CMS may well broaden these bundle payment initiatives to other care pathways where we do have leadership positions. Proposals like this from CMS demonstrate that a move to value-based healthcare is underway. The proposal mandates the participating hospitals be at risk for the cost and quality of the joint replacement surgery and 90 days of post acute care. As bundle payments take hold, we expect to offer unique comprehensive solutions to healthcare providers, encompassing our devices, associated diagnostics and home-based patient monitoring programs, all wrapped in risk sharing business models. Next turning to our integration efforts, the integration of Covidien into Medtronic continues to go extremely well. As I've mentioned before, we've organized our activities in four clearly defined areas; preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. We've been successfully achieving our first and highest priority preserve as evidenced by the continued revenue growth across all of our groups and geographies. We continue to monitor talent retention and overall employee satisfaction both of which remained strong. Our second priority optimize, is focused on achieving the expected minimum of $850 million in cost synergies by the end of FY'18. As planned, we've already completed over half of our value capture initiatives in the fiscal year and these savings are expected to build as we go through the year with an FY'16 goal of achieving $300 million to $350 million in savings. We're executing in our indirect sourcing plans, where we're using best case contracts and improved purchasing power to achieve meaningful savings. We\u2019re also realizing significant real estate savings having already closed over 60 facilities most of which were redundant field offices or distribution centers. Our third priority accelerate, is related to a disciplined process of assessing and prioritizing the numerous revenue synergy opportunities, which include leveraging the legacy Covidien's peripheral vascular sales force to drive sales of drug-coated balloons and leveraging Covidien's Neurovascular Division to enhance our Neuroscience strategy in RTG. In accordance with our plan, we have aligned the sales forces and integrated the back offices expeditiously in both of these areas, including moving the North American commercial operations of both businesses onto Medtronic\u2019s enterprise system SAP. Our fourth and final priority is transform. We're positioning the company to play an increasingly larger role in delivering higher value in healthcare, aligning our solutions to the emerging value-based payment markets and partnering with new stakeholders to lead and succeed in the transforming healthcare marketplace. An early example is our operating room managed services initiative in MITG where we take over the management and operations of hospital rooms -- hospital operating rooms. While we had a number of successes in Q1, we also faced some challenges including underperformance in our U.S. Core Spine business. Some of our recent product roll outs are taking longer to reach scale, but we\u2019re seeking to actively address our performance through a series of near, medium and longer term actions. In the near term, we intend to sign more large system deals to provide procedural volume share by using our new integrated RTG commercial organization. Over the medium term, we'll translate our surgical synergy initiative into a more specific commercial offering and focus the efforts of our new integrated commercial organization in promoting it. Over the longer term, we expect to see the impact of the changes we\u2019re making to our product development processes, which include incorporating several methods that have been successful in other parts of the company. Turning to the P&L, Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.02. Foreign currency translation continues to be a significant headwind affecting our Q1 EPS by $0.13 to $0.14. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP diluted EPS growth represented over 400 basis points of leverage, above our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points. We delivered $1.1 billion of free cash flow in Q1 after adjusting for certain litigation payments and non-recurring tax payments. We remain disciplined in allocating our capital with a focus on creating long term shareholder value. As a result of the Covidien acquisition, we've increased ability to deploy our cash in the U.S., solidifying our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. In June, we announced a 25% increase in our dividend, a 38th consecutive year of increasing our dividend. We expect to not only grow our dividend over time with earnings growth, but to increase our dividend payout ratio to 400% on a non-GAAP basis within the next few years. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we remain focused on delivering dependable long-term dividend growth. In addition, we remain disciplined in evaluating potential M&A opportunities. Any investment we must make -- any investment we make must be aligned with and ultimately strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies while at the same time offer high return metrics and minimize near-term shareholder dilution. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our first quarter results. Gary? Gary Ellis : Thanks Omar. First quarter revenue of $7.274 billion increased 70% as reported, 12% on a comparable constant currency basis after adjusting for a $529 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency and including the favorable impact from the extra week or at the upper end of our mid single digit range after adjusting for the extra week. Our first quarter results included an extra week due to our 52, 53-week fiscal year. While the exact benefit of the extra week is difficult to estimate, based on our analysis we calculate that it added approximately six percentage points of growth on the quarter or approximately 1.5 percentage points of growth for the full fiscal year. Legacy acquisitions and divestitures from both Medtronic and Covidien contributed 30 basis points net to Q1 growth. Q1 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.02, an increase of 3%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.57, a decrease of 34%. In addition to the $372 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter had several GAAP to non-GAAP after-tax adjustments primarily related to the Covidien transaction. A $165 million charge related to amortization of the remaining inventory purchase price step-up, a $53 million charge for acquisition-related items and a $52 million net restructuring charge. Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 35% of our total company revenue grew in the high single digits. This was a result of strong low double digit growth in Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure and mid single digit growth in both coronary and structural heart and aortic and peripheral vascular divisions. Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure or CRHF had strong above market low double digit growth again in Q1. We estimate the overall CRHF market continues to grow in the low to mid single digits. The market is showing strong preference for our leading differentiated technologies, including Evera, XT, CRT-D with its AdaptivCRT algorithm and Attain Performa Quadripolar Lead, the Arctic Front Advance Cryoablation System, the Evera MRI ICD in Japan and revealed LINQ insertable cardiac monitor in the U.S. and Europe. Strong demand for our Reveal LINQ resulted in diagnostic growth in the high 20s and is also resulting in meaningful pacemaker pull-through. In Europe, the launch of our Premium Micra Transcatheter Pacing System is off to a great start. Micra is one-tenth the size of a traditional pacemaker and is placed directly inside the heart. Looking ahead the robust productivity of our CRHF pipeline will continue as we expect to launch the Evera MRI ICD in the U.S. imminently. In addition the MRI safe version of Viva CRT-D in the U.S. and Europe, the full market release of the Arctic Front Advance Cryoablation System in Japan and the full market release of the third generation Arctic Front ST Cryo Balloon in Europe are all expected by the end of this fiscal year. Coronary and Structural Heart or CSH grew in the mid single digits driven by growth in Transcatheter Heart valves, drug-eluting stents and balloons. Transcatheter heart valves grew in the low 30s globally and in the high 30s in the U.S. In Q1 we received U.S. FDA approval for Evolut R, the first and only recashable heart valve in the U.S. and the first commercial implant started late in the quarter. Our team is focused on training U.S. Centers on this next-generation valve with its differentiated 14-French equivalent delivery catheter and we expect to be in all of our current U.S. accounts by the end of the calendar year. In Europe Evolut R is driving strong growth helping us gain share in Western Europe and we estimate we now hold the number one TAVR position in 11 European countries. In Japan we received PMDA approval for CoreValve and are anticipating reimbursement approval and launch in our third quarter. Last week we announced that we've entered into an agreement to acquire Twelve, a development stage company that is executing first in human clinical evaluations of a unique transcatheter mitral valve replacement design that we believe represents leadership technology in this phase and accelerates our time to market in this important new growth area. In drug-eluting stents, we grew in the low single digits and are holding global share on the strength of Resolute Onyx in CE mark countries and Resolute integrality in the U.S. It is worth noting that we continue to grow our U.S. DES share as an increasing percentage of U.S. DES sales are included in multi-line CVG customer agreements that leverage our broad cardiology product lines, those innovative therapies and wrap around program and services. In Q1 we also commenced enrollment in the two important clinical trials. Our first in human trial for our drug filled stent and our spiral HTN off and on med study and renal denervation. In Aortic and Peripheral Vascular Division or APVD, revenue grew in the mid single digits with low double digit growth in peripheral vascular partially offset by low single digit declines in aortic. In peripheral, we continue to execute a strong U.S. launch of our IN.PACT Admiral drug coated balloon and maintain our leading market position on the strength of our exceptional clinical data. Q1 was the first full quarter of launch utilizing our combined Medtronic and legacy Covidien peripheral sales force. We expect to file for expected indications for IN.PACT Admiral with a PMAS U.S. filing in the second half of this fiscal year for in-stent restenosis indication as well as a CE mark filing by the end of this fiscal year for an AV fistula indication. In atherectomy, we continue to see strong growth in new accounts from HawkOne Directional Atherectomy System, which has helped us stabilize share and see share gains above the knee. Last month we started the U.S. launch of the Entrust Delivery System, which is used to place our EverFlex self-expanding peripheral stent. In our Aortic business while we faced increased competitive pressure outside the U.S. and felt the impact of market reimbursement cuts in Japan, the business grew in the U.S. driven by the continued market adoption of our Endurant IIs Triple A stent graft, which resulted in sequential share gains. During the quarter our aortic business announced a number of important developments in both its organic and inorganic product pipeline including first implants of our next generation Endurant AAA stent graft platform, initiation of the U.S. feasibility clinical study for the valiant LSA branch, thoracic stent graft platform, acquisition of the Aptus Endo Anchor product line and the initiation of a joint development and staged acquisition agreement with Arsenal Medical to commercialize the company's novel and aneurysmal sac billing pump technology in AAA stent grafting applications. Now turning to our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group where it grew in the mid single digits and accounted for 34% of the total company revenue. MITGs revenue performance was driven by high single digit growth in surgical solutions and low single digit growth in patient monitoring and recovery. The Group benefited from strength in surgical volumes in the U.S., which has been incurring now for the past three quarter. Surgical Solutions grew in the high single digits with high single digit growth in advance surgical, low single digit growth in general surgical as well as low double digit growth in early technologies. Advance surgical strong quarter was driven by balanced low double digit growth in both advance stapling and advanced energy, as the business benefited from new products, the continued trend of surgical procedures moving from open to minimal invasive and the underlying strength of surgical volumes in the U.S. Early Technologies was driven by strong growth in GI solutions and interventional lung solutions. Patient monitoring recovery grew in the low single digits. Respiratory and patient monitoring, nursing care, and patient care and safety all grew in the low single digits. Respiratory and patient monitoring growth was driven by strong U.S. patient monitoring sales. Nursing care had strong sales in internal feeding. Now moving to our Restored Therapies Group; revenue grew in the mid single digits and accounted for 25% of total company revenue. Results were driven by mid 20s growth in neurovascular and high single digit growth in surgical technologies with low single digits growth in Spine and Neuromodulation. Spine grew in the low single digits in line with the global market. However, in the U.S. our core spine business underperformed the market. We recently realigned our RTG commercial sales management and we expect these changes to result in better alignment of incentives and an improved focus on cross-selling in our surgical synergy program, which integrates our spine implants and surgical technologies imaging and navigation equipment. We also expect the core spine business to improve as its numerous recent and upcoming product launches reach scale, including our alleviate expendable cage and Solera Voyager System in thoracolumbar as well as our Divergence Stand-Alone Interbody Cage the ZEVO Anterior Cervical Plate System, the PRESTIGE LP Cervical Disc and the ANATOMIC PTC interbody spacer in cervical. In neuromodulation, revenue increased in the low single digits driven by mid single digit growth in Gastro/Uro and DBS and low single digit growth in Pain stim. Our U.S. Pain stim business grew in the mid single digits, in line with the market. In pumps for Pain stim spasticity we have implemented the required changes to the distribution processes and are executing against our commitments under the consent decree we received in late April. Following an initial decline in Synchromed II implants, we saw stabilization in the back half of the quarter. In Surgical Technologies, revenue grew in the high single digits driven by mid teens growth in advanced energy, high single digit growth in Neurosurgery and mid single digit growth in ENT. Surgical technologies continues to benefit from diversified growth coming from disposals, service revenue and the strong adoption of new products including the StraightShot M5 Microdebrider and NuVent sinus balloon. Our Neurovascular Division posted strong revenue growth in the mid 20s. New products such as our Pipeline Flex device for the treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms and SOLITAIRE FR 4/40 revascularization device for stent thrombectomy are driving solid double-digit growth in Flow Diversion and Stents. We're also seeing increased pull through of our neurovascular access products given the strength of pipeline and SOLITAIRE. Earlier this week, we acquired Medina Medical and its Aneurysm abolition mesh technology for hemorrhagic stroke, which we believe can disrupt the Twelve market. Now moving to our Diabetes Group, revenues grew in the high single digits and accounted for 6% of total company sales. Low double digit growth and Intensive Insulin Management Division was driven by continued strong adoption in the U.S. of the MiniMed 530G insulin pump system was the Enlite CGM sensor. Growth was also driven by the continued international launch of the next generation MiniMed 640G insulin pump system with enhanced Enlite CGM sensor. We continue to make progress of bringing this technology to the U.S. and plan to submit the PMA for this system to the FDA later this calendar year. In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapy Division, revenue growth in the high 60s was driven by sales of professional CGM and infusion ports for type 2 diabetes and our diabetes services. In our Diabetes Services and Solutions division, high single digit growth was driven by strong consumable sales in the U.S. Our Diabetes Group announced several new partnerships in the quarter including Samsung, Becton Dickinson and Gluco. We also received the FDA approval in Q1 for the MiniMed Connect, which allows users to view their insulin pump and CGM data on a smartphone and provides remote monitoring and text message notifications for their care givers. This product is expected to launch in the second quarter. Turning to rest of the income statement, after adjusting for certain non-GAAP items mentioned earlier, the Q1 operating margin was 27.2%, which included 110 basis point negative impact from foreign currency. On a comparable constant currency basis, this represents a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins versus the prior year. Reflecting a relatively stabled gross margin a 110 basis point improvement in SG&A expense as a percent of sales and a negative 60 basis point change in net other expense due to onetime items all on a comparable constant currency basis. Included in the Q1 operating margin were non-GAAP gross margin SG&A as a percent of sales and R&D as a percent of sales of 69.3%, 33.7% and 7.7% respectively. It is worth noting that the non-GAAP gross margin SG&A and R&D were negatively affected by 130 basis points, 30 basis points and 40 basis points from foreign currency respectively. Also included in the operating margin was net other expense of $61 million including net gains from our hedging program of $64 million. We hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce the volatility and our earnings from foreign exchange. In addition a growing portion of our profits are un-hedged especially emerging markets currencies, which can create some modest volatility in our earnings. Assuming current exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which includes $1.12 Euro and 1.22 Yen, we expect the FY'16 net other expense to be in the range of $185 million to $235 million, which includes an expected impact from the U.S. medical device tax of approximately $210 million. For Q2 FY'16, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million based on the previously mentioned exchange rates. Overall, we continue to expect the full year FY'16 operating margin to be in the range of 28% to 29% on an as reported basis, which includes over 100 basis of margin improvement on a comparable constant currency basis offset by a similar amount of negative FX impact. This results in approximately 400 basis points of operating leverage on a comparable constant currency basis related to the cost synergies, which are the majority which are now expected in SG&A as a result of the Covidien acquisition as well as the continued execution on the legacy leverage initiatives of both Covidien and Medtronic. We continue to expect operating margins in the first half of the year to be below the full-year range improving in the back half of the year as the foreign exchange headwinds lessen and cost synergies accelerate. Below the operating profit line, Q1 net interest expense was $191 million a significant increase from the prior year comparable quarter, but consistent with Q4 FY'15 as we are including the incremental interest expense from our December 2014 $17 million bond offerings. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $18 billion in cash and investments and $35.6 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect Q2 net interest expense to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q1 was 18.1%. On a full-year basis, we continue to expect our FY'16 non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 18% and we expect to be at the higher end of this range until the presently expired U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated. In Q1 free cash flow was $592 million, which includes $92 million of certain litigation payments as well as $407 million of non-recurring tax payments that primarily relate to an IRS settlement. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow, excluding one-time items to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile. In Q1, we repurchased $750 million of our ordinary shares and paid $538 million in dividends. As of the end of Q1, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 100 million shares. First quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.436 billion shares. For FY'16, we continue to expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 1.433 billion to 1.437 billion shares including approximately 1.433 billion shares in Q2. Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2016 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We continue to believe that full-year revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6% on a comparable constant currency basis plus the incremental approximate 150 basis point benefit from our Q1 extra selling week remains reasonable. This operational revenue growth expectation is consistent with our stated baseline financial goal of consistently delivering mid single digit revenue growth. Our revenue outlook assumes CVG, MITG, and RTG grow in the mid-single digits and diabetes grows in the upper-single to low-double digit range all on a comparable constant currency basis and including the benefit of the extra week. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates were to remain similar to the beginning of this week for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY'16 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, including a negative $425 million to $475 million impact in Q2. Turning to guidance on the bottom line, we continue to expect cash earnings per share in the range of $4.30 to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.40 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates and approximately $300 million to $350 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition. As you think about your FY'16 models and quarterly gating, it is worth noting again that a higher percentage of the negative FX impact is in the first half of the year while more of the value capture synergies to occur later in the fiscal year. While we don\u2019t give quarterly earnings per share guidance I would note that Q1 and Q2 are often similar, but this year Q1 profitability was favorably affected from the extra week and thus we would expect street models to adjust Q2 down a few pennies from Q1. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year. I would now turn it back over to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Gary. And before opening the lines for Q&A, I\u2019d like to briefly conclude by reiterating that Q1 was a strong quarter and we feel good about the remainder of the fiscal year. We remain focused on reliably delivering in our baseline financial model. Mid single digit constant currency revenue growth, EPS growth of 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue on a constant currency basis and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. As the world continues to move towards value based healthcare, Medtronic is well positioned to provide medical technology solutions that improve outcomes while lowering cost. In fact using biomedical engineering to improve outcomes is the essence of the Medtronic mission that our Founder Earl Bakken drafted 55 years ago. To alleviate pain, restore health and extend life, this is something I am extremely passionate about and dedicate to. As our more than 85,000 employees, we're confident that our three growth strategies, therapy and innovation, globalization and economic value are the appropriate strategies to achieve our mission. The focus on these strategies is expected to result in both revenue diversification and sustained revenue growth. We expect to further leverage this revenue growth with our productivity initiatives, which have been significantly improved by our transmissional acquisition of Covidien. We expect to deliver consistent and reliable results, which when combined with our solid underlying fundamentals, strong secular growth drivers and disciplined capital allocation will enable us to create long-term dependable value in healthcare. With that, we'll now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, Geoff Martha, who recently replaced Chris O'Connell as the President of our Restorative Therapies Group is here. Geoff is a proven leader who has had responsibility for developing Medtronic's growth strategies, executing the Covedian transaction and overseeing the integration and I am confident in his ability to leverage the opportunities within RTG. Also joining us today to answer your questions is Mike Coyle, President of Cardiac & Vascular Group, Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group and also given the growing importance of our Cath Lab Managed Services Business, Rob Ten Hoedt. EVP and President, Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region is also present. We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and one follow up. If you have additional questions please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Hi, good morning. Just had a quick question for Omar, then one for Gary, Omar just your business momentum has been very, very strong and that continued obviously in this quarter and you've always talked about 4% to 6%, I guess on a go-forward basis, what's now providing as you look about the product portfolio. What gives you that confidence in that 4% to 6% and what has to go right to continue deliver on the upper end of that range over the next several quarters given some of your larger products are beginning to anniversary or the costs are getting more challenging? Omar Ishrak : Well no, we think that we have got a pipeline of new products coming out that will replace the products that are lapping in growth and besides some of them have continued momentum even after the anniversary period like the transcatheter valve where the market continues to grow. But as I pointed out in almost every group, we have a very strong pipeline of products coming out all the way from diabetes team to RTG minimally invasive CVG all of them have several new products in the pipeline. So we see this new therapies momentum continuing. And in addition I am looking to supplement that with significant growth from both emerging markets as well as services and solutions, which kind of diversify our sources of revenue and can contain any surprises that may come up and so we think that that range is a pretty reliable range and after the acquisition of Covedian it's given us even more diversification. David Lewis : Okay. So the upper end of the range Omar is not necessarily out of contention here even over the next several quarters? Omar Ishrak : Well I would say the whole range, but you're right. The momentum right now suggests that the upper end of the range is the place to go, but the range is there for a reason and so it's -- we're going to stick to the mid single digit range and we'll do everything we can to get to the upper end of the range. And given our momentum especially with new therapies and given the fact that in both services and solutions and emerging markets we expect our momentum to actually pick up in the back half of the year. There is a good possibility we could drive the higher end, but the ranges like I said is there for a reason. David Lewis : Okay. Omar, very clear. Thank you. And then Gary just one comment on the quarter, obviously revenue momentum is very strong. You had the extra selling week, I think there some are saying and in this particular quarter with the extra selling week there could have been more leverage to the bottom line. Gross margins were fine. There was some -- it looks like some discretionary spending obviously some currency, can you just give us a sense of why we wouldn't have seen more upside in the first quarter and how we're tracking versus some of the Covedian synergies. We talked about the $850 million number. I think there is an expectation that number could have upside. So this quarter relative to the extra selling week will obviously not have more leverage and how you're feeling about potential upside to the Covedian synergy number as we progress through the balance of the year, thank you? Gary Ellis : Yes David, I think you addressed kind of why we -- you didn't see quite as much of it hitting the bottom line here in Q1. Obviously we saw very strong growth both at the topline and we feel good about where we ended up on the bottom line, but there is obviously a lot of headwind. The majority of the biggest one being obviously the foreign exchange as we've highlighted foreign exchange especially in Q1, but Q1 and Q2 is probably at the peak here in these next couple of quarter and we clearly saw that in Q1 and we think that will probably become little bit less as we go through the year. In addition, the synergies are occurring basically and exactly as we expected and back to you point we're probably a little bit ahead of schedule and achieving the overall synergies that we've laid out, but we always knew that a majority of those were going to be backend loaded in the quarter here, excuse me, in the year because it just takes time for the physicians to be consolidating or having pulled together two different companies. There is lot of investments being made as we do that and so we knew that the synergies we have no expectation that we won't meet or exceed the $850 million that we've laid out as an organization. We're well on our way towards that schedule, but we knew from a timing perspective that that's a little bit higher, more in the backend of the year as you would expect and so we weren\u2019t going to get much benefit here obviously in Q1 to offset some of the foreign exchange issues. So in our view, yes, you might have expected a little bit more to the bottom line especially on the strength of the revenue growth, but there is a lot of moving parts that we're still dealing with here as we pull these two companies together and everything is on schedule, everything is going as we would expect, but the timing is also as we expected and we expected it to be a little bit less in few months and improving as we go through the fiscal year. David Lewis : Okay. Thank you very much. Ryan Weispfenning : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : Thank you, guys and congratulations again on the quarter. Let me focus again on a couple of businesses. One I wanted to touch on was neurovascular, which you said grew mid 20s and obviously has accelerated on the back of the stroke trials that came out over the past year. Can you just talk about how you see that market for stroke developing and the implications for sustainability of the recent performance? And then second, if you can give us any more insight into the upside performance within CRM, how much of that came from Reveal, which has obviously been a very big driver, Reveal LINQ, which has obviously been a big driver last few quarters versus kind of the underlying base CRM business, the ICD market, the pacemaker market. Omar Ishrak : I am going to give you a little overview and then I'll ask Geoff and Mike to help out with more detail here, I think Mike from a overall perspective the stroke market is one of our biggest opportunities and we're very excited about it. We think we're in the early stages of penetration with our new therapies and so we expect the momentum just from the therapy itself to continue. But looking into the future, we're looking at the entire stroke care pathway more carefully and we've got other products that are also impacting the stroke disease area, which we expect will have some level of pull through from our business in the stroke market. But beyond that I think both Geoff and Mike can add more color to that and certainly Mike can add their color to the CRM question. So Geoff will you start. Geoff Martha : Yes sure, we're seeing a lot of the growth in the last quarter come from the ischemic stroke market here and thrombectomy and we see that market continuing to grow worldwide in the 25% to 30% range and in the U.S. even a little higher than that. And obviously the growth that's coming now in the stroke intervention piece here is from the clinical evidence that\u2019s come out recently and we see a number of barriers though and that\u2019s driving a lot of growth and there are number of barriers though that we're working on that I\u2019d like to comment on. One is the diagnostic space and I\u2019m going to let Mike comment on that because there is a play there for our diagnostic in this area, but then there is others like the ER physician education, EMS routing, some focus on neurologists and these are areas that in addition to the intervention, we\u2019re focused on all of those areas with our team at Irvine. And so we\u2019re feeling very good about it. You saw the in the Hemorrhagic space that\u2019s all ischemic. You saw we did this Medina acquisition, which is around mesh coils, which should help us in the Hemorrhagic space, but we're not leading right now and we think this will help us in a big way there as well. So we feel very bullish about it. Just based on the clinical data, but there is a lot of other levers that we're working on like I mentioned and may be Mike if you want to comment on the diagnostic piece. Yes and broadly Mike your reviews on stroke and then go on to the CRM question. Mike Coyle : Sure, I think, you asked that CRM growth and one of the drivers is certainly linked in stroke in cryptogenic stroke. In fact, the size of the revenue contribution of Link just in the cryptogenic stroke indication is very similar to the size of the solitaire contribution in the stent thrombectomy area. So -- and we\u2019re the only company that has a complete, now profile of both diagnostic and therapeutic devices to treat ischemic stroke. So we view this as one of the largest opportunities within the company. Broadly speaking on Cardiac rhythm in general, we have modestly better market conditions and we're taking share in virtually all of the segments that we participate in. So firstly obviously link has now fully anniversaried its introduction, which occurred in the fourth quarter of last year. So it's encouraging to see that continued growth momentum in syncope as well as atrial fibrillation monitoring and so it continues to be a strong driver. In addition especially in the syncope, which is more than half of the uses of the product we get pacemaker pull-through from that. Roughly 8% to 9% of those patients will wind up having a pacing indication in the first year. The results of the pacemaker and over the three year life of the device we typically would expect to see that 20% of those patients becoming indicator for pacemakers which is driving new obviously market growth for us and we\u2019re capturing virtually all of that share of new pacemakers. In the ICD market, that we\u2019ve seen modestly improved conditions, mid single digit growth in initial implants, which is very encouraging, which obviously we're benefiting from, but also from share obviously from the attained performer of product line in CRT-D segment as well as the MRI safe Evera product line in Japan where we're seeing some nice growth. And then of course in the AF Segment, we continue to grow well above the market with our collaboration technologies really becoming the preferred intervention for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation. So all of those are driving growth for us including things like Thyrex in any effective count. So those items are all contributing to improvements in the market conditions and improvement in our share position. Mike Weinstein : Can I ask one quick follow up for Omar or Gary, if I think about the time period since the Covidien acquisition, you've made a number of small call it technology pipeline acquisition? I think I can count 8 to 10 to sum top of my head. Can you just talk about the cumulative dilution from all these really small acquisitions have been -- Twelve is not that small, but Medina and RF Surgical and all these other ones, what\u2019s the incremental dilution from that, that you're absorbing in your FY'16 guidance? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Well, first of all the way we look at this is that the business units themselves make product tradeoffs. In several of them we kind of cancel existing program to cover for that. So the first responsibility to cover the dilution actually goes right down to business units and there, there is a real savings. And then as we go up we cover in the group and then we cover at a corporate level and through that we can cover the whole dilution. The actual amount I don\u2019t know Gary, do you have sense of how much that is. Gary Ellis : No, Mike as far as -- we\u2019re having to add it up myself to say what is it recovering because back to Omar's point most of this is being either covered by the business unit or the group as they go forward with this. There are several of the small technology acquisitions that you mentioned whether it\u2019s actually existing revenue etcetera that there is almost no dilution and it will be neutral and it\u2019s highly positive. Some of them are more technology based that are going to have more of an impact from the standpoint of more clinical trials like Twelve for example on the transcatheter mitral. That will have more of a dilution impact, but yes that will be basically Mike and his team will view them as an R&D program and they\u2019ll cover that in their R&D basically budget as they move forward. So I haven\u2019t even added it up myself as far as it is actually us being focused on this discipline and if we do these types of acquisitions, we got to cover that, if is dilutive to the company, which some of them will be that we got to make trade-offs within the rest of the organization. So I don\u2019t have to tell you what the exact number is. Mike Weinstein : Understood. Thank you, guys. Gary Ellis : Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs. David Roman : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I want to maybe to start with spine given the Management change that occurred over the course of the quarter and maybe Omar and team if you go in just a bit little bit more detail in helping us understand the progression to turning that business around and what specific factors will influence an acceleration of that business and when you think we can get back to sort of a market growth type in the core franchise? Omar Ishrak : I\u2019ll let Geoff add depth to the answers here. Look, my expectation is that getting back to the core growth can\u2019t be soon enough. So we want to get there as quickly as possible and I think we\u2019re taking aggressive action especially in the near term to do with the way in which we\u2019re leveraging our integrated sales force with our products and the way we\u2019re kind of grouping these products together much more aggressively than before to make a difference in these accounts. In the mid-term, we will drive more technological synergy through surgical synergy and we\u2019ve got sales force positioned for that and longer term we\u2019re addressing some of the speed to market issues in our product development area, which we see are existing right now. They take a little time to come through the products. So, Geoff please add to that. Geoff Martha : Yes sure. Sure David first two macro comments, one losing being a shared donor in Core Spine in the U.S. is not acceptable to us and we have a real sense of urgency around turning that around. So that\u2019s number one and the team is committed to that. Number two, we\u2019re making some tangible changes in the Restorative Therapies Group and the biggest one I would say is managing it as an integrated group versus a holding company with a series of business units underneath. And when you do that this allows us to leverage our breadth to differentiate and drive growth in very targeted areas, which I\u2019ll get to in a second, but the biggest beneficiary of this change, I believe will be our spine business globally in the U.S. especially. So some of the changes, some of the specific impacts were one, we've moved to an integrated sales force in the U.S. and in Europe and that is enabling us to do some much more efficient health system wide selling. In our case, we can combine some capital equipment from our Surgical Technologies business, navigation and imaging in with our spine products and so that\u2019s helping a lot. And then more specifically enables us to drive this surgical synergy concept and this is where navigated procedures in spine using NAV, using our imaging and driving that to more of a standard of care. So there are several components of that and again spine will benefit from this. A tighter technology integration between our NAV and imaging technology with our spine implants and instruments and an R&D roadmap based off as surgical synergy offering versus just an R&D roadmap is independent spine and independent Surgical Technologies. We can get to one rep in the cases versus having a ST rep in there and a spine rep. We\u2019re developing and putting together more robust clinical and economic data and just really trying to drive the surgical synergy strategy as a standard of care and today we estimate only 14% of Core Spine procedures are navigated. So we see a lot of upsides here and a lot of it is driven by working much closer together with our spine and our Surgical Technologies business. And then finally, we've got just a laser focus on just improving our innovation cycles in spine. The speed and the impact, and I don't want to pull any punches, we're not as fast as we need to be and that's another contributor to some of these other players gaining share on us. And this is something that we're focused on at the spine level, at the RTG level and also pulling in some broader Medtronic resources to improve the speed and effectiveness of our innovation cycles in spine. So we feel like we've got a lot of levers to pull here and we're focused on it. And over the -- so I just laid out some short, medium and longer term. I think the innovation cycles you won't feel that for a couple of quarters. But the other stuff, the other initiatives, the integrated selling and surgical synergy you should feel in the more near, medium term. David Roman : That's good perspective, Geoff. Thank you. And then maybe just following up on that, Omar or Gary, anybody could talk about some of the parallels that may exist between this selling model and what you've been able to realize on the cardiology side of the business. Because I think in your prepared remarks you talked about an increased number of stents for examples being on broader product line contract sales and if you look at your performance of those businesses clearly you're benefiting from the breadth of product lines that you have to offer? Are there any parallels that you could draw between that experience and the spine/imaging navigation side of the business that may give us more confidence in sort of the success of the strategy on the spine side of the business? Omar Ishrak : Yes, look, I think you described it very well. That's exactly it. I think our near term strategies are exactly what you described that we've learned from our CVG experience that putting an integrated sales force together with a complete suite of products with specialists in the field can drive and some aggressive contracting based on that can drive pretty quick growth in sales and capture good accounts. We really haven't done that in spine, because the sales forces have never really been put together. That mean informal context, as that\u2019s on the same as organizationally being integrated. And I think that's one of the things that we have done in the last 3 to 4 months and we're absolutely going to leverage as we go forward. And so the CVG parallel is a good one. Geoff Martha : This is Geoff, just to build on that. I mean, not ashamed to say that we're definitely looking at the playbook that Mike Coyle and the CVG team have followed over the last four plus years and we definitely are getting a lot of confidence and inspiration from that. And then don't overlook MITG either, because they've done a lot of this over the last couple of years as they compete against a J&J. And so I think we have two parallels to look at that aren't exactly the same, but we're drawing lessons from both of those and have already taken steps. And then finally one advantage we have that even CVG, no offense, Mike, doesn't have - is we have real technology integration between the navigation and imaging and the power tools and the implant. So there's real technology integration there to drive procedural innovation that not only gets at economic outcomes, procedures more efficiently and faster, but also clinical outcomes. We need to do a better job of developing that data and getting it out there, because once surgeons try this, they really like it. There's a lot of surgeons and particularly in spine that are more experienced and sometimes they say hey, look, I don't need this. But once they try it typically they don't want to go back to do an un-navigated. So we feel very good about that and we just have to really focus on this more over the next couple quarters. David Roman : Okay. Great. Geoff Martha : Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Hopkins of Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Thanks. And good morning. So wanted to start out first with Omar. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on your comments on emerging markets since it's so topical. And so I guess my question is just specifically what was the growth in emerging markets for Medtronic and was Middle East and Africa the only area where you saw a slowdown and then I was just wondering if you could just comment generally on your confidence in the near and intermediate term that emerging market growth can continue? Omar Ishrak : Well, first, I'm very confident. And in fact, the Middle East and Africa was really the only region which was significantly impacted because of the reasons that I stated, because of the distributor sales. The underlying operational performance was fine and we expect that to bounce back this very quarter. I think Latin America was a little softer than we'd like. But the other regions were much stronger than they've been historically and in particular I know that's in everyone's mind here, we were actually quite pleased with what we saw in China. We had low double-digit growth in China, which actually is better than what we've been seeing in most quarters last year. We feel that we've outperformed the overall market. All of - the med device market there was reasonably strong. We did outperform it, but the underlying market was quite robust. We feel at this stage with what we know and what we can - intelligence that we can get from our own people and the market itself, we feel pretty good that we can continue this and in fact accelerate it in the back half. Because we'll get some tailwind out of the Middle East and China seems to be okay, at least from what we can see. Latin America may be a little more pressured, but China seems strong. India is definitely coming back. Russia is definitely strong. Southeast Asia is also well into the teens in growth. And so we've got every reason to believe that with our diversified position right now we have a right to expect sort of double-digit type growth out of emerging markets and I haven't given up like I said earlier on the objective of high double-digits because I think that's what we're entitled to. We've just got to find a way to unlock it. Robert Hopkins : Great. That's very helpful. And then for my second question, I think I heard mention that Bryan was on the line and so I wanted to ask a question about Covidien's businesses both this quarter and how they've been trending, just especially on the kind of the core general surgery markets of energy and stapling? Just some thoughts on how is the legacy Covidien business doing and specifically energy and stapling in the quarter and recent trends? Bryan Hanson : Hey, Bob. It's good to hear from you. Yeah, so far, so good, right. We've been able to stay focused on the business. We've been able to continue to perform as part of Medtronic as we have in the past. I feel really good about the new products that we've launched. Omar mentioned a couple, but we have a whole family of products in advanced stapling and advanced energy, they are doing quite well for us. And of course as you know, Bob, we're not going to sit and wait for those to continue. We've got others coming behind them. So I see the momentum in surgery in particular in the US elevating just because you see more surgical procedures, but I also see that shift from open procedures to MIS and that's creating momentum not just for us, but really for all players in the surgical marketplace. So a good market that we're in. We've not lost our focus which is key and we continue to deliver technologies that our patients and customers need. Robert Hopkins : Great. Good to hear. Thanks, Bryan. Bryan Hanson : Yes. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Bob. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Hey. Good morning, everybody. I guess just as a -- I guess to follow up on Bob's question. I was just wondering kind of for Omar and then also for Bryan just kind of under the new kind of Medtronic umbrella has there been any change of thinking for the Covidien Group now on the idea of robotics and the importance of robotics, especially now that J&J has announced that they are teaming up with Google to have a platform. And I don't know whether or not being under the Medtronic umbrella has changed kind of thoughts in that realm and then I have a second follow-up? Omar Ishrak : I think -- okay. First of all, just a few words and I'll let Bryan make the brunt of the commentary on this one. First, from an overall Medtronic perspective, look, the importance of robotics is pretty clear. And it's a trend that we can drive in an application focused way and I feel confident that our team can address that market. I think from an overall change perspective, I think a focus on some longer term investments is probably the biggest single change that I hear from Covidien, ex-Covidien employees. But I think Bryan is best suited to give more color to that, as well as the robotics strategies. Go ahead, Bryan. Bryan Hanson : There's been a number of changes if I think about just broadly how we think about our strategy. But specifically to robotics we're continuing down the path that we were on previous to the acquisition and we're going to continue that path as part of Medtronic. And you spoke a little about some competitors out there that are focusing in the areas as well. I actually like to see that because we are making significant investments in this area, it gives me confidence that robotics is here to stay, the embodiment of what's that going to look like, and how it\u2019s going to get traction, you know, still a question mark in my mind. But I do feel like it's here to stay. The way I look at it from a strategic standpoint is we as an organization are highly focused on optimizing surgical procedures around the world and I kind of look at it a as three legs of a stool from a surgical perspective. One is open surgical procedures because there's a whole heck of a lot of procedures that are still done open and they're done inefficiently. And we have advanced energy and stapling products that help the efficiency of those procedures and we're going to continue to invest there. The other leg of the stool is what I would define as traditional MIS. This is an area that I think we've done quite well and have shown our ability to lead the market and we're going to continue to invest from a therapy innovation standpoint on that leg of the stool. And we have been making significant investments in robotics and that will continue. Looking forward to the day that we actually enter the market with robotics and we're driving revenue and not just investment, but that will come. But to me, all three legs of the stool need to be in play for someone to be sustainably successful in the marketplace. In addition of to that, you've heard a little bit of talk about it today, that we would overlay our capabilities from a service perspective and bring OR managed services to the table, so that we can further optimize the efficiency of the operating room. And to me the combination of those three things I referenced from a therapy standpoint with services really will differentiate us in the space. But robotics is a piece of the puzzle, I guess is what I am saying, its not the whole puzzle. Kristen Stewart : Got you. And then my follow up question was just more broadly, Omar, for you. Now that you've had Covidien under your belt for I guess now about eight full months. How are you thinking just about all the businesses? And I guess as you look more holistically too at the Medtronic portfolio, do you think at this stage you have come to any conclusions or do you think you're close to coming to any conclusions that there's some businesses that maybe don't or no longer fit in the portfolio that we could see some divestitures or do you think that all the pieces still make sense? Omar Ishrak : First, from an overall perspective, I think you understand the way in which we organized into the four groups. So that's our kind of primary strategic alignment. The goals and objectives of each of those groups are clear, into which sorts of market spaces they participate in. And within MIPG we're still looking through that portfolio. I know there was some questions around some of those businesses. I think right now we're still looking to see a number of things. First of all, do they add to our overall strategy of MITG and we're going through that carefully. We're not prepared to conclude on it completely. But right now they're all contributing. Do they fulfill our mission and are inline with our missions? They are. So right now, we've got what we've got and we're driving to see if we can get growth from all of them. I think it's a little premature to decide, although I I know it's been six or eight months. But we made some changes in the way in which we invest and to see if that investment change will result in or what they will result in, I think we need a little longer to assess. So I'd say Kristen that we're still - at this stage we've got everything there. It all fits from a clinical relevance perspective, from a mission perspective. Whether we can - in our new paradigm of investment of some of those businesses can we change the equation more, we'll have to see. So it's a little bit works in progress still. But by and large we're treating them like they should be in that they're completely part of MITG. Bryan you want to add anything to that. Bryan Hanson : Well said. I mean, we're working through our own strategy and again some mindset shifts associated with our own strategy and we haven\u2019t worked through that yet. As we do we'll get a better feel for the fit of these - of all aspects of what was legacy Covidien and make decisions based on that. One thing too, and not just from the perspective of MITG, but if you look at the broader hospital solutions opportunity and the services that we bring to bear we also have to look through that paradigm to make sure that the products that we have if they don't fit the MITG strategy still might fit the overall hospital solutions strategy. So lots to still work through, but clearly we're looking at it. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Great. Ryan Weispfenning : We probably have time for one more question. Thanks. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Joanne Wuench of BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuench : Can you hear me? Omar Ishrak : Yes, we can Joanne. Joanne Wuench : Oh! Terrific. Thank you so much. One of the things that struck us during this earnings season was the commentary from a number of companies regarding hospital surgical volume. If we take a big picture or big step back, big picture, what do you see going on in terms of that in the United States and how do you see that in the coming months and quarters? Omar Ishrak : Well, you know, again, I'll let Bryan, maybe Mike also can comment on that a little bit, because I've got two of the bigger businesses here. But clearly the US is strong and procedure growth is strong. We -- on both the MITG and CVG we've taken share, but I think we'll all acknowledge that the procedure growth is really strong. And we think that the revitalized economy, as well as the Affordable Care Act are both contributing to that depending on the nature of the procedure. We think it's too early to tell, but we think there's some sustainability to this. But I think maybe Bryan your perspective first and I'll let Mike Coyle comment also for a little bit. So Bryan, go ahead. Bryan Hanson : Yes, again, I don't know that I have a whole lot to add to what you said. But it's clear to us, and we've got folks that are the in the operating room in the US every day, and the best litmus test for me on whether or not surgical procedures are up or when these guys go in the morning, look at the boards and see the number of procedures either during the week and on the weekends. And we're definitely seeing a heightened number of surgical procedures from every company that I've seen present - everyone's seeing that momentum in their organization. I would expect it to continue, though we've had it now three quarters. The question for me will be when it annualizes what does it look like at that point, but it is contributing so far for us and driving our mid single digit growth and I would expect it to continue. Geoff Martha : Mike, you've also seen some good growth in the cardiac space\u2026 Mike Coyle : Right. Geoff Martha : So go ahead, why don't you make some comments\u2026 Mike Coyle : Sure. I would echo that certainly in the pacemaker and ICD arena, we've seen the improvement come in initial implants which is very encouraging. And from my perspective, we're seeing sort of mid single digit growth in initial implants in ICDs in particular, which is quite a change from what we've seen in recent years. And just anecdotally talking to customer accounts about this, they do seem to think that the availability of insurance for people who absolutely need it because they have a sickness and they can't be turned down for coverage is helping drive those volumes. Joanne Wuench : That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, when the Covidien agreement was announced last year, one of the ideas was to cross sell what we call the buffet table of products as you went into the hospital administrator. Given that its early days, what kind of feedback are you receiving when you go into say hey, we've got - I think quote was six of the top 10 areas really well covered now by products? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : First, we - you might have said that on day one, I'm not sure, but certainly as we laid out our strategies that was not one of our core strategies. It was more around value creation because we had Covidien products which created value within the hospital and with our Medtronic products which were like chronic disease products. And we said that in value based healthcare, we have a broader set of assets that we could use to participate in value based healthcare model, where a broader continuum of products helps. So that was our primary notion around the breadth that we had. The fact that we have more - that we're more significant partner to a hospital, I think is important, but that alone is not one of our key strategies. I think that gets us in the door, but each of our product lines have to perform, perform competitively with the physicians and against our competition. And then if you do have a seat at the table which others don't then we go and leverage that. But that's not our primary integration point with Covidien. I mean, there are others like periferovascular and neurovascular which are much more directed revenue synergy efforts where we're seeing very good results. And then in the operating room managed services we're - this aspect of moving towards value based healthcare is again where we're seeing real benefit. I think those are the ways in which we can make a true differentiated impact in healthcare. I think the fact that we are just broader helps, but that's not a critical growth driver for us on its own. Gary Ellis : Kristen [ph] This is Gary. Just to add to what Omar said. I mean, I think as he indicated, the idea to say there's a lot more contracted -- of the entire portfolio, no, that hasn't happened nor did we necessarily expect that was going to be the case. But it clearly has helped us get into as we know with governments or CEOs and hospital systems, it's clearly helped us as we deal with insurance companies et cetera that we have the broader portfolio, so we're talking about a lot of different options. But could we point to a bunch of contracts where we negotiated across the product portfolio, the answer is no. And we didn't expect that. What we did expect however, was just the strength of the portfolio will clearly get us in conversations with high level officials across organizations and much better format. And I think that is happening and you're seeing that on some of the hospital solutions. You now see we have our first hospital solutions in the operating room with basically the former Covidien product line. So we're seeing that all happening and back to Omar's point we're seeing the synergies across the individual product portfolio, but not from the standpoint of we're all contract bundling perspective. Joanne Wuench : Terrific. Thank you so much. Gary Ellis : Okay. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Okay Thanks to all of you for your questions and with that and on behalf of our entire management team I'd like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q2 call which we currently anticipate holding on December 3rd. Thank you all and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. The call will be opened for a question and answer session following the speakers' prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead? Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thank you, Maria. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2016 second quarter, which ended October 30, 2015. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments, earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by division summary. We also updated our combined historical Covidien-Medtronic financial statement presentation, which is posted to our investor relations website. This presentation now contains FY'15 quarterly P&L stated on a month-aligned basis instead of the prior quarter-aligned basis. Comparisons made today will be against the month-aligned P&L. Next, you should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, and our year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes Covidien Plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning. Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter revenues of $7.1 billion, representing growth of 6% at the upper end of our mid-single digit expectations. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.03, growing at 11% on a comparable constant currency basis and reflecting 480 basis points of leverage, above our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points. Q2 was a strong quarter. Our operational performance remains consistent and we believe sustainable across all our functions, groups and regions. At the same time, we are outperforming the overall market and delivering operating leverage. We are also executing on our value capture programs from the Covidien integration and realizing the targeted cost synergies. This combination of solid top-line growth and leverage is generating significant accessible free cash flow, which provides us enormous flexibility to deploy through strong returns to our shareholders, paying off debt and pursuing targeted acquisitions. Despite our strong performance however, we recognize foreign translation is a significant pressure to our bottom-line on a reported basis as it is for most multinationals, but we are attempting to offset this as much as possible by stretching our operations and through our conventional hedging programs. As we look ahead though, our confidence continues to grow around our ability to develop the right mindset; business models and offerings to lead and compete in the emerging value based healthcare models around the world. I am pleased with our organization's willingness and aptitude to explore new and novel ways for Medtronic to not only deliver better clinical and patient outcomes, but to tie success to these outcomes with providers, payers and governments. Our strong revenue growth is resulting from crisp execution on three growth strategies, therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. These strategies are designed to create competitive advantage for Medtronic by capitalizing on three long-term trends that we keep playing out in healthcare. Namely, the continued desire to improve clinical and economic outcomes, the growing demand for expanded access to healthcare and the optimization of cost and efficiency within healthcare systems. We have tried [ph] to take in each of our strategies into three independent growth vectors and we continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals. In therapy innovation, we are seeing very strong adoption of our new products. Our new therapies growth vector accounted for nearly three quarters of our total company growth contributing approximately 420 basis points. This remains well above our goal of 150 basis points to 350 basis points. In our cardiac and vascular group, which grew 8%, we continue to see strong growth from recently launched products that are helping to create important, rapidly growing new medtech markets such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, drug-coated balloons, AF ablation and insertable diagnostics. CVG is also seeing new therapies drive growth in space businesses such as our recently launched Evera MRI ICD, which is helping to drive both, sequential and year-over-year global high power market share gains. Over the coming quarters, we expect to launch a number of additional exciting new products that will continue to differentiate us in the market and help protect and grow our leadership position. For example, we continue to make progress on bringing our revolutionary Micra Transcatheter Pacing System to the U.S. Last month, we had a very successful late breaking data presentation at AHA, and a simultaneous New England Journal of medicine publication. This data form the basis for our FDA submission, which we filed in Q2. In addition, CVG continues to invest in key intermediate to long-term technology programs. Building on our success in transcatheter aortic valves, we are particularly enthusiastic about our recent acquisition of COV. This company has a differentiated transcatheter mitral valve, which has the potential to create a new, multi-billion dollar end market. We are also making progress in enrolling our SPYRAL HTN clinical program for renal denervation, an important therapy that we are pioneering. Renal denervation has the potential to help fulfill the huge unmet need in treatment resistant hypertension. Overall, I feel that our strategy has positioned us exceptionally well in the global cardiovascular device market. The team is executing consistently, gaining share, developing new markets and effectively leveraging it is breadth of therapy innovations to positively affect the lives of thousands of patients around the global. In our minimally invasive therapies group, which grew 3%, new therapies such as our differentiated Endo GIA Reinforced Reload stapling system and LigaSure Maryland Jaw laparoscopic surgery sealer and divider are driving strong growth. MITG has a full therapy innovation pipeline, with a specific focus on four areas, the transition from open surgery to minimally invasive surgery, respiratory compromise, lung cancer and gastrointestinal cancer. Across these growth drivers, we are developing solutions that span the entire continuum of care aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster competition free recovery, and enhance patient outcomes through less invasive solutions. I am pleased with the clear strategic roadmap the MITG team has developed through a very complex mix of products and capabilities. The strategy supports the outcomes-based Medtronic mission and will serve as the foundation against which we are assessing our entire MITG portfolio. In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 5%, we have a number of new products driving growth. In Surgical Technologies, we recently launched O-arm 2 [ph] surgical imaging system NuVent sinus balloon. In Neurovascular, our pipeline Flex and Solitaire FR devices are leading the rapidly growing stroke market. In spine, our business outside the United States performed well and grew above the market. In the U.S., while our performance was below market, we did see sequential improvement after adjusting for the extra week in Q1. In Neuromodulation, while we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments and are focused in resolving this matter our - revenue has been somewhat affected by this situation. We also are facing increased competition in Pain Stim where our sales were flat compared to last year. Our Restorative Therapies Group is urgently addressing these specific issues as well as leveraging the breadth and scale of the group to the commercial implementation of surgical synergy. One example is a program that combines O-arm placements with increased spine implant commitments. Under our new integrated RTG sales management structure, we have already finalized several of these contracts in the first half of this fiscal year and have seen notable increases in our spine implants sales in these accounts. While still early, our expectation is that strategies like this will result in improved performance. Our Diabetes Group, which grew 11%, also has new products driving growth, including the MiniMed 530G and MiniMed 640G systems as well as MiniMed Connect, which provides convenient and discreet access to patient data and remote monitoring from the user smartphone. In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapy Division, we recently launched pattern snapshot for iPro Professional CGM, which uses new algorithms to streamline data interpretation for healthcare professionals. These advancements along with a full pipeline of new products and solutions are aimed at creating an annual cadence of innovation that can extend our leadership position globally. As a result of the products that are currently launching, as well as our robust pipeline and the potential of new markets across all of our groups, we believe, we sustain our new therapy growth vector at the upper end of the 150-basis point to 250-basis point range. Now let's turn to our globalization strategy. In Q2, emerging markets grew 11%, a sequential improvement over the prior quarter and contributed approximately 140 basis points to our Q2 total company growth. This was just below are baseline goal of 150 basis points to 200 basis points, but we are encouraged by a relatively consistent above market performance in countries that are under significant macroeconomic pressure. We continue to see increased diversification of our emerging market revenue, which stabilizes the growth rate and reduces the dependency of any single market. In Q2, Greater China, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America, India and Southeast Asia, all grew double-digits. In Mainland China, we grew 13% and improved sequentially the balance contributions from each of our four groups. We continue to implement our channel optimization strategy in China, which is focused on transitioning our distribution channel to include consolidated platform distributors. We are also leveraging the breadth of our therapies to establish expanded multiline selling presence in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Another priority is to develop deep partnerships for the Chinese governments such as the one that we have already forged for the Chengdu Government in Sichuan Province and are looking to further broaden. Recently, our entire executive committees spent a week in China meeting with the several provincial and central government officials to discuss the creation of more partnerships across all of our businesses. Although complex, China will become the largest healthcare market over the long-term, serving more patients and doctors than any other country. We can never lose sight of this potential. In the Middle East and Africa, we grew 10%, driven by newly formed joint venture with our largest Saudi distributor. Despite political instability in the region, our team continues to deliver strong growth, reflecting the fact that governments in this region continue to prioritize healthcare investments. In Latin America, we grew 11%, driven by Mexico, Chile and Argentina. In Brazil, we significantly outperformed the market, with strength in MITG, Neurovascular and Neuromodulation. While the outlook in Brazil remains uncertain given the macroeconomic and healthcare challenges in the country, we believe we can outperform the market by continuing to partner with healthcare stakeholders to reduce costs while improving patient outcomes. We did experience some weakness this quarter in Eastern Europe and Russia, which together account for less than 10% of our emerging market revenue. This was a result of a planned distributor changeover in Eastern Europe, continued weakness in the Ukraine and Belarus and year end procedure delays affecting our MITG business in Russia. We continue to make progress in pursuing potential opportunities such as government partnerships to improved growth in this region. Across emerging markets, we are applying our standard market development activities as well as our differentiated approach of local channel optimization in China, India and Saudi Arabia and establishing government partnerships like the one in Chengdu. In addition, we are developing unique partnerships with private entities such as the Abraaj Group. In Q2, we made a commitment to Abraaj Group's growth market's health fund, which is focused in improving access to health care in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, as well as the other developing markets. Abraaj Group purchases our bills, hub hospitals, surrounded by networks of referring hospitals and clinics. We are strategic partners in this market development effort, with a commitment to improve patient access, healthcare delivery outcomes and efficiency and product supply within these Abraaj hospital networks. In summary, we believe that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in medtech over the long-term. Turning now to our economic value growth strategy, our services and solutions growth vector contributed approximately 20 basis points to our Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, it represents strong mid-30s growth, almost all organic. We expect to further improve our growth as service as a solutions is adopted and expanded across all our business groups. In Care Management Services, formerly known as Cardiocom, we had high-teens growth in Q2, driven by a strong performance within the U.S. via healthcare system. This business represents an important platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in the bundled payment models of the future for different states. In Cath Lab Managed Services or CLMS, where we provide administration, operational efficiency expertise and daily management of Cath Lab [ph] hospitals, we continue to generate rapid growth. In Q2, we expanded our CLMS business into Latin America by purchasing a majority stake in auction to acquire Cardiored, a privately held Chilean Cath Lab Managed Services provider. Cardiored already has a presence in Chile, with long-term agreements to operate 10 Cath Labs and 9 private clinics throughout the country. We expect the Medtronic's scale will help to quickly expand Cardiored presence both, within Chile and throughout Latin America. We also continue to expand our operating room managed services or ORMS offering, which applies Cath Lab business model to an operating room setting, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and expertise. We have now signed six ORMS deals, representing approximately $140 million in cumulative revenue with an average life of seven years. Since starting hospital solutions two years ago, we have now completed a total of 66 long-term CLMS and ORMS agreements with hospital systems, representing over $1.5 billion in revenue over an average span of six years and we have a large number of potential contracts at various stages of negotiation with providers around the world. We also continue to expand our solutions offerings into diabetes care delivery with Diabeter, a Netherlands-based diabetes clinical research Center that has developed a unique care model that incorporates standardized and scalable protocols and we continue to grow the number of Diabeter patients expect to expand Diabeter beyond the Netherlands to other countries around the globe as we transform our Diabetes Group from a market-leading pumps and sensor company to a holistic diabetes management company. All of these activities are expected to serve as building blocks for value-based healthcare, where payment is based in actual outcomes over specific time horizon. Specifically, we are creating unique offerings that combine bundled solutions across the care continuum to target specific patient populations or cohorts within a particular disease. This is consistent with the direction of CMS's bundled payment initiative, which we fully support and are encouraging expansion into other three states, where we participate. In the end, we remain convinced that there is an incredible amount of value to be realized in healthcare and we believe our technologies and services can play a central role, with providers, payors and governments to make this shift to value-based healthcare successful. Turning now to the P&L, and as I mentioned earlier, we delivered EPS leverage in Q2 of 480 basis points in a comparable constant currency basis, which exceeded our baseline expectation of 200 basis points to 400 basis points. All areas of our global operations are executing to the plan we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year as we deliver our productivity improvements and cost synergy expectations. We also executed below the operating income line, delivering above plan financial performance through higher interest income, a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. It is also worth noting that the strong performance was against a difficult comparison due to legacy Covidien's fiscal year end in the prior year. For the back half of this fiscal year, we expect to significantly exceed our baseline EPS leverage expectation of 200 basis points to 400 basis points. As we have communicated, this over performance will be driven by planned cost synergies from the Covidien integration. The integration of Covidien is in fact going very well. We are executing on our priorities to preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. Our cultures continue to come together, talent retention and employee satisfaction, which we monitor and quantify through frequent employee surveys and focus groups remained strong. Our cost synergy efforts thus far have been focused in the following areas. In direct sourcing, where we are using best case contracts and improved purchasing power to achieve meaningful savings, common expense policies, which we are driving across the organization. Real estate, where we have now closed over redundant sites mostly back-office and field distribution centers and SAP, where we are bringing legacy Covidien entities on to Medtronic's common enterprise system, leveraging our internal expertise from having orchestrated similar system-wide implementation within legacy Medtronic. In addition to executing on the promise cost synergies, every function is encumbering additional opportunities for savings. Covidien acquisition is truly serving as a catalyst to re-examine and redefined our overall operating models and cost structures. Another key element of the Covidien acquisition that we are just beginning to execute on is unlocking our trapped cash. We were able to free a significant amount of our trapped cash in Q2, transferring $9.3 billion into accessible cash to an internal reorganization as part of the Covidien legal entity integration. The ability to deploy this cash in the U.S. gives us increased flexibility and options. We are working quickly and diligently to determine the best way to utilize this cash, with the priority of creating long-term shareholder value, and will communicate our strategy in the very near-term. This is just one more example of the benefit of the Covidien acquisition, perhaps even more meaningful than the cost synergies that we are delivering. The improved financial flexibility and our ability to invest in U.S. technologies and products as well as return additional cash to shareholders is and is expected to continue to be a significant differentiator for Medtronic shareholders. Our strong revenue growth and focus on operating leverage is generating significant free cash flow. In Q2, we generated $1.1 billion and are expecting to generate nearly $40 billion in free cash flow over the next five years. We are deploying our capital with a focus on M&A investments, providing strong returns to our shareholders and meeting our debt commitments. Earlier this fiscal year, we increased our dividend by 25% in and we expect to grow our dividend rate faster than earnings, with the intent of reaching a 40% payout ratio on a non-GAAP basis within the next few years. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we remain focused on delivering dependable long-term dividend growth. This quarter, we also accelerated our share repurchase activity from our prior plans and are committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Regarding investments, we remain disciplined when evaluating potential M&A opportunities. Any investment we must make must be aligned with and ultimately strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies, while at the same time offers high return metrics and minimize near-term shareholder dilution. In summary, I am extremely pleased with how our team is executing and Gary will not take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter results. Gary? Gary Ellis : Thanks, Omar. Second quarter revenue of $7.058 billion increased 62% as reported or 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes the $452 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 30 basis points to Q2 revenue growth. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $1.03, an increase of 1% versus the $1.02 delivered by Medtronic, Inc. last year, for an increase of 11% on a comparable constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.12 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.36, a decrease of 57%. This quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were up $442 million certain tax adjustment, primarily related to the internal reorganization that resulted in approximately $9.3 billion of previously trapped cash becoming accessible and $29 million loss on forward interest rate swaps related to the same internal reorganization, a $373 million amortization charge, a $56 million net restructuring charge and $32 million acquisition-related items charge, primarily related to the Covidien integration and a $17 million certain litigation charge related to increased product liability. For Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 35% of our total company, revenue grew revenue by 8%. CVG had strong performances in all three of its divisions, with each growing above the company average. Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure or CRHF, had another strong quarter with 7% revenue growth, which included mid single-digit growth in both, high power and low power, high 20s growth in AF solutions and low 30s growth and Services and Solutions. We estimate the CRHF implantables market is growing in the low-single digits and we continue to take share both, year-over-year and sequentially. High Power had particularly strong quarter in U.S. ICDs, driven by the launch of the Evera MRI ICDs, the only FDA-approved MR conditional ICD system. We also continue to see strong customer acceptance of our differentiated CRT-D technology, including our AdaptivCRT algorithm, quadripolar lead VectorExpress programming and improved device longevity. In low power, we are seeing strong demand for review link, which resulted in robust diagnostic growth in the mid-20s. Pacemakers sales also have solid mid single-digit growth in the U.S., where we gained over 400 basis points a share due to strong pacing pull-through generated by review link and increasing customer preference for MRI safe technology, including our recently FDA-approved Advisa SR MRI single chamber device. Looking ahead, we are expecting to receive FDA and CE Mark approvals for both, our Amplia MRI and Compia MRI CRT-Ds along with our Visia AF MRI single chamber ICD by end of the fiscal year. Our Coronary & Structural Heart division grew 10%, with mid-20s growth in Heart Valve Therapies, mid-single digit growth in coronary and low single-digit growth in Extracorporeal Therapies In Heart Valve Therapies, transcatheter valves grew in the high-30s globally, including mid-fifties growth in the U.S., our first full quarter of U.S. commercial launch of the CoreValve Evolut R. We estimate the global TAVR market is growing nearly 30%. In Japan, we are expecting reimbursement and launch of CorVel in Q3. Regarding the intermediate risk, we expect to meet our SURTAVI trial enrollment target this winter and submit to the FDA by the middle of FY'17, with data expected at ACC 2017. In our coronary business, drug-eluting stents grew mid-single digits globally, including high single-digit growth outside the U.S. on the strength of Resolute Onyx and mid single-digit growth in the U.S. from the continued acceptance of Resolute integrity. In balloons, we grew low double digits as we continue to gain share with our differentiated Euphora PTCA product family. In the Aortic & Peripheral Vascular division revenue grew 10%, including mid single-digit growth in Aortic, low double-digit growth in peripheral and mid-teens growth in endoVenous. In Aortic, while we face increased competitive pressure outside the U.S. and felt the impact of market reimbursement cuts from Japan, the business grew in high single-digits in the U.S., driven by the continued market adoption of our enduring Endurant IIs AAA stent graft. We also are seeing strong adoption of our Aptus Endo Anchor technology, which is resulting in competitive comp conversion and AAA device pull-through. In peripheral, we continue to execute on our U.S. launch of the In.Pact Admiral drug-coated balloon and maintain our leading market position on the strength of our exceptional, clinical and economic data. Data presented at TCT and published in JACC, showed sustained superiority in primary patency and re-intervention rates over balloon angioplasty at two years. Cost-effectiveness data released at Viva showed In.Pact Admiral lowers the overall cost of treatment. In endoVenous, we launched VenaSeal closure system in the U.S. last month and expect it to drive growth in this business going forward. Across CVG, the use of wraparound programs, services and solution bundles and multi-line contracting strategies continue to drive growth, with a number of cross business multi-line contract growing over 20% in U.S. Now turning to our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, revenue grew 3% and accounted for 33% of total company revenues. MITG's revenue performance was driven by mid single-digit growth in surgical solutions and low single-digit growth in patient monitoring and recovery. It is worth noting that MITGs growth this quarter was slightly slower than its historical run rate as a result of a difficult comparison due to the legacy Covidien fiscal year end in the year ago. Surgical Solutions growth of 5%, included mid single-digit growth in advanced surgical and early technologies and low single-digit growth in general surgical. Advanced Surgical continued to benefit from new products and the continued shift from open to minimally invasive surgery. The business had solid growth in EndoStapling, driven by the Endo GIA Reinforced Reload as well as in Vessel Sealing as a result of the continued acceptance of the LigaSure Maryland Jaw. We estimate that surgical volume market growth in U.S., while still growing has normalized. General surgical benefited from the RF Surgical acquisition, which closed in Q2. Early Technologies delivered strong results, particularly in the U.S. from growth in gastrointestinal diagnostics. The Patient Monitoring & Recovery division grew 1% in line with its market. Respiratory & Patient Monitoring as well as patient care and safety grew in the low single digits, with Nursing Care declining in the low single digits. Respiratory and patient monitoring results were driven by growth in sensors and acute ventilators. Patient Care & Safety results were driven by strength in electrode sales, particularly in the U.S. While Nursing Care declined, it had strengthened in enteral feeding. Now moving to our Restorative Therapies Group, revenue grew 5% and encountered for 25% of the total company revenue. Results were driven by low 30s growth in Neurovascular and high single-digit growth in Surgical Technologies, with low single-digit growth in Neuromodulation flat results in Spine. In Spine, our overall international sales grew 5% and Core Spine business grew 6%, which was significantly above the market. Spine had strong double-digit growth in Japan, in the Middle East and Africa and solid mid-single digit growth in Canada and Latin America. Offsetting Core Spine's strong international performance was BMP, which had flat international sales in the quarter due to the impact of stop shipment in Europe. This issue is limited to our third-party manufacturing facility that only supply the European market. While the supplier has identified the remediation plan, we do expect to be off market for the remainder of the fiscal year, reducing our expected international BMP revenue by approximately $7 million per quarter. In the U.S. Spine declined 2% and the Core Spine business declined 4% underperforming the market, which grew in the low single digits. We expect our U.S. Core Spine performance to improve as we realize the results from our recently realign RTG commercial sales management as well as the implementation of the surgical synergy programs that Omar mentioned earlier. In addition, we expect Core Spine results to improvement as numerous recent and upcoming product launches reach scale, including our Elevate Expandable Cage and Solera Voyager System in thoracolumbar as well as our divergence standalone Divergence Stand-Alone Interbody Cage the ZEVO Anterior Cervical Plate System, the PRESTIGE LP Cervical Disc and ANATOMIC PTC interbody spacer in cervical. Turning to Neuromodulation, revenue increased 2%. We continue to face challenges in our drug pump business as a result of the FDA consent decree. The division had strong growth in deep brain stimulation driven by referral development, emerging market expansion and a commercial focus on surgical synergy, which combines Activa DBS implants with our peak surgery system, TYRX Antibacterial Envelope and O-arm imaging. In Pain Stim, while we are facing competitive pressure, we are receiving good reception of our AdaptiveStim HD programming options. In Gastro/Uro, we continue to see solid growth of our InterStim System for bladder and bowel control and we expect the recently launched Verify Evaluation System to result in increased implants going forward. In Surgical Technologies revenue grew 8%, driven by mid-teens growth in Advanced Energy, on strong sales of the peak surgery system and Aquamantys System. ENT growth was driven by sales of the NuVent sinus balloon and a backorder release of the powered ENT blade. The Neurosurgery business also had a strong quarter, driven by the U.S. launch of the O-arm 2 surgical imaging system. Our Neurovascular division had another strong performance in Q2, with revenue growth of 32%. Growth was driven by stent retrievers for treating acute ischemic stroke, where recent clinical data and AHA/ASA stroke treatment guidelines are driving rapid adoption of our SOLITAIRE FR revascularization device. The division also had very strong results in flow diversion, led by continued adoption with a Pipeline Flex device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. During Q2, the Neurovascular division announced two technology acquisitions, Medina Medical with its this Aneurysm Embolization Mesh technology for hemorrhagic stroke, which we believe can disruptive the core market as well as Lazarus Effect and its mesh cover technology that is complementary to our SOLITAIRE stent retriever platform. Now moving to diabetes group, revenue grew 11% and accounted for 6% of total company sales. The Intensive Insulin Management division grew in the mid-teens, including growth of nearly 40% in Europe as a result of strong sales of our MiniMed 640G insulin pump system with the enhanced Enlite CGM sensor This next generation system features SmartGuard predictive low glucose management technology as well as a new insulin pump design featuring a full-color screen. We continue to make progress in brining this technology to the U.S. as we have completed the clinical trials and are on track for early calendar 2016 submission to the FDA. In our non-intensive diabetes therapies division, revenue doubled on strong sales of the iPro 2 professional CGM technology. In addition to professional CGM, the NDT division continues to focus on market access and integrated patient care solutions for people with Type 2 diabetes. In our Diabetes Services and Solutions divisions, revenue grew in the mid-single digits, driven by strong growth in consumables, new Diabeter service revenue as well as sales from the recent launch of the MiniMed Connect. The uptake and user feedback on MiniMed Connect have been extremely positive and it is currently the highest rated connected glucose monitoring app in U.S. We also continue to partner with IBM Watson, combining our clinical expertise, close loop algorithm development and CareLink data analytics with IBM's Watson Cloud and Watson Analytics and machine learning capabilities. In early pilot run, using the database of 100 randomized patients was able to predict some near-term hyperglycemic events, demonstrating the potential possibility of applying cognitive computing to support diabetes management. Now turning to the P&L. As I discussed the operating items, it is worth clarifying again that my comments will be made on a non-GAAP comparable constant currency basis unless I say otherwise. The Q2 operating margin was 28.4%, which excludes our 100-basis point negative impact from foreign currency and represented a 20-basis point improvement over the prior year. This operating margin improvement, included a 60-basis point improvement SG&A offset by 20-basis point decline in gross margin, a 5-basis point decline in R&D and a 20-basis point decline in that other expense. This resulted in operating profit growth of 6.4% or operating leverage of approximately 60 basis points over revenue growth. In the coming quarters, we expect this leverage contribution to grow and be our majority contributed to our overall EPS leverage. In line with our expectations, the amount of Q2 operating leverage was lowered due to the difficult comparison against legacy Covidien's fiscal year end quarter, which included strong fiscal year in sales. We estimate that the total benefit in the prior year was approximately $50 million on our operating profit line. Adjusting for this operating profit growth would have been approximately 9% in Q2, representing operating leverage of approximately 300 basis points. Our operating margin included gross margins of 70.2% SG&A of 33.0% and R&D of 7.4%. Also included in our Q2 operating margin was net other expense of $57 million, which included net gains from our currency hedging program of $71 million. We hedged majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign-exchange. However, growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. Assuming recent exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which includes \u20ac1.06 and \u00a5123, we expect FY'16 net other expense to be in the range of $100 million to $130 million, which includes an expected impact for the U.S. medical device tax of approximately $210 million. For Q3 FY'16, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $10 million in income to $10 million in expense based on the previously mentioned exchange rates. We expect our operating margin for the second half of FY'16 to be in the range of 29% to 31% on an as reported basis, including 28% to 28.5% on an as reported basis in Q3. This forecast implies over 100-basis point improvement in our full fiscal year operating margin on a comparable constant currency basis, which on a reported basis is almost completely offset by a similar amount of negative FX based on current rates. This strong operating margin improvement supports the significantly greater than 400 basis points in earnings per share leverage we intend to generate in the back half of the year, primarily a result of the Covidien cost synergy programs. We continue to expect these value capture programs to result in $300 million to $350 million in FY'16 savings and a minimum of $850 million by the end of FY'18, spread roughly equally across the three fiscal years. Below the operating profit line, Q2 non-GAAP net interest expense was $172 million, which was an improvement to our forecast due to modest outperformance in certain investment income classes. Based on current rates, we would expect FY'16 net interest expense to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million, including $160 million to $180 million in Q3. At the end of Q2, we had approximately $35.8 billion in debt and approximate $17.2 million in cash and investments of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. This cash mix is a significant improvement from prior quarters due to the $9.3 billion internal reorganization we executed in Q2 as part of our Covidien integration. We expect to announce our strategy on how we intend to use these proceeds in the very near-term without likely focused on share repurchases and accelerated debt pay down while preserving financial flexibility. These potential actions are not contemplated in our current outlook. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q2 was 16.5%, which was an improvement from our forecast as a result of operational tax adjustments and the allocation of profits among jurisdictions in which we operate. On a full-year basis, we continue to expect our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We expect to be at the higher end of this range until the presently expired U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated. In Q2, free cash flow was $1.1 billion. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow, excluding the cash impact of non-GAAP adjustments to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile. In Q2, we paid $537 million in dividends and accelerated our share repurchase activity; repurchase $710 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q2, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 90 million shares. Second quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.429 million shares. For FY'16, we now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximate 1.430 million shares, including approximate 1.427 million shares in Q3. Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2016 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We now expect revenue growth for the back half of the fiscal year to be in the upper half of our mid-single digits baseline range on a comparable constant currency basis. Our second half revenue outlook assumes that MITG grows in the low to mid single-digit, RTG grows in mid-single digits, CVG grows in the mid to high single-digit and Diabetes grows in the high-single to low-double digits. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact of exchange rates were to remain somewhat yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year then our full fiscal year '16 revenue will be negatively affected by approximately $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion, including a negative $330 million to $390 million impact in Q3. Turning to guidance on the bottom-line, based on our first half performance, we now expect non-GAAP cash earnings per share in the range of $4.33 to $4.40, which includes an expect $0.45 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates and approximately $300 million to $350 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition. As we look at the back half of our fiscal year, it is worth pointing out the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expired at the end of 2014, if Congress reacts actively renews the credit for 2015, we would see a $0.03 benefit in FY'16. Both, renewal and non-renewal scenarios are reflected in our earnings per share guidance. While we do not give early earnings per share guidance, when looking at the gating earnings per share consensus, we would not be surprised to see approximately $0.04 $0.05 shifted from Q3 to Q4, which assumes that the R&D tax credit is renewed in Q3. Finally, I want to point out that the updating historical Covidien-Medtronic financial presentations that Ryan mentioned earlier reflect lower FY'15 comparable earnings per share. However, this has no impact on our FY'16 expectation. As in the past, my comments on earnings per share guidance do not include any charges or gains that are recorded or would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. Before turning the call back over to Omar, I would like to note that we plan to hold our Q3 earnings call on March 1st and our Q4 earnings call on May 31st. In addition, we plan to host our Investor Day on June 6, which will be held again in New York City. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Gary. Before opening lines for Q&A, I would like to reflect on our overall performance. Our team has come a long way, executing quarter-after-quarter. We are building a business with solid and diversified growth drivers, operational excellence, strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation, but it is also important for us to remember that we have a long journey ahead of us and our work of fulfilling the Medtronic machine goes on. I am confident this team can execute consistently, balancing trade-offs and offsetting pressures to create long-term dependable value in healthcare. With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I have asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group, Bryan Hanson President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, Geoff Martha, President of Restorative Therapies Group and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. Where we are rarely able to get to everyone questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and only one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please? Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : Good morning. Can you guys hear me okay? Omar Ishrak : Yes. We can Mike. Gary Ellis : Yes, Mike. Go ahead. Mike Weinstein : Perfect. Well, first off congratulation on another nice quarter. Let me, Gary, just circle back on your commentary on repatriated cash. My first question is really, it sounds like there is some commentary fourth coming in terms of what are you going to do with that cash? Any reason you are not being more explicit today as in the comments you made about potentially accelerating share repurchase and paying down debt? Gary Ellis : Yes, Mike. I mean, as we indicate in our comments, obviously, we are looking at this. We are excited about the opportunity that we are able to get access to this cash and make it available. We are looking at different options. As we indicated in our comments, obviously, the main focus of that will be, we did take on a lot of debt related to the transaction. We have commitment on the debt side that we want to look at, but obviously the other opportunity for us is to take a look at share repurchases and accelerate that as a potential. We are looking at both, options we are evaluating that. We are having conversation with our Board. As we make decisions, once we make those decisions, then we will communicate what our plans are, but we just do not want to get ahead of ourselves in communicating before. Again, we have had a full dialogue and discussion with the board. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Let me ask you about a couple of different business that to me stood out this quarter. I mean, there is whole bunch them, but let me just target a couple of them. Once, was your Diabetes business, and you commented on the growth you are seeing in diabetes, particularly Europe, where you have got some newer technologies available. Can you talk about the growth there number one. Number two, your Neurovascular business continues to do extremely well. We are seeing that obviously because of the ischemic sort of trials and what is happening in that market, but could you just give us your own thought on sustainability and what you want to do with that business going forward? Omar Ishrak : Okay. Mike, I am going to let Hooman and Jeff will answer this question, so Hooman why do not you go ahead with the questions. Hooman Hakami : Sure. Hey, Mike. Yes. We saw great growth in Diabetes, 11% overall. The European growth was really, I think, something that stood out. We had just incredibly strong growth in 640. We saw that not only in Europe, but also in Asia Pacific and I think what it shows is that new innovation here matters and this is something that we are going to continue to drive. We have got a plan to launch this product in the United States. You heard from the commentary that the trials was done and we are going to release it to the FDA in early 2016, so we are excited about that and I think what you are also seeing that I think it is worth noting is the 530G is doing incredibly well in the United States and we are seeing very, very good performance there on tough comps, so when you take a look at those two things. I think, we are seeing great performance within the group and we expect this to continue. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Geoff? Geoff Martha : On the [ph] side it is a huge opportunity not just for Restorative Therapies Group, but for Medtronic. First of all you saw we did - these guys have done - our team and everybody has done a great job developing technologies and the clinical evidence and we want to maintain that leadership, so the two tuck-in acquisitions we did last quarter, I think, take our technologies roadmap out several years to maintain our leaderships there, so that is one. Then two, we are looking at the broader stroke care continuum from diagnostics working with Mike Coyle's group here in the link technology into patient management and referrals systems, so we think beyond the technology if you look across the care continuum, there is several waves of innovation here and this is a top priority for not just my group, but for Medtronic. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Then maybe just one question, and I will let others jump in. Omar, one of the questions we talked about last call, last call you remember I think industry was a little bit frustrated on the pace of margin improvement and part of it was tough to see because of the FX headwinds you guys were seeing. One of the questions was the degree to which some of the Covidien synergies and effectively some of the upside to this synergy targets, Mike had reinvested back on the business versus shown down to the bottom-line to shareholders. If you want just give us your own updated thoughts on that and how investors should be kind of expecting Covidien synergies to play throughout the year? Omar Ishrak : Yes. We have already said, as I said in my commentary they we are expecting some significant upside to 200-basis point to 400-basis point range and we will show that in the coming quarters. That is where we stand. It is pretty straightforward. You know, most of these synergies will fall through and we will go from there, but I do not want to minimize our operational performance outside of the synergies as well, because there is good work going on in productivity improvements in our products and SG&A. Some of it is using some of the new structures we are creating under the integration, but across the Board, we are delivering productivity and to the extent especially this year with the Covidien synergies, we really expect by the end of the year we will be above the range that we have talked about. As we have actually already done to a small extent in the first two quarters, but that amount will increase in the coming quarters. Mike Weinstein : Perfect. Thank you, Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Omar, I just wanted to come back to revenue for second. I think, your guidance for the upper end of 4 to 6 is consistently you said last quarter, but it is probably the most bullish component of the report this morning, so what is giving you the confidence in the acceleration sort of in the back half of the year? Not only it is the acceleration, because the comps get so dramatically harder as the anniversary the acceleration last year, so what gives you the confidence you still can sustain that momentum in the upper half of revenue in the back half as these comparables get harder. Omar Ishrak : I think the direct answer there is our new product momentum. I do not think we have been in a position in this company today with the products we have already launched and the upcoming pipeline that we have across the Board in virtually every group. The cadence of product innovation across the Board has increased significantly and when you sort of combine all of that together it makes quite a difference. That is our goal after all. We are in the end a technology company striving to sort of change outcomes. Now, in addition to that, we are completely cognizant of the fact that one of our main growth strategies is to diversify the sources of growth, so we see emerging markets actually steadily improving into the back half of the year and services and solutions again starts to keep growing because of programs that we are implementing across the Board are gaining traction across multiple regions, so those are fairly slow. It takes a little time for them to come through, but in aggregate they do come through and they all contribute. When you add all of that up together, we feel pretty confident to be in the upper half of the range and again for this to be sustainable good years does not mean that the next year would be bad. It has to continue to improve, so that is the outlook that we have on this. David Lewis : Okay. Very helpful, and I just had a quick follow-up for Gary and one for Geoff. Gary, our math implies 12% to 15% constant currency earnings in the back half of the year is an acceleration from the first half. Does that jive with your math and how are you feeling about the $850 million number? Then for Geoff, I know it has not been very long that you have been at the helm on RTG, but I wonder if you could just briefly comment on the ability to achieve the type of network effects in RTG that have been so successful and accelerating Medtronic Cardio? Thank you. Gary Ellis : David, to your first comment about earnings per share, the answer on the constant currency would be yes. That is what we would expect to see in the back half of the year. That is not - if you look at the first half of the year, basically we have seen between 11% and 12% kind of constant currency comparable growth overall, so we expect that to accelerate a little bit in the back half of the year as we talked about primarily because of more of the benefits of the Covidien integration and all the integration efforts coming through, so total related to the $850 million commitment that we have move to by FY'18, we are right in line. In fact, maybe slightly ahead of our plans to deliver $300 million and $350 million in the current year and right in line with the expectations on doing that for the full 850 by FY'18, so we feel very confident about that. We feel confident about that in our earnings per share guidance we are providing to the organization or to the investors, but in general yes that is right in line with our expectations but foreign-exchange does continue to be a negative headwind for us obviously, but on a comparable constant currency basis, we are seeing an acceleration in our growth. Omar Ishrak : Geoff? Geoff Martha : David, again, good question. I would answer it - three parts to the answer. One, from a market perspective, one thing that has helped the cardiovascular space is the emergence of the cardiovascular service line globally and we are seeing that not to the same effect yet. It is, I do not know 10-plus years behind as the neuro services line Neuroscience service lines emerge, but we are definitely seeing that trends emerge. The more that happens, the more it plays to our hand, because we have by far the best breadth to cover those Neuroscience service line, so that is one and that is a tailwind for us. The second is our internal capabilities of taking and this is different than actually cardiovascular. We have implants that work with Intraoperative Imaging and Navigation and we have both platforms and that gives us some flexibility. Now, we have to integrate those better and take them to market selling benefits versus features and we are working on that, but that is another tailwind and the Intraoperative Imaging navigation is a key driver to us getting this network effect so that we sell, like I said, solutions versus the features. Then thirdly, which we are copying the playbook from our Cardiovascular Group is changing the way our operating principles and our operating mechanisms, so that our business is - the silos come down to a certain extent and they are incented to drive these cross business unit deals where it make sense, so when you are bundling, if you will, intraoperative navigation and Intraoperative Imaging navigation with some of our implants. You need to have the incentives and the operating mechanisms and analytics to do that, so we are in the process of doing that, so those three things are the things that are driving it, but one thing that is gating it is the Neuroscience service line evolution in the marketplace. David Lewis : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs. David Roman : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Omar, I was hoping if you go back to one of the things you referenced in your prepared remarks towards the contribution from new products I thinking above the sort of historical level or your target levels. Can you just sort of talk about what specifically influenced that and why that would not translate into better overall top-line growth? Is there any part of the new product story that has all cannibalistic of the base business or something that is happening in the end market that we would not have let that 400-plus basis points to new product to drive better overall top-line growth and that is obviously now throw any water on the resulting, but just for some perspective? Omar Ishrak : Well, a number of things. First of all, the new product growth includes the baseline product lines, so that inclusive of all of that. The only answer if we do the math is that the emerging markets and service and solution have to pickup. Remember, service and solutions because of the integration together with the Covidien, the baseline has changed, so therefore it is a 20 basis points where our number is like 40 to 60, so that is one aspect that will drag it down. Those numbers are small, but in the context of which you are talking about, you are talking about the ranges of the upper end here, so we are talking about 10s of basis points rather than and 100s, so they do make a difference. Then emerging markets also, as we climbed up into the range, probably will help. Outside of that it is a matter of how much above the 350 we actually get. Again, like I have said before, we just want to be a little cautions not so much because of our product launch activities but because of the environment around us, which you just never know, we just have a little cautious about macroeconomic pressures, political instabilities, those things or some healthcare rule changes, so we have given up passed experience of these things surprising us. We just got to be a little cautions, so that is really the best way I can answer this that I would really like to see all three of our growth vectors above our projections before we really confident that we can extend the range so that we get that level of diversification, but in nowhere am I any sort of less confident about our new products execution just because of the breadth of our pipeline I think that is going to happen. I just think the macroeconomic circumstances we just want to be a little cautious about that and therefore I want to see the other growth vectors also climb with the same range before we can get more bullish. David Roman : Okay. That is helpful. Maybe just a follow-up for Gary on the P&L and cash flow side, as we think about the sort of underlying operating profit of the business, obviously FY'16 is sort of a tail to have as we think the sort of normalized run rate of the business so we think about that 30% number that you are talking about exiting the year sort of that the right underlying profit of the business off of which to think about forward forecast. Then on the free cash flow side, the $1.1 billion you are talking about this quarter, if you annualized that that is pretty close to what you were as an independent company pre Covidien, so when do we start to see the benefit flow through to free cash flow and move toward that. That is your number target you put out therefore for FY 19? Gary Ellis : Well, with respect to of the profit margin, I mean, you cannot take our Q4 number and annualized that because as you look historically the same way that you had with Covidien that we just talked about as far as the tough comparison. Our Q4, the profit margin is always much, much higher than the previous three quarters. That is historical, because we have a strong closing and so you have a lower rate. We cannot annualized the fourth quarter, but obviously we are in the 20% 29% range for the full-year that we have been talking about then we would obviously continue to build on that number, so that is kind of the - you take the average for the year and then build on that standpoint of the incremental improvements we will see from value capture going forward is what you should assume, but my only point is just do not take the fourth quarter annualized, because that it unusual it spite by the low-end the best profit operating margin tends to be in the fourth quarter, but we would obviously could expected to continue to improve. The cash flow in the quarter, $1.1 billion includes some restructuring cost resurgence stuff like that, so we pulled that out. You are closer to the $1.3 billion and the point if you looked historically Medtronic and Covidien, the cash flow also similar to the profits rose as we go through the year, so it is always actually that $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion about 40% to 50% versus where Medtronic, Inc. itself was a year going into the quarter, we would expect still for the current year that we are going to be somewhere around $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion in free cash flow and similar to what we talk about on the profit to the cash flow also improve in the back half of the year, which is normal because we are first half of the year we are paying off bonuses and things like that in the prior year in the cash flow just it spite historical nature is just lower, but in the back half of that will accelerate so we are still very confident that for the current you will be in that $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion and similar to what we have talking about our earnings growing close to double digits on that cash flow going forward over the next several years and generating as we talked about close to $40 billion in free cash flow over the next five years. We are still very confident about that. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Let me start with the Puerto Rico our tax issue. I think in September at our conference you said there would be a briefing in October did that happen and do you still expected the decision in late fiscal 2016. I think in the past you said most of these cases settle before decision. Do you still feel that it settlement it is more likely here as well and had upon? Thanks. Gary Ellis : Well, I mean as far as the trial process, yes. There is a process where there is some briefing that had to be provided by both parties like the government and Medtronic that occurred I believe in October. That is all been done from what I understand and now we are in a situation is and the judges per view the judge has the option to take as long as sheets would you like in those case. We are assuming that at the end of our fiscal 2016 early into FY'17 is what she will make sure make a decision, but it can go longer too. This is her decision on how quickly she moves in making that decision. As far as settlement discussions, again, I cannot say anything on that, because obviously settlement discussions required two parties to come together and at the point of time, I cannot say anything about that at all. I mean you get happens to happens that in the mean time we are just waiting to see what the decision is from the court case. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks. Then on emerging markets Omar, you bounce back this quarter plus 11% and based on your earlier comments it sounds like you expect that to - I just want it to be clear. It sounds like you expect that actually improved in the second half and I am asking, because we do look across medtech emerging market growth does not appear to have slowed so I just wanted to be clear that you think you can kind of in the second half of this year build off of the 11% and actually accelerate and is that mid-teens growth that you have talked about in the past so realistic? Thanks for taking the questions. Omar Ishrak : Yes. First, yes, we expect this growth to increased, the words I would you like to use and then I think I used in the commentary was that we would like to see steady increase and improved consistency, so I do not want this to like bounce back and forth between '15 and whatever. This things has to go steadily and our diversification across the emerging markets helps with that and I think we will see that I think the mid-teens goal is completely realistic over a period of time and that is what were aiming to get through the market opportunity is massive and it is really up to us to execute our variety of strategies and get the benefits from them, so in short, I expect this to steadily improved quarter-after-quarter. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions guys. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Larry. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Thanks. Can you hear me okay? Omar Ishrak : Yes. Bob Hopkins : Great. Good morning. A couple of quick things, first, for Gary the synergy that particular $300 million to $350 million for this year. Can you just give us a sense as to how much has been realized here in the first half and also Gary if you would mind just walking through a little more detail why you think the streets sort of needs to shift a little bit from in terms of earnings from Q3 to Q4? Gary Ellis : Well, as far as the synergy number of the $300 million to $350 million, I would say right now we probably have already achieved about 40% of that the 35% to 40% has already been incurred. We have indicated previously that a bigger portion would be in the back half of the year and that is kind of what we are still expecting, so I would expect that 60%-plus of the benefit will at the back half of the year so. We are right in line with our plans and our targets the back slightly ahead of where they are at but approximately 40 % we have already realized up to this point. With respect to the guidance just as far as taking look at the quarters and stop, all we are looking If you look historically, our Q2 and Q3 historically both revenue and bottom line are relatively consistent and there is not a big change overall between those two and we did a $3 here in the current quarter. We are assuming that there will be an R&D tax credit. There is a benefit for in the third quarter, so overall I would get you more in the $5 to $6 range and all we are saying is, that versus where the street it is at I think it is a bit higher than that number. On the other hand I would tell you I think the street loan lower in Q4 versus what we would have historically see as far as an uplift. So our saying is if you look at our historical modeling Q2, Q3 are usually relatively consistent and it is Q4 where you sees a big jump I think there has been two much way we put in Q3 right now and but again these are your models you guys can put together how you like, but that's if you look at history I think you are going to see that you are a little lit bit probably lower high in Q3. Bob Hopkins : Then for Mike and Omar and thanks for that Gary, can you guys just put in perspective the MRI safe ICD launch in the United States. Maybe relative to the MRI safe pacer launch how just how should we think about this launch in terms of the ability this product to take share or you are the only one in the market with such a product and then Omar I was wonder if you could just give some broad thoughts on kind of the state of Medtech right now in terms of what you are seeing across your businesses in terms of your surgical procedure volumes pricing just kind of a broad look at the current point of time if you do not mind? Omar Ishrak : Okay. Mike do you want to go first? Mike Coyle : Yes. Bob maybe the best way to think about is just some statistics around mix, right, if you look at dual chamber pacemakers right now. Probably two-thirds of our product is MRI safe as we sell into initial implants - and with the recently, two quarters ago we launched the single chamber. We are probably now up to somewhere around 40% mix in single-chamber for MRI safe and we just launched the MRI safe ICD and our mix in the quarter would be probably somewhere around 20% so there is still a lot of room to run there. Obviously, we have not yet released the MRI safe CRT-D which we expected to do by the end of the year. So I think that might give you some sense of sort of how we see the mixed change taking place within our business. Omar Ishrak : With respect to the overall medtech market, look we have had a - the medtech industries has actually had a pretty good year and I think a lot of that is you look knowledge is driven by U.S. growth so U.S. has been stronger than I can remember for a long time and that is not only the medtech sort of companies but also hospitals. Now as we going to sort of calendar year '16, there will be some anniversarying that is happening and also some of the hospitals have reported slightly sort of lower growth rates, so we are watching this carefully. I do not know to what extent the procedure growth will continue at the same rate of growth. I do not think it will slowdown, per se, but the growth rate might well slowdown. So that is what we are watching very carefully and I think coming after the next couple of months it is pretty crucial to see how procedures go, but again really at the end of the day this is a U.S story and to a certain degree emerging markets Medtech has been resilient in the emerging markets compared to other industries simply because of the nature of the industry itself that governments continuing to invest there so that has been reach the bottom really has not fallen out that all and although I think we have our performed the overall market into the market in general it has been pretty resilient. So those things holding U.S. growth is what has driven the medtech industry. I think U.S. growth will anniversary probably steady a little bit. On the other hand, medtech in emerging markets might well start to improve I mean I do not know. I know our projections are that we will start to improve overall we will have to see, hope that helps. Bob Hopkins : Thank you very much. Thank you. Gary Ellis : We have time for one more question, operator. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Josh Jennings of Cowen & Company. Josh Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Just wanted to, Omar, start with first one is although it is relatively early since the close of the Covidien transaction, you have had three quarters of combined entity experience and just wondering how you are evaluating the entire product portfolio and whether or not you feel like you have increased flexibility now that pruning the portfolio or weed out lower growth, lower margin products and business units and whether we should be expecting that? Omar Ishrak : I think I kind of alluded to that a little bit. First of all, since the acquisition, we have set up Minimally Invasive Therapies Group under Brian. Brain and his team are really charted, a very clear and compelling vision for the future, which is outcomes-based and very aligned with the Medtronic mission, so that was the first step and I think I talked about the four areas of focus within MITG. Now we are looking at the entire range of assets that we have within MITG and kind of assessing that against the strategy and as we go through that process which were in the middle of doing in the next 6 months or so, we will take action as is necessary, but that is the way in which we are gauging it. So the first step was to kind of decide clearly and get full sort of excitement with the team and agreement with the team that this is where we should go which I think the team is put in place and understand with the core product technologies are that drive that and solutions that are necessary for that. Next is to look at the breadth of everything else and see what fits and what doesn\u2019t. I mean somethings clearly do not and we\u2019ll have to see how we monetize those assets as we move forward, but by and large that is the way in which we are looking at this. Josh Jennings : Great. Then just follow-up for Omar and Gary, any updated views on potential revenue synergies outside of peripheral neurovascular? Thanks a lot gentleman. Gary Ellis : Look, that is an area that is pretty active I mean one thing that you just try about was the in stroke were the linked our product feeding into the stroke care and vascular channel is one that is pretty high in our list. I can tell you that as a business, as a leadership team we work to figure out methodologies where internally we can have our selling groups of multiple products and do it in a way that is scalable unsustainable and then in an organized way around the world I think that first step was pretty important. So that area certainly is a big sort of enabler for us to move products around various sales channels and we have done that and we will have to see how these things go forward but there is a lot discussion between sales team using those principles without getting distracted from their main focus as to how accelerate their growth. So we are optimistic that we will start to see those but the specifics of those right now are still sort of being generated. The other area that I will point is the translation of the operating room managed services from Cath Lab I mean that is a big step for us and the acceleration there is pretty exciting. As you can see, like I said we have already closed six of those deals $140 million in cumulative revenue that is much faster than anything that Covidien was originally planning for and we are only beginning there, so those are the ways in which we are looking at this right now. Over time, we are creating a structure where we can use the combined nature and assets of our company to address many different problems both, from a technology perspective and from a comorbidity perspective, which would be an increasing problem in healthcare where we think we have the breadth of assets that we can address very effectively. Okay. With that thank you all very much for your questions and on behalf of the entire Management team I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic and we look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q3 call in March 1. Thank you and all of you please have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Jackie. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic\u2019s Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2016 third quarter, which ended January 29, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments, earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued for the first time a presentation that provides additional details on our revenue performance and as a result had reduced our prepared revenue by division commentary in Gary\u2019s section. Next, you should note that many of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, and our year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes Covidien plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien\u2019s prior-year monthly results to Medtronic\u2019s fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning. And thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $6.9 billion, representing growth of 6% in the upper-half of our mid-single-digit baseline expectation. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.06, growing at 17% on a comparable constant currency basis and reflecting 1,150 basis points of leverage, significantly above our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points. Our performance in Q3 was solid, with sustained execution, resulting in another quarter of market outperformance. We continue to deliver on our three growth strategies : therapy innovation, globalization and economic value; which are driving increased diversity of our growth, an important and differentiated attribute of our company. Our revenue growth may modestly ebb and flow from quarter to quarter indicative of the challenges we\u2019re absorbing in certain businesses or regions as we capitalize on success in others. However, our confidence around the sustainability and consistency of our revenue growth within the mid-single-digit range continues to build with each passing quarter. In addition, the Covidien integration is delivering robust operating leverage, as we realized our committed cost synergies, which combined with our financial leverage, drove high-teen EPS growth and double-digit EPS leverage in Q3. Through FY 2018, as we continue to realize cost synergy benefits, we expect to be at the high-end of or exceed our EPS leverage goal of 200 to 400 basis points. While our operational performance remains strong, we recognize foreign currency translation is still a significant pressure to our bottom-line on a reported basis, as it is for most multi-national companies of our size and diversity. We\u2019re attempting to offset this as much as possible by stretching our operations and through our conventional hedging programs. We also continue to generate significant accessible free cash flow, which we are deploying with discipline, investing for our future, while at the same time allocating capital to reduce debt and provide strong returns for our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In summary, our formula for long-term success is to deliver consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth, with 200 to 400 basis points of EPS leverage and return a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. The expected net result is creating enormous value with sustainable double-digit total shareholder returns. Now, let\u2019s turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. As we have noted before, we have three growth priorities stemming from our overall strategies : new therapies, emerging markets, and services and solutions. With specific growth expectations for each, we continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals. In therapy innovation, we continue to see strong adoption of our new product and our pipeline remains robust. Our new therapies\u2019 growth vector accounted for nearly two-thirds of our total company growth, contributing approximately 350 basis points, at the high-end of our goal of 150 to 350 basis points. Based on our pipeline and product breadth, we believe performance in the upper-half of this range is sustainable over the long term. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 7%, we continue to see strong growth from recently launched products that are helping to create important rapidly growing medtech markets such as transcatheter aortic valve replacements, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF ablation, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons. CVG has also seen a highly differentiated new products drive growth from its base businesses. In drug-eluting stents, our Resolute Onyx and Resolute Integrity stents are holding share despite major competitive launches. Our position in Europe has been strengthened further by the recent addition of new sizes and indications for Resolute Onyx. In High Power, the Evera MRI ICD that we launched last fall resulted in improved pricing in the U.S. ICD market and a multiyear high share position. Looking ahead, we have a number of new products that will continue to differentiate us in the CVG market, and help protect and grow our leadership position. These include our MR-Conditional CRTD devices, which recently received FDA approval and are currently launching in the U.S. and Europe. We also continue to make progress in bringing our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System to the U.S. and Japan. And we had a successful FDA advisory panel in this technology two weeks ago. Our longer term CVG pipeline is also robust with potentially disruptive therapies like our Drug-Filled Stent, Intrepid Transcatheter Mitral Valve and Symplicity Spyral renal denervation system. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 5%, with Surgical Solutions growing above market and PMR growing at market. Innovative technologies that advance and enhance minimally invasive surgery are driving strong above market growth. Looking ahead, the majority of MITG\u2019s growth will come from five key growth drivers. Within Surgical Solutions open to Minimally Invasive Surgery or MIS, Gastrointestinal cancer and Lung cancer, and within PMR End-Stage Renal Disease and respiratory compromise. Of these the largest contributor to growth is expected to come from our open to MIS strategy, which is focused on sustainable long-term surgical market leadership by improving open surgery, transitioning open surgeries to MIS, and advancing MIS technologies. Our recently created new business, Renal Care Solutions supplemented its breadth with the acquisition of Bellco last month. Bellco is a full line of therapies and systems for the treatment of renal failure. This combination of Bellco with our legacy renal access business and our internally developed portable dialysis system, offers a complete product solution for End-Stage Renal Disease. With few of the global growth drivers that I just mentioned, MITG has a strong product portfolio and expects to launch more than 20 products through the end of fiscal year 2017, with approximately 75% in Surgical Solutions and approximately 25% in PMR. These new offerings are expected to generate approximately $500 million in cumulative revenue over the next three years. Across MITG, we are developing solutions to expand the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery, and enhanced patient outcomes through less invasive solutions. In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 4%, we also have a number of new products driving growth. In Neurovascular, our Pipeline Flex and Solitaire FR devices are leading the rapidly growing stroke market. Following the four clinical trials published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, the market continues to adopt our Solitaire mechanical thrombectomy device. A segment of the global ischemic stroke market that we think can triple in size by 2020. In Surgical Technologies, we are seeing strong growth from our recently launched O-arm O2 Surgical Imaging System. In Spine, despite posting mid-single-digit growth in international Core Spine and double-digit growth in U.S. BMP, Q3 results came in below our expectations, primarily because of weakness in U.S. Core Spine. We are focused on executing our turnaround plan in Spine. Our primary focus is growing our market share to what we are calling speed-to-scale product launches. Speed-to-Scale involves coming to market with a steady cadence for new products as a result of faster innovation cycles and launching these products of scale with sets available for the entire market. These new products will also be combined with enabling technologies, biologics, and targeted physician training at the time of launch. The goal is to constantly innovate procedures such as OLIF and TLIF, and improve upon their outcomes. We have several near-term launches, including accelerated ramps of Solera Voyager, and our ELEVATE expandable interbody device, both of which are expected to improve our share in TLIF procedures, an area where we\u2019ve been struggling. This quarter we will launch the Atlantis Essentials another Cervical Plate System, the first product in our Spine Essentials platform. Spine Essentials will bring efficiency to the most common spine fusion procedures through more streamlined pre-sterilized sets. Additionally, we are further integrating the development roadmaps of our enabling technologies with our spine instrumentation, offering a differentiated surgical synergy experience for our customers. And finally, we intend to focus our efforts and gaining share in biografts, utilizing our broad biologics portfolio, including infuse. We had challenges this quarter in our Neuromodulation division as well. While, we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments and are focused on resolving this matter, our drug pump revenue has been affected. We are also facing increased competition in Pain Stim, our recently approved MRI Surgical Lead is expected to help our competitive position in Pain Stim, as we are the first company to have a complete Spinal Cord Stimulation System approved for full-body MRI scans. In addition, we continue to market the benefits of our differentiated AdaptiveStim and SureScan MRI technology. And more surgeons are adopting our AdaptiveStim HD High Density programming options. While we are focused on solving the issues in Spine and Neuromodulation, and our efforts in Spine are expected to result in steady improvement. Neuromodulation could be under some pressure for the next several quarters, resulting in overall RTG growth around the low-end of the mid-single-digit range. In our Diabetes group, which grew 11%, we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G System in the markets where it is available as well as strong demand for our MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing a remote access to pump and sensor data on the users\u2019 smartphone. We also continue to make an excellent progress in bringing the world\u2019s first hybrid closed-loop system the MiniMed 670G to market. We expect to complete enrollment in our pivotal trial in the next few weeks with PMA submission to the FDA targeted before the end of June. Outside the U.S., we had strong Q3 performance. We were pleased by the positive guidance recently issued by NICE in the United Kingdom, which recommended the MiniMed Paradigm Veo as the only system for reducing the risk of potentially life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes. In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business for Type 2, our partnership with Henry Schein is underway and we are already starting to see interest from primary care physicians for our iPro 2 Professional CGM system with Pattern Snapshot. In our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we are preparing to bring our standalone CGM system, Guardian Connect, to market with the PMA submission in U.S. next week, as well as expected launch in Europe in early FY 2017. This product will allow us to provide both Type 1 and Type 2 patients on multiple daily injections with a real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our standalone CGM product with the applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we are well-positioned to provide patients with not just a sensor, but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution. Overall, we are excited by the progress of our diabetes business and feel we are well-positioned for sustained growth. Next, let\u2019s discuss our globalization strategy. In Q3, emerging markets grew 14% and contributed approximately 190 basis points for our Q3 total company growth, at the upper-end of our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We have consistently delivered double-digit growth in emerging markets, despite the fact that several of these markets have faced macroeconomic pressures. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies in channel optimization, and in developing public and private partnerships. We have also benefited from increased geographic diversification of our emerging market revenue, which stabilizes the growth rate and reduces the dependency on any single market. In Q3, Middle East and Africa, Southeast Asia, India and Greater China, all grew in the mid to upper teens. In China, we grew 14%, where our strong sales execution and expansion of our multiline selling presence into tier 2 and tier 3 markets is resulting in above market growth. We continue to implement our channel optimization strategy, which aims to transition our distribution partnerships to include consolidated logistics platform distributors. We are also developing comprehensive partnerships with provincial governments, like that to the Chengdu Government in Sichuan Province, where we previously announced a partnership to manufacture our portable hemodialysis equipment. In Q3, we broadened our partnership with Chengdu, agreeing to manufacture our next generation diabetes pump technology in Chinese language for the local market in Sichuan, while working together with local authorities to expand access for this product. China continues to represent a tremendous growth opportunity. Despite the complexities of this market we have shown that we can grow double-digits in China in sustained basis. We believe China will become our largest healthcare market over the long-term, serving more patients than doctors in any other country. And we can never lose sight of this potential. In the Middle East and Africa, we grew 19%, driven by the joint venture we formed earlier this year with our largest Saudi distributor as part of our channel optimization strategy in the region. In Latin America, we grew 10%, including 7% growth in Brazil. While we continue to outperform the market in Brazil, we do see continued market volume weakness, resulting from public spending constraints, as well as some difficulty in getting inventory into the country because of customs holds. Across the emerging markets, we\u2019re applying our standard market development activities, as well as our differentiated approach of local channel optimization, like in China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, establishing government partnerships in Chengdu and developing private partnerships like the one we established with the Abraaj Group last quarter. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth in these regions and lead to sustained market outperformance. We believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in medtech over the long-term. Turning now to our economic value growth strategy, our Services and Solutions\u2019 growth vector contributed to approximately 20 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points revenue growth, our revenue growth was in the mid-30s and contributed 50 basis points to CVG growth, where our efforts are most developed. We expect to further improve our growth of Services and Solutions model and expand it across all our business groups. In Care Management Services, formerly known as Cardiocom, our growth rate was in the mid-20s in Q3, driven by strong performance within the U.S. Veterans Administration Healthcare System, where we are managing a cohort of over 85,000 patients with multiple co-morbidities. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions. In our Hospital Solutions business through which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms, we had service revenue growth rates in the mid-30s. Since the time we started this business a little over two years ago, we have now completed a total of 72 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $1.7 billion in contracted service and product revenue over average span of six years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also have seven hospitals in Latin America and seven in the Middle East and Africa. We continue to attract strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in regions around the world. And we have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We are pleased with the progress we are making in expanding hospital solutions into operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We have signed five operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $140 million in cumulative revenue with an average life of seven years. We are also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management through Diabeter, a Netherlands-based diabetes clinic and research center we acquired almost a year-ago. We continue to grow the number of contracted patients and expect to expand Diabeter beyond The Netherlands over time. Through initiatives like Diabeter as well as others that I mentioned earlier, we are transforming our diabetes group from a market-leading pump and sensor business into a holistic diabetes management business. While all of these Services and Solutions, Care Management Services, Cath Lab and Operating Room Managed Services and Diabeter are still relatively early stage businesses, they are represent important future building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value-based healthcare offerings, where payments will be based in measurable patient outcomes over a specific time horizon. We are rapidly developing expertise in these areas with a particular focus in supporting bundled solutions across the care continuum targeting specific patient cohorts requiring a particular intervention. This is consistent with the direction of CMS\u2019s bundle payment initiative and their first implementation, Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement or CJR, which we fully support. While this initiative is still evolving, it is one that is mandatory, consistent and measurable, which allows it to be scalable. We encourage CMS to expand bundled payments to other clinical areas, where we participate more broadly. Healthcare is going through a necessary transformation, where stakeholders are seeking not only to improve clinical outcomes and expand access to care, but are also looking for solutions to optimize cost and efficiency. Our confidence continues to grow Medtronic\u2019s ability to lead and compete in these new value-based healthcare models around the world. Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payors. We remain convinced that our technologies and services can play a central role to make the shift to value-based healthcare successful. Turning now to the P&L, as I mentioned earlier, we delivered EPS leverage in Q3 of 1,150 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our baseline expectation of 200 basis points to 400 basis points. All areas of our global operations are executing to the plan we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year, as we deliver on our productivity improvements and cost synergy programs. Operating leverage in the quarter was 510 basis points, driven predominantly by the improvement in SG&A, which is the line item with the majority of the Covidien integration cost synergy that we are realizing today are located. The remainder of our EPS leverage was driven by improvements in our interest expense and tax rate, as well as share repurchase activity. Our strong revenue growth and operating leverage is generating significant adjusted free cash flow. In Q3, we generated $1.8 billion and expect to generate nearly $40 billion in adjusted free cash flow over the next five years. We also continue to look for ways to un-trap cash in our balance sheet. Last September, we announced that we had un-trapped $9.3 billion of cash. And last month, we announced how we intend to use these proceeds. We\u2019re executing an incremental $5 billion share repurchase that we intend to complete by the end of FY 2018. We intend to use the majority of the remaining proceeds to either prepay existing debt or pay debt that comes due by the end of fiscal year 2018 in order to meet our commitments to our debt investors. We\u2019re deploying our capital with a balanced focus in M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We are committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Earlier this fiscal year, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow or dividend faster than earnings, with intent to reaching a 40% payout ratio on a non-GAAP basis even earlier than we had previously announced. Regarding share repurchases, with incremental $5 billion share repurchase, we expect to return approximately $15 billion to shareholders over three years, more than double the amount we returned over the past three years. With our M&A investments we remain disciplined when evaluating potential opportunities. Any investment we make must meet our portfolio criteria, which are : the targets must provide a line-of-sight to improving outcomes, allow for Medtronic to add value and we must have a team that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must be aligned with and strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies, meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution. Before turning the call over to Gary, I\u2019d like to conclude by commenting briefly on our Covidien integration activities, which continue to go extremely well. We\u2019re executing on our priorities to preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. We have preserved and in many cases accelerated the growth of both companies. Talent retention and employee satisfaction remain high as our two cultures continue to come together. Our value capture programs are resulting in strong operating leverage. And we have meaningfully improved the sustainability of both our growth through the diversification of our revenue base and our capital allocation goals through the increased access to our cash. In summary, Q3 was another quarter of solid execution by our organization. Our operating leverage is coming through as we expected and I\u2019m pleased with how we are positioning the company to deliver growth consistently and reliably. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our third quarter results. Gary? Gary Ellis : Thanks, Omar. Third quarter revenue of $6.934 billion increased 61% as reported or 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes $344 million of unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestiture contributed a net 20 basis points to the Q3 revenue growth. Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share was a $1.06, a decrease of 1% versus the $1.07 delivered by legacy Medtronic last year, or an increase of 17% on a comparable constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.11 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.77, a decrease of 21%. In addition to the $374 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter\u2019s non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were a $43 million charge for acquisition-related items, a $16 million net restructuring charge and a $25 million benefit resulting from the establishment of a deferred tax asset related to the realization of a one-time capital loss. Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 35% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 7%, with all three divisions growing at or above overall company growth. CRHF grew 6%, as we took significant share in a flat global implantables market. In High Power, our strong Evera MRI launch resulted in our highest U.S. High Power shares since early in the decade, despite the fact that we had declines in CRTD. While CRTD business experienced sequential growth in U.S. implants share, we also had an intentional reduction in customer inventories ahead of our Q4 CRTD MRI launch. In Coronary, we are holding global diluted earnings - drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitor data releases and product launches, which we attribute to increasing preference for the Resolute Onyx in Europe and our CVG multiline contracts in the U.S. In transcatheter valves, we grew in the low-30s consistent with the market. Market share growth in Europe and the initial launch of CoreValve in Japan in the back half of Q3 balanced modest U.S. share loss, where our competitor product launch and a lack of having Evolut R in the largest valve segment limited total U.S. growth to the mid-20s. We were pleased to receive IDE approval for our U.S. low risk trial and it is worth noting that we now expect the global TAVR market will grow to approximately $4 billion by the end of 2020. In Peripheral, we maintain drug-coated balloon market leadership globally and in the U.S. on the strength of our clinically differentiated impact IN.PACT Admiral balloon. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 33% of our total company sales, grew revenue 5%, with strong at or above market performance in both divisions. In Surgical Solutions, both Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy grew in the upper-single-digits, although we estimate that U.S. surgical volumes have normalized now at 1% to 2%. The PMR division grew 1%, as the business was affected by a product hold of the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator, which resulted in an approximately negative $10 million to $15 million impact to the quarter. This is expected to affect quarterly PMR revenue by approximately $20 million to $25 million, until the product returns to the market, which is expected in the first-half of next fiscal year. Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales, grew revenue by 4% with strong growth in neurovascular and surgical technologies offsetting declines in Spine and in Neuromodulation. In Spine, while U.S. Core Spine was challenged, we gain international Core Spine share. In BMP, the U.S. had strong low double-digit growth. However, the InductOs ship hold in Europe is expected to continue through mid-FY 2017. In Neuromodulation, we recently received FDA approval for Parkinson\u2019s patients with early onset motor complications, expanding the number of potential patients that can be treated with DBS therapy. Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of total company sales, grew revenue at 11%, with strong broad-based performance across all three divisions. In IIM, our Type 1 business, we are seeing very good growth driven by the MiniMed 640G. In NDT, our Type 2 business, while the revenue base is still small, we are seeing growth over 250% as we continue to drive our iPro 2 professional CGM solution and the new easy to interpret pattern snapshot report into primary care channel. In DSS, our Diabetes Service & Solutions business, we saw high-single-digit growth driven by U.S. consumable sales, our Diabeter acquisition and continued strong adoption of our MiniMed Connect remote connectivity platform. Now turning to the P&L, as I discussed the operating items, it is worth clarifying that my comments will be made on a non-GAAP comparable constant currency basis unless I say otherwise. The Q3 operating margin was 29.2%, this represent a 140 basis point improvement over the prior year, but this improvement was completely offset on a reported basis by a negative 140 basis point impact from foreign currency. The 140 basis point operating margin improvement, included a 140 basis point improvement in SG&A, offset by a 20 basis point decline in gross margin, a 10 basis point increase in R&D and a 20 basis point improvement in net other expense. This resulted in operating profit growth of over 10% or operating leverage of approximately 510 basis points over revenue growth. Our operating margin included gross margins of 70.5%, SG&A of 33.3% and R&D of 7.6%. Also included in our Q3 operating margin was net other expense of $9 million, which included net currency gains of $78 million, primarily from our earnings hedging program. It is worth noting that including these net gains was an unexpected $21 million expense resulting from a revaluation of the Argentine peso denominated assets, which devalued by approximately 30%. Regarding our earnings hedging program, while we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are un-hedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. Assuming recent exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include a \u20ac1.09 and \u00a5113, we expect Q4 net other expense to be in the range of $5 million expense to $15 million of income, which includes approximately $110 million in currency gain and no longer includes the U.S. medical device tax, which has been suspended. We expect our Q4 operating margin to be in the range of 31% to 31.3% on an as reported basis, based on current exchange rates. This forecast implies an approximate 300 basis point improvement in our operating margin on a constant currency basis. Our value capture programs as a result of the Covidien integration remain on track. And we now expect to exceed our original FY 2016 savings goal of $300 million to $350 million. And continue to target a minimum of $850 million by the end of FY 2018. Below the operating profit line, Q3 net interest expense was $176 million, in line with our forecast. Based on current rates we would expect Q4 net interest expense to be in the range of $205 million to $210 million. This is an increase over prior quarters as the execution of our incremental share repurchases results in reduced interest income. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $35.8 billion in debt and approximately $17.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q3 was 14.3%, which was an improvement from our forecast due to the permanent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit as well as operational tax adjustments. For Q4, we expect our non-GAAP normal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%. In Q3, adjusted free cash flow was $1.8 billion, we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile. In Q3, we paid $534 million in dividends and repurchased $710 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 81 million shares. Third quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.422 billion shares. For FY 2016, we now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 1.427 billion shares, including approximately 1.419 billion shares in Q4. Next, I would like to comment on our revenue outlook. We expect revenue growth for the fourth quarter of FY 2016 to be in the range of 5% to 5.5% on a constant currency basis, which is consistent with our prior outlook of second-half revenue to be in the upper-half of our mid-single-digit baseline goal. This is solid revenue growth, especially when you consider the strong upper-single-digit growth we delivered in Q4 last year. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact of exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our Q4 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $180 million to $220 million. Turning to guidance on the bottom line, we continue to expect non-GAAP cash earnings per share in the range of $4.36 to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.45 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates. As in the past, my comments on earnings per share guidance do not include any charges or gains that are recorded or would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. Next, I will like to provide some high-level framing comments on fiscal year 2017, while we intend to give our revenue outlook in earnings per share guidance per our normal practice on our Q4 call, here are some items to keep in mind as you think about our next fiscal year. First on revenue growth, while we are not formally providing our FY 2017 and revenue outlook, we believe it is reasonable to think about our revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis consistent with our baseline expectations. However, keep in mind that we had an extra selling week in the first quarter of FY 2016. This will negatively affect our Q1 FY 2017 revenue growth rate by approximately 600 basis points and our full fiscal year revenue growth rate by approximately 150 basis points, and as a commensurate impact to earnings per share. Regarding foreign exchange, given current rates, we expect $200 million negative impact in FY 2017 revenue and expected to negatively affect FY 2017 earnings per share by approximately $0.20 to $0.25, primarily from the loss of significant hedging gains we had in FY 2016, as well as continued pressure from un-hedged emerging market currencies. Based on the operating leverage from our Covidien integration activities as well the financial leverage from share repurchases we expect to generate in FY 2017, we would expect constant currency earnings-per-share growth to be in double-digits to lower teens, after adjusting for the extra weak in FY 2016, which would exceed our baseline goal of generating 200 to 400 basis points of earnings per share leverage. Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to remind you that we plan to hold our Q4 earnings call on May 31. We also plan to host our Investor Day on June 6, which will be held in New York City. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Gary. And we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I have asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha, President of Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We want to try to get as many as people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question, and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. And operator, first question, please? Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Michael Weinstein : Thank you, guys, and good morning. Let me start with a couple of items. So, Gary, probably the first question people will have is just the operating margin expansion this quarter wasn\u2019t - I think what people were hoping and maybe which you were thinking in the last quarter, can you just talk about how much of that was FX, which you touched on and any other comments just relative to the progression of the synergies from Covidien? Gary Ellis : Yes, I mean, as we indicated, Mike, I mean, obviously we are getting a lot of leverage in the quarter, 1,150 basis points on the bottom line on a constant currency basis. And as I mentioned in my comments, 510 points on the operating margin line just of leverage there and 140 basis point improvement on an operating basis. Unfortunately, with foreign exchange, it has been a headwind all year, it\u2019s having a similar negative impact on the margin, and so we didn\u2019t get as much of improvement than you might see on an as reported basis just because of that. So as we\u2019ve been doing all the year, where basically we are continuing to executing against our operating leverage plans and our cost takeout synergies that we have from the Covidien transaction, but as with many companies we are experiencing the foreign exchange that\u2019s mitigating or eliminating a lot of that benefit that we are - as we roll through that. We are trying to manage that the best we can, but clearly that\u2019s having a big impact. The Covidien synergies, the integration costs were coming in right on plan. In fact, as I mentioned in my comments we\u2019re ahead of schedule and we\u2019re probably going - we clearly will exceed the $300 million and $350 million that we assumed in the current year. We are seeing a lot of leverage here in Q3 and as we indicated - and even in Q4 we\u2019ll continue to see improvement in that operating margin as a result of the synergy. So we are right in line with things, but I agree with you, I think FX is kind of camouflaging some of the real benefits you are seeing from an operations perspective. Michael Weinstein : And for FY 2017, the $0.20 to $0.25 that\u2019s - let\u2019s say, $0.05 to $0.10 more than maybe you were taking a month, month-and-a-half ago? Gary Ellis : Yes. I mean, I think overall the gains are - we even said for the current quarter was like $100 million, and it is $100 million in Q4. So, I mean, we are generating almost $400 million in gains in the current year. Obviously, we are not hedged at these favorable rates next year, and as a result that\u2019s going to have a negative impact. I think it\u2019s a little bit higher than what we would have been expecting a month or two ago in emerging markets. Some of currencies in the emerging markets have continued to weaken and that\u2019s become a little bit greater part of the total. But the biggest portion of the $0.20 to $0.25, the majority of that is just the hedging gains that we will not have in FY 2017 that we had in FY 2016. Michael Weinstein : Right. And then last one, the CRTD inventory drawdown that you highlighted in the quarter, any estimate for how much that was, because obviously the ICD performance was a little bit weaker than this year was expecting? Gary Ellis : Michael Coyle will take that. Michael Coyle : Yes. It was in the range about $15 million to $20 million. Michael Weinstein : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Mike. All right. Thank you, guys. Gary Ellis : Thanks, Mike. Michael Coyle : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions here, I guess, Omar, I think the hallmark the last several quarters of the business has been a significant strength in the U.S. This is sort of the first quarter in a couple where we\u2019re seeing U.S. performance is a little slower here in the third quarter versus the prior two or three quarters. It was pretty broad based. There were certain specific things you called out. Is there anything broadly you\u2019d sort of comment on as it relates to the U.S. market performance in the quarter? Omar Ishrak : Like I had mentioned in the last call, the three things that we look at in the U.S, one is one which we knew was going to slow things out a little bit was the anniversarying of the Affordable Care Act and that probably had a little bit of an impact. The overall procedure volumes based on the economy I think were more or less steady. I think in the Surgical Solutions maybe a slight drop in procedure volumes, but essentially it was steady. There was no economy related issues. The third aspect was simply our new products. And like I said, these new products going to come and go on a quarter-by-quarter basis and in general we still had pretty strong performance from new therapies. But in prior quarters it was even stronger, given a larger kind of sort of synergy of different products coming in at the same time. I think that\u2019s going to go float up and down and that I think is the main factor here in the change in the U.S. market. But I have to point out that our whole model is based on the diversification, because we can\u2019t depend on just one market. And as you saw this quarter, emerging markets picked up a little bit and essentially sort of offset the drop in our U.S. revenue. But I think overall from a market perspective, it\u2019s pretty steady. David Lewis : Okay. And then, Omar for you and the broader team, I mean, obviously durable growth is what you\u2019re trying to drive people towards. Omar Ishrak : Yes. David Lewis : I think as of outside sphere over the next couple of quarters that your CRM performance is not sustainable, and obviously that\u2019s going to weigh on kind of relative growth the next couple of quarters. Maybe, either from like why is CRM growth sustainable. And I guess Omar or for the broader team, if you think about certain franchises whether it\u2019s Spine or PMR, what are the key franchises that start getting better as CRM performance begins to decelerate? Thanks so much. Omar Ishrak : Thanks. Mike you go first and then I\u2019ll kind of talk about it. Michael Coyle : Yes, actually, we see the CRHF business is being one of the prime drivers of sort of the near-term catalyst for the business over the next couple of quarters. Obviously CRTD, MRI being launched now in the United States, but with the 3T kind of CRTD MRI in Europe we think that\u2019s going to be a big contributor. We\u2019re going to continue to add expanded MRI capability in the standard ICD segment with Evera MRI 3T for Europe and that will follow on into the U.S. early next year. Visia AF is the single chamber offering in that space where we will be actually adding to sort of the free capability of the link diagnostics where a single chambered device were really the first device which can actually detect atrial fibrillation. We have the Micra that we would expect to come in, in the first-half of next year in the pacing segment. And after the upcoming ACC meeting we\u2019re going to be releasing the data on the FIRE AND ICE trial, which is the first very large head-to-head comparison of CryoAblation technology to point-by-point ablation technology. Not mention in fact that we also have things like Core Valve coming into Japan and LINQ coming into Japan next year. So we think there are plenty of catalysts to keep the business growing here over the next several quarters. Omar Ishrak : Yeah. I think we\u2019re confident in our steady growth in CVG overall and certainly in CRM. But like you point out, our business model is based on diversification of variety of other products. And I think the two examples that you gave are pertinent. I think in PMR we started seeing acceleration, especially as the ventilator starts to sort of resolve the issues that we\u2019ve had and we expect that early next year, early next fiscal year. And in Spine, I think, we try to lay out as much detail as possible our change in approach. And we like, Geoff had mentioned earlier, we expect to see results in Spine in steady improvement every quarter. So an overall balance is what we look for. And then we also have pretty good cadence in diabetes as well. But we\u2019re - Mike is pretty confident that we can keep our growth rate in CRM going at least to a large degree. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thanks, David. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. David Roman : Thank you and good morning, everybody. Omar, can you maybe come back to Spine for a second? It\u2019s obviously a business where there\u2019ve been several iterations of sort of a turnaround plan over the past, call it years. So I think at the analyst meeting right before announcing the Covidien acquisition you were talking about the opportunity for cross-selling within RTG, now you\u2019re talking a little bit about ramping up the product cadence. What signpost are you watching to identify whether you have the right strategy in Spine? How long are you willing to continue to let this business underperform? Omar Ishrak : Well obviously, underperformance is not acceptable. The thing is that market is still a very attractive market for us and we\u2019ve got core expertise. So we\u2019re going to get this thing fixed. And then, I completely take your point. We laid out these strategies earlier. We haven\u2019t talked about the new product in as much as depth, we talked about in general terms. But as we start to dig into it under Geoff\u2019s leadership, we found that the way in which we were launching these products was just completely sub-optimal, which was really kind of almost compromising the value of these products. And the overall cross-RTG synergies, what was missing before as we just end on specific targets on this. That\u2019s why we made the changes. We\u2019ve made changes in the field-level. We\u2019ve made changes in the overall leadership level. And we are looking at this thing closely on a quarter-by-quarter basis and we expect to see improvement. The real guideline here is U.S. Core Spine, and the correlation of the product launches to an uptick in performance. I think it\u2019s as straight forward as that. That\u2019s the benchmark that we are looking at. That\u2019s the benchmark that you should look at. And we\u2019re going to get this thing fixed and because - again, like I said, we are in a position of high share. We are in a position where we\u2019ve got the biggest breadth with our customers. We\u2019ve got to this thing right. So that\u2019s the portion we are taking and those are the guidepost I suggest that we look at - we\u2019ll point out and you should look at. David Roman : Okay. And then, maybe for Gary, I know a lot of moving parts here around currency, synergy capture et cetera. Can you maybe just help us again - I\u2019m sorry, frame the impact that of the medical device tax suspension with currency hedging losses and how that all kind of ties into your comments around FY 2017, because I would have thought that the positive impact from the device tax suspension would at least give you some relief on currency and hedging losses? So can you maybe just walk us through the different moving parts there again? Gary Ellis : Yes. Well, I mean, again, we are not obviously giving the FY 2017 guidance. And so, I don\u2019t want to get too much into what\u2019s going on there. We try to give some highlights of some things just to consider as you go through the model. But the point is, as we try to highlight here, I mean, for the current year as we go forward, we are continuing to expect the revenue growth to be in that mid-single-digit range as we go forward. We are expecting we are going to continue to get the operating synergies and be at the high-end of the - or in fact exceed probably the earnings growth that we\u2019ve been expecting from the value capture of the Covidien transaction. And that\u2019s going just as we expected. It\u2019s coming in, in fact a little bit of ahead of the schedule at this point. And so we feel confident that will be positive as we go into the next fiscal year, obviously. Foreign exchange continues to be a major headwind for us as it is with the many multinational companies and ours because of the hedging programs we did. If anything - if you think about it from foreign exchange, we had a $0.45 to $0.50 impact from the current year, but that was with significant gains that we had from our hedging programs. So our impact was somewhat muted from maybe where other companies who don\u2019t hedge were at. That is going to come to ahead for us in FY 2017. And as we indicate, that\u2019s potentially another $0.20 to $0.25 of impact as we go into next year. You\u2019re right; we are going to have some benefit from the medical device tax. We are getting some already in the current year that\u2019s helping give us even more operating leverage than what we were expecting previously. But again, the foreign exchange is kind of offsetting that as we kind of drive through this. And so there is positives from the medical device fact. There is going to be positives from our share repurchase. All those are factor we have taken in consideration. But I think if you weight all those together, I think you\u2019re going to find that they play out like we\u2019ve indicated in our comments, because - but the issue as foreign exchange is clearly still a significant headwind for us. And then, we obviously have a tough comparison next year in FY 2017, because of the extra week we had in the current year. Those are all the factors that we try to lay out for you as you put together your models and we\u2019ll probably obviously provide more details and more guidance as we get to our Q4 call. David Roman : Okay. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, David. We will take the next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Hi, thanks and good morning. So just to follow-up on that, so two questions, one for Gary, I think you said in the prepared comments that while you are not giving guidance for 2017, your directional thought on earnings on a constant currency basis was low-double-digit to low-teens, and that\u2013 but that excluded the $0.20 to $0.25, and that also excluded the negative impact of the extra week, is that right? Is that what you said? Gary Ellis : That\u2019s correct. I mean, Bob, what do we indicated was that - you are getting it to low-double-digits, mid-teens, what it would be, if you take out the impact for the extra week and obviously impact of foreign exchange. It was obviously you\u2019re going to be there. So I\u2019m not trying to minimize those. We think even with the extra week, it depends on how you look at. You are probably still, probably close to double-digit growth on the operating earnings even with the extra week in there. But without it you\u2019re back to that lower double-digits, mid-teens is kind of the expectation. But foreign exchange of $0.20, $0.25 will obviously bring that down somewhat as we go forward. So that\u2019s our expectations as we look for FY 2017 as far as the existing models. Now again, we\u2019re not giving any guidance, but maybe just ran through what we provided on those key attributes that\u2019s what you would see in your models. Robert Hopkins : Okay. So then directionally again on a reported basis for earnings that gets you to the high-single-digits depending on what ends up happening with the medical device tax, how much reinvests are down. Gary Ellis : That\u2019s right. Robert Hopkins : Okay. So then, thank you for that. And then, just to follow-up on one another thing for maybe for Omar or for Mike Coyle, on the High Power side, can you give us a sense as to what you expect for market growth as we look forward? And I\u2019m just curious, did we see the same inventory drawdown when you launched your traditional ICD MRI-safe? I don\u2019t recall that. But I just would love to get a quick history lesson. Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Go ahead, Mike. Michael Coyle : No, we didn\u2019t do a drawdown in advance of that. And actually we wound up delaying the launch for a few weeks to allow that to occur. So that\u2019s what caused us to decide in this case to go ahead and do the inventory drawdown during the quarter. In terms of the overall growth of the market, as we said, we think the overall implantables market was relatively flat during the quarter. I\u2019d point out two things to keep in mind. One is one of our competitors had an extra few days of extra week in their prior year quarter which is causing the market to look like it\u2019s slower than perhaps it actually is, in addition to the fact that we had this drawdown that I just referenced. So if you had to correct for those items, we think the overall market was relatively flat with Low Power growing in low-single-digits and High Power basically declining in the low-single-digits. But we had both the - now a nice share capture, but also price improvements in the standard ICD segment tied to MRI. We would expect to see a similar dynamic play out in the CRTD segment which, of course, is larger. So I think that\u2019ll probably give you the best view of what we think is going to happen going forward. Robert Hopkins : Great. Thank you very much. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Bob. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Matt Miksic : Thanks. Can you hear me okay? Omar Ishrak : Yes, we can. Matt Miksic : So I just wanted to follow up on the numbers that you gave for your outlook, long-term outlook for the TAVR market, and obviously coming in just to touch below what one of your competitors has come in would have been, and maybe a touch below some of the comments that you talked about halfway to $5 billion I think was your language over the past couple of months. Not to make too much of that, but we would love to get a sense of how you feel about the market developing or what if anything we should read into those differences. Omar Ishrak : Okay. I\u2019ll let Mike answer that. Go ahead, Mike. Michael Coyle : Well, first let me correct, we never said that we thought the TAVR market was going to be $5 billion. In fact, I think, the last update we gave prior to today would have been around the $3.5 billion market around 2020, 2021. So I\u2019m not quite sure where that comment came from. In terms of overall growth in the quarter, we were quite pleased in fact that we essentially grew with the market in the low-30% range for transcatheter valves. Obviously, that market growth is quite robust above the range of estimate that we had given previously of 25% to 30% for FY 2016. And in addition, given the fact that we had a major competitive launch into United States during the quarter, we were actually quite pleased that our global transcatheter valve business is essentially splitting the market in terms of the growth rate growing with the overall market. In terms of sort of guidance to a potential $4 billion market that was included in the commentary today, there are number of moving pieces here. Obviously, we\u2019ve not seen relative to the intermediate risk group committees [ph] to be not inferior or superior. We obviously are just getting started with the low-risk group so we\u2019re basically have sort of error bars, if you will, around the range. It\u2019s probably between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in terms of 2021 kind of timeframe. And that\u2019s where we sort of landed in the middle on the $4 billion, but I think that will give you sense of at least how we\u2019re thinking about it today. And obviously, that will evolve as data gets presented on the performance in these patient cohorts. Matt Miksic : Sure. That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you, Mike. And just, Omar, just to clarify your comments on the ACA and the volume trends that\u2019s sort of annualizing the ACA, is it fair to say, same much of that volume that you\u2019re seeing is in the MITG space that it was sort of a pull ahead and sort of equalizing this year or is that something you\u2019re seeing more broadly across your businesses? Omar Ishrak : No. It is primarily MITG, and maybe, Bryan, you want some color on that, go ahead. Bryan Hanson : Yes. I was very clear too, because we saw an increase for four quarters, exactly. And two quarters ago that ended. We saw basically the U.S. volumes go up to about 4% growth and now they\u2019ve come down to about 2%, they were 3% to 4% during that fourth quarter period. And they\u2019re 1% to 2% now. So we definitely saw an increase and a drop off as those annualized, but it\u2019s specific\u2026 Omar Ishrak : And then, stable at that level. Bryan Hanson : Yes. It\u2019s not like we are declining, we\u2019re just not growing as fast as we were during that four quarter period. Matt Miksic : Got it. Helpful, thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Matt. Omar Ishrak : Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering, Bryan, if you could give an update on just the overall MIT Group and just any new products that we should be looking for or any highlights, I guess, as we are heading into the SAGES meeting? Omar Ishrak : Go ahead, yes, go ahead, Bryan. Bryan Hanson : Yes, sure. So generally speaking, I\u2019d just say, if you look at MITG, everything is going well. I\u2019ll pull back and just talk about that for a second then I\u2019ll get into the products and health business. But we do on a monthly basis an employee engagement survey, just to kind of check the pulse of the organization as we are going through the integration. And I\u2019m happy to say that those results come back very positive. As a matter of fact, within MITG the scores are slightly higher, even in legacy Medtronic. And so being acquired and having the number of changes that are occurring in our business and still having those scores come back in engagement perspective that high, gives me confidence that we are going to have the retention of key talent, which we\u2019re working very hard to do and we are going to continue our momentum. So I think that\u2019s probably first and foremost in my opinion is the most important thing. Second to that, at SAGES you\u2019re going to see a number of nice things coming from our surgical business. I referenced in the prepared document that we have greater than 20 products across MITG being launched that will drive close a $0.5 billion in revenue over the next three years or so. So we have a very healthy portfolio of products. Just a couple that I\u2019ll call out that you\u2019ll see again in SAGES would be new generators that we have in our advanced energy line. One of them would be a next generation ForceTriad generator that will focus on better speed to seal and also provide the capability to drive new LigaSure instruments. That\u2019s the most important thing about the generator. It will give us the capability to drive instruments that will be a little more unique in the marketplace. I\u2019ll talk about one of those in a second. We also have a generator that we are launching that is specifically for emerging markets. That\u2019d take that same capability in LigaSure and provide a lower cost generator so we can get access to those markets as well. That actually launched a quarter ago. And then, one of the new instruments that I mentioned in Energy will be a multi-function device. And this is important, because what you are looking for the perfect world in Advanced Energy is to be able to divide tissue to scelvenize [ph] either organs or vessels that you\u2019re trying to take. And you want to do that typically with a product that divides well or cuts well. But at the same point, you would like to use that instrument for sealing. And that\u2019s one of these products we\u2019re going to be launching and talking about at SAGES will do both of those very well. This has been elusive for everybody in the marketplace to get it down. We think we figured it out. We are going to talk about that in SAGES. And then, we have a couple of items in Stapling. We\u2019ve got our next generation powered Stapling that\u2019s coming. We\u2019re getting great reviews from customers. And again, most important thing about the powered stapling is it is the driver for our end effectors and with utilizing Tri-Staple Technology. So those are just a few things coming in the short-term. And then, of course, in the mid-term we talk about our robotics platform. We will give you a little more insight in SAGES. I want to be cautious to give you any specifics on when we are going to launch, but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s in the mid-term and we\u2019re excited about that project as well. Kristen Stewart : Okay, great. And then, just for you, Geoff, just as you\u2019ve been now Head of the RTG Group that business had obviously some pluses and minuses. You saw some really good growth across the Neurovascular business. It\u2019s obviously legacy Covidien unit and then some weakness still amongst the Spine business. How quickly do you think that it will take to really term, I guess, the franchises around - clearly, we\u2019re seeing kind of the turn within R&D functions within the Cardio Vascular Group? What are some of the different things that you are doing within Spine? Are you wrapping some of the solutions around it or what\u2019s kind of the approach in change of the, I guess, strategy within RTG? Geoffrey Martha : Sure. Well, thanks, Kristen. First of all, on the businesses like Neurovascular, and particular in our Surgical Technologies business, the ENT business, Advanced Energy business, we want to ensure those continue to perform. And we feel very good about where they stand in terms of their new product launches and the new clinical data that they will have coming out, so very excited about that, and obviously a lot of questions even on this call regarding Spine. That\u2019s a multi kind of fully \u2013first to answer the turn around there, we have been having steady quarter-over-quarter growth over the last couple of quarters. This quarter was a little bit of step back in the U.S. And we anticipate returning to growth next quarter and a continued to steady cadence of improvement. And it\u2019s really, there is a couple of things, one, as Omar mentioned, our Core Spine portfolio. We are excited about the products. Our upstream marketing guys have done a good job, building a number of new products. And now we are focused on the downstream commercial execution, and the launch of those products. And just this quarter we have several new ones for lumbar fusion, this VOYAGER fixation system and Elevate Expandable Cage. And the one that I am particularly really excited about is this OLIF procedure, which we think based on the physician feedback we are getting, is going to fairly disruptive to the space. And so, we have a number of those new product launches. And the big change is launching them at scale. So making sure we have the right amount of assets and inventory to launch them at scale, which is a change. The other component here is our biologic portfolio, which infuse is the biggest piece. That continues to rebound and we continue to get - we just got a recent new indication for that OLIF procedure I just mentioned. And we\u2019re working on other indications there for infuse and then our broader biologics portfolio. And then finally, Omar already mentioned surgical synergy. A little bit of a more nuanced view on this one. First of all, when people look at our overall RTG performance, the spine business dramatically helps our surgical technology business. Our navigation - that business has been about a high-single-digit, low-double-digit growth platform for the last couple of years, powered by navigation and the imaging platforms. Without Spine we wouldn\u2019t have that type of growth, full-stop. But what we need to do is move further upstream and have a tighter technology integration between those two units so that our customers feel a differentiated surgical synergy experience. And then, finally, we are hiring what we are calling ETC reps, these are Enabling Technology Consultants, that are really driving the penetration on the ground with the physicians for navigated spine procedure. So it\u2019s a number of different things. And, look, this is going to be a steady climb back. And we are pretty excited about the next two quarters actually regarding Spine. And then, getting back to overall RTG, there is a place that we have the - I think the most weakness actually in the Spine, because it\u2019s moving, is Neuromodulation. Our weakness in Pain stim and pain pumps, partially driven by the consent decree for pumps and a competition for stim, that\u2019s offsetting our growth in DBS and Neuro. And that\u2019s going to take a few quarters to work through those dynamics. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Thanks very much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Kristen. We\u2019ll take questions from two more people, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe\u2026 Omar Ishrak : Can you speak up a little bit, Vijay? We can\u2019t hear you\u2026 Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys, can you hear me now? Omar Ishrak : Yes. That\u2019s better. Vijay Kumar : Can you hear me now? Omar Ishrak : Yes. We can. Go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Okay. Maybe one quick on the guidance, right, I think when Gary mentioned sort for low-teens EPS growth for next year, and if you offset that by 1.5% from XOV [ph] and the $0.20 to $0.25 from FX hedging gains, I just want to make sure that that low-teens EPS growth, is that assumed [indiscernible]? Gary Ellis : I think, I caught most of it. You were breaking up a little bit as you went through it. But I mean, again, I want to make sure we\u2019re clear, we are not giving guidance for FY 2017 yet. And we just try to put some items out there for you to think about it as we\u2019re going forward. So I am not going to get specific about what we\u2019ve assumed for share buybacks et cetera, because, obviously, we are not giving guidance, yet. But as we were trying to highlight in our comments, obviously, the revenue growth we would expect to continue in the mid-single-digit revenue range as we talked about. Clearly, we are going to get a significant operating leverage improvement from the earning standpoint on a constant currency basis, because of the value capture we are taking out, because of the medical device tax benefit and how much of that\u2019s reinvested, not reinvested, will come into play as we go through that whole discussion. Obviously, as you indicated, there will be share buyback benefits that will be reflected in most numbers. And that\u2019s why we indicated that on a constant currency basis, we would expect that we\u2019re going to be in the low-double-digit to mid-teens earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis. We just take all those factors into consideration, that\u2019s after you take out the extra week of your just comparing apples-to-apples. And as a result of that - then you have the FX impact coming in place. So all we are trying to highlight to people, as your assumptions going forward on our leverage assumptions et cetera are consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing, but just remember, FX has not went away and just remember that we had an extra week in the current year. So other than that, I don\u2019t want to give you more on the guidance aspect. We\u2019ll provide more details as we put together our guidance in the Q4 call. Vijay Kumar : That was helpful, Gary, and maybe one for Omar. Omar, I know that you spoke about funneling in the service offering, right. And part of it was expanding the Covidien\u2019s surgical offerings in EM. And I\u2019m wondering if you could provide us any sort of an update on how it\u2019s tracking either in Europe or in active markets within Europe. Omar Ishrak : Actually, it\u2019s striking very well. This is the moving the Cath Lab Managed Services model to the operating room. And like I mentioned before, really I got five contracts in place operating in Europe today, with contracted revenue of\u2026 Gary Ellis : $140 million. Omar Ishrak : $140 million already from both devices and services, so that\u2019s the - I think the pickup is about equivalent to what we\u2019d experience with Cath Lab Managed Services about four or five quarter we expect to see; maybe accelerate that little more as we go into more geographies more quickly. But we are quite pleased with the progress there. And then we\u2019re developing good expertise in that area. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thanks, Vijay. We\u2019ll take our final question. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Raj Denhoy : Hi, good morning. Gary, I hate to come back to this. But I wanted to get to the operating margin question again. And really the reported number was just slightly below the guidance you gave of 28% to 28.5% last quarter. And I understand currency had an impact, but you did also give us currency guidance, which was - and you did come in line with that. So I guess, I\u2019m curious, what the disconnect was between what you actually did in currency and what you thought the impact would be on the quarter. Gary Ellis : Yes, well, I think, overall, we gave currency guidance from the standpoint of revenue, which did come in line with what we had expected. But I think where currency was a little bit greater was on the bottom line and it\u2019s primarily because of the Argentine peso that I mentioned earlier, that that cost us an unexpected a little over $20 million, $21 million impact that we had not expected in the guidance that we provided back in the Q2 call. So that was the primary thing now. So FX was a bigger negative on the bottom line in the quarter, that what we had originally expected at the beginning of the quarter. As you indicated, the revenue was right in line, but the bottom line was a larger impact. So from an operating margin perspective, we came in with basically where we expected originally, but it was little bit more offset on the bottom line from FX than what we had originally expected. Raj Denhoy : And so, when we think about - you gave us guidance also for the fourth quarter here of 31% to 31.3% on operating margins. How do again do we get comfortable - and I hate splitting hair, because I realize there\u2019s only 20 basis points or so. But given that it\u2019s sort of the marker that investors are using for the integration of Covidien, how do we get comfortable that we won\u2019t again see perhaps an outsize impact on currency or is it just simply the nature of the beast here? Gary Ellis : Again, I wish, I could predict currency and be able to tell you that there is not going to be surprises to positive or negative on the currency side. So I mean, currency is what it is, I mean, though that the impact will be as we go forward. Again, we were trying to give guidance on - as you said, I mean, 20 basis points, trying to call that in our operating margin line with all the moving parts there going on is not easy. So we understand there are lots of moving parts here. Currency was negative in the quarter. I\u2019m not expecting another devaluation here in Q4. But if it happens in one of the currencies that could be a little bit of a negative. On the other hand, what we\u2019ve tried to provide as far as guidance on what we expect based on what we know right now and based on the current rates and where things are at, that gives the guidance on the operating margins. So we feel confident about that, assuming, again, that there are no surprises positive or negative. So that\u2019s all the best we can do at this point in time, just to give you some indication on which direction these things are going. Raj Denhoy : No, that\u2019s helpful. Gary Ellis : But let me just add one comment. The key element I want to make clear is the thing that we can control. The cost take-out of the synergies that we\u2019re getting from the standpoint of the Covidien transaction and the leverage we\u2019re getting across to rest of the organization, that\u2019s the piece that we can control and that is going right as expected. It\u2019s in fact ahead of our plans, as I mentioned there in our previous comments. So the piece that we can control, we are delivering on as expected. Raj Denhoy : No, that\u2019s clear. Thank you. Operator : That was our final\u2026 Omar Ishrak : Okay. Go ahead - anymore, shall we close now, Ryan, go ahead. Ryan Weispfenning : Yes, let\u2019s close, Omar. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Listen, first of all, I just want to also reemphasize what Gary just said. As I\u2019ve said, ever since I started here, we can work on things that we can control. What we accept other variables and we try to understand completely, the valuation of the company is based on the actual performance. We can only kind of drive what we can control as best we can, meet our commitments and drive it aggressively as we can. And that we are completely committed to doing. And on that basis, as Gary just pointed out, the cost synergies that we expect from Covidien, we\u2019ve got pretty granular look at that. We\u2019re delivering. We\u2019re delivering, this operating team is delivering and they\u2019re stretching hard and then trying to cover for other things. But there is only so far we can go about things that are not in our control. So I just do want to make that point that we haven\u2019t lost our operational focus on delivering these synergies one bit and in many ways are a little bit ahead of our original commitments. But there are lots of moving parts there. And then, we are optimistic about the future and our plans are pretty solid going into fourth quarter and into next year. But let me go back to the long-term and really conclude by noting that our overall long-term financial model. And let me remind you what it is. It\u2019s consistent mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth on a reliable basis, which we will get through the diversification of our businesses as well as geographies and our new product cadence. 200 to 400 basis points of constant currency EPS leverage over the long-term and some of that may be a little higher in the next couple of years, as we realize all the synergies from the Covidien acquisition as we saw this quarter. And then, finally returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders, that again is a commitment that we are completely living up to and we expect to see that fulfilled in the upcoming quarters. Stepping back, further look - this company is geared around fulfilling our mission, of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life, and that mission continues. We are confident that this team can execute consistently, balancing our trade-offs and offsetting pressures and in the end we\u2019re committed to creating long-term dependable value in healthcare. With that and behalf of the entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q4 call on May 31. Thank you and have a great day, everyone. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic's Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ryan Weispfenning, Please go ahead. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Jacky. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016, which ended April 29, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. Next, you should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website investorrelatation.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly or annual results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 respectively and all quarterly year-over-year growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. Our annual year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which in addition to adjusting for the negative effect of foreign currency translation includes Covidien Plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. With that, I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning, thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion representing growth of 6% which was at the upper end of our mid single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Q4 important non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.27 growing 18% on a constant currency basis. Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I would like to recap fiscal 2016. FY\u201916 was a transformative year for our organization, our first full-year after closing the largest ever Medtec acquisition. It was a year where in addition to executing a large complex integration, we closed 14 additional acquisitions totaling $1.5 billion. It was a year where we launched a number of ground breaking new products and extended our thought leadership within value based healthcare. We delivered record revenue of $28.8 billion grew at the upper end of our mid single-digit baseline goals and capped off our fourth consecutive year of achieving mid single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was broad based with strong progress against each of our three strategic pillars, new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions. Our FY\u201916 non-GAAP dilutive EPS of $4.37 was in the upper half of the guidance range we established at the beginning of the year, representing constant currency growth of 15% and EPS leverage of 780 basis points. We executed in the Covidien integration synergies, delivering approximately $355 million in the fiscal year, which contributed approximately 440 basis points to our FY\u201916 EPS leverage. We improved our operating margin by 100 basis points including 120 basis points of improvement in SG&A. we reinvested in R&D organically as well as inorganically, absorbing any diluted impact through EPS and capitalizing on our strong free cash flow generation. These investments are in-line with our stated strategy and further support the sustainability of a long-term growth and market leadership. In FY\u201916, we un-trapped approximately $10 billion of our cash, which provided additional returns to shareholders, allowed us to pay down debt and increased our financial flexibility. We also increased our dividend substantially by 25%. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases well above our minimum commitment of 50%. Despite our strong operational performance in FY\u201916, a non-GAAP diluted EPS only grew 4%, after including the 47% negative impact of currency. While we do have an earnings hedging program to reduce volatility and are looking at natural ways to limit the impact, reduce [the risk] as largely upside our control and we feel that over the long-term [indiscernible]. Now moving to our Q4 performance, 6% revenue growth was very strong especially when considering this was built upon 7% growth quarter in Q4 FY 2015. We continue to outperformed the market and the strength of our diversified portfolio was evident across our groups and geographies. Solid performances in diabetes, CVG and MITG more than offset the challenges we faced in certain businesses in RTG. Geographically, we had strong 15% growth in emerging markets and solid mid single-digit growth in developed markets, including 4% growth in the U.S., 8% growth in Western Europe and 11% growth in Australia and New Zealand. Overall, we are pleased with the consistent performance in each of our three growth sectors New Therapies, Emerging Markets, and Services & Solutions. In New Therapies, we delivered above goal performance in Q4, contributing 390 basis points for our total company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 80%, new therapies are driving strong market outperformance. We are helping to create rapidly growing markets such as transcatheter aortic valve replacements, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF Cryoablation therapy, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons. In CRHF, we continue to see strong share gains in high-power from the ongoing launch of Evera MRI ICD as well as the recent launches of the Amplia MRI and Compia MRI, Quad CRT-D. We also saw exceptional growth of over 50% from our TYRX infection control products. In Q4, we received FDA approval for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world\u2019s smallest pacemaker one-tenth of the size of the traditional device. We also received FDA approval for our Visia AF ICD, a unique single chamber device that can sense in both the atrium and the ventricles using proprietary detection algorithms. First developed for our highly successful review of legacy insertable loop recorder. In CHS, ourResolute Onyx DESdrove sequential share gains in Europe and ourResolute [Technical Difficulty]cathetergained potential share in the rapidly growing TAVR market.In APV[Technical Difficulty]system drove above the market growth.[Technical Difficulty]. Over the past two years, our CVG organization has demonstrated industry leading levels of concerning driven R&D and productivity across its businesses and our forward-looking product pipeline looks equally robust. Mike Coyle will share more details on what is head for CVG at our investment in next week. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 6% led by strong above market performance in Surgical Solutions and low single-digit growth in the Patient Monitoring & Recovery. Growth in MITG is coming from five key growth drivers, open to minimally invasive surgery or MIS, Gastrointestinal diseases, lung cancer, End-Stage Renal Disease and respiratory compromise. Open to MIS grew double-digits in Q4 helped by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy portfolio including the LigaSure Maryland, Endo GIA Reinforced Reload, with Tri-Staple Technology and Valleylab FT10 energy platform. GI diseases and lung cancer also grew double-digits with solid growth in our GI Diagnostics business resulting from strong PillCam performance in the U.S. and Europe. We received FDA clearance in Q4 for expanded indications for our PillCam Colon 2 capsule to potentially reach more patient\u2019s interest for colon cancer. Revenue in Renal Care Solutions doubled largely as a result of the acquisition of Bellco a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the up or single-digits benefiting from our capnography market development efforts. We also continue to make progress in bringing our new Capnostream 35 to market in FY\u201917. MITG continues to supplement their businesses with tuck-in acquisitions. In addition to Bellco, the business recently agreed to acquire Smith & Nephews highly profitable and fast growing gynecology business that would complement our existing global [UIM] (Ph) product lines. We expect this acquisition to close this summer, we also recently signed an agreement to take a majority ownership in the Netherland Obesity Clinic or NOK, which I will touch on later. Across MITG, we are developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication free recovery and enhance patient outcomes through less invasive solutions. Bryan Hanson will discuss these strategies in more detail at the next week\u2019s Investor Day. In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 3%, we also have a number of new products in neurovascular our SOLITAIRE FR Mechanical Thrombectomy device is delivering strong results, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market. Even off to the anniversary of the New England Journal of Medicine Articles last year. Our flow diversion products for the treatment of intracranial aneurysm Pipelines Flex in the U.S. and Japan Pipeline Shield in Europe continue to lead the market. In Surgical Technologies, we had mid-20s growth in imaging driven by strong customer demand for our new O-arm O2 surgical imaging system. In Advanced Energy our business is annualizing at over $250 million. Our Aqua Metals system andPEAKPlasmaBlade are driving consistent upper-teens growth. In Core Spine new product introductions across several procedures resulted in a sequential improvement to our growth rate. Specifically we are seeing incremental revenue from our differentiated overlook procedures as well as from the recent SOLERA, VOYAGER, Elevateand PTC interbody launches for key lift and mid lift procedures. We are also realizing some early benefits from speed to scale initiative, which accelerates innovation and enables rapid deployment of these product and procedures to the entire market. Looking ahead, we are expecting FDA approval for our differentiated 2-level Prestige LP our officialCervical Disc in FY\u201917. Strong seven-year clinical outcome date in the 2-level Prestige LP were presented earlier this month at ACC. As expected, we face challenges in our neuromodulation division, while we continue to make progress against our FDA Consent Decree Commitments, we are still experiencing double-digit revenue declines in our drug pumps. Our revenue has been relatively stable sequentially for four quarters, so we expect drug pump growth to be roughly flat going forward. In DBS and Pain Stim we are facing increased competition, but as we look ahead we are optimistic that drivers which has expanded early onset DBS reputation in the U.S. that we received earlier this year a new strategies that the focus our pain strategies in the growing Opioid epidemic and improve our neuromodulation results. On balance however, Pain Stim and DBS could be under some pressure for the next several quarters. As we enter FY\u201917 we are realigning our businesses within the Restorative Therapies Group to provide a stronger focus in the diseases and conditions that we serve. Externally will report revenue results for four divisions comprising RTG. Spine, which includes our Core Spine, BMP and Kanghui businesses, brain therapies which includes our DBS which we are now calling brain modulation, neurovascular and neurosurgery businesses and pain therapies, which includes our drug delivery, spinal cord stimulation and interventional spine business. [Technical Difficulty] which we are now calling Pelvic Health. Advance Energy and ENT will be reported externally as a specialty therapies division. As part of these changes RTG is adopting the general manager structure that has proven very successful in driving a steady cadence with meaningful innovation in our Cardiac and Vascular Group. Additionally, RTG has aligned its commercial organization to this new structure, enabling the group to use its breadth to deliver solutions to hospital administrators and payers while maintaining focus on specialist physicians. Jeff Martha will discuss these change as well as additional details and its turnaround efforts in spine and pain at the Investor Day next week. In our Diabetes Group, which grew 10% we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G systems in markets where it's available. Insulin pumps grew over 30% in developed geographies outside the United States. Despite having anniversaried the launch of the MiniMed 640G this quarter. We also had a strong quarter for MiniMed Connect which is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the users Smartphone. Regarding our pipeline, we are on-track to submit the PMA for the MiniMed 670G with the Enlite 3 CGM sensors to the FDA before we end of -. Once launched, this would be the world's first hybrid closed-loop system. Also this quarter, we were pleased to reach an agreement with United Healthcare to be their preferred insulin pump provider. United Healthcare saw what others including UK's NICE have seen that we are the only company with evidence that clearly demonstrates the clinical and economic value of our integrated pump and sensor platform for both patients and for the healthcare system. Our agreement with UHC is a real affirmation of our strategy to invest in innovation that drives evidenced based outcomes. In our non-intensive diabetes therapies business, we continue to make good progress driving our iPro 2 professional CGM system to Type-2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians. Through our partnership with Henry Schien and our recently announced collaboration with Qualcomm Life, we expect continued success in our Type-2 business. In our Diabetes Service & Solutions business, we are on-track to launch Guardian and Connect in Europe with the current enhanced Enlight sensor in early FY\u201917 and in the U.S. with the next generation sensor in the second half of FY\u201917. Guardian Connect allows us to provide both Type-1 and Type-2 patients on multiple daily injections with a standalone real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our standalone professional CGM products with the application in cognitive competing capabilities that we would bring through our partnership with IBM, we will provide both Type-1 and Type-2 patients with not just a sensor, but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution. While the market remains competitive, we feel strongly that our diabetes business is well positioned to drive sustained growth and Hooman Hakami will provide more details on our strategy and progress at next week\u2019s Investor Day. Our new product pipeline is robust across all four of our business groups and we are confident that we can drive sustainable growth of our New Therapies growth factors in the upper half of 150 to 350 basis point goal. Next, let\u2019s turn to emerging markets. In Q4, we grew 15% and contributed approximately 185 basis points to our total company growth, well within our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We continue to consistently deliver double-digit growth in emerging markets, overcoming macroeconomic pressures in certain countries. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. Our emerging market performance also benefits from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence in any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies in emerging markets represents a single largest opportunity in Medtec over the long-term. In Q4, our businesses in Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe all grew in the upper-teens and India and China grew in the low double-digits. Next week at our Investor Day, we will have the chance to share more details from the leaders of our global regions. Turning now to the economic value growth strategy, our Services & Solutions growth factor contributed approximately 25 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, Services & Solutions continues to achieve revenue growth around 50%. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model is expanded across all our business groups. In Care Management Services formally known as Cardiocom, we grew in the high-20s in Q4 driven by strong growth within the U.S. Veterans Administration Healthcare System. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us especially as post-acute care services becoming even more critical and bundle payment models for different interventions. In our Hospital Solutions business for which we provided expertise in operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating, we had service revenue growth in the high-50s. Since starting this business a little over two-years ago, we have completed a total of 88 long-term Managed Service Agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2 billion in Contracted Service and Product revenue over an average span of six-years. One of the majority of these hospitals are in Europe. We also have management contracts in hospitals in Latin America and in the Middle Eastern Africa. We are attracting strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in the regions around the world have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We continue to make progress in expanding the hospital solutions model from cath labs into operating means utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We have already signed 10 operating Room Managed Services deals, representing approximately $250 million in cumulative revenue with an average life span of seven-years. We are also expanding our solutions offering into Chronic Disease Management, one example is Diabeter, a Netherlands based diabetes clinic and research organization we acquired a year ago, which is currently operating four centers providing holistic diabetes care management. Another example is NOK, a chain of clinics in the Netherlands for moderately obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake NOK this month. NOK offers patients an integrated comprehensive care model, including extensive screening, [pre-care] (Ph) program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery program and long-term follow-up. Their approach is highly successful and we plan to gain critical insights with the goal of expanding NOK\u2019s clinics to more countries providing broader patient access to the multi disciplined teams of specialists in improving patient outcomes. Through initiatives like Diabeter and NOK, as well as the ones I mentioned earlier, we are uniquely positioning our business to focus not just on devices, but providing services and solutions across their continuum. While all of these services and solutions are still relatively early stage businesses that represent important building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value based healthcare offerings where business models will be based on measurable patient outcomes over specific time horizons. Our organization is scoring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with provider and payers. Turning now to the Q4 P&L, we grew non-GAAP diluted EPS by 18% and EPS leverage was 1210 basis points both on a constant currency basis. Covidien cost synergies were over a $100 million in the quarter were in-line with our expectations helped drive a 180 basis points improvement in SG&A and were a major contributor to our strong EPS leverage. In addition, our business also delivered strong underlying operating leverage in Q4. The combination of Covidien synergies and underlying leverage resulted in a 260 basis point improvement to our operating margin after adjusting for unplanned items. Our non-GAAP operating margin including the dividend - impact of proceeds was 40.3%, which was 70 basis points below the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. This was a result of three unplanned items that negatively affected the gross margin. First, an additional 30 basis points from the FX impact in inventory that is based solely on intra-quarter currency fluctuations. Second 20 basis point impacts from one-time such as accounting step-up on the Bellco acquisition inventory. And third, a 20 basis point impacts from higher than anticipated scrap in obsolescence across each of our groups. Without these specific unplanned items, our non-GAAP operating margin would have been 31% and within our expected range. Despite these pressures, we were able to offset the unexpected items to bottom-line. Turning to capital allocation, we are deploying our capital with a balanced focus in M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We remain firmly committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Last year, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings, with the intent of reaching a 40% dividend per share payout of prior year non-GAAP EPS in the near-term. Regarding share repurchases and FY\u201916, we began executing the incremental $5 billion share repurchase we announced earlier in the fiscal year, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase program. Competing a total of $2.3 billion in net share repurchases in FY\u201916. We also continue to use our capital to make strategic and discipline M&A investments, which must need our portfolio criteria. Namely, the targets must provide a line of site to improving outcome, allow Medtronic to add value and we have a committed team in place that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution. Before going to Gary, I would like to note that in a transformative year with a significant number of contacts moving parts our team delivered. Our strong results would not have been possible without the dedication teamwork and passion that are 85,000 employees around the world demonstrated every day. We have undertaking the strategy to transform healthcare, we don\u2019t take lightly the challengers this lofty goal places in our organization. And it has been amazing to see what our combined organization can accomplish. We have formed a common culture and are collaborating with our partners in healthcare to serve millions of patients around the globe fulfilling the Medtronic mission of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life. We are building on a track record of delivering consistent mid single-digit revenue growth and with every quarter we are increasingly confident about the sustainability of this performance. While we recognize that we still have a lot of work ahead of us, we are well our way to meet our integration synergy, free cash flow generation and EPS leverage commitments. We are looking forward to sharing details of these plans with you at the Investor Day next week. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results. Gary. Gary Ellis : Thanks Omar. Fourth quarter revenue of $7.567 billion increased 4% as reported or 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes the $179 million of unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestiture contributed a net 60 basis points to Q4 revenue growth. Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 36% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 8%, with all three divisions growing above the high end of our targeted mid single-digit range. In CRHF, we expect to continue to grow above market due to our differentiated MRI implantables portfolio and other new product introductions that Omar mentioned. We have now started U.S. physician training and shipments of our Micra TPS pacemaker. In AF Solutions, our business grew over twice the market in the mid-30s, and is now annualizing at over $0.5 billion. AF Solutions had another very strong quarter with aortic plan advanced following the compelling FIRE AND ICE trial, which was featured as a late breaker at ACC and simultaneously publish in the New England Journal of Medicine. Later this month, secondary endpoints from the FIRE AND ICE trial and rates of re-hospitalization and repeat ablation procedures will be highlighted in the late breaking clinical trials at the Cardio Sym Congress. In Coronary, we are holding global drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitor launches. Due to our customers\u2019 increasing preference for Resolute Onyx in Europe and many emerging markets, continue enthusiasm for the delivery characteristics of [Technical Difficulty] integrity in the U.S. and our expanding use of CVG multiline contracts in many geographies around the world. In Transcatheter Valves, we are seeing strong growth and we expect this market to grow $4 billion to $4.5 billion by 2020. Our U.S. share stabilized after the drop we saw in Q3, but not having a large size Evolut R. We started our Evolut R XLclinical which is a 60 patient 30-day follow-up trials. In intermediate risk, we completed enrollment in our SURTAVI trial, which is expected to lead to FDA approval and we are moving into continued excess for intermediate risk patients at 60 U.S. SURTAVI centers. In Q4, we also saw strong acceptance of Core Valve in Japan following the first full quarter of launch. In peripheral, we had a number of strong data presentations on our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon last month that Charing Cross. Including mechanisms of action data, which are resulting in competitive account conversions. We also received FDA approval for a change to impact labeling, removing requirement or pre-dilatation and replacing it with simple appropriate vessel of preparation. These labeling changes now positioned Medtronic as the only company in the U.S. that develops, manufactures and sells both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons as combination therapy for SFA disease. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 32% of our total company sales grew revenue 6%. We continue to monitor surgical volumes in the U.S. and we estimate there may have been a slight acceleration in the most recent quarter with volumes now growing approximately 3% versus 1% to 2% range we saw earlier in the fiscal year. We are seeing stronger mid single-digit growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery market while inpatient surgeries are going in the low single-digits. In PMR quality issues related to the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and CapnoStream 20 capnography monitor had a combined impact of approximately $25 million in Q4 revenue. We expect to have both of these issues resolved this summer. Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales grew revenue by 3% with strong growth in neurovascular and surgical technologies and an improved results in spine which offset low single-digit declines in neuromodulation. Our U.S. Core Spine business declined 1% a large improvement over the past two quarters. We estimate the U.S. Core Spine market is growing 2% to 3% so while the last year-over-year we did gain over a 100 basis points per share sequentially. We expect spine to return to market growth over the coming quarters. In Europe we continue to be affected by the ship hold in our InductOs BMP, which is resulting in an impact of approximately $8 million per quarter. Our latest projection is that our third-party supplier will be able to resolve the issue some time during Q3 FY\u201917. In neuromodulation it is worth noting that our Q4 growth was affected by the divestiture of the [indiscernible] drug, which occurred in late Q3. This business was generating $7 million to $8 million per quarter. Our diabetes group, which accounted for 7% of our total company sales grew revenue 10% with strong broad based performance across all three divisions. It is worth noting that the diabetes group double-digit growth came in the face of the competitive U.S. environment. We attribute this performance to our focus on building the diverse revenue streams through geographic expansion and growth in our new business. Products like MiniMed 640G system with Enhanced Enlite sensor and Smart Guard technology helped drive growth outside the U.S. while our non-intensive diabetes therapy and diabetes services and solutions divisions also contribute to overall performance. And while we expect the tough U.S. competitive environment to continue until we get FDA approval for MiniMed 670G hybrid closed-loop system, we believe that our sufficient drivers will continue to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit global growth in our diabetes group. Now turning to the P&L. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a $1.27, an increase of 18% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.10 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.78. In addition to the $348 million after tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on and after tax basis were $118 million charge relating to the retirement of $2.7 billion debt a $97 million net restructuring charge and $85 million charge for acquisition related items and a $44 million impairment charge related to an investment in bio control. The Q4 operating margin was 31.8% on a constant currency basis. This represented a 210 basis point constant currency improvement over the prior year. After adjusting for the negative 30 basis points for the one-time Bellco acquisition inventory step up a negative 20 basis points for the unplanned scrap and obsolescence, the operating margin would have shown a 260 basis points constant currency improvement which fell in the range of our expectations. It is worth noting that ASP declines were in-line with previous quarters and did not affect the gross margin. Our operating margin included a gross margin of 69.8%, SG&A of 31.1% and R&D of 7.4% all on a constant currency basis. Also included in our Q4 operating margin was net other income of $21 million, which included net currency gains of $102 million primarily from our earnings hedging programs. These currency gains were $37 million lower than the prior year. Regarding our earnings hedging program, while we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies during this volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged especially in emerging market currencies which can create modest volatility in our earnings. Below the operating profit line Q4 non-GAAP net interest expense was $188 million, slightly better than our forecast. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $31.2 billion in debt and approximately $12.6 billion in cash and investments of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. In Q4, we prepaid approximately $2.7 billion of our debt utilizing a portion of the $10 billion of cash that was entrapped in a transaction last September. Our non-GAAP normal tax rate on a cash basis in Q4 was 14.6% this was an improvement to our forecast and included an approximately $40 million benefit from the reversal of evaluation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses from our interventional spine business. In Q4, adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion, which was below our expectations due to timing on certain items but we expect it to recover going forward. We remain committed to returning the minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target in any credit profile. In Q4, we paid $531 million in dividends and repurchase $660 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q4, we had a remaining authorizations to repurchase approximately 72 million shares. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,416 billion shares. Before turning the call back over to Omar, let me conclude by commenting on our initial fiscal year 2017 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Our baseline goal is to consistently grow our revenue in the mid single-digit range on a constant currency basis. For FY\u201917, given current trends, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis, constant basis which excludes the estimated negative 150 basis points annual impact from the extra selling week we had in Q1 of FY\u201916. Assuming current exchange rate to remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include a $1.11 euro and 1.10 Yen our FY\u201917 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $25 to $75 million with modest FX headwinds in the first half of the year turning to modest FX tailwinds in the back half of the year. In Q1, we would expect revenue growth to be in the lower half of our 5% o 6% annual revenue outlook range on a constant currency constant week basis. Our Q1 revenue growth outlook excludes the estimated negative six percentage points impact or approximately $450 million from the extra selling week we had in Q1 FY\u201916 as well as negative $25 to $75 million FX impact on revenue based on current rates. Turning to guidance on the bottom-line, we believe it is reasonable to model non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.60 to $4.70, which includes approximately 225 to $250 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition. While the expected FX impact on earnings per share from our unhedged currencies has improved by approximately $0.05 since March, this has been offset by our increased expect the FX impact on inventory. Given this, assuming current exchange rate to remain similar for the remainder of fiscal year, foreign currency would have a $0.20 to $0.25 negative impact on our FY\u201917 earnings per share. Our guidance implies earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 16% on constant currency basis after taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra selling week in Q1 of FY\u201916. For the first quarter of FY\u201917 we would expect earnings per share growth on a constant week basis to be around the upper end of our annual earnings per share growth guidance range. However, it is worth noting that on a reported basis, we expect Q1 earnings per share relatively slightly down given the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra week and the expected negative $0.06 to $0.08 of FX based on current rates. As usual, our earnings per share guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Gary. While I have more to say next week at the Investor Day, I did want to take the opportunity to recognize Gary\u2019s service to Medtronic today in what is his last earnings call as Medtronic's CFO. Gary has served in this role for the past 11-years and since May of 2005 and has been with Medtronic since 1989. Gary has been a constant counsel to me during the time that I have been here and his experience and knowledge and overall guidance has been critical and invaluable to both me and our overall team, as we have navigated through a very complex environment. Gary\u2019s expertise will be missed, but he will still stay on as IT and Operations leader at least for a little while and we will still have the benefit of his strong counsel, more on that in the Investor Day. And we will now open the phone lines for Q&A and in addition to Gary, I\u2019ll ask Mike Coyle, President for Cardiac Investor Group; Bryan Hanson, President for Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha, President, Restorative Therapies Group and Hooman Hakami, President of Diabetes Group to join us. We want to try to get to as many people as possible. So please help us by limiting yourself to only one questions and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have any additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator first question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Michael Weinstein : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Let me just try and clarify few items. So one, could you just maybe make a little bit clear for the FY\u201917 guidance, what does that assume in terms of your margins. Second, I think I understood the commentary on the first quarter, basically you are saying down side on a quarter basis, so let\u2019s call it as 102, 103. Just want to clarify that? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Okay. I\u2019ll let Gary kind of take this one. Go ahead. Gary Ellis : Yes. I mean as far as FY\u201917 margins, we would expect going forward based on the assumption obviously of the earnings per share on a constant currency basis growing 12% to 16% as we indicated. But the operating margins would obviously continue to improve similar to what you saw in the current year. Obviously the synergies in the Covidien integration as we indicated in the call would be a little bit less for next year, but the operating leverage from the rest of the business would be obviously a little bit more, if we move into the FY 207 period of time. So operating margin improvement, we are not getting into specific on that, but basically the assumption would be Mike that assuming a 12% to 16% constant currency earnings per share growth. You are going to see a similar kind of growth in operating margins similar to probably what you saw in the current year [indiscernible]. As far as the Q1 guidance, what we are trying to indicted in the call is that yes we are in the kind of that upper end of the range, taken into effect the extra week, et cetera. I think you are probably - the 102, 103 you mentioned is probably right and its well within that ranges is what people could probably be assuming. Michael Weinstein : Okay. And Gary, I was asking on the FY\u201917 margins, because the incremental inventory hit from FX. I\u2019m just trying to think about the actual impacts on reported margins for the year? I would assume at that [indiscernible] get that range. Gary Ellis : Yes, I agree, it will be. I mean you are right. On a constant currency basis we will continue to see in kind of improvement? The FX impact in the first quarter up $0.06 to $0.08 reflects that we are going to still see more FX on the inventory in that number. We saw a little bit higher number here in Q4 than what we had originally expected and that\u2019s what based on our guidance at this point. Obviously that number continues to get even worse that could be a different issue. But right now, I think it will be a slight negative, but have mitigated, I should say some of the operating leverage we are getting on a constant currency basis as we saw during the current year. But we would expect to see again on a constant currency basis that would continue, but as reported you are right, it might be less of an impact in Q1. Thanks Mike. Michael Weinstein : Okay. And then Omar maybe just two questions. So one the commentary around surgical volumes, is obviously consistent with what we have seen from companies reporting from across the sector over the last month as well as not just device companies, but the hospital companies. Can you just tell us was the commentary about the uptick in surgical volumes is consistent over the course of the quarter, I mean is this something that you have seen even in April and maybe into May if you have insight into that? And then second, I was hoping you could just comment on the diabetes business, because your international performance was exceptionally strong this quarter and just trying to look forward to what\u2019s going to play out in the U.S. once you get 670G approved here? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Just a few words and then I\u2019ll let both Bryan and Hooman kind of give you some more details. First, I think we saw steady improvement in surgical volumes through the course of quarter and I\u2019ll let Bryan comments in a minute on the continued outlook. Why don\u2019t you say that Bryan and then I'll take on diabetes. Go ahead. Bryan Hanson : Yes. I don\u2019t know that I would give specificity in the quarter, but I would say same thing across the quarter. So on more volume growth and what we had seen in the last few quarters. We use a bunch of data points to be able to get to that. One of the big data points that I personally use is calling our sales reps, because we are out in the operating room and we see the number of cases. And there is definitely feel there was increase in volumes during the quarter. Until I see it for another couple of quarters, I\u2019m not calling it a trend, its one quarter, but certainly felt nice in the quarter. Omar Ishrak : And with diabetes I'll let Hooman comment, obviously we are very excited about the potential the hybrid closed-loop system. But I also very attention to much of the commentary around our broader based efforts, that is one aspect of growth in diabetes. I think we are very excited about what we can do about overall patient management and in our agreements that we can make the major stakeholders such as payers liquidated this last quarter. Hooman do you want to say few words? Hooman Hakami : Yes, sure thanks Omar. Hey Mike. I would concur with what Omar said, I think if you take look at our performance this quarter, 10% growth is strong, it was largely driven by OUS revenues and 640G and I think it just show you what kind of uptake we can get with the new product launch. The U.S. continues to be competitive and here we have a product that was launch in September of 2013. And so we don\u2019t have the benefit in the U.S. of a new product like we do in Europe. But I think it\u2019s underscores a couple of things. One is what Omar said is that our revenue base is becoming more and more diverse and we are seeing more traction from OUS revenues, from emerging market revenues and from call it non Type-1 revenues with Type-2 and Services & Solutions. The other thing that I think it shows is that when we do get a next generation platform here in the United States, we can expect some great results. The traction we are seeing in Europe and the feedback that we are seeing on our new pump platform is great we expect to see that here in the United States, once it\u2019s launched. So as we get the 670G, we think there is going to be really strong uptick there and as you heard from a commentary things are on-track with respect to that. And then finally, the last point I would make it between now and when the next generation pump comes out Mike, we have got a log assets that we can leverage within the diabetes business in the U.S. the size of our sales force is the largest the size of our clinical team is the largest in the U.S. We have got the largest sale and service infrastructure for patients, we have got deep and broad payer relationships and on top of that we have got a growing Type-2 and solutions business here in the United States. So, we feel good even though the competition continues to intensify in the U.S. we feel good about our overall global performance and then once thing come with the new product we feel very, very good. Michael Weinstein : Thanks Omar. Okay. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Mike. Next question? Ryan Weispfenning : We will go to next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Just a few piece of question here? Hi guys, first question Gary just to rectify fiscal 2017 guidance of non-Op items. Your free cash guidance for next year is very strong, I wonder if you could update us on two points, one is just the size and timing of anticipated buybacks in the guidance as well as the potential tax rate for fiscal 2017 and I have a couple of quick follow-ups? Omar Ishrak : Okay. Go ahead Gary. Gary Ellis : Well, as far as the free cash flow, the guidance that we are giving $6.5 billion to $7 billion for next year is in-line kind of what we are expecting from our operating earnings growth and continued focus on working capital. So that expectation we do expect as we have indicated previously and we will talk more about it at the investor meeting that our free cash flow will continue to grow very nicely probably close to the double-digit range similar to the earnings as we go forward. So we are feeling confident about that. We are not getting specific obviously about what we are doing with share buyback, but as we indicated previously, when we announced the incremental buyback and if you watched historically, we tend to do that we said we are going to be more front-end loaded on that. And so I think you could assume the same thing as we go into FY\u201917 and its more front-end loaded than towards the back half of the year. So but we are not giving specific about how much we are going to be including in that piece of it. So as far as tax rate goes, I mean there is obviously the befit of R&D tax credit catch up during the current year. if you take that out of the equation, going forward we haven't provided any specific guidance on tax rate, but basically we are saying that your tax rate is going to be relatively flat with where we were currently at. So I wouldn't expect any significant uptick or reduction. David Lewis : Okay. That's very helpful Gary, thank you. And then may be just a follow-up or two here. Omar or Gary I guess there has been a lot of focus as you know on quarterly margin performance for the net until we've have got the senior management is that there is a long-term margin opportunity here. Can you talk a little bit about your confidence and sort of long-term margin assumptions? Why you believe at double-digit earnings? How it can sustain it for a few years and I think about the Covidien synergy number you gave today, you know 225 to 250 certainly gets you to an 850 number in a few years, but it may not get you above that 850 number. So what is giving you the confidence that you can deliver this sort of may be double-digit earnings for longer? Omar Ishrak : Well, a number of things, you know in the Investor Day this will be our core subject, because we want to explain this to you in detail. But look it starts with our revenue growth, so you should kind of get to our mid single-digit revenue on a consistent basis otherwise you got a big hill to climb here. So revenue growth has to be sustainable and has to be consistent and that is something that we are feeling as I said better and better about. Having said that, then we need sort of operating leverage like you said and that in the short-term promising Covidien synergies, but what the Covidien synergies do is it builds a platform for us from which we can continue the same work. As we keep growing taking advantage of our scale in our functional costs primarily, we think we have got productivity that has a long tail, a long tail that we can continue to do. And in addition to that our product cost reduction will also has good sustainability as we consolidate our manufacturing operations, which we really haven't even built into any of the synergies at all in our $850 million number, because we feel that that would take longer than initial three-year period. In the interest of preserving revenue and not taking any risks that's why we didn't jump into that but what it does, is it gives us a continued sustainability beyond the three-year period. Those are the two main things it's an area of extreme focus for us and we think it's very important for us to build the plan that's sustainable and that's diversified in a way that is reliable and we will walk you through a lot of those in Investor Day but that's essentially how we are thinking. David Lewis : Okay. Thanks so much and Omar. I'll get back in queue. Ryan Weispfenning : We will go to the next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. David Roman : Thank you and good morning everybody. I wanted just to go over to the CVG business for a second. And maybe you could talk a little bit more detail about the performance of the transcatheter valve business and help us understand the path to returning to market type growth in the U.S. and may be what you are saying specifically from an end-market growth perspective how that's evolved since ACC and highlight your relative competitive positioning? Omar Ishrak : Go ahead Mike. Michael Coyle : Yes, so first the overall growth of the market is at the high-end of the ranges that we had been speaking about in prior quarters. So the global market appears to be growing in the mid-30s, our reported growth this quarter is in the high-20s. I think the primary difference between our growth and the market growth is the performance of the large valve segment of the Evolut R. we don\u2019t have available yet the 34 millimeter version. If we do get that product we would expect to be able to have its share of performance and perform like the other three sizes do and provide us the share growth opportunity. So that would be the primary for the current dynamics. In terms of overall market growth, obviously both international U.S. growth is well above as I said the high-end of where we have been thinking that the market would go. We think the positive date in the intermediate segment that has been available A from a competitive and B from our own sub analysis of our high risk data, [Technical Difficulty]. Essentially an expectation that by the time we get to 2021, we should be looking at a market that is around $4 billion with some modest penetration of the low risk segment and of course we have now started clinical trial activity in that low risk segment. So I think that would be our picture of the market there currently. David Roman : Okay, and maybe as a follow-up on the P&L I mean clearly you have elected not to give segment margin - P&L margin guidance or modeling help whatever you want to call it for 2017 versus what you have given in the prior year. And given the investor focus on those metrics, it\u2019s going to very clear about how to think about this for FY\u201917 that the context should be essentially stable-ish to maybe slightly down gross margin, leverage on the SG&A line. You have this dynamic with other expense giving you modest reported operating margin expansion, a flat tax rate and down share count is what gets you to the $4.60 or $4.70. Are those the right moving parts to think about in the model for FY\u201917? Omar Ishrak : That\u2019s pretty good. Gary Ellis : Yes, without giving any model view you know I think you have summarized it well. Again, we are trying to focus on what the two levers that we are driving revenue in the bottom-line and the leverage we talked about there. But you are right, to achieve the constant currency earnings growth that we highlighted in here, we are going to have to continue getting operating margin improvement, which we expect with not only the Covidien integration synergies but clearly with what other operating leverage components we are driving. The gross margin, the only comment I would make to our comments is, I\u2019m not sure that the gross margin will be down, it\u2019s possible that it will be on an as recorded basis because of FX, but the reality is we are expecting some of the - assuming some of our synergies will be coming in manufacturing line. So it\u2019s possible you could see the gross margin being flat to may be slightly improving. But that\u2019s probably the biggest fluctuation we saw here in Q4. So I think your assumptions for next year the way to laid it out is probably not a bad assumption right now until we can actually show that we can improve the gross margin a little bit. David Roman : And just to be clear, I was laying that out on as reported basis just to reflect the numbers that could end up in consensus because that\u2019s where we also myopically focused right now. So that\u2019s why I was saying down on a reported basis, but operating margin slightly better on a reported basis year-over-year? Gary Ellis : That\u2019s right. David Roman : Okay, got it. Thank you very much. Omar Ishrak : Thanks David. Ryan Weispfenning : We will go to the next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Hi thanks and good morning. Can you hear me okay? Omar Ishrak : Yes. Robert Hopkins : Great, good morning. So two questions, one looking backwards and one looking forwards. First looking backwards, Omar I would love to get your take on something, you guys have really been performing very well on the top-line, but over the last two quarters you kind of struggled to get to your goals on operating margins. And I just want to get your take on that. I mean is this the case where you are just not quite giving yourself enough room with guidance to account for the normal fluctuations that you see or are synergies maybe you expected a little bit more, just wanted to get your take on the last two quarters from an operating margin perspective? Omar Ishrak : I think it really is the guidance being too tight. I mean look our main area of focus is our overall EPS and we felt that we are always moving partially with the balance and get to an EPS number. That tight of a guidance that we have talked about before was really directional in building the overall EPS and if we knew that there was going to be that much scrutiny on the operating margin line we would never have given such a tight range. I mean the sorts of things that happen, there was no way we predicted them and with things like the Bellco acquisition and its map, we haven\u2019t really done that accurately, because we just closed the acquisition like a week before the we did our earnings call. And when we laid it out, some of these elements became obvious and there were pressures and its absolutely the right thing to do for the long-term and it\u2019s a extremely accretive kind of positive deal for us but on a immediate three-months basis you can get surprises. So really our guidance should have been more thought through and we really feel that moving towards an EPS goal is the right way to look at our company. Because it\u2019s a company with a lot of assets and capabilities and we think that it has been good mid single-digits, deliver EPS leverage to an extent that gives us double-digit EPS growth, return 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders on a consistent basis. I mean that\u2019s a pretty good deal if we can do that at a constant currency level. Gary do you want to say a few words? Gary Ellis : Yes. Bob, I think you said it well. I mean in hindsight if we would have realized how much focus was going to be on the operating margin line, we probably clearly would have given a broader range when we were talking about that at the end of our Q3 earnings call. You know 30 basis point range that we gave on an as reported number were the FX anything else moving 30 basis points is $27 million. And $7 billion company with FX and all these moving part. That was my mistake, we should not done that, but we didn\u2019t realize the focus everyone is going to have on it. And reason I think we were trying to address that and get it out for the modeling was exactly that, it\u2019s not that we are not getting synergies. In fact, if anything the Covidien synergies and other operating leverage we are getting across the organization, we feel very good about and we are attracting that on a very tight basis. It\u2019s the other moving parts that you just get from a large organization like this that we get specific uncertain-line item is creating an issue. So what we are trying to as Omar said, is focused on we are driving top-line, we have plenty of levers including all the costs synergies that we are achieving to drive the bottom-line. But in general, there is going to be some moving parts in middle and we were way to specific in Q3 on tight range on the operating margin and that was my mistake. Omar Ishrak : And you know these moving parts we hope to offset at the EPS level, because then that gives you the full flexibility to be able to that. So that\u2019s the way in which we are modeling our business. Robert Hopkins : Okay. Thank you for that. That\u2019s helpful. And then one other question kind of looking forward on the 2017 guidance. First, are you going to provide any longer term directional guidance at the Analyst Day on the 6th? And then secondly, just seems like on the Q3 call, you gave some preliminary thoughts on 2017 and it seems like what you are doing today is just sort of narrowing that range with a few moving pieces. But as I look at across the business, there are couple of things that it would suggest have gotten better, I mean that you have done a deal that looks a little bit accretive, you did refinancing it looks a little bit accretive. So I might have thought the EPS guidance would be a little bit higher. So I just wonder if you could comment on those two things. Any long-term thoughts and just maybe some thoughts on the 2017 guidance? Omar Ishrak : We will certainly discuss the long-term strategy at the Investor\u2019s Day, so just hold on for a week for that one. And in terms of the guidance, look like we just mentioned earlier, there are a lot of moving parts here and we have been burnt by FX before. And so, we just wanted to be reasonable in our approach and that\u2019s the most accurate, I mean it\u2019s not virtually conservative, nor is it a virtually aggressive kind of an estimate that we gave, it\u2019s a fairly broad range. And obviously we do our best to maximize performance. That\u2019s really the best I can do there with that range. Gary Ellis : Yes. Again, remember Bob at the Q3 call, we really didn\u2019t give any guidance for FY\u201917, we just said remember these factors as far as when you are putting together your thoughts for FY\u201917. And I think we basically have come in, as you said we have tightened up a little bit from that and as far as where we are at. FX it has been moving around, I mean you looked at even just a few weeks ago, it\u2019s probably not $0.05 benefit from where we were - but may be as much as another $0.03 or $0.04 higher than that. So the dollar strengthened again a little bit. So we are being somewhat cautious, because as Omar said, FX has continue to be a headwind for us and we expect that in the next year. You are right, from and operating perspective, things are going very well, the revenue is strong, we are getting the operating leverage we would expect. But there is also lot of still moving parts, we still have a lot of integration efforts we have to get done, we are going live with SAP in Europe for the Covidien amities this week. So there is just still a lot of moving parts and we think the range we have given is consistent is what we communicated before and consistent with our long-term strategy. Robert Hopkins : Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Bob. Ryan Weispfenning : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Josh Jennings : Hi good morning gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just ask first quarter on organic top-line growth guidance that you provided for fiscal 2017, it\u2019s a little bit of tighter range than we are used to. Clearly your confident in the lower end of the ranges at north of 5%. But can you just help us think about how you set the top end of the range at 6% and whether you are leaving some conservatives in guidance and what needs to happen in order to get to above that top end of the range? Omar Ishrak : Well, we need to deliver what we talk about the first. So before we think about going above that. First of all, the range is tighter that\u2019s true. And we did emphasize a word given current trends. We are overall committed in the mid single-digit range and we feel that given our performance and given the diversity of our portfolio, we can get to the upper half of that range like we have discussed. And we need to first deliver that consistently before we talk about meaningful upside beyond that. Like I have mentioned in previous calls, what would trigger any thought of consistently delivering over that would be a fee, sort of over achieved on each of our growth drivers, New Therapies, Services & Solutions and the Emerging Markets for few quarters in a row. Only then we will have confidence that more than 6% is sustainable. You will get the odd quarter where we do, do better. But you will get some pressures on other quarter. So I don\u2019t want to bank on that yet. Like you said, it is a tight range and it\u2019s something that we internally did debate about, but given trends and the fact that we have been holding that level of performance over a significant period of time sort of makes us feel reasonably confident that it\u2019s something that we can achieve. So that\u2019s I think the best response I can give on that one. Josh Jennings : Okay, thanks. And just a question on longer term margins. As the Services & Solutions business continue to contribute to the revenue base and top-line growth in more meaningful levels, can you just talk about how should we think about their contributions impact to margins as we move forward into fiscal 2017, 2018 and beyond? Thanks a lot. Omar Ishrak : We will lay some of that out in the Investors Day, but essentially as you pointed out Service & Solutions net operating margin on its own is usually lower than what we get from a device perspective. However, in all most all of these transactions and agreements we have make, there is a device component that gets attached to it and we get incremental overall revenue and we find that overall our operating margin dollars go up significantly as a result of these transaction. And then as we go forward, we expect to see productivity from those Services & Solutions arrangements both from the services themselves, but also from hopefully lower cost of sales in some of those accounts of support sales. That's the way we are looking at it, it's something that we feel that we have to cover in our overall model and yet deliver the EPS that we are talking about. And that's what we are focused on and use every other variable that we have to cover for that, because we do think that the Services & Solutions gives us a sustainable long-term growth which was very sticky. And besides that it's something that our stakeholders and customers want. So it\u2019s something that we got to manage from our overall business perspective and not get too kind of align that and focus on that one. Do you guys want to add into that? Bryan Hanson : No, I mean I think you said it Omar, I mean in and out of itself the Service & Solutions business has a lower margin just by its very nature, but the reality is there is benefits that also benefit rest of the company from those Services & Solutions that actually can potentially help leverage some of the margins on those sides of the equation. So it's a little bit of a headwind especially here in the near-term as Omar said, but as we get efficient at it we get more productivity out of it, in general we don't think it will have a huge impacts on our overall operating margins. And obviously it will help solidify and give us more sustainability in our overall revenue growth and even in our overall shares. So we feel good about the prospect overall and how it may increases the bottom line growth, but I think you are right in and out of themselves all those contacts the Service & Solutions component has a slightly obviously lower margin than the rest of the business. Omar Ishrak : I think there is an important point if I can just follow-up, just to give you a specificity. We just this acquisition of NOK in the Netherlands that's a business which does bariatric surgery as well as other services and support areas and the net operating margin of that business is lower than our average, but sort of reasonable. When you layer in our surgical devices into those contracts on a consistent basis that drives up our volume on very high margin devices, which gets coupled to this transaction and therefore increases the overall margin rate significantly in those kinds of accounts from what NOK originally had. And so that's the kind of thing that we think we can scale around the world and get significant benefit. Josh Jennings : Okay great. Thanks very much. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Josh. Josh Jennings : Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : We will take that two more callers please. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Matthew Taylor : Hey thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to go back to your earlier comments about surgical volumes. I was curious if you had any thoughts around sort of what is driving the incremental improvement, is it economy or coverage or products. What do you attribute some of that improvement to? Omar Ishrak : Well, give that it is consistent with what all the hospitals are reporting, I have got to say that the overall healthcare demand if you like in the U.S. is something that is on an upward trajectory. That's got to be the fundamental reason and it's probably some of it is just natural demographics which provides this. The other is probably we are seeing some of the impact of the Affordable Care Act and all of the initial pieces of increased coverage might have been more sort of upstream in nature in diagnostics and so. I mean some of these will lead to more procedures. Those are the only things that I can sort of intelligently kind of talk about. Other than that just what we experienced. It is not something that\u2019s easy to predict to be fair and we look at all kinds of different factors and do the best, we have leading indicators, we talk to people and we get a sense for it, but everything that I just said was close to conjecture in my part. Michael Coyle : I would state the same, I mean it's very difficult even to get - you got to go to the different data points and triangulate just to get a sense of what is happening to the volumes, to go deeper level than that and understand why it's difficult to make assumptions, but it\u2019s very difficult to pinpoint specific reason. The other thing I would reference beyond just the increase in overall volumes, the other thing that we are seeing is a mix shift, a much greater growth in the MIS procedures versus [indiscernible] and this is pretty consistent when I look at other players in the marketplace and I look at their revenue growth in the quarter. So I\u2019m really happy about that and truthfully that's probably the bigger opportunity, a smaller uptick in surgical volumes in the U.S. versus a real change in the make shift MIS, although the make shift MIS all day along. And that\u2019s pretty consistent again with what we have seen and what the rest are telling us and what we are seeing from other companies that are playing in the same space. That\u2019s to me is really the story. Matthew Taylor : Thanks, and just one final, you did a little bit better, this quarter you were flat. Can you talk about your overall strategy there that you recently announced the deal with Meso can you talk about some products flow and other improvements that could help [indiscernible]? Omar Ishrak : Sure. We detailed some of are in the commentary, but I\u2019ll let Geoff kind of comment on that directly. So go ahead Geoff. Geoffrey Martha : Yes sure, so heading the Meso deal I mean we are very excited about that. That is I'll call it one-way of multi-pronged strategy around what we call surgical synergies and we feel as we move out into the future, this surgical synergies will be in spine our calling card. We have got very strong enabling technology platforms in navigation and imaging, we are excited about the partnerships in robotics with Meso and then integrating these platforms as we move forward to provide to differentiate spine procedures both economically and surgeon experience. Low radiation, just an easier surgical procedure et cetera, we think is going to differentiate our spine business. And so as you move forward and this isn\u2019t five-years from now, this is going to take place quarter-over-quarter as we continue to emphasize this. So this is something we are very excited about. And as we move forward, outside of surgical synergies, we do have a number of products starting in our FY\u201914, FY\u201915 our spine business put a lot of effort into revamping the product portfolio and the products that are hitting the market now are Elevate Cage for example, VOYAGER another one and this quarter launching our or OLED procedures, I\u2019m calling then our second generation OLED procedures. We are getting a terrific uptick in these things. My only regret is that two quarters ago when we are planning we didn\u2019t plan aggressively enough and because I think we are hitting our maximum with sets and if we had more sets, you see more growth. So that\u2019s something that we are factoring into our planning going forward to deal a little bit more aggressive, but both from a product standpoint and then from what we call surgical synergy standpoint things are looking very good for our spine business right now. And as you pointed out, every quarter we have improved over the last five quarters and it\u2019s a big shift, it take a little bit of time to kid of change directions and we should see continued improvement quarter-over-quarter. Matthew Taylor : Great. Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Matt. We will go to one more caller please. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Hi, thanks everybody. Hope you all had a happy Memorial Day weekend. I had a couple of questions. Just wanted to go back to the RTG and the new reporting divisions. Is there anything I guess to be set forth to kind of the four different businesses? Is it more just alignment with the underlying surgeons or is it just to kind of facilitate maybe better structure to improve the performance? How should we think about that? I\u2019m just kind of curious it has anything to do with just perhaps isolating spine and perhaps thinking about it as maybe less core. Bryan Hanson : No, actually it is not isolating, it\u2019s the other way around actually. But Kristen there is a couple of changes going on and we will get into this next week, but just summary. One moving into these different reporting divisions is really putting the businesses, organizing them by disease, state or condition versus technology and the example I'll give is neuromodulation. I mean that was the business largely held together based on technology implantable stimulator and from whether the gastro euro which we are now calling Pelvic Health or whether it be DBS or pain stim they are all calling on different physicians, specialties and we really felt we would get more traction if we organize by disease state versus by technology. So that\u2019s going to help us one, focus on the physicians appropriately and two, innovate because when we are innovating we are looking across the disease sate and across the character changing rather. So that\u2019s the one change and the other change that Omar mentioned in the commentary was moving into this general manager structure. So that gets to more execution and this is something that CVG has done over the last four-years, five-years where you are having General managers that are 100% focused on the individual therapy segment that they serve in this products within that therapy segment. So making your businesses more smaller, more focused and granular. So that\u2019s another component of that and along with this we have fairly sweeping leadership changes across RTG and many of the leaders that are now running a group have top performers from other parts of Medtronic. And so combined with the different structure, the disease state organization with this GM structure to drive innovation and we have new proven players from other areas of Medtronic, we feel very good as we hit FY\u201917. Michael Coyle : And again to clarify the spine comment. Look, this is specific spine customer and the only thing we did is remove interventional from that and that is not the same customer. It made a lot more sense to group that together with pain, where we have a lot of associated therapies and we were missing the big picture look at pain by splitting up all the different very significant non-opioid therapies that we had. And so this is really a disease based look and look at our customers and that will drive innovation and it will drive a clear picture of how we go to market with our sales force. And then it finally leads value based healthcare, driving for outcomes, is the only way in which you are going to do it. Bryan Hanson : Yes. You know another thing on spine, regarding surgical synergies. As you know the enabling technology platforms sit in what we historically call surgical technologies that component other is now in our brain business, so NAV and imaging. We actually go to a small surgical synergy team, which is a bridge between that business and our spine business and looking at our integrated technology roadmap by procedure as we move out and that also works for DBS as well. So before we had two separate businesses that weren\u2019t linked quite close enough in my humble opinion to drive the surgical synergy benefit. So we put a small team and includes marketing as well as engineering talent to drive that integrated technology roadmap and that value proposition. So just in Q4 alone we had 50 new kind of combined capital equipment spine core metal deals, which is significantly more than we have had in the prior three quarters combined. And this is something that is a result of that and as we move forward, you will see the technology roadmap more integrated. So we have actually built a little bit of bridge between spine and our capital equipment business. Kristen Stewart : So taking the structure that was successful with CVG in kind of overlaying that? Bryan Hanson : Yes. Absolutely. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then just follow-up on diabetes. I saw today the announcement or if I guess it was maybe last week with Qualcomm with the Type-2 diabetes. Maybe if you could just expand a little bit more of that. It\u2019s just see more of the emphasis on Type-2 this seems to be kind of very early stage. When might the product like this kind of come out or just kind of how should we think about what I guess look for to next week? Hooman Hakami : Yes, sure. Hi Kristen. Look, we continue to be excited about and focused on our Type-2 business. This is a new business unit that we put in place a little over a year ago. And we will talk you about the product roadmap next week at the Investor Day session, so you will get more insight there. But sufficed to say that our focus within Type-2 - first the Type-2 population is 90% of all patients with diabetes, so it\u2019s a huge market opportunity. And when you take a look at those 90% of the patients, what we have decided to focus on is really monitoring those 90%. We could have gone the rout of insulin delivery, because that\u2019s also a core competency, but insulin and delivery within that Type-2 population only addresses about 10% of that 90%. The broader opportunity is within monitoring and what you see with Qualcomm Life, what you are seeing iPro 2 and our new Pattern Snapshot capabilities are really our efforts to bring more and more advanced monitoring solutions to those Type-2 patients. And at the end, our goal isn\u2019t just to deliver a sensor to those patients or just the product, it\u2019s really to deliver an integrated solution to those patients where we bring not just a technology, but capability through analytics and insight that I can give those patients actionable information, so that they can better managed their disease. And also to do the same thing for physicians, who are managing those patients. So we are really excited about the opportunity. As you said, we are just getting started, but we think there is a tremendous amount of runway in this business. Kristen Stewart : Thanks very much to you guys. Omar Ishrak : Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Okay. It\u2019s time to close the call out here and I would like to remind that we plan to host our Investor Day next Monday June 6th in New York City. We look forward to having a more detailed discussions with you on our plans to deliver on these strategies that we outlined today. And I would also like to note that we anticipate holding our Q1 earnings call on Thursday August 25th. And finally, in conclusion, as we have noted, we continue to focused on delivering consistent mid single-digit constant currency growth, strong EPS leverage and recurring a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders. FY\u201916 was indeed successful and transformative year for our company and looking ahead, we feel we are well position to participate and lead in the transformation to value based healthcare, which can ultimately create long-term dependable value for our shareholders. And with that and on behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. Thank you and all of you please have a great day. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jackie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic first quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning. Please go ahead. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thank you, Jackie. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our FY '17 first quarter which ended on July 29, 2016. After our prepared remarks we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website investorrelations.Medtronics.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of FY '16 and all year-over-year growth ranges are given on a constant currency and constant weeks basis which adjust for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and the extra week that was in our prior-year first quarter. As previously disclosed, we estimate the extra week had an approximate $450 million impact on revenue and $0.08 to $0.10 impact to earnings per share. The extra week impact for each business or region was estimated by adjusting Q1 FY '16 revenue by the prorated total Company impact. The constant currency adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. With that I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning and thank you, Ryan and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning we reported first quarter revenue of $7.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.03 representing another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth. All our business groups and regions delivered strong growth, resulting in Company-wide revenue growth over 5%. In addition, our continued focus on both operating and financial leverage drove solid double-digit EPS growth and strong cash flow generation as we continue to strategically deploy our capital against our priorities of reinvesting with discipline in M&A and R&D, returning substantial cash to our shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet. We feel very good about our momentum to start our fiscal year and are confident in our ability to the sustain this performance over the coming quarters. Now let's turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. We have three specific growth priorities stemming from our overall strategies. New therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions with quantified growth expectations for each. In New Therapies we delivered results at the upper end of our goal in Q1 contributing over 300 basis points to our total Company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group which grew in the mid single-digits, we continue to complement our steady cadence of differentiated products with market-leading breadth, scale and technology innovation. In CRHF, our AF Solutions and Diagnostic Businesses again delivered impressive growth. AF Solutions grew in the mid-30%s, well above market growth on the strength of Arctic Front Advance cryoballoon and our recent FIRE AND ICE clinical data. In Diagnostics which grew in the low double-digits, market acceptance of our Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder had strong momentum resulting in increased pacemaker pull-through. In our core CRHF and peripherals business revenues were flat in the global market that, in our estimation, was down in the low single-digits. In the U.S. low single-digit growth in initial implants as well as our shared gains in high-power implants offset mid-single-digit declines in device replacements. We continue to take share in the U.S. with MRI safe systems and our recently launched Visia AF ICD. In Q1 we started shipments for MICRA Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker at 1/10 the size of the traditional device. Concurrently, we initiated physician training in the U.S. and we look forward to obtaining a national coverage decision from CMS for this transformative therapy by the end of the fiscal year. We also look forward to a number of new product launch catalysts over the balance of the fiscal year, including Claria MRI CRT-D system with effective CRT pacing in the U.S. and Japan, Visia AF in Japan, Reveal LINQ in Japan and our CRT-P quadripolar pacing system in Europe. We closed our acquisition of HeartWare earlier this week, a leading innovator of miniaturized circulatory support technologies for the treatment of advanced heart failure. We're pleased to now significantly broaden our range of therapeutic options for heart failure patients with the addition of HeartWare and we expect it to add meaningful revenue growth to CVG throughout the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. Not only do we have complementary technologies and service capabilities, including infection control, physiological sensors and algorithms, remote patient monitoring and patient management and integrated diagnostics, but we also have experience with rechargeable battery technology and implantable controllers that can accelerate the development of reliable, fully implantable, LVAD systems. In CSH, our Resolute Onyx XDES and Euphoria balloons are driving solid mid single-digits international growth in our coronary business but we experienced declines in the U.S. from competitive product launches. We anticipate FDA approval and market release of Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of FY '17. In structural heart, the global TAVR market is robust, growing 40%. We continued to gain share in international markets with our CoreValve and CoreValve Evolut R valves. However, the lack of a large-size Evolut R is limiting our share in the U.S. market. We expect approval of our Evolut R XL valve early in the calendar year 2017. Earlier this month, Evolut R was the first system to be granted CE Mark for intermediate risk patients and we're on track to submit our SURTAVI data for U.S. intermediate risk indication expansion approval in Q4 this fiscal year. In APV we had strong high single-digit growth in our aortic business with Endurant IIs aortic stent graft, Heli-FX EndoAnchor system and Valiant Captivia thoracic stent graft technologies all fueling growth. In our peripheral business growth was driven by our IN.PACT Admiral DCB which continues to outpace and lead the fast-growing drug coated balloon market on the strength of its handling characteristics and differentiated clinical data. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew in the mid single-digits with consistent quarterly performance stemming from five key growth drivers, open to minimally invasive surgery or MIS, gastrointestinal diseases, lung cancer, end stage renal disease and respiratory compromise. Open to MIS grew in the high single-digits in Q1 driven by the recent product introductions in our advanced energy portfolio like the Valleylab FT10 energy platform as well as the continued adoption of Endo GIA Reloads with Tri-Staple Technology portfolio, specifically the Endo GIA reinforced reloads. G.I. diseases and lung cancer also grew the high single-digits with solid growth in our G.I. Solutions business resulting from the continued launch of the Barrx 360 Express RF Ablation balloon catheter. Our focus on end-stage renal disease is benefiting from the fiscal Q4 acquisition of Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the low double-digits. We were pleased to return both the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and the Capnostream 20 patient monitor to customers and patient following ship holds that were put in place last fiscal year. We continue to supplement MITG with tuck-in acquisitions. Earlier this month we closed on the acquisition of Smith & Nephews fast-growing gynecology business that will complement our existing global GYN product line. We also closed on our agreement to acquire majority ownership position in the Netherlands Obesity Clinic or NOK which I will cover in more detail later. Across MITG, we're developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster, complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less invasive solutions. In our Restorative Therapies Group, we're reinvigorating therapy innovation across all of our disease-focused businesses, delivering a consistent cadence of solutions across the patient care continuum resulting in mid single-digit growth this quarter. In Spine, we grew in line with the market with mid single-digit growth in the U.S. offsetting an international decline. Outside the U.S., we were mainly affected by the macroeconomic challenges in the Middle East, where we have strong market share and where the continued BMP in Europe which we believe should be resolved by the end of the fiscal year. In the U.S., we continue on an upward trajectory, delivering another quarter of sequential improvement in our growth rate. Our speed to scale strategy is producing tangible results as we launch a steady cadence of procedural innovation like our OLIF procedure and new products including the SOLERA VOYAGER, ELEVATE and PTC interbodies for key lift and mid-lift procedures. Last month we obtained two-level FDA approval for our Prestige LP which we expect will help drive adoption of cervical disk arthroplasty procedures in the U.S. In addition, to speak to scale our focus on surgical synergy which combines enabling technology with our spine implants to deliver integrated procedural solutions is starting to show results. In fact, the combined growth of our spine business and our spine imaging and navigation capital equipment in our Neurosurgery Business was in the high single-digits in U.S. in Q1. We believe this is an indication of our overall growth in spine procedures and a more relevant comparison of our spine results against several of our competitors. We're also excited about our partnership with Mazor Robotics which is generating significant surge in interest and together we're set to introduce the Mazor X at NASS later this year. All our businesses in our Brain Therapies division delivered a strong quarter. In Neurovascular, our Solitaire FR mechanical connectivity device is delivering strong results even after the anniversary of the New England Journal of Medicine articles last year, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market. In Brain Modulation, our DBS products had a solid quarter and we just received CE Mark for SureTune2 which provides patient-specific visualization to aid in DBS programming. In Neurosurgery we saw a robust sales of the recently launched O-arm 02 surgical imaging system as well as the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system. While our Pain Therapies division declined in the low single-digits due to continued competitive pressure in our spinal cord stimulation products, our drug pumps grew in the mid single-digits. Our Interventional business showed continued strength growing in the low single-digits with our OsteoCool RF spinal tumor ablation system driving solid growth and generating pull-through of our balloon catheter plasty products. And all of our business in our Specialty Therapies division, ENT, Pelvic Health and Advanced Energy, collectively grew in the low double-digits. Turning now to our Diabetes group. We delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter with solid growth in our Intensive Insulin Management division driven by strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G system outside the U.S. While the U.S. market remains competitive, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for our MiniMed 630G earlier this month and we expect to see strong U.S. growth of this platform just like we have seen with the 640G outside the U.S. The 630G features a new, contemporary pump hardware platform including a waterproof case, HD full-color screen and remote bolus capability directly from the meter, along with several enhancements to our Enlite Sensor. The new platform also integrates continuous glucose monitoring with SmartGuard technology which is the only technology available in the U.S. that not only takes specific action against lows but also reduces the frequency of nighttime low episodes by a third. In addition to our current offerings we submitted the PMA for our hybrid closed loop system with the Enlite 3 CGM sensor to the FDA in June of this year. In our non-intensive diabetes therapy division we saw another quarter of very strong growth as we continue to promote our iPro2 professional CGM system to type II patients being cared for by primary care physicians through our partnership with Henry Schein. Our NDT pipeline is centered on a steady cadence of product applications and informatics innovation to enable primary care physicians and patients to make better, more informed choices in the management of type II diabetes. In our Diabetes Services and Solutions division, we saw solid growth from both our consumables business and from Diabeter which I will cover in a moment. We're excited about the recent CE Mark approval for our Guardian Connect standalone CGM system with our current enhanced Enlite sensor and expect initial product availability in fiscal Q3. In the U.S., we have submitted our PMA application to the FDA earlier this year and expect to launch Guardian Connect together with the next generation sensor in the second half of this fiscal year. Guardian Connect allows us to provide both type I and type II patients in multiple daily injections with a standalone real-time glucose monitoring solution. We also continue to make strong progress with our partnership with IBM and remain on track to launch our Sugar.IQ personal diabetes assistant powered by Watson in the next few months. When you combine our diabetes devices with our applications in cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring to our partnership with IBM, we expect to provide both type I and type II patients with not just a sensor but a comprehensive diabetes management solution. Across all four of our groups, CVG, MITG, RTG and Diabetes, our new product pipeline is robust and we're confident we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies growth vector within our 200 to 350 basis point goal. Next let's turn to emerging markets which delivered double-digit growth contributing over 150 basis points to our total Company growth in line with our expectations. We continue to execute against our strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. We feel that these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. In Q1, our businesses in South Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and China all grew in the mid-teens or higher. In China, our latest -- our largest emerging market, we continued to outperform the overall market with our unit growth rates from all four of our business groups growing in the mid-teens. Latin America also had strong broad-based growth across our major markets, Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Brazil was particularly strong from both recent distributor conversions and solid product growth in MITG. In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we achieved low 20%s growth with all of our groups delivering double-digit growth. We won important tenders in several product categories and are engaged in multiple private -- public partnership opportunities across India. The only region with pressure in emerging markets in Q1 was the Middle East and Africa where we had declines in Saudi Arabia as a result of the macroeconomic environment in that country that is causing government budget controls, product license delays and tender delays. Overall however, the consistency of our emerging market performance benefits strongly from increased geographic diversification reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in med tech over the long term. Turning now to our services and solutions growth vector which contributed approximately 30 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, services and solutions continues to achieve strong revenue growth mostly from CVG related offerings. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model's expanded across all our business groups. We continue to see success in our hospital solutions business through which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms. In Q1 our service revenue growth from hospital solutions was in the mid-40%s. We have now completed a total of 97 long term managed service agreements with hospital systems representing more than $2.1 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of six years. While the majority of our activity is in Europe, we continue to expand into other regions including Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. Our Care Management Services business which is primarily focused on remote monitoring of high cost and chronic disease patients with comorbidities grew in the high single-digits in Q1. Driven by strong interest and growth from payers as well as providers moving towards value-based care models. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundle payment models for different interventions. We're now also managing chronic conditions in diabetes and obesity through our acquisition of Diabeter and majority stake in NOK. Diabeter, our holistic diabetes care management organization that is currently operating for centers in the Netherlands, delivered revenue growth over 50% in Q1 and we're now treating over 1700 patients. We're currently developing plans to expand the Diabeter model into other countries. NOK is a chain of clinics in the Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery offering integrated comprehensive care model including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post surgery program and long term follow-up. We plan to gain critical insights from NOK's methodology and expand into more countries providing broader patient access to their multidisciplinary teams of specialists thereby improving patient outcomes. We expect all of these new businesses will start to contribute significantly to the services and solutions growth vector moving it to our expected range over the next few quarters. Turning now to our Q1 P&L, we grew revenue more than 5% in non-GAAP diluted EPS approximately 14% to 16% which resulted in EPS leverage of approximately 1,000 basis point. Our strong revenue growth and high profitability is generating significant accessible free cash flow and we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. Before turning the call over to Karen, I'd like to note that we continue to refine our thinking on value-based healthcare solutions. As you know, CMS in the U.S. is shifting payments for certain episodes of care for fee-for-service to bundle payments over longer time horizon. Our recently formed orthopedic solutions business continues to refine, together with our surgeon partners, our compelling comprehensive solution for CMS's first episodic bundle in joint replacement. Last month CMS announced their plans to expand bundle payments beyond hips and knees to AMI and CABG procedures where we have significant market presence and clinical expertise. We're analyzing the details of these proposed bundles and intend to submit our comments CMS as we move toward expected finalization of these payment models. While we're still early in the journey to value-based healthcare, we remain focused and fully understanding and leading the shift to healthcare systems that reward value and patient outcomes over volume. And we continue to develop partnerships and insights into how we can utilize our expertise to play a role in this evolution. We feel appropriate application of medical technology can help address inefficiencies and improve outcomes in healthcare delivery driving new forms of value creation for both our customers and our shareholders. With that I will now turn the call over to our new CFO, Karen Parkhill, who I am pleased to welcome to Medtronic and she will take there a more detailed look at our first quarter financial results. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Omar. Our first quarter revenue $7.166 billion decreased 1% as reported or increased over 5% on a constant currency, constant week basis. Foreign currency had a negative $7 million impact on first quarter revenue and acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately a net 70 basis points to revenue growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.66. Non-GAAP was $1.03. After adjusting for the $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation and the $0.08 to $0.10 estimated impact from the extra week last fiscal year, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew approximately 14% to 16%. EPS came in slightly above our expectations due to a $0.01 to $0.02 tax benefit. In addition to the $376 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were a $79 million net restructuring charge and a $39 million charge for acquisition-related items, both stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien. A $52 million litigation charge and a $31 million net benefit related to the resolution of several tax matters with the IRS, including a benefit from our Tyco tax issue and a charge for a proposed agreement resolving matters stemming from several acquisitions. The net tax benefit does not include any impact related to our Puerto Rico royalty rate dispute with the IRS which has not yet been resolved [Technical Difficulty] for the quarter was 27.4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the extra week, the operating margin showed an approximate 100 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our operating margin included a gross margin of 68.9%, SG&A of 34% and R&D of 7.8%, all on a constant currency basis. While our gross margin was down slightly, mainly due to revenue mix, we drove improvement in SG&A, largely a result of execution on our Covidien synergies. We're pleased with the smooth completion of our SAP implementation in Europe in the first quarter and will continue with implementations across other regions over the next several quarters. Separately and collectively these conversions help drive future synergies. We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings this fiscal year and expected to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of FY '18. Our efforts to realize the Covidien synergies are also serving as enablers to catalyze other leverage programs designed to deliver additional long term margin expansion. Looking ahead at our operating margin keep in mind that recent acquisitions, including hardware, while not expected to be dilutive to EPS on a net basis could impact the operating margin percentage by an estimated 25 basis points in the second quarter and 35 basis points for the full year. However, we remain committed to our plans to generate 130 to 210 basis points of improvement in our operating margin this fiscal year as outlined at our investor day. When we take into account currency it is also worth noting that net other expense of $39 million which is included in the operating margin, reflects about $55 million in reduced foreign-exchange gains versus the prior year. However, the elimination of the U.S. medical device tax offset that by an almost equal amount within net other expense. While we hedge into the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign-exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging-market currencies. As we have said before, that can create modest volatility in our margins. Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $179 million. At the end of the first quarter we had $32.1 billion in debt and $12.8 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. Our debt did increase by just under $1 billion as we issued short term debt to manage minor timing differences between sources and uses of cash. Our non-GAAP, nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 15.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast as it included the benefit from several operational tax adjustments for the quarter. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We're deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline with a balanced focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $599 million in dividends and repurchased in net $1.5 billion worth of ordinary shares in the first quarter. At quarter end we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 51 million shares. First quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.407 billion shares. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet. As an S&P dividend aristocrat we expect to deliver dependable long term dividend growth. In June our board approved another double-digit increase to our dividend which brings our payout ratio to 40%. With regard to reinvestment, our investments, particularly M&A, must not only meet high financial return hurdles with minimal shareholder dilution but also provide a line of sight to improving outcomes and allow for Medtronic to add value. Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude by reiterating our outlook. Our revenue outlook and EPS guidance for FY '17 has not changed. We continue to expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis which excludes the estimated negative $450 million impact from the extra selling week we had in the first quarter of last fiscal year. While the impact from currency is fluid and therefore not something we predict, if current exchange rates which include EUR1.13 and JPY100 remain stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, our full-year revenue would be positively affected by approximately $275 million to $325 million. With respect to earnings, we expect FY '17 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 16% after adjusting for the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week last fiscal year as well as a negative foreign currency impact of $0.20 to $0.25. This EPS growth implies non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70. All of this is in line with prior guidance. Looking at the second quarter only, we expect our revenue growth to be within our full-year growth range of 5% to 6% and our EPS growth to be in the lower half of our full-year growth range of 12% to 16%, both on a constant currency basis. Again, while currency impact is not something we predict, if exchange rates remain stable, we estimate our second quarter revenue would be positively affected by $25 million to $75 million. Other than as noted, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings doing the fiscal year. We feel good about the performance of our operations, the overall state of our markets, the diversification of our portfolio and geographies and our ability to execute. All of which give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our annual and long term commitment. As you know, our focus is to consistently deliver revenue growth in the mid single-digits and EPS growth in the double-digits on a constant currency basis. Our guidance for this fiscal year remains consistent with that long term focus. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Karen. And we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha, President of our Restorative Therapies Group and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group, to join us. [Operator Instructions]. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan in our investor relations team after the call. Operator, first question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan Mike Weinstein : Just maybe Omar I want to do start with HeartWare could you just spend a minute on why now on HeartWare that was the biggest question people had is people understand the franchise but why did you do the transaction today and then second there was obviously some dilution that comes with buying HeartWare given the burn in the company how did you offset that? Omar Ishrak : Okay why now well you know when you deal with their opportunistic elements which can come through so that was clearly one, the other is we really felt that we were in a position where we were getting critical mass around our expertise in heart failure and where HeartWare was positioned as a company we felt that we could add immediate value and through that combination drive up significant revenue not only in the first year but in the next couple of years through real sort of milestones that the company can meet such as reaching approval for destination therapy and then other new products so that was we felt a good timing for us. And besides you can't plan acquisitions to the month period, it depends on a variety of circumstances and things just fell into place. We felt we had the management bandwidth to do this the team was well-prepared, we had the right capabilities and we had additional synergies that we could add in many different ways. So we felt this was absolutely the right time. And in terms of the dilution that obviously comes along with an acquisition this size, there are offset to the cardiac and vascular group made that unless Mike is going to comment on the overall thing on that. Mike Coyle : Sure, Mike, obviously we had a number investments internally going on in R&D programs directed specifically at heart failure including diagnostic programs and services as well as enhancements to our CRT product lines and we basically are reallocating resources and people to support the activities within HeartWare and backing off on some of those because we actually think HeartWare return on investment will be even better. Mike Weinstein : If I could just ask two quick follow-ups. Mike this was a tougher quarter for the traditional ICD business for the high power business, could you just comment on that and I was wondering if Hooman could comment on 670G timing in light of the 630 approval. Thanks. Mike Coyle : As a relates to ICD or think probably the thing that is impacting the overall market is U.S. replacements and that we saw pretty stable low single-digit growth in initial implants for ICDs but we\u2019re now getting to a point where year-over-year comparisons on frankly replacements are down and sort of the low double-digit kind of range which is obviously a function of what's patents to initial implants 5 to 8 years ago depending what you're talking about CRT to standardize CDs. So that's obviously putting some strain on the overall market growth. We actually took share in the ICD market as we continue to get the benefit of the MRI safe technologies rolling into not just the standard ICD's but also into CRT-D. And that's something that we think we can continue, we think we are very much in the front end of basically the mix shift toward use of MRI in standard high-powered and into CRT-D and we also obviously have a very robust set of new products that are just hitting the market and will be added to over the course of the next several quarters including the Visia AF and a single chamber segment as well as the Clary's [ph] CRT-D device which adds the effective CRT algorithm to our overall set of offerings. So we think -- obviously the market is going to provide a bit of a head wind because of the replacements but we think we\u2019re in a good position to continue to take share and mitigate some of that. I was particularly encouraging to me that we could get to that mid single-digit growth when we\u2019re seeing that kind of stress metrics in the ICD market but obviously we\u2019re in a little bit of an off segment on our DES market as well and yet are able to still get into mid-single-digit growth so we think it speaks to the importance and value of the breadth of the portfolio. Hooman Hakami : Yes with respective 670 Mike, the PMA is with the FDA, it's really hard to predict when they're going to improve it obviously it's in their hands now. We are working actively with them to answer the questions that they have regarding our submission but as you know and as Omar talked about in the commentary in the meantime we launched the 630G we received approval and have launched the 630G and we're excited about this. This is going to address some of the biggest requests we've seen from patients color screen waterproofs remote [indiscernible] capability and so it's a chance for us to really bring additional enhancements to our patients while the 670 process goes on. So we\u2019re excited about the new product that we have and in the meantime we\u2019re working actively with the FDA on the 670. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Just a couple of questions here. Omar the last four quarters as you know organic growth has been extremely stable within Medtronic, in this quarter there were a couple of areas Mike mentioned one of them but the stem [ph] franchise U.S. geography broadly at a little bit the emerging market geography what if you could sort of address those few areas and may be a couple different people but just more specifically after that four quarters of significant stability of organic growth can that organic growth number get better here over the next several quarters and I have a quick follow-up after that. Kevin Miller : Well you know look we've always said that one of our main strength is the diversity of not only our portfolio but our geographic presence as well as the nature of the sources of revenue that we have from emerging markets from services solutions and new therapies. And that by definition means that there will be areas which are strong one quarter and week in others but overall we're pretty confident, very confident that we can maintain even just organically the mid-single-digit range within the full range of mid single-digits. We expect acquisition to supplement that and give us more confidence in holding that range but our new product introduction and so on as well as our geographic extension should enable us to that. Now specifically to your question, you know we would really bit of a down product cycle if you like in the U.S. where most of our new products have the biggest impact. We think we'll get up bonus of new products in the coming quarters and that will pick it up again but the slight drop in U.S. revenue from our typically we've been doing about 4 to 3 this quarter is primarily that. We think in many areas we continue to show strength particularly in surgical procedures and within the MITG portfolio and that really hasn't changed. And like Mike pointed out a little earlier we\u2019re in a down product cycle actually both in cardiac and in diabetes which we think will come back in the next few quarters. So that\u2019s the dynamics in the U.S. market and new therapies. And also you know the other thing that I would like to point out is RTG, our restorative therapies growth led by Spine which we're watching very carefully, we're encouraged to see good strength there or early strength, I mean it's -- we've got to demonstrate sustained capability of mid single-digit growth there but we're pleased to see the way that RTG is moving now and offsetting pressures even in that portfolio with strength in other areas. And in an emerging markets actually again we\u2019re quite pleased, we\u2019re trying to -- went through all kinds of gyrations in the last two years if you like and through that we've maintained either double-digit growth plus and minus is a little bit in that geography and then the other geographies have balanced each other out. I mean Middle East and Africa has been a very strong contributor of emerging market growth over the last several orders. This quarter there were conditions there but then other geographies such as Latin America showed considerable strength and China for that matter to offset that. So we\u2019re very confident that the projection that we made of sort of low to mid teens double-digit growth in the emerging markets is something that is quite sustainable despite macroeconomic challenges that may come about. I think I covered your points David. David Lewis : You did Omar, thank you. And just a quick follow-up on earnings and margins broadly for Karen and the broader team. So just to avoid any confusion we've had a last couple of quarters, your commentary Karen thinking about consensus in the second quarter earnings number we kind of come around kind of a 150 number plus or minus a penny I wonder if could just comment about your comfortability with the consensus or that number and then just broadly if you take a step back from the analyst day, margins were the real focus and I wonder you're giving us 12% to 16% for this year but your confidence that we continue to see the durability of that 12% to 16% or sort of mid-teens earnings growth and of all those plans and restructuring plans you referred to when does the investor really start to see the inflection in this plan where they could really get this sense of the sustainability of this long term double-digit teens profile. Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Thanks David. I don't comment specifically on consensus numbers but happy for any of you to follow up with Ryan to go through your models at any point in time. In terms of our confidence in delivering our long term bottom line EPS growth I think this company has a very strong ability and we're very confident in our ability to deliver our commitment. Not only do we have significant growth on the top line particularly from emerging markets as Omar noted, but we have been driving strong synergies from the Covidien acquisition and we're focused on delivering additional leverage of beyond the Covidien acquisition through significant focus on managing our cost efficiently and I feel we\u2019re very confident in our ability to do just that. Omar Ishrak : I think maybe if I could just add to that your question about when to watch for inflection points, well listen like we've said before the Covidien synergies if we hit our $850 million projection that alone takes us through the double-digit EPS sort of projection. I mean by definition in FY '17 and mostly in FY '18. Now as we transition beyond that, we're like I mentioned in the Investor Day working on other efficiency programs in operations and in functions and many other areas which will then sustain that level. So those programs that we worked on right now but clearly the real results will prove themselves beyond FY '17. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : So just two quick questions one is just to clarify question on the revenue growth guidance for 2017 you know given that now you've closed HeartWare. I hear you specifically on the upper end of the mid-single-digit range but I'm just curious does M&A add about a point to growth for 2017 given all the deals that have happened? Omar Ishrak : Well yes I mean if you have the deals up its something like that probably a little less than that but you know the main point though here is that the range that we projected really balances out issues that may arise, market issues and other issues that arise in our business. We feel confident that even organically that we will be in the mid-single-digit range and the whole range. And we feel that acquisitions give us increased confidence that we will hit that and probably in the higher end of that range I mean certainly this year with HeartWare we've got increased confidence for that. But that's the way in which we're looking at this. You know it's probably if you want to direct answer to your question is probably slightly under a point that the acquisitions are adding but things roll off other things come in, it's pretty dynamic picture and believe it or not there are some divestitures as well like the drug business and other things that grow out of our portfolio. So net-net it's probably a little less than a full point. Karen Parkhill : And Bob we did say that this quarter net M&A added about 70 basis points this quarter. Bob Hopkins : Great. Thank you. No, I understand the philosophy around the guidance I just wanted to make sure I had a good understanding of all the moving parts. And then for second question just on the product side I was wondering if Mike could talk a little bit about the upcoming MRI safe competition, we\u2019ve started to see a little bit of that roll-in just Mike your confidence in mid-single-digit growth now that we're about to see a steady cadence of MRI safe competition and then quickly on the diabetes side I heard the timelines for 670G but I just want to make sure there's no change in timelines on 670G from your perspective? Mike Coyle : So on MRI, we obviously think this should become standard of care and right now if you just look at the most mature products we have in that segment are in a dual chamber pacing area and there the mix is still in the U.S. which is the most developed market in the sense or still -- only 70% of our business is actually MRI safe and recognizing that we're just a little over half the pacing business that means that less than half of the patients we\u2019re getting pacemakers in the United States that are getting MRI safe devices and as you go into the other product lines ICD's it's more like a 50% penetration rate for us when you get to CRT-D it's more like a 30% penetration rate for us or mix for us. So these penetration rates are very low and so we still think there's plenty of upside to go in those spaces, but as competitors catch up to this which still we have got it's only happening on the [indiscernible] side right now and is expected to take still several quarters into next year next calendar year before we see ICD competition CRT-D competition in those areas. We're continuing to advance the bulk. I mean obviously on the pacing side it's Micra right where we basically have an opportunity to significantly shift to very much value-added product in a single chamber segment as we get our reimbursement in place for that which is going to happen before the end of the fiscal year. In the standard ICD segment for single chamber the addition of Visia AF is being very well received in the marketplace. It is the only single chamber device that could actually do monitoring of atrial fibrillation without having a lead. So it gives a very significant benefit beyond simply the MRI safe characteristics of the products. And then in the CRT-D side we're obviously adding significant therapeutic value with things like adaptive CRT and effective CRT which basically improve response rates in CRT and because our hardware platforms Amplia in particular are basically positioned to be able to do multi-point pacing. We're going to add multi-point pacing capability to that Amplia product with software downloads below the end of the fiscal year. So we continue to advance the offerings that we have beyond MRI as competitors catch up in MRI. Omar Ishrak : And in terms of diabetes the 670G is on track but Hooman do you want to say a couple of words on that? Hooman Hakami : Sure. There's absolutely no change or any indication that things are going to push out on the 670G and may be Bob just an additional point of clarification we didn't launch the 630 because we thought there was a risk to the 670 timeline. So the 670 is as I said we're working very, very closely with the FDA, the relationship is outstanding and we\u2019re actively engaged with -- we launched the 630 not due to anything related to the 670 but because of two things. One it gives our patients the request that they've asked for and I touched on what some of those were from waterproof to color screen and at the same time what it does is it refreshes our product line in the U.S. the 530G was launched in September of 2013 that\u2019s three years ago. And we held our own with this product even at this long anniversary but if you take a look at how well the 640 has done outside the United States, we felt that by bringing these patient centric features and a new hardware platform into the U.S. now, we could really refresh our product line and really drive growth in the U.S. while we wait for the 670. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : I was wondering if you could just I guess take a step back and I guess since this is your first call just refresh us on I guess your thoughts on joining Medtronic and I know as mentioned before on the call, the operating margins has been a real big goal for Medtronic. I was wondering if you could just refresh us on the overall thoughts there and just again Medtronic from a broader sense on your enthusiasm on joining the team. Karen Parkhill : I'm thrilled to be a part of this great team. Medtronic is an amazing company with a very strong mission that clearly spoke to me personally. I think we're a leader in the industry from a vision perspective and I'm excited to be at a company that is leading not just, not just the medical device industry but the healthcare industry in general and I'm thrilled to be at a team where we're focused on growth and efficiency. In terms specifically of the operating margin as you know our focus is to drive a stronger growth in our bottom line and we have in our top line and the only way you do that is through efficiency in our margins. We're very focused on that we talked about driving the Covidien synergies through to completion and ultimately achieving the $850 million commitment that we have put out there. And then on top of that, as we said we're focused on driving efficiencies throughout the company looking at all of our processing, bringing in lean Six Sigma to make us better and more efficient, centralizing resources where we can and ultimately driving double-digit bottom-line growth which is much stronger than a very impressive mid-single-digit top line growth. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then just I guess from your perspective where do you think that you're going to add the most value from Medtronic and can you just give us your thoughts on capital deployment and how you look at the lens of with M&A. Karen Parkhill : Sure. I'm happy to talk about those. I'm excited to step into the very big shoes of Gary and I intend to steer the ship very much in the same direction that he has. I do come from a financial industry background most recently though I've had experience in many industries within financial services obviously one of the key things that we had been doing in an ultra-low rate environment was focused on efficiency and driving strong bottom-line. And so that's exactly what we'll be doing here. In terms of capital deployment, I think the highest and best use of our capital is to grow the intrinsic value of the company through reinvestment first and foremost, but beyond that I think it's very important to have a dividend that is strong and that does steadily grow with earnings and then on top of that, where we can have meaningful pay back to our shareholders through share repurchase and that's exactly what we're doing with our commitment to deliver a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of share repurchase. In addition to the ability of us on trapping more cash we have an additional $5 billion commitment over a three-year period from FY '16 to FY '18. So obviously I firmly believe in all that we're doing with the company and hope that helps. Omar Ishrak : Let me also add, look it's a pleasure to welcome Karen onto the team. She's made a great start and really -- if nothing else we value the fresh thinking and a fresh angle that is very useful for us as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Omar, I wanted to start with a big picture question for you. In calendar Q1 2016, it was generally a strong quarter for the largest med-tech companies, we actually found acceleration in the weighted average of organic growth for the large [indiscernible] 5% to 6% depending on whether it include Edwards and Intuitive. So the question I have for you is what you think is driving improvement in the industry growth, how sustainable is it -- could you actually see growth improve for the industry from here or do you think 5% to 6% is the new norm and then I had a follow-up. Omar Ishrak : Look you know the industry is very broad so to be specific about this stuff but just a few reflections on this. First of all, if you're in healthcare your entitlement is growth because the opportunities in healthcare are limitless. If you look at it both from a medical innovation perspectives, the number of problems that have to be solved that patients will value, that create a real difference in people's lives driving equity in healthcare around the world. The opportunities there are again limitless and we're just scratching the surface and then on top of that you know like we've talked about the challenge of addressing wastage in healthcare where we\u2019re literally wasting across the world hundreds of billions of dollars in total healthcare spend which -- of which there's inefficiency in deliveries primarily because of payment models and so on around the world. So if you look at all that collectively, the fact that the healthcare industry is growing is really not a surprise in many ways. It's an entitlement that the healthcare industry should have. And I think the fact that there was momentum this last quarter and last couple of quarters I mean that's -- it's too tough to call on something with that short a timeline but I've every expectation that all stakeholders in healthcare if they get their heads around these opportunities will steady increase in the growth profile in healthcare I think that's our entitlement. I think that's the only real comment I can make. I think all the companies that you listed are good companies with innovation driving and creating new markets. We expect to be an equal player in many of those areas, but there are lots of people out there with great sense of purpose and inventiveness in driving the solution. So again I just put it in the perspective of overall healthcare this is not one that should ever be a down market if we as players and stakeholders in the healthcare market can get our heads around this. Larry Biegelsen : And Mike, the intermediate risk indication for CoreValve in the Ce Mark [ph] approval came earlier than people expected, what do you think the implications are for the market and for CoreValve for that intermediate risk indication and just Karen the net other expense or income for the remainder of the year it was a little bit lower this quarter than we expected and the catch rate as well, could you comment on that please. Thanks a lot. Mike Coyle : As it relates to intermediate risk we were certainly expecting these developments both in terms of [Technical Difficulty] Edwards approval in the United States. We reflected that in our estimates for the overall market which we showed at the analyst meeting. So I wouldn't necessarily change what we said at that time. Other than to say it's obviously good to see these developments tending to happen sooner rather than later in terms of regulatory organizations looking at these compelling data and basically making sure these technologies are available to patients in the intermediate risk group and so we look forward to obviously finishing the [indiscernible] study working with the FDA to get label indications for that in the United States and we think the growth profile will be overall [indiscernible] market which was very robust in Q1 is going to continue to be a very impressive driver of growth for us and for Medtec in general. Karen Parkhill : Yes on net other expense we did mention the fact that our medical device tax does flow through that line item and obviously that was down year-over-year about $55 million. We did have currency gains that run through that line item as well. Those were down year-over-year too. In terms of our tax rate we did have several discrete tax benefits in the quarter that did push our overall tax rate down to 15.7% for the year. We do still do expect our tax rate to be within the range that we talked about before of 16.5% to 17.5%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Bruce Nudell : Omar, we recently revisited the surgical practice patterns in orthopedics and some things don't seem to change. There seems to be just some [Technical Difficulty] for the status quo and some of the intricacies of gaining share in terms of repacing of internal savings pose another impediment to change. Should we be thinking about Medtronic's orthopedic initiative principally on the basis of broad solutions including management of patients and post-acute care or is really the implant side of the business really seminal to your thinking? Omar Ishrak : No, I think it's a former, it is a broad solution that is necessary and we feel that there is a lot of cost I mean the majority of cost in that overall episode is actually in the post-acute space and so we think we can make a considerable difference but let's not just put that in a single bucket because in overall process includes proper risk stratification of the patients and that risk stratification drives a very specific care pathway to which adherents must be made and then following that, a clear handoff to post-acute care in the most efficient manner possible and finally a clear measurement and accountability for the outcome of the patient. Those four things that I've just outlined are not things that today are look at holistically. And I think in each one of those areas there's considerable inefficiency and we believe that putting technology and using technology will not only create an inflection point, in the short term, but will actually create long term sustainability of savings in that process because as you improve outcomes, you improve your cohort selection and risk stratification. Your care pathways improve and then through all of that implants will play a role in terms of providing the most effective implant at the appropriate cost and when there is innovation in those areas we use them to drive up outcomes. So that\u2019s the way we look at it but you have to start with the holistic view and implant is only a portion of that and that\u2019s our view. Geoff, do you want to add anything to that quick Geoffrey Martha : No I think you're right if we look at this holistic view we look at it in several areas like the segmentation of the patients and the risk analytics, the pre-procedure patient engagement and education. The inner operative technologies not just the implants but different surgical tools that can be used that can lower the procedure cost during the hospital stay or downstream. And then the post-acute remote patient monitoring and then finally the patient reported outcomes the data collection reporting on that and look, we're seeing examples for example I was just with our Advanced Energy business yesterday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and they have the technology that almost adds almost $500 to the cost of the procedure and when they -- over the last year with the advent of knowing that CGR was coming they really had to -- they revamped their go to market strategy, did that patient segmentation that Omar was talking about was very clear to the surgeon partners and the health systems they are selling into, what patient cohorts the hemostasis technology, what patient cohorts that added value to downstream and what it did not. Okay? So they did that patient segmentation, they published some papers on the value of the technology downstream for those courts in patients both clinically and economically and they have seen a big boost in their business. So we\u2019re seeing the impact when you look at it holistically you can document and I think it's a matter of time you'll see certain technologies separate themselves that way both good and bad, up and down and so I take your point on the I guess the -- what would you call the built-in forces that are keeping things stable but I think over time as hospitals and health systems and payers become more sophisticated in looking at this holistic approach and looking at the clinical and economic impact across the 90 day period in this case I think you're going to see separation. I just don't think people have fully grasped it yet. Bruce Nudell : And just a follow-up for Mike. Mike, you know there were reports of vascular injuries with CoreValve, I'm presuming that was mainly it's training issue not a class affect related to the longer size of the self-expanding kind of devices. And a second follow-up on I'm presuming you pull the trigger on HeartWare being pretty comfortable with HVAC, it's going to be competitive until the pipeline evolves and just any thoughts you might have on the pipeline. Mike Coyle : Sure. So on the field action we took obviously we monitor all the patients that are being treated with our products and in that particular case we saw some overlap between specific anatomic issues and an increase in vascular trauma. So it was in fact only about training that this field action was done, it was to improve sensitivity to those particular aspects when screening patients and making sure that care is taken in terms of the delivery of the device. I would point out that our instance of vascular injuries actually below what is in the TBT registry. So we have a low threshold for identifying these issues and what we think we can help improve outcomes we obviously take action to do it. So there was no change to the product, there were no issues with manufacturing, it basically was a training issue. On HeartWare obviously we're very bullish on the HVAC system as it is we think that device it performed very well, we were obviously able to see details of the clinical evidence that they generated in support of their U.S. approval in advance of making the decision to acquire the company and I think you\u2019ve seen especially in their most recent quarterly earnings results that in Europe there is beginning to see after the initial trial a nice bounce back in terms of overall share which obviously is consistent with our view that this product with its smaller size and its performance characteristics should be able to compete very effectively in that space. We continue to look at the MVAD device and decide how aggressively we want to pursue that and we're working closely with the leadership team there, very impressed with the people who are doing that work and we look forward to being a leader in this space for decades to come. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar, Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : So maybe one I had a guidance clarification question and one follow-up. I guess when you look at sequentially 1Q versus 2Q, 1Q we came at the high end on a constant currency constant week EPS growth. 2Q was sort of looking at the bottom end of the 12% to 14% range, so can you just talk to sort of what changed in 1Q and 2Q and when I look at the annual guidance rate 1Q revenues came in 200 basis points above internal plans, So if we\u2019re looking at low half of the annual sort of 5% to 6% but we came in north of 5% and so revenues came in better in 1Q but I'm just curious why how EPS we sort of re-created on the EPS guidance. Karen Parkhill : In terms of first quarter versus second quarter yes our first quarter we did come in at the high end of that 12% to 16% growth range and we did give guidance that we expect second quarter to be at the low end of that 12% to 16% range. The key reason is the tax rate. We expect our tax rate from the second quarter last year to second quarter this year to be about 50 basis points higher. In terms of revenue growth rate, obviously we do expect our second quarter to be in the same line as our overall annual growth rate of 5% to 6%. Clearly we've got the HeartWare acquisition closing that gives us confidence around that range. Vijay Kumar : And then maybe one follow-up, I guess a lot of questions have been asked but I'm just curious maybe if Mike can answer this have you had conversations with the FDA on whether they would accept a one-year data for CoreValve given we have notion, we have subgroup analysis of high risk and your peer [indiscernible] just got approval based on one year data and if you had those conversations what's been the response? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Obviously it's always a very fluid discussion with FDA and I have been very impressed with the way they have adapted their views in the TAVR space to the quality of the clinical evidence and have been flexible in terms of timing on approvals in the space generally I think we saw that again with Edwards and we had approval and so this group I think is extremely effective at balancing the therapeutic benefit of products with their risk and trying to get good new therapies to the market as quickly as they can. So we will as you point out continued to basically look at one year and two year cuts on the data. There was a large number of patients that we have, we've obviously completed enrollment. As we have said we expect around ACC to be reviewing those data publicly and obviously we'll continue to work with the FDA and they will ultimately be the one to decide when the product is approved. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Thanks to all of you for your questions and in conclusion, let me just reiterate that we're focused and consistently delivering on our three commitments mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth, double-digit constant currency EPS growth and returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders. And as I noted earlier we feel that the appropriate application of medical technology that can help address inefficiencies and improve outcomes in healthcare delivery driving new forms of value creation. With our differentiated growth platforms and leadership in the strong end markets we believe that we're well positioned to capture this to ultimately create a long term dependable value for our shareholders. With that and on behalf of our entire management team I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you in our progress on our Q2 call which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, November 22nd. Thank you all and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Weispfenning. Please go ahead. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2017 second quarter, which ended on October 28, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and the revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website investorrelations.medtronics.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 and all year-over-year growth rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis, which adjusts for the effective foreign currency. Other than is noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Good morning and thank you, Ryan and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, representing growth of 3%. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit grew 9% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.12 growing at 15% and representing EPS leverage of 1,120 basis points. Q2 revenue was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. We faced issues that affected our growth, including slower than expected revenue as we await new product introductions. Despite this revenue shortfall, we produced strong improvement in operating margins and double-digit earnings per share growth. While some of the challenges that had an impact on revenue in Q2 could persist over the coming quarters, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth not only in our current fiscal year, but on a sustained basis into the future. Now normally, the diversity of our revenue base overcomes any quarterly challenges. However, there were enough unexpected and unrelated issues in Q2 to collectively affect our revenue and each of our growth factors. Our new therapies growth vector, which contributed approximately 195 basis points to our total company growth, not only just fell below our goal of 200 to 250 basis points, but was well below our trend and expectations with the largest impacts from CVG and diabetes. In CVG, revenue growth was 3%, below our targeted high-end of the mid single-digit range and meaningfully below what we believe this business should be able to sustain. In our CRHF division, strong growth contributions from diagnostics, atrial fibrillation and our recently acquired HeartWare LVAD business were offset by weakness in our core cardiac rhythm implantables business, which declined in the low single-digits. While we continue to take share in the U.S. ICD market, the market itself declined in the mid single-digits driven by high single-digit market declines in high-power device replacements. In the UK, our implantables revenue declined in the mid-teens as the National Health Service is changing its procurement model to limit bulk purchases causing a temporary disruption to normal buying patterns of the local products. We expect these pressures in CRHF to continue through the fiscal year. Our CSH division was affected by transient market share losses due to the timing of new product cycles. For example, in the fast growing TAVR market, we lacked until recently, a large sized version of our Evolut R platform. And in drug eluting stents, our new Resolute Onyx DES is not yet available in the U.S. and Japan driving declines in those markets to competitive DES products. However, at the end of this quarter, we did receive FDA approval for Evolut R XL, which we expect to drive U.S. growth in the back half of our fiscal year. In addition, we expect the introduction of Evolut Pro and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around fiscal year end and Resolute Onyx in Japan in FY \u201818. In our APV division, solid mid single-digit growth was driven by our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloons, which continues to lead the market and drive mid-20s growth. We expect this momentum to continue in the second half of our fiscal year. Within our Diabetes Group, we were pleased with the earlier than expected FDA approval of the MiniMed 670G, which not only represents revolutionary technology toward a long-awaited closed loop insulin pump system, but also has been received with strong enthusiasm amongst the diabetes community. However, the earlier than expected approval has created a bigger than expected gap between product approval and shipment. As a result, we created a priority access program for the 630G, which offers upgrade priority to the 670G when launched. We are seeing strong demand for this program primarily from early adopters. We do expect the majority of customers to wait to purchase the 670G once it launches in the spring of 2017. In addition to this dynamic which is driving lower than expected pump and consumable sales, a portion of our 630G revenue is now deferred until receipt of the upgrade. Going forward, we expect some improved revenue growth for the remainder of this fiscal year and we expect diabetes to ultimately return to double-digit growth once the 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year. Our minimally invasive therapies group grew 4% in Q2, consistent with our goal of mid single-digit revenue growth primarily driven by our Open-to-MIS growth driver, including strong product sales of our recently launched Valleylab FT10 energy platform and continued performance of our endostapling specialty reloads. Surgical solutions came in slightly below our expectations primarily driven by the impact of competitive reprocessing of our advanced energy vessel sealing disposables in the U.S. We are confident in our ongoing strategies and new product launches that are designed to address this headwind. Looking ahead, MITG expects to launch more than 15 new products in the second half of the fiscal year to drive growth, including a new powered stapling platform called Signia and new vessel sealing enhancements. This pipeline gives us confidence that MITG can continue to grow in the mid single-digits in the back half of the fiscal year. Next, our Restorative Therapies Group grew 3% this quarter and our spine division continued to show improvement. Overall, spine growth was 1%, our strongest growth seven quarters as we gained global spine share. Our U.S. spine business grew 3% driven by continued adoption of infuse and strong adoption of our speed to scale launches and surgical synergy strategy, resulting in share gains along with sales of our navigation and imaging equipment in neurosurgery. RTG did suffer from a voluntary recall of certain neurovascular products which affected revenue. Some of these products will remain off the market in certain geographies for a period of time, but the most substantial impact of the recall is behind this as we bought back existing distributor inventory in Q2. Across all of our groups, our product pipeline remains robust. We have important new growth catalysts that we expect to lead to improved second half growth. Some of these products have already been launched and others are coming to the market in the coming months. We are confident we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies growth vector and expect to be well within our 200 to 350 basis point goal in the back half of the year and over the longer term. Next, let\u2019s turn to emerging markets, which grew 10% and contributed approximately 120 basis points to our total company growth slightly below our goal of 150 to 200 basis points. The primary driver was a shortfall in the Middle East, where our revenue declined in the mid single-digits as governments are dealing with an increased deficit, affected by declining oil prices. In Saudi Arabia, the largest market in the region and where we have a strong market leadership position, our overall business declined by approximately 40%, mostly impacting our CRHF, surgical solutions and spine divisions. We expect continued pressure in the Middle East for the remainder of the year, but we also believe that the basic demand for our critical life saving therapies will eventually rebound strongly. On the positive side, our businesses in South Asia, ASEAN, Eastern Europe and Latin America all grew in the mid teens or higher. China, our largest emerging market, grew 11%, with a double digit growth in MITG and diabetes and high single-digit growth in CVG and RTG. In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we grew again in the low-20s, with strong growth coming from key tender wins in MITG. In ASEAN, growth was broad based, with double digit growth in Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. In Eastern Europe, we grew over 20% in Russia as a result of strong momentum in CVG and MITG. Latin America also had strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina, driven in part by a new tender wins and continued channel optimization efforts. We expect current emerging market performance levels to be sustained in the back half of the year and continued to believe strongly as the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in med tech over the long-term. Turning now to our third growth factor, services and solutions, which contributed 20 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 basis points to 60 basis points, services and solutions continues to achieve solid revenue growth, mostly from CVG-related offerings. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as new models are created and expanded across all our regions. We continued to see success in our hospital solutions business, through which we provide expertise in creating operational efficiency in both cath labs and operating rooms. We are also continuing to grow our chronic care models, including Diabeter for type 1 diabetes and NOK for morbid obesity, by pursuing global expansion opportunities. And finally, we formally launched our orthopedic solutions business earlier this month, a comprehensive program to help providers meet their CGR requirements in the U.S. Before I turn the call over to Karen, let me reiterate that we are disappointed with our Q2 performance. That said, we also believe that these headwind events were largely temper in nature and we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and double digit EPS growth for the full year. What should not be lost in the discussion is that, despite revenue challenges this quarter, our organization delivered strong improvements in operating margins, including improvements in our gross margin and SG&A and met our goal of delivering double digit EPS growth. Karen will now take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter financial results. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Omar. Our second quarter revenue of $7.345 billion increased 4% as reported or 3% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency had a positive $50 million impact on second quarter revenue. And acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately 120 basis points net to revenue growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.80, non-GAAP was $1.12. After adjusting for the $0.06 impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 15%. Strong operating performance helped to offset the revenue shortfall in the quarter. And the majority of the tax benefit during the quarter was offset by a worse than expected impact of foreign exchange on earnings. In addition to the $385 million adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after tax basis were a $24 million charge for the HeartWare acquisition fair market value inventory step-up and a $35 million restructuring charge, and a $2 million charge for acquisition related items, both stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien, along with expenses related to our acquisition of, HeartWare offset by a net gain from the adjustments of our contingent consideration on prior acquisitions. Our operating margin for the quarter was 28.9% on a constant currency basis, representing a strong 150 basis point year-over-year improvement. Efficiencies in both the gross margin and SG&A largely a result of execution on our Covidien synergies drove the increase. We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings in the fiscal year and expect to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of the fiscal year \u201818. Our efforts to realize the Covidien synergies are also serving as enablers to other leverage programs designed to deliver additional long-term margin expansion. Net other expense was $89 million compared to $57 million in the prior year, reflecting about $90 million in reduced foreign exchange gains versus the prior year, primarily due to our hedging program, partially offset by a $48 million reduction in the U.S. medical device tax. While we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign exchange, FX can create modest volatility to the P&L above the operating margin line. [Technical Difficulty], a growing portion of our profits are un-hedged, especially from emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility throughout the P&L. Looking ahead, we remain committed to our plan to generate 130 basis points to 210 basis points of improvement in our operating margins this fiscal year. Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $173 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $32.4 billion in debt and $11.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 14.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast and included $42 million of operational net tax benefit, primarily related to the write-off of a deferred tax liability associated with the prior impairment of an investment in a foreign subsidiary. While we have had tax benefits in both Q1 and Q2, we continue to forecast a tax rate of approximately 17% for the second half of the fiscal year. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We are deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline, with the focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $593 million in dividends and repurchased a net $985 million of our ordinary shares in the second quarter. This represented a total payout ratio of 101% on non-GAAP net income and 142% on GAAP net income. Keep in mind our payout ratio is elevated as we not only returned 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders, but also execute on our commitment to return $5 billion through incremental share repurchases by the end of fiscal year \u201818. At quarter end, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 39 million shares. Second quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.393 billion shares. Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude with our outlook. As Omar mentioned, we continued to expect to deliver mid single-digit revenue and double digit EPS growth this fiscal year and we expect our revenue growth to improve from the disappointing growth this past quarter. However, given the issues we outlined in the second quarter, some of which could persist in the near-term, we now expect our full year revenue growth to be within the mid single-digit range on a constant currency constant weeks basis as opposed to the upper half of that range signaled previously. Moving to the back half of the fiscal year, we expect revenue growth to also be in the mid single-digit range on a constant currency basis. With regard to our business groups, we continued to expect MITG grow in the mid single-digits. And we expect RTG to grow in the low end of the mid single-digit range, ramping in the back half of the year. While we expect improvement from the headwinds faced in CVG and diabetes in the second quarter, we recognized that until some of our important new products officially launched, revenue growth is likely to continue to be affected. For that reason, in the back half of this fiscal year, we expect CVG to deliver mid single-digit and diabetes to deliver mid to high single-digit revenue growth. Keep in mind that CVG had a strong finish to last fiscal year. So, on an annual comparison basis, we expect slightly slower growth in the fourth quarter. And because we do not expect the 670G to be on the market until the end of this fiscal year, we expect growth in diabetes to ramp through the back half, with stronger growth in the fourth quarter than the third. We continue to expect diabetes to ultimately reach double-digit revenue growth as signaled in the past once the 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year. While the impacts from currency is fluid and therefore not something we predict, if current exchange rates, which included \u20ac1.6 [ph] and \u00a5110 remained stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our full year revenue to be negatively affected by approximately $20 million to $60 million, including an approximate $10 million to $30 million negative impact in the third quarter. With respect to earnings, we continue to expect double-digit EPS growth on a constant currency constant week basis for the full fiscal year. For the back half of the fiscal year, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS growth to be in the 8% to 10% range on a constant currency basis given slightly less than previously expected revenue, a more normal 17% expected tax rate and the loss of the year-over-year benefit from a lower medical device tax starting in December. Taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week in the first quarter last fiscal year as well as an estimated negative foreign currency impact to our full year EPS of $0.20 to $0.22 if current exchange rates remain stable, this EPS growth implies full year non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.55 to $4.60. Lastly, we are modifying our free cash flow outlook methodology. Recall that last quarter, we were forecasting an adjusted free cash flow of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for fiscal year \u201817, a range that would exclude cash payments related to non-GAAP items that might occur during the year. Going forward, we will include these items to more closely align our free cash flow projection with the results we report each quarter. However, in light of the unpredictability of the precise amount and timing of cash payments, we are expanding the range. Given this, along with the revenue and net income expectations already discussed, we expect our free cash flow for the fiscal year to be in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion. Now, I will return the call back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Karen. And we will open the lines for Q&A. But before we do, I wanted to reiterate what for me are the three key points about our Q2 performance. First, we are disappointed in our revenue performance this quarter. The issues that caused the shortfall are identifiable, and in many cases, temporary. As I mentioned, we have several new product introductions in the back half of the year that we expect to drive our revenue growth back to our normal range. Second, despite our revenue challenges, our organization delivered an operational discipline, including driving the expected Covidian synergies, which led to strong operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth. And third, looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth, not only in our current fiscal year, but on a sustained basis in the future. And as always, we remain focused in creating long-term dependable value for our shareholders. We will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I have asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha, President of our Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group, to join us. We want to try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question and if necessary, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question, please? Operator : The first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the questions. So, Omar, I think there is pieces of it I think that people understand the comments ranging from the diabetes business and just the impact on demand because of the timing of 670G or Saudi Arabia having a significant drop off obviously in demand. I think probably the best way to think about kind of one question investors are going to have today is on the U.S. business. And so if we looked at the U.S. growth corporate-wide on an organic basis, it\u2019s basically flat this quarter. So, I would love to hear just kind of the group\u2019s thoughts on the health of the U.S. device market and what appears to be some slowdown at least reflected in your results and some other company\u2019s results over the last quarter? Omar Ishrak : Yes. Thanks Mike. I think the primary driver for us though is the fact that the U.S. is more sensitive to new product cadence and we are big enough in the market it reflects the market up and down a little bit ourselves. And as we launch new products in the U.S., I think we will benefit accordingly. Like I mentioned earlier, in CVG, we just launched the Evolut R XL, which will contribute to U.S. growth in the second half and also the introduction of the Evolut Pro and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of the fiscal year. You mentioned diabetes, that\u2019s primarily a U.S. launch on the 670G, so that we think again will have a big impact in the market and the slowdown in diabetes was mostly in the U.S. again, which again impacted the overall market. In MITG, we are launching over 15 new products in the second half to drive growth. And in RTG, our continued drive on our speed to scale launches and so on in addition to our sales in navigation and imaging should all help the U.S. So, we think this is a lot in our own control and through successful execution of new product introductions I think will make an impact. Mike Weinstein : And Omar, if I looked at it, just \u2013 with respect just a little bit, so it\u2019s always harder to tell just on a quarter-to-quarter basis in some of the implantables businesses such as CRM, but if I look at surgical solutions, the U.S. growth in surgical solutions, which is pretty good barometer for device market growth was lighter this quarter. So, maybe just \u2013 if you just want to kind of comment on that? And then just the follow-up unrelated to the actual quarters, I know there are lot of questions coming out of the outcome of the U.S. election and the potential for corporate tax reforms. So Karen, I don\u2019t know if you have any preliminary thoughts on the potential implications of tax reform in the U.S. on the company both from a change in how tax rates are ultimately calculated and to the access to cash? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Well, there was number of points there, Mike. First, from a surgical solutions perspective, while it is a barometer in the overall market, there were greater activities than we usually have on reprocessing, which \u2013 and for which we are addressing that through some new launches in the second half, so we think that will impact the market. And again, like I said before, because we are so big in the market, it does move the overall market up and down depending on what we do. I really don\u2019t have any hard data to comment on the overall procedures that would really worry me as a big factor. I think our own performance is the bigger thing here. With respect to the other points, Mike, it\u2019s too early for me to comment on any changes and so on. I mean in the end, we go back to our universal healthcare needs, improving clinical outcomes, driving value-based healthcare, increasing access. Irrespective of the government and irrespective of the country for that matter, those are the priorities and that\u2019s what we stay focused on. I think as long as any reform focuses on that, I think it will be accepted and it will be successful. It\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s one that we must collectively address. With respect to the tax situation, again, I don\u2019t want to speculate on what may or may not happen here. But I just want to reiterate that the reason we did the Covidian acquisition was operational. It was primarily driven by market synergies and broadening of our business and the way in which we can drive healthcare. At that time, that was the best structure and we continue to believe that, that is the right way for us in getting access to our cash, which we have deployed effectively. I am just going to leave it at that. We will see how things rollout and we will kind of go from there. But like I have said many times before, we like to control the things if we can control and execute those well. The rest will happen around us and it\u2019s tough for me to speculate. Thanks. Mike Weinstein : Understood. Thank you, Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Karen Parkhill : Good morning David. David Lewis : I am sorry, can you hear me. Omar Ishrak : Sure, we can David. Go ahead. David Lewis : Thank you. Sorry about that. So I appreciate your comments about sort of the growth being in your own control and then I think investors want to hear that, but I think it\u2019s sort of undeniable in this last quarter that U.S. implanters saw 2 points of comp adjusted deceleration, so something happened in the U.S. and I think people want to just understand how much visibility you have on sort of this back half improving of about 100 basis points, so I guess the question once again is, you have a different pacing of months relative to your peers, I mean have you seen enough stability or improvement in the last couple of months to believe that whatever happen in the U.S. market here in this quarter, at least it\u2019s stable now and that\u2019s something you can sort of build upon with your new products, so I do still think there has to be some market effect here with these new products to get investors comfortable that at least the market in your mind is stable to improving? Omar Ishrak : Yes. That\u2019s a fair point, David. The only thing that we pointed out was the device replacements where we are certainly slower. But I will let Mike Coyle comment on the CRM market and I will also let Bryan comment briefly on the surgical market, because I think that\u2019s an important question you are asking, so Mike, go ahead and just answer the question directly. Mike Coyle : David, the bigger impact was in the high power segment. In fact, the pacing market was pretty much in line with what we were expecting. So the high power side of the equation, we saw a slightly lower growth in initial implants, but we are now looking at high single-digit declines in replacements for the market and that\u2019s something different than we have seen historically. As we go forward, we think that we are in a particularly impacted area for CRT and that that will get better going forward, but we also expect on the high power side for standardized CDs that there will be this replacement headwind. But it\u2019s principally coming from the fact that there was lower device implants here 5 years 7 years ago when these devices were deep within in terms of initial trajectory. But even more important impact is the lengthening life of these devices because of the improvements that we have made to the technology to extend their battery life and that will be a bit of a headwind for us going forward. But what\u2019s going to work in our favor is the pipeline. If you remember from TCT, in the first half of the year, I think across all of our businesses within CVG, I think we probably had four or five new product introductions in major geographies. That\u2019s going to be up to about 25 in the back half, with some very important ones in the device implantables area, including extending the 3T MRI, bringing the Visia AF to Japan and a large number of other ones that I mentioned at TCT and identified as being catalyst for us going forward. So I think those are going to be things that we can count on to help our share position and hopefully also help with market growth. Omar Ishrak : Bryan, a brief comment on the U.S. market? Bryan Hanson : Yes. Obviously, we are pretty focused on the same thing. We look at a number of different data points and hearing comments from folks like yourself and other businesses. And I hear some people say that things are stable and some people say it\u2019s down. I look internally first to try to get a sense and I kind of hear mix the same way. So until I see something definitive, I feel like the procedures have stayed stable from quarter-to-quarter. And even if I saw something in the quarter, unless I see a couple of quarters in a row, there is not really a solid data point there. So I haven\u2019t seen anything or feel we should redirect on volume. David Lewis : Okay. And just maybe two quick follow-ups, Omar, maybe one for Hooman and one for Karen, so Hooman just I think we all understand the disruption in light the 670G, but I think earlier on, a few months ago, there was more enthusiasm around 630G and the reward program just sort of bridge that gap and I guess the question is, did something changed in sort of your view about the receptivity of 630G and the transition of reward program, that\u2019s first question. And for Karen, can you just update us where we are on the buyback program, I think the commentary was most of that was going to get completed in the earlier part of the year, have we basically exhausted that buyback or what\u2019s remaining for the remainder of the year? Thanks so much. Hooman Hakami : Okay. David, with the 630G, your question specifically look, what I would say is, once we have this product in the hands of our sales team and in front of physicians and patients, we actually saw a good momentum with the product. Maybe just to provide a reminder, this was approved in early August. And it takes a few weeks to demo it, to get it in front of the sales team, to get it in front of physicians and that makes August for us a tough comparison. Then when we get the 670 approved, which was much earlier than expected, we implemented the priority access program. And we saw, as the commentary suggested, some good up-tick with respect to that, but primarily from early adopters. So I think if you take a look at it on balance, I think the 630, once it was in the marketplace, it performed well. I think our dynamic, which was surely U.S. based, was the fact that in less than two months, we had two major product approvals in the same geography. And there is operational transition that comes with this and there is a degree of, I would say, perhaps confusion and disruption to demand because of that and that was really the biggest catalyst. Now going forward, we still remain very excited that the enthusiasm around the 670 is great, so we think that, as the commentary suggested, we are going to ramp, but once this thing is full scale, we will return to double digit growth. Karen Parkhill : And David on the buyback comment, we have purchased 2.5 billion so far this year. We continue to remain committed to repurchasing a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow, along with that incremental $5 billion repurchase that we expect to complete over a 3-year timeframe for fiscal \u201816 to \u201818. As you do know, we typically do front end load our share buybacks not only in the fiscal year, but even this $5 billion incremental share buyback, we have tended to upload \u2013 to front load in that 3-year timeframe. We still do have some incremental buybacks to go in the second half. Some of that related to our free cash flow and some of that related to continuing to repurchase the $5 billion, but we typically do front-end load. David Lewis : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Karen Parkhill : Good morning Kristen. Kristen Stewart : Can you guys hear me? Omar Ishrak : Yes Kristen, go ahead. Kristen can\u2019t hear you any more? Kristen Stewart : Can you hear me now? Omar Ishrak : Yes. Kristen Stewart : Sorry. In light of these results, does this change your thoughts on maybe smaller incremental tuck-in acquisitions, I know you seemed pretty confident that these are more transient issues, but how are you just thinking from an M&A perspective in the market? Omar Ishrak : No, I think to some degree, we have executed well on the M&A, both small, as well as midsized tuck-in acquisitions. And they helped us actually this quarter in diversifying our revenue base and giving us a much needed boost. I think our ability to execute those is pretty good and I am thinking about those the right way. As I have said before, we are disciplined about our cash allocation and we have done a lot this year, so we are watching it very carefully. And the bar is a little high. But that\u2019s purely to do with our capital allocation, not to do with our execution or any of these market dynamics. I think in many ways, we continue to look at different opportunities. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then is there any \u2013 I don\u2019t know how large the deferral is right now, is there anything to quantify, maybe on a diabetes side, how large the deferrals are impacting that growth rate right now? Omar Ishrak : I think it\u2019s tough to quantify that. That\u2019s a portion of the drop in our growth rates in diabetes. I think the delay in actual shipment is the bigger portion, but the delay is \u2013 the deferral is only a limited amount. Kristen Stewart : Okay, perfect. Thanks very much. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Kristen. Take the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Thanks and good morning. Can you hear me, okay? Omar Ishrak : Yes, we can. Thanks Bob. Go ahead. Bob Hopkins : Good morning. So, thanks for taking the questions. I want to start out just \u2013 I think it would be helpful if you guys could try to quantify the things that you are saying were temporary or kind of one-time in nature for this fiscal second quarter, so either in aggregate or broken down by the various things that you kind of called out like the neuro recall, diabetes, the tenders, is there a way to kind of quantify that and the impact on revenue growth for Q2? Karen Parkhill : In general, I would say Bob that the headwinds that we faced in the quarter caused us to move from our typical mid single-digit growth range to the 3%. And again, we don\u2019t think that, that is something that will continue. We haave guided in the back half to go back to the mid single-digit range. Bob Hopkins : Okay. So, just as a broad comment, but no specific quantification. Okay, so the other things I wanted to just ask about real quickly was, Karen, one for you, can you just give us a sense as to the free cash flow guidance you are giving for \u201817 on an apples-to-apples basis, because I know you are changed in the way you are talking about it? So, what was it at the beginning of the year, what is it now? And then for Mike or Omar, I was wondering if you could just comment on the TAVR business, now both you and Edwards have reported numbers that were a little bit below what the Street was forecasting. Can you just comment on the state of the TAVR market? And also on the state of the U.S. ICD market like what\u2019s \u2013 I mean, things have really slowed down there. What\u2019s the sustainable growth rate in your mind at this point? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Karen, go ahead. Karen Parkhill : Yes. On free cash flow, yes, we are changing our guidance to match what our actual free cash flow is as opposed to before the one-time items that can impact the cash flow. So, our former guidance was $6.5 billion to $7 billion adjusted, not including those one-time items. And going forward as I said, we will be doing the \u2013 trying to match what our actual free cash flow is with $5 billion to $6 billion. I don\u2019t have an actual apples-to-apples because it\u2019s very difficult to predict those one-time items. But I would say that, in general, the cash flow guidance has not changed substantially, it\u2019s just that going forward we will be focused on trying to focus on the actual and that\u2019s based on feedback that we have gotten from several investors. Omar Ishrak : Mike, do you want to take the market question from cardiology? Mike Coyle : In terms of TAVR, the overall market grew around 30%. We obviously were in the high-teens sort of the story of international versus U.S. right? In the U.S., we are waiting for the 34 millimeter to impact the market. We expect to be able to then participate in the market growth that we are seeing, which we think is actually quite strong for the U.S. In terms of high power, during the quarter, it looked like market growth was on the order of down mid single-digits. We actually did a bit better than that, because of share capture. And as I mentioned, we have a pretty robust set of new products at TBT \u2013 at TCT that we expect to help us grow faster than the market. Our models would tell us things should moderate a bit relative to the replacement cycle, but a bit I mean I think we are still looking at down market in the low to mid single-digits. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Bob. Can we take the next question? Bob Hopkins : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Matt Miksic : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. So, I think we have covered a lot of the sort of top line issues in the quarter. I wanted to, Omar, ask you about something that came out of the Wheat Symposium in your presentation with the aortic and peripheral group there. Just on contracting, something you have not commented on before, the amount of sort of multi-line contracting that you have seen taken up in the U.S. and something that was presented there took that maybe a step further into introducing this idea of a warranty offer just in exchange for commitments from clients. And love if you could elaborate a little bit on that and maybe where you see if you see the application of that in other areas? And I have one follow-up. Omar Ishrak : Well, I am going to make a brief comment on this and then I will let Mike kind of comment a little further on the specifics of the example that you state. But the main overriding comment I want to make is that the example that you state is truly an example of value-based healthcare. And value-based healthcare means that we become a company who are paid for outcomes as opposed to the product itself and that\u2019s a long-term journey, but eventually, we think that that\u2019s the right thing for healthcare, that\u2019s the right thing for us. It will make us more efficient team in our R&D and we will get rewarded for what we innovate and healthcare will get the right value and in the long-term improve outcomes and lower cost. So, that model you will see us replicate in many other areas. And like I have described in the chronic care world, with the diabetes and with the NOK and we have talked a lot about our antibacterial sleeve, which also is the same kind of model. So, you will see a lot of these things from us, these value-based healthcare models and that one example that you state is only the beginning. I think our size helps us with a seat at the table to do these contracts. And so I think it will give us a differentiated advantage not only because of our size, but because of our ability to innovate and link them to outcomes. Mike, any quick specifics on the particular example at the beginning? Mike Coyle : Yes. As you mentioned, we have been attempting to drive more of our revenue into multi-line contracts and create stickiness of share versus new products coming into the market and we are now up to 38% of CVG revenue in the U.S. is tied up in multi-line contracts. So, what you have specifically identified is the trend that we are trying to basically take products where we have clearly demonstrated superior outcomes and then create performance guarantees that allow us to then do what Omar said, become a value-based healthcare company. We have done that extensively with the anti-infective envelope TYRX in the CRM business and what was being outlined by the APV team there at Wheat was really using the strong clinical evidence around Endurant, Endurant 2S to basically create performance guarantees to drive market share in that segment. Matt Miksic : That\u2019s helpful. And to follow-up just understanding the disappointing growth on the quarter for a variety of the reasons that you have talked about and has been discussed on the call. If you could maybe revisit the long-term growth this mid single-digit growth objective that you have put out there? And what the components of that are, understanding expecting an improvement in the back half, should this include \u2013 should we expect this to include, obviously, in the contribution of hardware this year, incremental other acquisitions going forward? Any thoughts on just geography and where you are with the growth rate as you have talked about? Just how do you get there and what are the components of that? That would be very helpful. Omar Ishrak : First, let me point out that we haven\u2019t come off the mid single-digit estimate for the year. We are still saying that. And this quarter is not one that we are happy with like I have said and it\u2019s not one that we are going to repeat. And so we are completely confident in our ability to drive sustained mid single-digit growth and all our strategies are aimed towards that and those strategies cover our ability to produce new products across a variety of market segments. Typically, that diversity would protect us. It just so happened this quarter that a collection of them all happened together. In addition to that, we have got geographic diversity which we are building and that\u2019s our drive towards emerging markets where we have actually even with the enormous impact in Saudi, still delivered close to \u2013 at 10% emerging market growth, short of our overall set of basis point target of 150 to 200, but one that we think will pickup over time and we want to get more to the middle of that target rather than the low end. And the services and solutions is a longer term effort, but again another one which will give us sustained growth in the long-term. So, we are deploying multiple strategies for a sustained and consistent mid single-digit growth, which employs addressing new therapies, cadence of product innovation, different market segments within that, geographic diversification, the real focus in emerging markets, and creating this new services and solutions growth vector, along the lines that you described earlier based on our value-based healthcare initiatives. Matt Miksic : And strategic investment \u2013 I am sorry to interrupt, Omar, but \u2013 and strategic investment also part of that in not one of your vectors per se, but I guess how would you think about that in terms of your growth target? Omar Ishrak : No, strategic investments would be \u2013 well, let\u2019s put it in two ways. First of all, tuck-in acquisitions, is part of our overall mid single-digit sort of targeting. And you recall that we are driving these tuck-in acquisitions where we are balancing internal costs. So, we are not changing our EPS guidance \u2013 double-digit EPS growth guidance stays the same while we do these acquisitions. So, we consider them, although acquisitions, we make internal trade-offs to fund them. So, that\u2019s the way think about those. Bigger strategic acquisitions, they are always possible like we have done in the past, but they have to drive our strategies, that actually was strategic fit that we can satisfy and quantify for ourselves before we go into that. So, that\u2019s the way we look at it. Matt Miksic : Very helpful color. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Matt. Take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. It\u2019s just starting off with the fiscal 2017 guidance I think it will be helpful if you can talk a little bit about where you would expect things to get better in the third and fourth quarters versus the second quarter, so you grew 3% constant currency this quarter, it sounds like you expect that to improve in the third quarter, is that correct and can you talk a little bit about specifically what gets better. And then on the EPS guidance, I know you don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, but typically I think the third quarter is about $0.03 higher than the second quarter, do you expect that to be the case this year? Omar Ishrak : Let me take the revenue question. We were pretty clear in the sense that there is a whole series of new product launches that will come in the back half, all the way from TAVR to the \u2013 towards the end of the fiscal year, the Resolute Onyx. We have got 15 new product introductions in surgical solutions. We will address the reprocessing. And most importantly, we have got the 670G, which we will launch towards the end of the fiscal year and we expect a ramp up in growth as the next two quarters go by. So we do think that a significant shift in our new product cadence will give us enough growth to take us well in the single digit range in the back half. And also we haven\u2019t talked much about it, but the improvement in spine and the RTG growth starts to move up the mid single-digit range, which it wasn\u2019t before, so all of these are the main factors. To be clear look, we stated that the device replacement market in ICDs will continue to slow. We are not expecting that to turnaround. We expect the NHS and the buying patterns in the UK to remain slow for the remainder of the year. We expect the Middle East to remain where it is. So we are going to say that those market trends will continue. The rest are all new product related and our cadence will address it. I think that\u2019s the brunt of it. Karen Parkhill : And I would just add because you are asking about quarterly gating, too. For CVG in particular, we do expect a little bit stronger growth rate in the third quarter than the fourth quarter just given a very strong finish at the end of the year for that business. And as I mentioned, in RTG, because of the product introduction, we do expect that to ramp up through the back half from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, same with diabetes, a ramp up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. In terms of EPS, it\u2019s typically flat, so there is not a big difference that you had mentioned in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And we don\u2019t particularly give guidance. Larry Biegelsen : Understood. But just to be clear, do you expect to be in the mid single-digit range in fiscal Q3. And just lastly, given the results this quarter, how do you feel about the long-term operating margin goals, you provided at the Analyst Meeting this past June? Thanks for taking my questions. Omar Ishrak : First, we expect to be in the mid single-digit in the back half and in the early part of the \u2013 in Q3 as well and I think we stated that. Look, I will state it again. We don\u2019t want to make a habit of missing the mid single-digit goal even in the quarter and I am extremely focused on that and one that we will address. So our mid single-digit goal is one that certainly for the year is still valid and one that we expect to get back during the second half of the year. In terms of the operating margin, I mean that was one of the positives of this quarter that we did deliver a strong operating margin improvement, 150 basis points of constant currency improvement. We are on track. Our synergies are coming up. Our value capture programs are all delivering. Our gross margins actually are in line with what we expect. So we are certainly still think with what we presented at the Analyst Conference in terms of our operating margin enhancements and I think this quarter is a signal that we in fact can execute towards that. No, we are going to do that in future quarters, but that\u2019s the way we see it right now. Karen Parkhill : And we have talked about that operating leverage improving throughout the year. So in the first quarter, we had 100 basis points improvement, second quarter, 150 basis points and we expect it to continue to get a little bit better from here. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions guys. Omar Ishrak : Thanks. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Raj Denhoy : Hi, good morning. I wonder if I could ask a little bit about the idea of growth accelerating again towards the back half, I know it\u2019s been covered quite a bit, but part of what potentially we are seeing though is that as some of these product cycles wane and some of your competitors launch sort of responsive products, the question is really, is what\u2019s your bringing enough to replace what is sort of waning and is it really just a situation where perhaps, the better parts of some of these businesses may be behind you for a period of time? Omar Ishrak : No, we don\u2019t think so. I think you just got to look at the product case and I mean if I take that bit, for example, I mean clearly, that\u2019s a revolutionary new product which didn\u2019t hit the market at all and we think the benefits of that are yet to come. I mean that\u2019s a clear example of a breakthrough product line. And then I think in both CVG and in MITG and certainly in RTG, in all our product segments, I mean these are strong products, stuff that we are doing with in the transcatheter market are significant enhancements that due to what we had before and we expect traction on those. So we think our product pipeline is robust. We described that in the Analyst Meeting. We haven\u2019t come off any of that. Our feeling about their impact is no less than what it was then. It\u2019s just so happened that the timing of these launches, coupled with some really severe market headwinds, all at the same time, just kind of \u2013 those are concurrence of these events in one quarter and we expect that, that sort of collection of circumstances not to repeat. And we think that the new products, the robustness of our pipeline will come through and we will get the appropriate benefits. So our excitement around new products is not \u2013 and our confidence has not been shaken at all as to their viability and what they can do to the market and to patients. Raj Denhoy : Fair enough. And then maybe just one quick one on the new orthopedic offering, which you gave a little more detail around, perhaps you could just help us understand or frame the opportunity in terms of what you expect from that, because there are sort of two pieces to it right, there is the consulting services, but then there is also the unique aspect of bringing in orthopedic, knee line in the market and so maybe if you can give us some high level thoughts on how you think that business will start to contribute over the next couple of years? Omar Ishrak : I think I am actually going to let Geoff is going to \u2013 why don\u2019t you go ahead Geoff, with some color on that? Geoff Martha : Yes, sure. Raj, we are right now, obviously, this is new for us and we haven\u2019t even \u2013 we don\u2019t have a scalable amount of the need to sell quite yet. So the early interest that we are seeing is strong from surgeons that have skin in the game and we are seeing demand, that\u2019s for the knee. And then for hospitals, there is a lot of interest around these. We are sharing partnerships, but it\u2019s new to them and these are complex agreements that\u2019s taking a little bit more time, but we are feeling bullish about this. But we haven\u2019t provided any specific guidance yet because it is so new, the concept, right. You have got these risk bearing partnerships and that\u2019s really the centerpiece of the offering. And it\u2019s very difficult to forecast the speed of the ramp and so we haven\u2019t provided any guidance. I will just tell you that we are still feeling \u2013 we are happy with the response we are getting and we are still feeling positive about it, both the risk bearing partnership component, which is the centerpiece and then the underlying technologies, the [indiscernible] technology that we saw in our advanced energy business, as well as the new implants, the knee and down the road to hip. Raj Denhoy : Great. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Raj. We will go to the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Omar, I was hoping you could help us out thinking into calendar \u201817, there has been some concerns with Trump being elected and a threat of an ACA repeal that volumes could suffer as there is either a transition or a formal repeal of the Affordable Care Act, can you help us think about that. And in the setting of the fiscal Q2 performance, the organic growth in the first half has been challenged and was just \u2013 one of the leverage you guys haven\u2019t pulled is pruning post the Covidien acquisition, any thoughts there in terms of accelerating that process or that initiative? Omar Ishrak : Well, let me take those questions one at a time. First of all, with respect to the healthcare policy again, I don\u2019t want to speculate as to what\u2019s going to happen here, but what I do know, which I have stated consistently in the past, is that a move towards value based healthcare, a move towards a regime where the entire healthcare market gets rewarded for producing better outcomes will not only lower costs, but that\u2019s the only way forward. And it doesn\u2019t really matter which administration is in place or in which country you are in. That is a basic fact garnered in logic. And I think focus around that will prevail and I think that will be important in any future policies that are made and there is an alignment of stakeholders pushing in that direction. With respect to the pruning, look \u2013 we look at divestitures and acquisitions with the same lens. Does it fit our strategy? Can we win in that marketplace? Can we \u2013 do our financial metrics of returning 50% back to the shareholders and then growing mid single-digits and double-digit EPS growth? I mean, do those financial metrics, are they in line with that acquisition or not or divestiture or not? And based on those factors, we make decisions. And certainly, we are looking at different areas of our business all the time and you should expect to get periodic updates from us on that score. Did I miss any point? Josh Jennings : No. Thanks for that. If I could just ask one for Karen, just on looking out into next year, I know it\u2019s impossible to predict currency moves. But if the currency rates would remain constant here, can you help us understand whether there would be a headwind or tailwind in terms of hedging gains or losses in fiscal \u201818? And just the reason I am asking is because we do have the medical device tax benefit rolling off next year starting in fiscal 2Q. So, I just wanted to get a sense of when the reported operating margin would more closely mirror the constant currency operating margin performance? Thanks a lot. Karen Parkhill : Yes, no, happy to take that. So what I mentioned is, we certainly can\u2019t predict exchange rates, but if they do remain stable where they are today and two of the biggest rates that we are exposed to are the euro and the yen. So if they remain stable to about \u20ac1.06 [ph] and \u00a5110 for the remainder of the fiscal year, I mentioned we would expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million to $60 million. And on an EPS basis and this takes into account our hedging program too, it\u2019s not just our natural exposure. And on an EPS basis, we would expect full year EPS to be $0.20 to $0.22 impacted and we will give guidance for FY \u201818 when we typically do at a later date. Omar Ishrak : Great. Thanks, Josh. Let\u2019s take one more question. Got time for one more. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Thanks, guys for squeezing me in. One for Mike and then a quick one for Karen. Mike, your U.S. TAVR share is down about 10 points by our math over the past year. That\u2019s a pretty big shift. How much of that do you think was the lack of a large Annulus product? And are you seeing in just the couple of weeks here since the approval a noticeable pickup in those cases? Mike Coyle : The vast majority of that share decline is in that segment. We would estimate it represents about 25% to 30% of the overall market and our shares there were substantially lower than in the other three sides. So, as we bring that in we would expect it to normalize those shares and grow above the market as we do. Chris Pasquale : Okay. And then Karen, tax has been a pretty meaningful source of upside over the past couple of quarters. You mentioned you expect it to go back up to about 17% in the back half of the year. Just walk through why that is? Why that shouldn\u2019t stay at the rates we have seen the last couple of quarters? Karen Parkhill : Yes. It\u2019s very difficult to predict the one-time benefits that we would get in tax. They are spotty. They tend to be large. They impacted us positively this quarter. But we can\u2019t count on them all the time and so that\u2019s why we focus on our more normal 17% tax rate going forward. Chris Pasquale : Okay, thanks. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Chris. Okay. So with that, it\u2019s time to end the call. But before I finish, I have to repeat the three main points about this call and about our performance and outlook. Like I have said several times, we are not happy about the revenue performance this quarter, but we do think that the shortfall, the reasons of the shortfall are identifiable and in most cases temporary and we expect our new product introductions primarily to drive a recovery in the back half of the year and in longer term. Second, look, please acknowledge \u2013 we acknowledge the fact that our organization delivered an operational discipline and delivered strong operating margin and double-digit EPS growth this quarter. And finally, we remain confident in our overall strategy that we laid out in our Analyst Meeting, double-digit \u2013 mid single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth on a constant currency basis, not only this fiscal year, but sustained into the future, and that is something that we are certainly not coming off. Okay. So with that, I would like to thank you all for your interest and your questions. And on behalf of our entire management team, also thank you for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. And for those of you in the U.S., I want to wish you and your families a very happy Thanksgiving. And we look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q3 call, which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, February 21. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thank you, Paula. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2017 third quarter, which ended on January 27, 2017. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. First, a few additional comments, earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 and all year-over-year growth rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis. Other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with the earnings press release. With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar? Omar S. Ishrak: Good morning and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning we reported third quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, representing growth of 6%. Q3 non-GAAP operating profit grew 10% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share or $1.12 growing at 10% and representing EPS leverage of 480 basis points. In Q3, we achieved solid results across all of our groups with mid single-digit growth in CVG, MITG and RTG and high single-digit growth in diabetes. Geographically, we also demonstrated solid performance with mid single-digit growth in the U.S., high single-digit growth in the non-U.S. developed markets including Western Europe and Japan and double-digit growth in emerging markets. At the same time, we delivered meaningful operating profit growth, executing on our synergy programs from the Covidien integration and our operating excellence initiatives. Our revenue and operating profit growth resulted in continued strong free cash flow. As stated before, we expect to deploy this capital by balancing returns to shareholders with disciplined reinvestment in our business. We remain confident in our ability to deliver mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth and double-digit constant currency EPS growth, not only in our current fiscal year but also into the future. Our solid revenue performance resulted from crisp execution on our three growth strategies. Therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. These strategies are designed to create competitive advantages for Medtronic by capitalizing on the long-term trends playing out in health care, namely the continued desire to improve clinical outcomes, the growing demand for expanded access to care and the optimization of cost and efficiency within the healthcare systems. When combined with the demographics of an aging population, they produce secular growth tailwinds that we believe will create sustained long-term opportunities for Medtronic. Now let's discuss each of our growth strategies. In therapy innovation, we are seeing strong adoption of our innovative new products across all our businesses. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 6%, our new therapies are helping to create important rapidly growing MedTech markets such as LVAD, TAVR, drug-coated balloons, AF ablation, and insertable diagnostics. At the same time, our innovations are driving share growth in some of our base businesses. In cardiac rhythm implantables, we believe we are capturing share as a result of our differentiated 3T MRI technology, our unique diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms and our proprietary TYRX anti-infection envelope. In TAVR, we had strong growth both sequentially and year over year on the launch of the Evolut R 34-millimeter valve. Looking ahead, we expect to present our SURTAVI data at ACC next month which we will use to support our submission for TAVR indication expansion into the U.S. intermediate risk population. In coronary, we are anticipating FDA approval of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent around fiscal year end which we expect will turn the mid-20s U.S. DES sales declines into meaningful growth for FY 2018. And in cardiac rhythm implantables, we expect the recent CMS reimbursement coverage for Micra, the world's smallest pacemaker, to accelerate our sales in the U.S., driving both pacemaker market growth and share capture. In our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which also grew 6%, we had strong high single-digit growth in surgical solutions as we focus on moving surgical procedures from open to minimally invasive, driven by our ongoing new project launches in Advanced Energy and Advanced Stapling. While we continue to experience some pressure from reprocessing in Advanced Energy, it has been tempered by the launch of additional LigaSure instruments as well as the continued rollout of our Valleylab FT10 energy platform. In Advanced Stapling, Q3 results were driven by the continued adoption of our endo stapling specialty reloads. To drive growth going forward, we just announced the launch of Signia, our powered surgical stapler, representing a major advance in stapling technology by providing surgeons with real-time feedback on tissue variability, coupled with automated response by adjusting the stapler's speed. In our Patient Monitoring & Recovery division, we not only had solid growth from the continued adoption of the PB980 Ventilator and the strength of our Nellcor pulse oximetry product but also benefited from the Bellco acquisition with growth in dialyzers and other consumables. Our Restorative Therapies Group grew 4% this quarter with strong contributions from our Spine, Brain and Specialty Therapies division. Our Spine division again showed improvement, growing 3%, the strongest rate in over seven years as we continue to gain share. The improvement is being driven by an initiative we first told you about on our earnings call a year ago called speed to scale which involves faster innovation cycles and launching a steady cadence of new products at scale with sets immediately available for the entire market. We're also seeing success in our surgical synergies strategy, resulting in spine implant growth in conjunction with strong sales of our navigation and imaging equipment in neurosurgery. Neurovascular also had a solid Q3, growing 13%, driven by strong performance in floor diversion and coils. As we forecasted, our pain therapies business results are still declining. However, we were pleased by the initial physician enthusiasm with our new Evolve Workflow which balances high dose and low dose settings for spinal cord stimulation. We're also expecting approval of our next-generation spinal cord stimulator, the INTELLIS system in the first half of the next fiscal year. We expect INTELLIS to be the smallest rechargeable spinal cord stimulator on the market. Turning to our Diabetes Group, which grew 7%, we had strong sequential improvement in our U.S. business with our highest insulin pump growth in 10 quarters. We're capturing share and experiencing strong U.S. clinician and consumer demand for our 6 Series pumps through purchases of the innovative MiniMed 630G insulin pump system as well as enrollment in the MiniMed 670G Priority Access Program. This program gives users first in line access to our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system when it begins to ship this spring. While difficult to predict, it is worth noting that our Diabetes growth could slow somewhat in Q4 due to postponed purchases as we get closer to the full launch of the MiniMed 670G. As mentioned last quarter, we do expect Diabetes to deliver double-digit growth next fiscal year once the MiniMed 670G is fully launched. Our product pipeline remains robust across all our groups. We have a number of important near-term growth catalysts as well as a deep pipeline of innovation that we expect to bring to market through the balance of the decade. We remain confident that our new therapies can drive sustainable growth both over the coming quarters and over the long term. Next let's turn to globalization. Emerging markets grew 11%. We continue to make progress in structuring both public and private partnerships aimed at rapidly increasing patient access, as well as our ongoing efforts to optimize our distribution channels. We feel that these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. The Middle East macroeconomic environment challenges persisted in Q3, and our revenue declined in the low single digits. In Saudi Arabia, our largest market in the region, revenue continued to decline on a year-over-year basis, although we saw some sequential improvement. That said, we had strong results in other parts of the world. China, Latin America, and Eastern Europe showed sustained strength, growing in the mid-teens or higher. In China, our largest emerging market, we grew in the mid-teens with MITG in the low 20s on the strength of our Advanced Stapling platform and CVG in the double digits as we capitalized on our market development efforts in private hospitals and Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Latin America had mid-20s growth, driven by key tender wins and channel optimization programs, specifically in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. Eastern Europe also grew in the mid-teens with strength in Russia, where we started shipping our coronary stents and balloons as part of the public partnership agreement we reached last year. Overall, the consistency of our emerging markets performance benefits strongly from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in MedTech over the long-term. Turning now to our third strategy, economic value, we continue to see success in our Hospital Solutions business, which grew in the high teens. Hospital Solutions delivers annuity revenue. We are providing expertise and creating efficiency in managing cath labs and operating rooms for more than 100 customers. We continue to expand our Hospital Solutions offerings globally beyond Europe, with 30 accounts now in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Canada. It is also worth noting that in Q3, we signed our first U.S. contract with University Hospitals of Cleveland. We continue to grow our chronic care management business models, including Diabeter for Type 1 diabetes and NOK for morbid obesity. We're aggressively pursuing global expansion opportunities for each of these unique value-based healthcare businesses. While we are still early in the journey to value-based healthcare, we remain focused on fully understanding and leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and patient outcomes over volume. As always, we expect to do this in a way that creates value for healthcare systems as well as for our shareholders. With that, let me ask Karen to now take you through a more detailed look at the drivers for our third quarter financial results. Karen? Karen L. Parkhill: Thank you, Omar. Our third quarter revenue of $7.283 billion increased 5% as reported or 6% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency exchange had a negative $40 million impact on third quarter revenue, and acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately 150 basis points net to revenue growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.59. Non-GAAP was $1.12. After adjusting for the $0.05 impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 10%. Our operating margin for the quarter was 29.1% on a constant currency basis, representing a strong 130 basis point year-over-year improvement. With the impact of currency included, our third quarter operating margin also improved, increasing by 40 basis points year over year. And we continue to cover the earnings dilution from our recent acquisitions, which means we maintain operating profit expectations while realizing the incremental acquisition revenue. Taking into account acquisitions that we have done in the past year, our operating margin improvement on an organic basis would have been approximately 170 basis points in the quarter. This meaningful margin improvement was driven in part by efficiencies in SG&A, as we continue to deliver on our Covidien synergies. It is worth noting that our extensive effort to move Covidien onto Medtronic's global ERP system is underway and meeting our expectations. As we have outlined, this activity is an enabler, driving a portion of the cost savings we expect to realize in the latter half of the synergy period. We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings this fiscal year and expect to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of fiscal year 2018. Beyond our integration efforts, we will remain focused on driving additional operating excellence initiatives to deliver continued margin improvement. Net other expense was $46 million compared to $9 million in the prior year, due in large part to lower net gains from our foreign exchange hedging program. Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $180 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had $32.1 billion in debt and $11.5 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 17%, in line with our expectation for the second half of the fiscal year. Free cash flow was $1.8 billion. We paid $590 million in dividends and repurchased a net $566 million of our ordinary shares in the third quarter. This represented a total payout of 74% on non-GAAP net income and 141% on GAAP net income. Keep in mind, our payout ratio is elevated, as we have been continuing to not only return 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders but also execute the $5 billion incremental share repurchase commitment we made through fiscal year 2018. We did accelerate our share repurchase activity by shifting the vast majority of the remaining activity for the fiscal year into the third quarter given our share price. Third quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.383 billion shares. Regarding our dispute with the IRS related to Puerto Rico transfer pricing, the tax court issued their final ruling late last month. Under the terms of the decision, we would experience an increase to our annual accessible cash generation of approximately $225 million as well as the movement of approximately $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet from trapped to accessible. The decision could be appealed. But if it is not, we could begin to see movement of a portion of the trapped cash in fiscal year 2018. As previously stated, we intend to use the cash released to pay down our debt. Second to our dividend, debt paydown remains a near-term capital allocation priority, as we remain committed to a strong balance sheet and target an A credit profile. We also expect to maintain our disciplined approach to pursue value-creating tuck-in acquisitions. And of course, share repurchase is another tool we will continue to employ to provide meaningful return to shareholders when our cash flows and business reinvestment priorities allow. Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude with our revenue outlook, EPS guidance, and free cash flow outlook, which has not changed for the full fiscal year. Consistent with our long-range expectations, we continue to expect full-year revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit range and EPS growth to be in double digits, both on a constant currency constant weeks basis. For the final quarter of the year, we expect revenue growth to be in the lower half of the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis. This is solid growth, especially when you consider the strong 6% constant currency growth we delivered in the fourth quarter last year. We expect both CVG and MITG to grow in the mid-single digits. However, keep in mind that CVG had a particularly strong fourth quarter last year with peak levels of customer bulk purchases of cardiac rhythm implantables, which we do not expect to repeat. And MITG will no longer benefit from the inorganic revenue contribution of the Bellco acquisition, starting in the fourth quarter. We expect RTG to grow in the low end of the mid-single-digit range, consistent with the third quarter. And we expect diabetes to grow in the mid to high single digits with a potential for postponed purchases that Omar mentioned earlier. While the impact from currency is fluid and therefore not something we predict, if current exchange rates, which include $1.06/euro and \u00a5113/dollar remain stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be negatively affected by an estimated $20 million to $40 million and EPS by an approximate negative $0.05. Regarding cash flow, we continue to expect our free cash flow for the fiscal year to be in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion. While we intend to give our fiscal year 2018 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in May, it is worth nothing that if current exchange rates remain stable through next fiscal year, we would expect fiscal year 2018 revenue to be negatively affected by approximately $100 million to $300 million, an improvement from the update we gave in January. Given this improvement, we would now expect the FX impact on fiscal year 2018 EPS to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.15, again, if current exchange rates remain stable through next fiscal year. Now I will turn the call back to Omar. Omar S. Ishrak: Thanks, Karen. To conclude, Q3 was a solid quarter, and I was pleased by the revenue growth and sequential improvement in our groups and regions. Along with revenue growth, our organization delivered meaningful operating margin improvement and double-digit constant currency EPS growth as well as growth in free cash flow. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth and double-digit constant currency EPS growth, not only in our current fiscal year but also into the future. With our differentiated growth platforms, leadership in strong end markets and disciplined capital allocation, we believe we are well positioned to create long-term dependable value for our shareholders. We will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of CVG; Bryan Hanson, President of MITG; Geoff Martha, President of the RTG; Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group, to join us. We want to try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question, and if necessary, any related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please? Operator : Your first question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just a quick one for Karen, just on the topic of the IRS transfer pricing dispute. With the change \u2013 I guess with the increase in cash and the movement of trapped debt, what does that also do to the tax rate longer term? Karen L. Parkhill: Yes, it doesn't really impact the tax rate longer term. We continue to expect a 17% cash tax rate, both for the rest of this fiscal year and likely going forward. Kristen Stewart : Okay, perfect. And then just a bigger picture question for you, Omar. If there had been some conjecture during the quarter just in terms of the medical supplies business, maybe if you could just \u2013 from a bigger picture perspective, just talk about now that we're two years past the anniversary of Covidien, maybe just talk more broadly about how the acquisition has gone, and just generally, if there are some assets that may be better monetized outside of the portfolio, whether it's with Covidien or just looking at the whole portfolio and just your thoughts on how that's added value to Medtronic. Thanks. Omar S. Ishrak: Well, firstly, we are, as I've noted several times before, quite pleased with the way the Covidien acquisition has gone through. It's been a very complex transaction as you know. It's one of the biggest in medical devices, perhaps the biggest. And we've now into year three of our integration process. And we've done it exactly the way we planned it. We're preserving our revenue, optimizing our costs and beginning to transfer healthcare through this process. And employee satisfaction ratings are high. We've had good retention ratings. So we've really hit all the strategic and tactical objectives of the Covidien acquisition, and we continue to do so. We've still got a year more to go, and as Karen outlined, we're optimistic about the rest of the integration. I'm not going to speculate on the future of specific products and businesses. What I will say is that, as part of good portfolio management, we ask a series of questions. What value does Medtronic add to that product or business? What value does that product or business add to Medtronic overall? And is the business appropriately resourced, given Medtronic's overall priorities? We look at these questions across all our portfolio and we will take action both in terms of divestitures and acquisitions on that basis. I think that's the best way to comment on this subject, Kristen. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Thanks very much. Omar S. Ishrak: Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Kristen. Paula, can we take the next question please? Operator : Yes, your next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Michael Weinstein : Thanks, and good morning, everybody. Let me start, Omar, with your comments where effectively you reiterated the outlook that you gave back last June at the Analyst Meeting. You said we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth and double-digit constant currency EPS growth, not only in the current fiscal year but also into the future. And I think I want to draw attention to that because obviously that's an important statement. I think on the back of last quarter and the lowering of FY 2017 guidance, I think the confidence in the LRP had waned on the Street. So could you just spend a few minutes, and Karen chime in here, on why you're still confident in, not only the mid single-digit top line, I think where the Street has always struggled, has been on the margin expansion piece, the ability to go after the significant margin opportunity that you've talked about and deliver double-digit EPS growth over the next several years? Thanks. Omar S. Ishrak: First of all, from the mid single-digit growth, we've stated in our Q2 call that a lot of that was a result of some unrelated market factors, some of which still persist, but also related to the timing of some of our new product launches, which are now playing through as expected. So the mid single-digit revenue growth is more or less in line with what we'd always projected on a yearly basis, and we have every expectation to maintain that into the future. In terms of the operating margin rate, we're delivering according to what we talked about, including acquisitions for that matter in terms of the operating margin rate. We still have a year's more of Covidien synergies to deliver on. And like I stated at the Analyst Meeting and subsequently, we're using that opportunity to build a structure through which we can look at other opportunities throughout the company as we leverage our scale, starting with the consolidation of several manufacturing operation plants, reducing that from over 100 to something between 50 and 60. If you do the math on all of that plus centralizing some of our support functions and comparing it against industry benchmarks for the size of business that we are, we get to a number that we talked about at the Analyst Meeting. So nothing fundamentally has changed from that. Karen? No? Okay. Michael Weinstein : And maybe I'll bring Karen in. So, Karen, as you've had a year now or coming up a year to get further into the business and to get your own arms around the numbers, your confidence in the ability to go after what was 500 basis points to 650 basis points of margin expansion over a five-year period, that number at this point appears achievable or reasonable to you? Karen L. Parkhill: Mike, we remain focused on delivering on our commitment of double-digit EPS growth, and there's no way that we can get there without meaningful margin improvement. So we are focused on it, and we have plans in place in the near-term around Covidien synergies and then beyond Covidien synergies in the longer-term to continue on that effort. Michael Weinstein : Okay. Perfect. I'll let some others jump in. Thank you, guys. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Mike. Omar S. Ishrak: Thanks, Mike. Ryan Weispfenning : Paula, next question? Operator : Your next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. David R. Lewis: Good morning. Let me start, Omar, with you and then move on to Karen. Omar, we've seen some recovery in the U.S. businesses of many of your peers this quarter. Your U.S. business this quarter was really stable on a comp adjusted basis, no material improvement, but your ex-U.S. business was much stronger than we thought. Could you just walk us through sort of U.S., ex-U.S. dynamics this quarter and how you see the future unfolding? Omar S. Ishrak: We felt pretty good about our U.S. business. We've had some significant product launches which sequentially for us has made a big difference, and those are progressing on plan. We also see new products coming out into the fourth quarter, into early next year in several areas across the board from CVG, diabetes, MITG and RTG which we think will sustain that growth, and the U.S. is most sensitive to growth as new products are launched because that's usually where they're accepted first. Outside the U.S., we've done well. I think Europe continues to grow in a consistent fashion. I think some of our Hospital Solutions effort, although the Hospital Solutions represents a relatively small portion of our overall business, it does drive meaningful share and performance on those accounts. And outside of Western Europe, I think, let me just reemphasize that our strategy of consistent strategy of focus in emerging markets, of building both private and public partnerships and optimizing our channels is resulting in sustained growth. And we've been through several macroeconomic related market fluctuations in many geographics and still delivered double-digit emerging markets revenue growth. And I think we have plans in place to sustain that. So I think that's really all I can say, a repeat of perhaps what I said in the commentary. Karen L. Parkhill: And, David, I would just add, you had mentioned U.S. growth being stable. In the third quarter with U.S. growth at 3.5%, that represented a meaningful improvement over the last couple of quarters. David R. Lewis: Sure. Yeah, Karen, I just meant stable on a comp adjusted basis. Sorry if I was being confusing. So looked stable to us around 30 basis points improvement comp adjusted versus the optical acceleration, but thank you. And then quick question for you, Karen. You've been very clear on Puerto Rico. That cash is going to be used to pay down debt. I know we're not going to get you to talk about what's being divested or could be divested. But to the extent that we see a material divestment in fiscal 2018, are you committed to using the proceeds of that divestiture to repurchase shares to offset dilution? Or is there a chance that you still would use that cash to further pay down debt? Thanks so much. Karen L. Parkhill: Yeah, I can't speculate on anything potential in the future because any potential cash inflow will depend on the circumstances and the timing unique to that situation. But just to reiterate our capital allocation philosophy in general, we do remain focused on both reinvestment and return to our shareholders. I did note around the Puerto Rico proceeds that debt paydown does remain a near-term priority, but we will also continue to focus on acquisition strategy and to allocate additional resources to share repurchase when appropriate. David R. Lewis: Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, David. Paula, next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Hi. Thanks, and good morning. Can you hear me okay? Omar S. Ishrak: Yes. Bob Hopkins : Great, great. Good morning. So congrats on a solid revenue growth quarter in Q3 here. I just wanted to kind of get a little bit better sense for the drivers of that growth. So maybe broadly speaking, can you just talk about \u2013 was the strength sort of balanced across the months of the quarter? Can you talk about the environment for surgical procedure volumes? I'm trying to get a sense for the degree to which this was kind of Medtronic execution versus a positive environment and just sort of what happened over the course of the quarter. Thanks. Omar S. Ishrak: I think the new product launches that we had planned for this time in the quarter had a meaningful impact, especially sequentially and we stated that before. I think the market conditions weren't that different. We still had macroeconomic issues in the Middle East. And at the same time, the U.S. overall procedural volume remained more or less stable. However, as I noted earlier as you introduce new products, the U.S. gets the biggest benefit and then we realize that. In terms of new products, just to be specific, at CVG we launched Evolut R 34-millimeter CoreValve, and that really contributed to its growth. We really expect some continuance of this as we introduce the Evolut Pro and the Resolute Onyx in the U.S. towards the fiscal year end. We also achieved Micra reimbursement, which was significant. That's the small pacemaker. In MITG, we've launched over 50 new products in the second half of FY 2017 to drive growth. And as I mentioned, in RTG with our consistent level of launches and the speed to scale methodology that Geoff has introduced, we are really beginning to see some benefits of that. So these things put together \u2013 and obviously the traction on the diabetes 6 Series pump, right now with the 630G which if you recall, in Q2, we barely launched and really hadn't started selling. So that has gained some traction, and our Priority Access Program is also getting a good degree of interest for the 670G. So you put all that together, those are meaningful set of product launches. And what we're really excited about is that we expect that momentum to continue in terms of product launches in Q4 and have a good pipeline into next year. So I think that's the best way to think about the differences. Bob Hopkins : Great, thank you. I appreciate that. And then just quickly for Karen, can you give us some quick thoughts on the accounting changes you'll be implementing at the beginning of fiscal 2018? How much does that add to earnings? And do you have any preliminary thoughts on the impact of tax reform and what that means for Medtronic? Thank you. Karen L. Parkhill: Yes, if you're talking about the accounting change around stock compensation... Bob Hopkins : Right. Karen L. Parkhill: ...we will be implementing that next year. The impact would be very dependent on stock price and option exercise, so very difficult to tell. But it will be part of our overall tax planning for next year. So I wouldn't expect any positive or negative from that to fall to the bottom line. In terms of tax reform, we outlined at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference the fact that if we look at the overall Republican blueprint, which has the most detail but still not enough detail to really assess the impact out there, we do think that we would benefit slightly from that blueprint and benefit in the near term on just tax rate. In the longer term, it could be a slight detriment as interest deduction on debt going forward may no longer apply. But the biggest benefit to us, as we talked about at the conference, would be the potential repatriation of our cash. Today, we have about 55% accessibility to our ongoing cash that we generate. And if we were able to have 100% accessibility, that would be meaningful to us. Just for this fiscal year alone, that could be another approximately $2.5 billion of cash accessible. And obviously, we anticipate growing our cash every year, so that could be very meaningful. Bob Hopkins : Thanks very much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Bob. Paula, next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Danielle J. Antalffy: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on a great rebound this quarter. I just wanted to follow up on some of the revenue commentary. As we look into fiscal 2018 and you do have some incremental headwinds coming online. You guys have been very transparent about the replacement headwind for your high-power devices. You've got some competitors coming on the MRI/CT side as well, persistent competitive headwinds in spinal cord stimulation. You've got another transcatheter heart valve coming in the U.S. Can you talk about how you're thinking about what the drivers will be to manage through those headwinds and keep you guys at that mid-single-digit top line growth trajectory? Omar S. Ishrak: You've got to understand that, while there is competitive new product activity, we also have new product activity. We've used our lead, for example, in the cardiac MRI space by launching differentiated products in cardiac rhythm implantables. We've got approval now for 3T MRI, which our competitors don't. We've got a series of new algorithms in our cardiac rhythm implantable products that again are unique and differentiated. We've got the Micra, the smallest pacemaker, which no one else has and recently got reimbursement and only beginning its growth trajectory. So just in the cardiac rhythm space, we've got ammunition too against our competitors. Now it will have to play out in the marketplace, and we certainly don't take our competition lightly, but we're not exactly sitting still. In the transcatheter valve area, again, there is new competition, but we just came out with our second or third generation of these valves, building on the live clinical experience that we've built over the past two years in that space. So again, product launches coming out towards the end of this fiscal year and well into next year. In diabetes, we have the 670G hybrid closed loop system, which we think in FY 2018 will gain full traction and will be a meaningful growth driver for Medtronic into next year. Recall that this is a unique hybrid closed-loop pump product, which in many ways promises to be revolutionary in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes patients. And again, we've barely \u2013 we haven't really benefited from that successful approval in the middle of last year. And then in the neuro space, there is significant competition and we've got our work cut out for us there, but we are also launching products. We just talked about the Evolve Workflow that we just launched which has got good physician enthusiasm, which we are just beginning to get traction on. We've got INTELLIS implantable neurostimulators, which are the smallest stimulators there are in the market, which again, will have an impact. In MITG, a series of new launches, led by the LigaSure instruments, our stapling products, all of this put together with a cadence of launches, like I said earlier, about 15 new launches in MITG in the second half of this year alone. That's a pretty big list which is broad and diverse. Danielle J. Antalffy: Yes, I know. Omar S. Ishrak: And we expect this will make a difference. Danielle J. Antalffy: That's very helpful, Omar. And I guess just following up on that, you've broken out what you expect in new products, growth factors you contribute. Should we still be thinking about that as contributing what it has in the past, or do you think that's going to be a bigger contributor going forward because of all that you just listed? Omar S. Ishrak: No, I think our growth efforts are to some degree diversified, although the new product segment or the new therapy segment is the biggest portion of our growth. We've talked before about new therapies contributing something like between 200 to 250 basis points of growth for Medtronic every year, and that remains on track. In addition to that, we've had steady performance from our emerging markets, and we expect 150 to 200 basis points of contribution from that, and delivering in the low double digits will give us that. And Services and Solutions driven by annuity revenue from Hospital Solutions as well as some of our value-based healthcare business models also contribute meaningfully to our growth. So we've got a balanced growth effort across these different areas. But of course, new therapies form the heart and the core of our growth. And they also, in fact, lead to future emerging market and economic value growth. Danielle J. Antalffy: Thank you so much. I appreciate the response. Omar S. Ishrak: Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Danielle. Paula, can we have the next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Brooks West of Piper Jaffray. Brooks E. West: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I want to start with Hooman if I could. A lot of moving pieces in the diabetes market right now and, Hooman, I'd love to get your thoughts on the market overall, especially given J&J's recent announcement. And then we're trying to connect the dots in terms of how we should think of the ramp of your business. So you've talked about spring launch for 670G, but you've talked about that being a controlled launch. You've got the Priority Access Program. I'm just wondering how that all works as we think about the launch cycle of that device? And then last, just how should we think about the contribution from the UNH relationship? Thanks. Hooman C. Hakami: Sure. Okay. So a few pieces there, Brooks. I'll try to take them one at a time. As far as the market overall, as you pointed out it's a dynamic market, and certainly over the last, call it, 90 days a significant number of competitive sort of announcements. But what I would say is that, if you take a look at that market and you look at our positioning in that market, we feel great about where we are. We've got the 630 in the US. We've got 670 that we're going to launch in the spring, number one. Number two, we have a stand-alone sensor that we anticipate getting approval on towards the end of this fiscal year, beginning of next fiscal year which will signal our entry into that market. And then on top of that, our international growth continues to be good. So you put all of those pieces together on top of the work that we're doing in value based healthcare and Type 2, we really like how we're positioned in the marketplace overall. Now in terms of the 670G specifically, you pointed it out. The launch is spring as planned. Absolutely no deviation from that. It is going to be a staggered launch as we've talked about before. And the reason we're doing the staggered launch is to make sure that we're rolling this out in a methodical way, so that we do the right thing for patients and physicians, make sure they get the proper training. And then also it's staggered because we do have a Priority Access Program. We want to make sure that the participants in the Priority Access Program are first in line for this new technology, our employees as well, and then as we conclude with payers and manufacturing capacity, we'll open it up and really get the full capacity. And then I think your \u2013 the last part of your question, Brooks, on UnitedHealthcare, that relationship continues to go well. We're very pleased with how that has gone. It really was our first step into value based healthcare with a payer, and we were thrilled to be able to do it with United. And we've been able to have ongoing discussions about how we can continue to broaden that partnership. And so that landscape looks well. You touched on other payers. I'm not going to comment on specifics related to other payers, but I would say, as other payers look forward, they're also looking to ensure that they are driving, not only costs but also outcomes. And that's going to continue to be very important. Brooks E. West: Thanks. Let me just follow up if I could on the 670G launch. So I'm curious, how as a patient do you get into the Priority Access Program? How does that work? And given the kind of four-year cycle around pumps, how many patients in your installed base, broad numbers, do you expect will be in that Priority Access Program? And then if I think about when are you going to hit full launch on 670G? Is that by year end? Is it further out than that? Just a little bit more clarity would be helpful. Thanks. Hooman C. Hakami: Sure. So, on the 670G, the Priority Access Program essentially \u2013 so let me provide some additional background. Back in August, we received approval from the FDA for the 630G product. Literally less than a month later, we received approval for the 670G product which was far faster than what we had anticipated. And if you remember, we had submitted the 670G to the FDA in June of last year, so far accelerated timeline by the FDA for the 670 approval. So literally in less than a month, we had two products approved right on top of each other. We created the Priority Access Program so that patients who purchase the 630G would be first in line for the 670G once it was released in the spring. And so that's really how you get on the Priority Access Program. As far the uptake question that you have, Brooks, we don't disclose the actual number of participants that have chosen to enter into the Priority Access Program. But I think, as Omar talked about in the commentary, we're very pleased with our U.S. results as we really start to get into the swing of things here, first full quarter with the priority access program and the uptake continues to be great. And there's a number of things that need to happen in order for us to really get the full launch, not the least of which is payer coverage which we're actively working, and it's hard to estimate how that's going to go. But those are the kinds of things that we're working on in order to ramp up as fast as we can. Brooks E. West: Thank you so much. Hooman C. Hakami: Sure. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thanks, Brooks. Paula, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch at BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Karen Wuensch : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Can you give us a little bit of an update of how you're approaching, entering the United States with your Hospital Solutions business? Obviously, you've got your first contract here in public on the print, but how do you think about pushing that business further in the U.S.? Omar S. Ishrak: Well, again, in a measured fashion, we're going after significant accounts where there is an interest in our overall capability. We think in the U.S., given the strong sort of innovation platform that we have here that these accounts can serve as launching pads for future value based healthcare programs where we really work on the value for our new therapies on these platforms. And again, we do these in a measured way. I think a lot of the efficiency initiatives that we have in other regions around the world, the U.S. hospitals do by themselves. So, again, we're being selective about where we go. But there is a considerable degree of interest, and we are going to be adding a few more accounts in the coming months. Joanne Karen Wuensch : And then as my second question, there's a lot of moving parts, some coming out this weekend at ACC, and the TAVR space and structural heart. Can you give us an update on what your view is on that market, and particularly, where you are in mitral? Thank you. Omar S. Ishrak: Yeah, I think Mike Coyle is the position to comment on this. So, Mike, go ahead. Michael J. Coyle: Sure. We continue to expect the market growth that we outlined at the analyst meeting back in June. So the growth profile is really going to be driven by the expansion of indications of use into the intermediate risk group at ACC at late breaking clinical trials. We will be presenting the SURTAVI data which will be the basis of our clinical module for support of that indication for use in the U.S. And so everything we see is pretty much on track for what we described as a $4.5 billion to $5 billion market opportunity around 2021. So, in terms of mitral, we continue to do the feasibility enrollments for the Intrepid product. We're now up to about 40 implants and those continue to go well. We're going to be sitting \u2013 we are sitting down with the FDA to talk about pivotal study design and we expect to kick that off in fiscal 2018. Joanne Karen Wuensch : Thank you. See you at ACC. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thanks, Joanne. Paula, question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Taylor of Barclays. Matthew Taylor : Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about two product factors specifically. I guess one is the last couple quarters you called out the replacement headwind. I was wondering how that impacted results in this quarter? And how you see that playing out in the results over the next couple quarters? That's kind of the first one. Omar S. Ishrak: Is this a replacement headwind in cardiac rhythm? Matthew Taylor : That's right. Omar S. Ishrak: Mike, do you want to comment on that? Michael J. Coyle: Yes, we actually saw an improvement in the replacement growth this quarter from the standpoint that I pointed out last quarter. We were seeing high single-digit declines. We expected that to get marginally better just by the modeling of kind of where we were in the replacement cycle. But we also benefited in the quarter from two additional things. One is there was a fairly significant competitive recall that took place, and that actually drove some competitive replacements for us that we typically don't get. But we also had unrestricted release of TYRX in the quarter which is our anti-infective envelope. And it actually is particularly valuable in replacement procedures and especially high power replacement procedures. So, actually, the replacement growth was a low single-digit decline this quarter versus what we saw in Q2. Matthew Taylor : Great. And then one product that we haven't heard much about in a while could be a bigger one over the next year or so is the surgical robotics system. I was hoping we can get an update there on timing or if you want to give us any kind of preview in terms of the features and benefits and how you think that will compete. Omar S. Ishrak: I'll let Bryan comment on that. Go ahead, Bryan. Bryan Hanson : All right. Great. Yeah, no real change from the time that we talked to everybody in June. I still am very bullish on the project. We will be launching on a limited basis in specific countries towards the end of FY 2018. And then as I've said before, I would expect material revenue coming in FY 2019. The real difference between what we're going to launch and what you're going to see out there is the endo factors. I mean the robotics system itself I think is \u2013 will be interesting and will be unique in a certain way. But the endo factor is where we bring a lot of value to our end users today. There's a lot of confidence in those endo factors and to be able to combine that with a full suite of endo factors at launch of robotics system will be a big benefit to us. The other thing, outside of robotics by itself, I think this is important, as much as I'm excited about robotics as a microcosm, I got to look at the macro. And when we do launch robotics, we'll be the only organization that will have a full suite of instruments in open surgery, traditional MIS and robotics. And the combination of those things will be unique to us and the value then as a result of that that we can bring to the customer will be beyond what anybody else can. And that's probably the thing that I'm most excited about. Again, robotics by itself, very interesting. That broader portfolio is the thing that really gets me excited. Matthew Taylor : Thanks, Bryan. Thanks, Mike. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Matt. Paula, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter here. So maybe my first one for maybe Mike Coyle is probably better suited for this one. Mike, back when you guys launched CoreValve in the high-risk group, right, we had this massive market expansion rate, patients on the sidelines. So there's been \u2013 do you think there's a large pool of patients sitting on the sidelines and when you guys launch intermediate risk, will it have a similar effect on the market? Michael J. Coyle: When we do our modeling, we basically see the approval, general approval of intermediate risk expanding the sort of prevailing high and extreme risk patient population by another 50%. So you don't want to think about it as a third, a third, a third in terms of the distribution of these patients. So, obviously, getting the data out and then having that adopted to drive penetration is going to be the key item but that's the way we would outline it. And then of course, we've begun the low risk clinical trials as well as have some others in the space. And so we would expect that to be sort of the next wave of expansion as those data become available. Vijay Kumar : Great. And then maybe one for maybe Omar and both Karen can pitch in on this one. I think, Omar, when you look back on that question on operating margins, right, I think the thought process was you guys managed to an operating dollar rate on the profit equation. Has anything changed on that metric? The way you're thinking about the business given Karen's comments and, look, we're focused on margins. Because, obviously, from our side, this week, we look at margins, right, and versus how you guys are modeling or running the business internally. So I'm just wondering if there's been any change in the thought process. Thank you. Omar S. Ishrak: No real change in our thought process. I mean we said consistently that for sustained EPS growth, you need to do that through operating margin. Now that doesn't mean that there aren't other vehicles which we could use intelligently and which we will use and that's financial leverage. But at the end of the day, the majority of our improvement will have to come through operating improvement in the business. And we outlined and I said earlier in the call what kind of things we're looking at. I do think that the manufacturing consolidation is one of our biggest and most significant strategic moves in that area. And as that comes to play, we'll give you more details but that's one that we're working on very, very actively. And we think we'll be the platform which will give us sustained operating margin improvement in the future. I mean that's essential. And then like I said before, the scale and size of our company is such that many of the support functions have never been integrated and with the introduction of the IP systems around the world which are now sort of not complete but well on the way to being complete. Leveraging those will give us further capability to drive the efficiencies in that regard. So operating margin remains our focus. That's where we provide the most detail. But again, let's not forget that we sit on a lot of other assets and some degree of financial leverage we can get to shore up our EPS growth, I think is something that's the right thing to do. Vijay Kumar : Great. Thanks, guys. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Vijay. Paula, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Bruce Nudell of SunTrust. Bruce M. Nudell: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I had a question for Mike and then a follow-up for Omar. So, Mike, could you just talk about the growth rate in the LVAD market? I know it's a small acquisition but a space we're historically interested in, and U.S./ex-U.S. growth. And also the competitiveness of HVAD, I know the data is coming up at ISHLT, but just given the very low thrombosis rates seen with HeartMate 3, how do you think HVAD will compete even if the stroke rate is tamed in the ISHLT presentation? Michael J. Coyle: Overall, the growth of the market is low double digits, so very much in line with what we had expected when we did the acquisition. In terms of the overall performance of HVAD, we are very bullish on its performance, and I think the data sets that we will be using to get the destination therapy results or the leading indications in the U.S. I think will show a high degree of comparability between the two products. And we think the size advantages of the product as well as its long-term ability to be done in atherectomy procedure we think offer some significant advantages and we're looking forward to competing in the segment. Bruce M. Nudell: Thanks for that. And, Omar and Karen, the company has successfully initiated an impressive globalization effort. But with that, you institutionalized currency risk. Can you foresee \u2013 firstly, do you foresee any secular changes, or do you think that negative stuff today will become positive stuff tomorrow? And secondly, what's the philosophy going to be in terms of just delivering cash EPS quarter-on-quarter irrespective of currency? Thanks so much. Omar S. Ishrak: Currency is clearly an issue and we do have exposure, that is true. We've got some hedging programs which softens the peaks and valleys in the currency rate. But in the end, that's all it does. We are, however, beginning to put to together, in accordance with our manufacturing operations optimization, a natural hedging program which will allow us to have cost and revenue in the same geography or at least in the same currency. That is the only ultimate protection against currency swings. But having said that, I will say that we're very early in that journey and it will take a while before that strategy really plays out but that's the course we have taken. Karen, do you want to add to that a little bit? Karen L. Parkhill: I would just add on natural hedging that it's not just where we place our centers, but it's also how we negotiate contracts with both our vendors and our customers. So we are focused on driving as much natural hedging as we can into the business. That said, we will always have currency risk just being a big global company. We recognize that currency risk is not something that we can control but something which we do indeed need to manage, and that's what we're focused on. Bruce M. Nudell: Thanks so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Bruce. Paula, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Jennings of Cowen & Company. Joshua Jennings : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had a follow-up for Mike Coyle on ACC and the SURTAVI data. I was wondering if you could help us just think about how the data is going to be presented. There have been numerous revisions to the inclusion criteria. It is an interim look and a Bayesian statistical analysis, but I was hoping if you could just answer the specifics. With the interim analysis pre-specified, is there any statistical penalty for the look? And then secondarily, what types of subgroup analysis should we think about being presented at ACC in terms of lower STS score, patient subgroups, as the inclusion criteria was expanded. And then also the two different valves being in the study, is there going to be Evolut R specific subgroup analysis as well? Michael J. Coyle: Josh, obviously these are all embargoed data and just a late-breaking clinical trial presentation, so I'm not going to go into any real detail on it until the data have been presented, and we'll be doing an analyst discussion at ACC following the presentation of the data. I would just say that this Bayesian analysis and design criteria and intermediate look were all designed into the original study in 2012, so there's nothing new here. So we're looking forward to presenting the data and then being able to discuss it afterward. Joshua Jennings : Great, thanks. And, Karen, just to follow up on the operating margin expansion trajectory and the FX impact, is there any way you can provide us with any directional guidance for fiscal 2018 just in terms of where currency rates are now and how you're hedged and whether or not your positions will be a headwind or tailwind to reported operating margins in fiscal 2018? Karen L. Parkhill: Yes, so we will give full fiscal 2018 guidance on our next earnings call. But just from an FX impact perspective, if currency rates remain stable to where they are today, we would expect a negative impact on revenue of between $100 million and $300 million and on EPS of $0.05 to $0.15. Is that helpful? Joshua Jennings : Great. And anything specific to the other income line? Karen L. Parkhill: We are not going to give line item guidance at this stage on FY 2018, but expect more guidance on our next earnings call. Joshua Jennings : Okay, thanks a lot. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Josh, next question please, Paula. Operator : Your next question comes from Raj Denhoy of Jefferies. Raj Denhoy : Hi, good morning. I wonder if I could ask a bit about emerging markets. I guess it's about 14% of sales now, still growing low double digits. But I guess you're still seeing some headwinds in Saudi Arabia and some countries in that area. So maybe you could just give us an update on when you'll see that potentially rebound and where you think that 14% of revenue from emerging markets could eventually get to over time. Omar S. Ishrak: In terms of the Middle East first, year over year the decline is significant. Like I said, in Saudi Arabia alone, it's like 30% down year over year. But on a sequential basis, it's stabilized. So a lot of this has to do with built-up inventory of implantable devices in the Saudi system itself, which they're cleaning out right now, and we're helping them optimize the deployment of these devices into the market. We see that action happening today. So therefore, this stabilization, the sequential stabilization will lead to anniversarying of this decline by fiscal year end. At that point, we expect to return to growth, although I think it will be measured because there's still some inventory in the system. And I think that the healthcare systems there are responsibly deploying that inventory over time. So that's what I'd expect out of the Middle East that I don't think we'll see major declines and start to begin to see growth come back early into next fiscal year. At least, that's our expectation today. In terms of where this could be, our target is in the low double digits and aiming to get to the mid-teens. I think that's an entitlement given the size of that market. It isn't as easy as it sounds given the size of this market because the infrastructure just isn't there. But we're working in a very focused fashion with both the public authorities in many of these countries as well as private \u2013 both providers as well as other interested stakeholders in developing, in trying to develop inflection points in growth in singular countries. So those are the approaches we're taking, and each country is different. The macroeconomic conditions vary. There could be surprises in any one country at any time. But I think we're getting increasing confidence with the level of diversification that we have and the size of our emerging markets business across Latin America, Middle East, China, Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe including Russia, all of that put together, that diversification gives us some level of confidence that double-digit growth in the emerging markets can continue. And if you put that math together, that 14% ratio probably goes up a point or so every year. Raj Denhoy : So just to put a finer point on it, as the Middle East improves over this fiscal year and you move into 2018, is that mid double-digit growth from emerging markets, is that something we should expect even as soon as next year? Omar S. Ishrak: Look, again, I cannot comment on that because, like I said earlier, we look at this diversified sort of portfolio of emerging market countries and you don't know what's going to happen where. So it's \u2013 the whole object of diversification is that you balance upsides and downsides. And so I think sticking to the double-digits is what we're seeing, and you'll have occasional quarters where we do better. But I think we've shown that we've held the double-digit line even through bad circumstances, and that's just our historical performance based on factors that, in many instances, are outside our control. So that's the best I could comment. I think it's not prudent to speculate on what's going to happen only from an upside perspective in these markets. Raj Denhoy : No, that's helpful. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Raj. Paula, let's take one more question please. Operator : Okay. Your final question comes from Matt Miksic of UBS. Matt Miksic : Good morning. Thanks so much for squeezing me in, and congrats on a really nice job, sequential improvement. So I have one follow-up here on TAVR and one if I could on spine. So, on TAVR, increased market awareness and market development is emerging as an important driver for this new intermediate risk segment you talked about earlier. Mike, I would love to hear you may be talk about the cadence of data, new products and importantly your efforts and initiatives, or if you see that as important, when we can start to see that kind of activity in the market. And then I mentioned I have one follow-up. Michael J. Coyle: Sure. I think just in terms of the cadence of things that are going to drive growth for us, the 34-millimeter valve that we talked about, Omar talked about in his commentary, continues to roll out in the U.S. And that segment is 25% to 30% of our historical segment, so it's been important in terms of its contribution to our overall growth. And it requires training, and basically, we are only in 200 of our 400 plus centers with fully trained access to the products in Q3, so there's still growth opportunity in the U.S. for that. And then of course, we just released that product in Europe, so we will get full quarter benefit of that here in Q4. In addition, our next-generation product, the Evolut Pro, is basically expected to come into the market in the first half of fiscal year next year. So that will provide us growth opportunity in advance of other competitors coming into the market. And then the SURTAVI indication or the intermediate risk indication is something that we expect in FY 2018. And of course, we can talk more about that and its impact on the market after the data are released. So I think those are the main catalysts I think that I would point to for that business over the course of Q4 and into next year. Matt Miksic : And I guess, Mike, just to make \u2013 one of the things we're hearing in the marketplace is this need for getting back out into the community. Is that something that you've started, that you expect to start? Is that something that comes after SURTAVI or with the new launches? Michael J. Coyle: I think market development activities will follow when we have indications for use to pursue them. So we can talk about that. In fact, Rob [ten Hoedt] will be discussing our general program here at ACC, so that might be a good place to have that discussion. Matt Miksic : Great. And then if I could just on spine, the robotic initiative, the partnership you've struck up with Mazor, from their commentary, appears to be working quite well. Your spine business appears to be tracking a bit better. I'd love to get your view just on spine robotic surgery and then robotic surgery in general given that you're coming at this a little bit differently than sort of a stand-alone robotic surgery player in that you're a leader, trusted provider in both spine and general surgery. And maybe if you could talk about some of the key elements, considerations, as a market leader that you're running into or see as advantages or see as considerations as you look to roll those systems out or drive further into that part of the market? Hooman C. Hakami: Yeah, I don't know if you heard Bryan Hanson's response on his view on robotics and a broad portfolio, but I take a similar viewpoint on this. And for the spine market, we're looking at it holistically in terms of implants and enabling technology. And an enabling technology has several different layers. Intraoperative imaging, navigation, surgical tools and robotics. And so we believe \u2013 you mentioned our spine business is doing better, and that's just a result of us introducing \u2013 that has no impact from Mazor. This is a result of introducing a lot of the new technology over the last several quarters, launching that technology at scale, right. So, when we launch it, we have enough of the inventory and instruments to support the cases. So that's really what's in it. And finally, I guess rep engagement. Our U.S. team in particular, where we have 65% of our spine business, is humming on all cylinders. So that's what's driving our growth. As we move forward, our goal in spine, first, was to get back to market growth and now start to take some share. But as we move forward, what we need is to grow the spine market and we believe that the combination of this enabling technology which robotics is just one piece of, combined with our market \u2013 that combined with our implants, we believe we can improve outcomes, both from a clinical perspective and an economic perspective. And robotics fits right in there. What we're most excited about Mazor is their pre-surgical planning software that helps physicians plan pre-operatively versus intraoperatively which happens a lot today. And then the surgical \u2013 the robotic arm capabilities also will help do things a little bit more consistently and we believe this will help democratize a good spine surgery, not just in the U.S. but outside of the U.S. So it's a holistic viewpoint. Mazor is one part of our enabling technology strategy which we call \u2013 and then as you integrate that into our implants, we call that surgical synergy. So we are excited about the Mazor relationship. It is going better than we had anticipated in terms of faster uptake from our \u2013 our physicians are very interested in this enabling technology strategy and how robotics fits in, and I think that's upside to our future results. Matt Miksic : Thanks so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Matt. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's program. I will now turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Omar S. Ishrak: Okay. Well, thank you all for your questions. And on behalf of the entire management team, I would now like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q4 call which we currently anticipate holding on Thursday, May 25. Thank you all very much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes your conference. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Mr. Ryan Weispfenning, Please go ahead. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017, which ended on April 28, 2017. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments : Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements, and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, and rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis. References to annual results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to fiscal year 2016, and rates and ranges are given on a constant currency and constant week basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and the extra week that was in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Finally, other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning. Thank you, Ryan. Thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.9 billion, representing growth of 5%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.33, growing at 6%. Before providing more detail on our quarterly performance, I would like to recap fiscal 2017, a solid year for Medtronic. We delivered record revenue of $29.7 billion, growing approximately 5%, in the mid-single digits for the fifth consecutive year. We made progress in each of our growth strategies. In Therapy Innovation, we executed a steady cadence of meaningful product launches, as well as introducing some groundbreaking new technologies. In Globalization, we expanded access to our therapies in emerging markets resulting in double-digit growth. And in Economic Value, we continued to extend our industry leadership in developing value-based healthcare solutions. The integration of Covidien progressed as planned. We have now realized over $600 million in synergy savings and remain on track to deliver our goal of $850 million of total cost savings by the end of the next fiscal year. This operational productivity, coupled with our revenue growth, were key contributors to delivering double digit EPS growth and generating over $5.5 billion of free cash flow. We strategically deployed our capital in line with our stated priorities, balancing return of cash to our shareholders together with disciplined reinvestment in our businesses. We met our commitment of returning greater than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and net share repurchases. In addition, we invested approximately $1.5 billion in several strategic investments and five tuck-in acquisitions, and we expect these acquisitions to further enhance our revenue growth and improve returns over time. Finally, late in the fiscal year, we announced the sale of a portion of our PMR division to Cardinal Health for $6.1 billion as part of our disciplined portfolio management strategy. But most importantly, in fiscal year 2017, together with our physician partners, we served 70 million patients, more patients in more places around the world than any year in our history. It is incredible that two patients around the world are benefitting from Medtronic therapies and services every second. I am very proud of our more than 88,000 dedicated employees, for all that they accomplished in fiscal year 2017, and all that we can accomplish going forward, as we continue to fulfill the Medtronic Mission. Moving now to fourth quarter performance. We had a strong finish to our fiscal year 2017, delivering over 5% revenue growth. CVG, MITG, RTG, and Diabetes all grew in the mid-single digits. Geographically, we also demonstrated solid, balanced performance, with mid-single digit growth in the U.S. and non-U.S. developed markets, and double-digit growth in emerging markets. Complementing our solid revenue growth, our operating margin and cash flow continued to improve as expected. Our performance continues to be fueled by our three growth strategies : Therapy innovation; globalization; and economic value. We are creating distinct competitive advantages and capitalizing on the long-term trends in healthcare, namely, the desire to improve clinical outcomes; the growing demand for expanded access to care; and the optimization of cost and efficiency within healthcare systems. These trends, along with an aging population in most countries, produce secular growth tailwinds that we believe represent sustainable, long-term opportunities for Medtronic. Now, let\u2019s discuss our fourth quarter performance against each of our growth strategies. In Therapy Innovation, we continued to see strong adoption of our innovative products across all our groups. In our Cardiac & Vascular Group, which grew 5%, we are leveraging the breadth of our products and services, as well as our strong positions in important, rapidly expanding markets to drive sustainable growth. Combined, our TAVR, insertable diagnostics, AF ablation, LVADs, and drug-coated balloons are now annualizing at nearly $3 billion and growing at over 20%. In our cardiac rhythm implantables businesses, we recently received CMS approval for reimbursement coverage in the US for Micra, the world\u2019s smallest pacemaker. Also, as announced last week, we now have U.S. approval for the first MRI safe quadripolar CRT pacing system. In TAVR, we delivered mid-30s growth and increased our market share sequentially in both the U.S. and Europe on the continued launch of our Evolut R 34 mm valve. In Coronary, we just received FDA approval of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent at the start of this fiscal year. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong growth in TAVR, driven by the Evolut PRO valve and intermediate risk indication expansion, and in Coronary, we expect the recent approval of the Resolute Onyx will turn the mid-20s U.S. DES sales declines that we experienced in fiscal 2017 into meaningful growth this fiscal year. In our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which grew 6%, we had high single digit growth in Surgical Solutions driven by new products in Advanced Energy and Advanced Stapling. In Advanced Energy, we continue to rollout three new LigaSure instruments with a nanocoating that helps reduce instrument cleaning, which improves surgical procedure efficiency. And, we continue to see strength in the Valleylab FT10 energy platform. In Advanced Stapling, results were driven by the sustained adoption of our endo stapling specialty reloads. We also launched Signia, our new, single-handed powered surgical stapler that provides surgeons with real-time feedback during surgery. These new products continue to facilitate the move of open surgical procedures to minimally invasive, resulting in better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs. In Patient Monitoring & Recovery, our above market growth was driven by strength in our PB980 ventilator, our Capnostream 20 bedside capnography monitor, capnography disposables, as well as our Nellcor pulse oximetry products. Our Restorative Therapies Group grew 5% this quarter, with strong contributions from our Spine, Brain, and Specialty Therapies divisions. Our Spine division grew 3% and again gained market share. Core Spine grew in the low-single digits, continuing to benefit from our Speed to Scale initiative as we continued to launch a series of new products, including the Solera Voyager and Elevate expandable cage. In addition, Infuse sales were strong, growing the double digits. Our Brain Therapies division grew 9%, driven by double-digit growth in Neurovascular and Neurosurgery. In Neurosurgery, our StealthStation S8 surgical navigation system received strong surgeon enthusiasm at the American Academy of Neurological Surgeons annual conference last month. While we launched it late in the fourth quarter, we expect it to result in accelerating sales growth next fiscal year. Turning to our Diabetes Group, the growth rate at 4% decelerated sequentially as we predicted, ahead of the full launch of the MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system. Despite this, we gained insulin pump share in both the U.S. and international markets, driven by strong clinician and consumer demand for our 6 series pumps. In the U.S., direct pump shipments to consumers grew over 20%. In CGM, we grew in the low-20s and are seeing strong growth globally as more patients transition to our sensor-augmented pumps. Regarding the U.S. launch of the MiniMed 670G, we have approximately 750 people taking part in our Customer Training Phase. The feedback has been extremely positive with a continued increase in patient satisfaction levels. We are preparing for a broader launch in June to the more than 20,000 pump users that are enrolled in our Priority Access Program. As stated before, we do not expect revenue growth to ramp substantially until after we have fulfilled the Priority Access orders, given the low revenue associated with the upgrade program. Our product pipeline remains robust across all our groups, with a number of important near-term growth catalysts. We remain confident that our new therapies can drive sustainable growth next fiscal year and beyond. Next, let\u2019s turn to Globalization. Emerging markets grew 10%, as we continue to expand access to our products and services around the world. In addition to ongoing traditional market development, we are executing on differentiated strategies, namely structuring partnerships with both governments and the private sector, as well as optimizing our distribution channels. We believe that these initiatives will not only position us for long-term leadership in emerging markets, but also will accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. In the Middle East, we continued to face challenges in the macroeconomic environment, causing our revenue to decline in the mid single digits. However, in Saudi Arabia, our largest market in the region, we are encouraged by the relatively stable sequential revenue we have delivered for the past two quarters, albeit at a lower base, given the large year-over-year declines experienced earlier this fiscal year. In other regions around the world, we delivered strong, double digit growth in China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, and high single digit growth in Eastern Europe. In China, we grew in the low teens, with double digit growth across CVG, MITG, and RTG, largely driven by strong growth in pacemakers, advanced stapling, and neurovascular. In addition, we are seeing success from our expansion into Chinese 2 tier cities and private hospitals. In Latin America, we had high-teens growth led by strong results in RTG, Surgical Solutions, and Coronary & Structural Heart. Brazil, Mexico, Chile, and Argentina all grew double digits. In Southeast Asia, which grew in the low-20s, we executed a number of channel optimization initiatives, including moving to direct distribution models in certain businesses in Indonesia and the Philippines. Overall, the consistency of our Emerging Market performance benefits greatly from geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe that the penetration of existing therapies into Emerging Markets represents the single largest opportunity in MedTech over the long-term. Turning now to our third growth strategy, Economic Value. We continue to see success in our Hospital Solutions business, which grew double digits, as we are now managing cath labs and operating rooms for more than 130 customers around the world. Also, we continue to execute our value-based healthcare signature programs. One of these is TYRX, our anti-infection envelope for implantable devices, which is an example of where a technology change directly results in clear and measurable value to the healthcare system, without any dependence on other variables. Since launching our value-based program for TYRX earlier this calendar year, we have outcome-based contracts in place at over 140 accounts, helping drive over 20% revenue growth in TYRX in the fourth quarter. Infection control for implantable devices is a large opportunity, as in the U.S. alone, over 6,000 patients are affected annually. We are aggressively developing other unique, value-based healthcare solutions across each of our groups. And while we are still early in this journey, we remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improved patient outcomes over volume. As always, we expect to do this in a way that benefits patients, healthcare systems, as well as our shareholders. Before turning the call over to Karen, I would like to highlight the agreement that we reached in the fourth quarter to divest a portion of our Patient Monitoring & Recovery division to Cardinal Health. We were pleased to receive clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission last week and continue to expect this transaction to close in our second quarter of fiscal year 2018. This is a positive transaction for all involved, including our shareholders and employees, who, we believe, will thrive under this change in ownership. We are committed to disciplined portfolio management, and we reached the conclusion that these businesses, while truly meaningful to patients in need, are best suited under ownership that can provide the investment and focus that these businesses require. Upon closing, this transaction will have an immediate positive impact on our revenue growth rates and margins, with modest near-term earnings dilution. We intend to continue investing over the long-term in internal and external opportunities that are more directly aligned with our growth strategies and focus on strong financial returns. With that, let me ask Karen to now take you through a more detailed look at the drivers of our fourth quarter financial results. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Omar. Our fourth quarter revenue of $7,916 million increased 5%, both as reported and on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency had a negative $37 million impact on fourth quarter revenues, and acquisitions contributed approximately 110 basis points to revenue growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.84. Non-GAAP was $1.33. After adjusting for the $0.2 negative impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 6%. Our operating margin for the quarter was 30.7% on a constant currency basis, representing a year-over-year improvement of 40 basis points. With the impact of currency included, our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin also improved, increasing 10 basis points year-over-year. We continued to cover the earnings dilution from our recent acquisitions, which means we maintained earnings expectations while realizing incremental acquisition revenue. Taking into account currency and the acquisitions that we have done in the past year, our operating margin improvement on an organic basis was approximately 70 basis points in the quarter. The operating margin improvement was driven in part by efficiencies as we continue to deliver on our Covidien synergies. This was partially offset by purposeful investments we made in sales and marketing ahead of upcoming product launches. Net other expense was $48 million compared to income of $21 million in the prior year, due in large part to lower net gains from our foreign exchange hedging programs. Our full year operating margin improved 140 basis points on an organic basis, which takes into account the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions we have done within the past year, and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. This solid operating margin improvement was within our expected range for the year. Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $196 million, a sequential increase driven in part by our debt issuance in March. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $33.4 billion in debt and $13.7 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion dollars was trapped. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 17%, in line with our expectations. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding, on a diluted basis, were 1,381 million shares. Turning to shareholder payout, in fiscal 2017, we paid $2.4 billion in dividends and repurchased a net $3.1 billion of our ordinary shares. This represented a total payout ratio of 86% on non-GAAP net income and 136% on GAAP net income. Keep in mind, our payout ratio is elevated as we have been continuing to not only return 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders, but also execute the $5 billion incremental share repurchase commitment we made through fiscal year 2018. Before moving to our income statement guidance, I want to reinforce our commitment to strong free cash flow generation, which we recognize is an important driver of long-term shareholder value. In fiscal year 2017, our free cash flow was $5.6 billion, in line with our guidance, and representing very strong year-over-year growth of 35%. This growth was well above our long-term expectation to grow free cash flow in the high single digit range, roughly in line with earnings and is primarily due to the timing of litigation and tax items that affected our income statement in fiscal 2017 but won\u2019t impact cash flow until fiscal 2018. As you know, cash flow is subject to large swings in discrete items and, as we have demonstrated this year, can also be affected by timing. Going forward, we will talk about cash flow growth against a longer, multi-year view, and as such would expect our free cash flow to grow in the high-single digits, compounded annually, from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2018. Now, looking at the picture ahead. To avoid confusion, our guidance for this next fiscal year does not take into account the impact of the planned divestitures. We intend to update our guidance upon close of the transaction. For fiscal year 2018, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the range of 4 to 5%, on both an organic basis and after taking into account the year-over-year benefit from the acquisitions we completed early last fiscal year. By business group, we expect CVG to grow in the range of 5 to 6%, MITG to grow in the range of 3 to 4%, RTG to grow approximately 4%, and Diabetes to grow in the 10 to 12% range, increasing from the first half to the second as we fully launch 670G beyond our Priority Access Program. Looking at the [fourth] quarter, we would expect total Medtronic revenue growth to be similar to the annual range. But, keep in mind that in the first quarter, we will be fulfilling the 670G Priority Access Program, so we would expect Diabetes growth to be similar to the past quarter and ramp throughout the year. We expect solid operating margin improvement in fiscal year 2018, with greater strength in the back half of the fiscal year. We expect our gross margin on a constant currency basis to be flat to slightly improve throughout the fiscal year, with modest pricing pressure offset by operating improvement. Given historical and current foreign exchange rates, we expect currency to negatively affect the gross margin in the first half of the year, with a greater impact in the first quarter than the second. SG&A, as a percent of revenue, is expected to improve next fiscal year, particularly in the back half as we continue to realize additional Covidien synergies in our enabling functions and transition to centers of excellence. However, in the first half of the fiscal year, we expect SG&A as a percent of revenue to remain relatively flat from the first quarter to the second, as we invest in sales and marketing for important new indications and product launches, including TAVR intermediate risk, Resolute Onyx and the 670G. Given our recent debt issuance and the purposeful liquidation of some of our investments, we expect net interest expense to moderately increase over the level just reported in the fourth quarter. And, while difficult to predict given the dependency on our stock price movement, we expect a slight tax benefit from the accounting change for excess benefits on stock options we will implement in fiscal year 2018. With respect to earnings, we expect fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow in the range of 9 to 10% on a constant currency basis, with higher growth in the back half of the year as we fully launch important new products and realize additional savings in SG&A as mentioned. In addition to these items, given the tax benefits we had in the first half of fiscal 2017 that are not expected to repeat, we would expect first quarter EPS to be in the upper end of the high single digit range, with the second quarter in the mid single digit range, both on a constant currency basis. While the impact from currency is fluid and therefore not something we forecast, if recent exchange rates, which include a $1.12 euro and 111 yen, remain stable for the fiscal year, our full year revenue would be positively affected by approximately 75 to $175 million. Given historical and current rates, the impact from foreign currency would be a headwind in the first half of the fiscal year including approximately 10 to $60 million negative impact to revenue in the first quarter, and shift to a tailwind with the comparison against a stronger dollar in the second half. Full year EPS would be negatively affected by approximately $0.05 to $0.10, including a negative impact of approximately $0.03 to $0.05 in the first quarter. As Omar mentioned, we expect the divestiture of a portion of our Patient Monitoring and Recovery division to Cardinal Health to close in our second fiscal quarter. As stated upon announcement, the transaction is expected to result in modest net dilution to our fiscal 2018 non- GAAP earnings per share in the range of approximately $0.12 to $0.18, with the exact amount primarily dependent on the closing date of the transaction. The transaction is expected to improve our comparable, constant currency revenue growth rate and non-GAAP comparable, constant currency operating margin by approximately 50 basis points each. As previously stated, we intend to allocate $1 billion of the after-tax proceeds to an incremental share repurchase in fiscal 2018, with the balance used to reduce debt. Now, I will return the call back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Karen. To conclude, Q4 was a strong finish to the fiscal year, with balanced, diversified growth across our groups and regions. Along with the mid-single digit revenue growth, our organization delivered meaningful operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth, as well as growth in free cash flow in fiscal 2017. Looking ahead, I want to reiterate our longer term commitment to drive not only mid single digit constant currency revenue growth and double digit constant currency EPS growth, but also our focus on long-term value creation through strong free cash flow and strategic capital allocation, balancing return of cash to our shareholders with disciplined reinvestment to fuel future growth. We will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I\u2019ve asked Mike Coyle, President of CVG; Bryan Hanson, President of MITG; Geoff Martha, President of RTG; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group, to join us. We want to try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question, if necessary, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instruction] And your first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Two strategic questions to start off and I\u2019ll jump back in queue. The first is on cap deployment, the second one on margins. And maybe Omar or Karen, on capital deployment, if we think about the last access to cash you have between Puerto Rico and in the Cardinal assets, it\u2019s $8 billion, 7 of that is going to go into debt repayment. So, can you just talk about the messaging for shareholders here about repaying that debt, is simply a commitment to debt holders, what does it tell us about your interest in growth minded M&A or frankly larger would someone call more transformational M&A? And then I have a quick question on margins. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : First of all, we\u2019ve stated our capital allocation policies and we\u2019re kind following that. Second, we\u2019ve got a big transaction with this divestiture that you\u2019re -- that\u2019s coming up, and we\u2019re really focused on that. Third, our strategy for acquisitions, we\u2019ve said all along which is a disciplined strategy of looking at companies which fit our strategic goals that give us returns above our cost of capital over the long-term and that either doesn\u2019t have any or minimizes any dilution to present income. And those are the strategies we look at and the sizes, secondary and all of that through the strategic goals of the company and whether it fits or not is what we look for. But right now our focus really is on the divestiture. Karen Parkhill : I would just add that in the near term we\u2019re focused on fulfilling our commitment to reduce our leverage post the Covidien acquisition, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. Over the longer term, we\u2019re focused on reinvestments to drive stronger growth and better margins in the longer term. David Lewis : Okay. That\u2019s very clear. And then, Karen, just come on fiscal 2018 guidance, by our math, it applies about 80 or 90 basis points of margin expansion and that\u2019s sort of the lower hand of the place holder, you set down, or the Company set down last year sort of 70 to 140 basis points. So, is this sort nearly a refinement as we get closer to the year, some conservatism? What does it tell us about your commitment to delivering those longer term targets of 500 to 600 basis points or better? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Thanks for the question, David. We\u2019re very focused on driving operating margin improvement and leverage. And we cannot get to our double digit bottom line on our mid single digit top line without driving that operating leverage improvement. We\u2019re focused on driving solid plans going forward and executing against those solid plans to ensure that we deliver. As I said before, we will focus on the top line and bottom line, recognizing we need to get the leverage in between, but not focus as much as on the exact basis points of leverage in between because that can vary in any period. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan. Mike Weinstein : Karen, a couple of financial items first. First one, the IRS appeal deal of the decision on Puerto Rico and that apparent delay to the resolution of that; how does that impact debt pay down plan and basically the assumption on cash flows -- for use of cash flows in FY18? Karen Parkhill : So, the IRS did recently request to appeal the tax court decision. We do expect this to delay the ultimate outcome and the movement of cash. Until the IRS files are opening brief, which we expect in the first quarter, we won\u2019t have a better estimate on the length of the delay. We do still believe our initially filed returns were correct and we continue to defend that position. In terms of the movement of cash and the debt pay down, we do anticipate to use obviously the proceeds from the divestiture to pay down debt. And our leverage target of getting to around three times at the end of this fiscal year and continuing to be focused on maintaining an A credit rating do not include the expected proceeds of the Puerto Rico settlement. Mike Weinstein : Okay. That\u2019s perfect. You made a comment about the impact on tax issue 2016 09 adoption; what is the EPS impact, given estimate of $0.05? Karen Parkhill : Yes. We are -- it is included in our guidance of 9% to 10% EPS growth. And so, we are not giving an exact amount on that, mainly because it is dependent on our stock price movement, on the exercise of our options which are inherently very difficult to predict. We do expect that change to give us a slight tax benefit in the next year. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Then last item just on 670G launch. So, I want to make sure we are all thinking about just the timing of this ramp, not only in terms of what it means for revenues but in terms of share gains. Is it fair to assume that you really don\u2019t want to be offensive going what I would characterize as non-Medtronic patients more in the second half of FY18 versus the first half because right now, you are obviously dealing with the initial customer feedback to launch and in June you are going to the existing Medtronic patients, will be more second half of the year before you are really in a position to go out and take market share? Hooman Hakami : Hey, Mike. This is Hooman. I\u2019ll answer the question. First, maybe a little bit of perspective on the fourth quarter because we were going through Priority Access there. And as was indicated in the commentary, even with Priority Access, we actually saw strong performance relative to the market and our peers. So, with the 630 and Priority Access, we gained over 4 points of durable pump market share in the fourth quarter. The other thing I would point out that I think is worthy of note is that globally our CGM sales grew in the low-20s because of the sensor attachment to all of these pumps. So, even though we are going through Priority Access fulfillment right now, in Q1 and we expect as Karen mentioned a ramp from Q1 to Q4, I think we\u2019re going to really put ourselves in a position to continue to take market share. And as we think about the full year, we feel really good that we are going to be able to end the year, not only with market share gains but also double-digit growth. Operator : It comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : So, I just wanted to first of all congrats on a strong finish to the year. I guess for my first question, I just wanted to clarify the fiscal 2018 guidance because there wasn\u2019t actually an EPS given. So, I think I\u2019ve got this straight but you are saying off of a 460 number for fiscal 2017, underlying earnings growth of 9% to 10% less the $0.05 to $0.10 form FX, and then there is obviously the $0.12 to $0.18 we need to think about for Cardinal. So, question number one is, is that right; do I have all the moving pieces correct? And then this is nitpicking a little bit but I\u2019m just curious on fiscal 2018, why the 9% to 10% is just a little bit below the double-digit goal that you talk about long-term? Karen Parkhill : Thanks for the question, Bob. You have the right ins and outs. And we did say that we will update the guidance post the close of the divestiture, just a little confusion. So but, the impacts from the -- the dilutive impact on EPS is you right that $0.12 to $0.18 is dependent on when we close the acquisition. We still expect close in the second quarter, but we don\u2019t know if it will be the beginning of the second quarter or the end of the second quarter. So, that\u2019s why we have the range. In terms of the $0.09 to $0.10 EPS growth -- 9% to 10% EPS growth, we obviously are fully committed to our mid single digit top line and double digit bottom line growth over the longer term. In this fiscal year, our top end of that range is clearly double digit. Impacting the lower end of that range is the fact that we have a temporary increase in our interest expense, this fiscal year, given the slight increase in our debt as we focus on repaying it down with the proceeds. So, it\u2019s a temporary impact. And then, we also do have purposeful investment in SG&A in the first half of the year as we get ready to launch very important new product. Bob Hopkins : And then, Omar, one bigger picture question for you. Love to get your views on something that we\u2019ve been trying to ask a lot of MedTech management teams lately, given how well the medical device space is doing. If you look at the earnings reports from hospital companies, their volumes aren\u2019t really doing much. But the medical device space, it seems like surgical procedure volumes are growing at a very nice clip. So, what are you seeing out there as you exited your fiscal year in terms of surgical procedure volumes and kind of what\u2019s your look for the rest of this year? And again, I ask the question because it just seems like MedTech is different than hospital volumes right now? Omar Ishrak : I think your observation is correct. And as you said, our surgical volumes are hanging in there, they are stable. I won\u2019t say that they are going in upward trend or anything, but they\u2019re certainly stable. And I see that to continue. I would like to point out though that MedTech markets do swing a little more based on new product introductions, especially in the U.S., which is what we are looking at. And so, like we have had some pretty important launches in the last six months or so, and also important ones going forward as we have mentioned. So, I think you should probably think that into account that the technology introductions do give a swing to the MedTech space that probably hospitals in general wouldn\u2019t see. I think that\u2019s the best I can do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : I guess maybe on the guidance, Karen, that 4% to 5% constant currency growth for our fiscal 2018. It looks like maybe M&A is less than 50 bps, but I just want to make sure the organic for fiscal 2018 is still about 4% and that\u2019s what the guidance is implying? Karen Parkhill : Yes. That\u2019s correct, Vijay. Our guidance for revenue would be on an organic basis and including the impact from acquisitions that will benefit us more in the first part of that year, given that we acquired these assets at the beginning of last fiscal year. Vijay Kumar : And then may be Omar, one for you. Obviously margin expansion has been a huge focus for the Company. Gross margin performance in the quarter was really impressive. And then for me -- for us, CVG, which -- that your highest margin segments sort of came in line; MITG and RTG came in well above despite that gross margins came in well above. Maybe can you can just talk about what\u2019s going on within the margins and how confident you feel about margin expansion over the medium term? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : As we\u2019ve mentioned before, as we transition out of getting margin improvement from the Covidien synergies to the future, gross margin improvement through operations consolidation is going to be one of our biggest growth drivers in that area, our productivity drivers in that area. And as we do that -- as you put that [ph] you will see benefit across all groups because operations consolidation takes advantage of common facilities and that drives this proportion increase in some of the areas. So, I would say that that is one of our key strategic drivers; it\u2019s one that we\u2019re focused on; it\u2019s a first big transformational element of productivity that we\u2019re focused on as we come out of the Covidien synergy period, which will really be finished by the end of this coming fiscal year. So, that\u2019s what we expect to see, and we expect to see continued improvement in gross margin. And as Karen pointed in the guidance, we expect some improvement in the coming year. Operator : It comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : I wanted to start with a big picture question on 2018 guidance. Could you just speak a little bit to your underlying assumptions for the CapEx and utilization backdrop in the U.S.? There is clearly a lot of policy uncertainty out there. I appreciate sort of your baseline assumption there. Omar Ishrak : Well, the CapEx, our business is overall less dependent on CapEx. But at the same, if you remember that the CapEx that we have is very linked to procedures. These are not necessary diagnostic procedures; these are actual therapy procedures and therefore is often funded by growth in those procedures. So, we\u2019re somewhat -- I think it\u2019s better to see our business more in line with volumes of procedures, rather than CapEx investments in general. So, I think that\u2019s probably a better way to look at our business rather than specifically CapEx investments. Karen Parkhill : And I would just -- in terms of CapEx hitting our cash flow, we would anticipate approximately $1 billion over the next two to three years, in line with what we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years. Our spending on IT investments should come down over the next one to two years but that will be offset by investments in our manufacturing consolidation strategy. Isaac Ro : Thanks for that. May be just to clarify, my question, Omar, was really, not so -- I appreciate your business sense. I wasn\u2019t talking so much about capital equipment purchasing but just the general preponderance for hospitals to spend on new technology and then at the same time utilization in terms of overall healthcare volume. Omar Ishrak : I think, look, the new technology -- we\u2019ve seen that when meaningful new technology comes out in our space, it comes out with good clinical evidence that says that if you deploy these, they have meaningful benefit for patients. And in general, we\u2019ve seen, if reimbursement is there, which we usually make sure it is, then there is pretty good adoption when new technology comes in. And we see the market and basically share goes up with the introduction of those new products. So, I think that\u2019s really the biggest driver of any market swings into the MedTech space in the U.S. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : So, two financial questions for me. So, Omar, you grew about 5% in fiscal 2017 on a constant currency week adjusted basis and you are guiding to 4% to 5% in fiscal 2018, despite the fact you have a lot of new product launches and important new indications. So, the question is kind of why didn\u2019t you feel comfortable kind of guiding to 4% to 6%? It\u2019s a little bit like Bob\u2019s earlier question on the 9% to 10%; it\u2019s a little bit nitpicky. And so, what areas might slow in fiscal 2018 relative to fiscal 2017? Omar Ishrak : Look, we just wanted to provide a slightly tighter range than a generic mid-single digit range which we could have, but we just wanted to give a slightly tighter range. And I think that\u2019s where that came from. I think that what we\u2019ve seen this past fiscal year is we\u2019ve seen some movement in the quarter, there is some level of uncertainty in marketplaces always. So, we just wanted to make sure that we again can hit the guidance that we put out there. I think the trend that we have right now, the new products would suggest that we should be able to deliver within that range. Larry Biegelsen : All right, fair enough. Karen, I\u2019m sorry. Were you going to say something? Karen Parkhill : No, the only thing that I would add is that we are focused on delivering consistent reliable growth. Larry Biegelsen : Fair enough. And then, Karen, one for you. You had FX swing from I think it was negative $100 million to negative $300 million to positive $75 million to $175 million or swing of about $325 million at the midpoint from negative to positive. But the EPS impact remained at kind of negative $0.05 to $0.15. And I know everybody realizes you hedged but do we ever at some point see the benefit from the change in currency on the top line; do we ever see that benefit on the bottom line? Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Karen Parkhill : Thank you for the questions. We do have -- we do expect if current rates remain stable to where they are today, a positive impact to revenue for the year, as you mentioned the $75 million to $175 million and a negative EPS impact of $0.05 to $0.10. That mismatch is really driven by the fact that the FX impact on revenue is based on rates versus a year-ago, put simply. But the impact on gross margin is based on the time the inventory\u2019s been on our balance sheet. So that can mean you can have differences between the top and bottom line impact. But, I think it\u2019s important to note for this fiscal year at least in any case that that $0.05 to $0.10 negative impact on the bottom line is only a small headwind compared to previous years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Matt Taylor : I wanted to ask a more detailed question maybe about the CVG guidance, because you are forecasting 5% to 6% and outlined a couple of product launches that you are going to be spending behind. So, I thought it\u2019d be worth talking about this more specifically with Onyx coming to market here and then intermediate risk and then Micra is new too. So, could you give us some color commentary on those things and what\u2019s really driving the CVG growth? Omar Ishrak : I\u2019ll let Mike answer that question. So, go ahead, Mike. Mike Coyle : Yes. We\u2019re heading into particularly I think attractive pace for new product introduction. Obviously the 34 mm is now available in U.S. and in Europe and impacted the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve got the approval for Evolut PRO, which is our next generation valve, transcatheter valve in the U.S. that really didn\u2019t have an impact on Q4, but will in Q1 and that will follow on with European group in the first half of next year. As you mentioned Onyx in the U.S. is now approved didn\u2019t really impact Q4, but will for the rest of fiscal 2018. Micra and CRT-D quad, the MRI -- CRT-D quad will also have meaningful impact on the quarter. And as we move through the summer, we expect expansion of intermediate risk for core valve as well as Onyx approval in Japan and in the second half we will be looking at destination therapy for the hardware technology as well as drug-coated balloon improvement in Japan. So those will big the drivers of our growth in FY18. Matt Taylor : And maybe just a bigger picture question kind of for Omar and Karen. Just wondering, your emerging market growth is about 10% and you\u2019ve talked for long term about aspirational goals that are higher than that. Obviously you highlighted a lot of the moving parts with different geographies this quarter, but what you need to do to be able to push that rate up over time or is it just more of a function of how the micro environment is? Omar Ishrak : Yes, I think, look, we intend to move that up. I mean that is our goal. I think the move will be gradual, rather than sudden. So, expect that from us. I think there is enough macroeconomic uncertainty that what we have had is the odd region really getting hurt by that. I want to point out that these are macroeconomic, but like the Saudi situation, was not a reduction in implant rates. So, the procedures actually are pretty stable. But as these countries sort out their own management of inventory and their own ability to deliver these products, they are going through these moves, which drive some constrains in the sale of these products. So, I am not sure that they are all necessary bad as these markets stabilize over time. We are encouraged by the fact that the implant rates actually at the customer level continue to grow. That\u2019s one thing. So, the closer we get to these customers and more direct we become, I think you will start to see these rates start to go up in a systematic fashion. If I were to point one thing, it is our ability to go direct. I think the more we do that, the higher our growth rates will become, not only from immediate transition but ongoing growth as we get closer to these customers. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Two questions, first for Mike Coyle. Mike, it looks like you had a real solid U.S. ICD [ph] number in the quarter, and by our math, it looks like, you took share. It looks like you are taking share first because you are still in the only play with MRI safe and then second you are still dealing with their recalls. So, how should we think about the ability to continue capture share in the U.S. through this year and how should we think about share capture as we go into calendar 2018 when St. Jude and Boston get MRI safe in the U.S.? So that\u2019s for Mike. And then, for Bryan, can you quickly give us an update on the robot. I think at stages, we\u2019re talking about launch outside the U.S. for your surgical robot in fiscal 2018. Thanks. Mike Coyle : Glenn, I think we actually did have some meaningful share capture in the U.S. from really two sources, one was what was initial implant growth, which was approaching the single digit, which is pretty good given that the overall market was probably slightly down in terms of initial implants. But we also -- and as you point it\u2019s a combination of things, not just the MRI labeling that we have but also some very significant differentiation in each of the product categories. Our Visia AF is the only single-chamber device that can actually detect atria fibrillation and report it out, so essentially getting [indiscernible] with each single-chamber device. And then, the differentiated algorithms that we have within our CRT systems, the Adaptive CRT and quad CRT that have been showing reduced hospitalization for the recurrent heart failure. So, those are things that we think will continue to maintain differential advantage for us even after competitors match up on the MRI side, which was not the case, it was more of an equalization [ph] when they came out with the technology. But the other thing that was occurring during the quarter and we expect to continue to occur is that we\u2019ve actually had a nice improvement share on the replacement market and that is principally driven by that as you point out a major competitive recall but even more important by this TYRX [ph] program that was mentioned in the context of the commentary. Infections are particularly a problem in replacement procedures especially with ICD and CRT systems. And we instituted this risk-sharing performance guarantee program where an account can actually get, if you will, insurance on a patient combing back with an infection, we will make a major payment, [indiscernible] to help offset the cost of the infection, as they will lose money on given current reimbursement rates and what they have to do to treat those patients. But that\u2019s only available; they are actually using the envelope on a Medtronic device. So, that has actually resulted in a pretty big spike to percent increase in the number of devices that are going in on competitive leads. And so that is really helping us to drive growth. Glenn Novarro : Okay, great. And then, Bryan, on the robot? Bryan Hanson : Thanks for the question. So, we\u2019re finally in the fiscal year, we\u2019re planning on launching robotic system and I guess that we\u2019re pretty excited about it. It\u2019s at the end of the year, unfortunately; I wish it was in the beginning but it\u2019s at the end of the year. I will remind everyone that we don\u2019t expect material revenue in 2018; we do expect material revenue in 2019, as we\u2019ve been saying. But I want to make sure that we refocus everybody on our 10th year. In robotic system our goal isn\u2019t necessarily just to compete in robotics; this is a part of a much broader strategy for us. The fact is we\u2019ve got a lot of open procedures today that we truly believe should be done minimally invasively. And I am perfectly fine with them being done minimally invasively in a traditional sense or robotics. But either way, if we can do that, we can number one, fulfill the mission of the organization, because these patients will be treated in a much better way from an outcomes prospective. And all our stakeholders when we make this move from open to MIS. Byproduct is which we are really focused on. We don\u2019t have to add an additional patient to the surgical funnel, but if we can make this shift from open to any form of minimally invasive surgeries, we can add a $10 billion marketplace. So that\u2019s the $10 billion price of that a single new patient just changing the way the patient is treated. And we do feel that there will be some period of time that we will be the only medical device company in the world that will be able to offer a full complement of products and open traditional MIS and robotics and on top of that bringing these optimization services to the operating room. So we\u2019re pretty excited obviously and looking forward to the launch. Glenn Novarro : And the U.S. launch is still in fiscal 2019, is that correct? Bryan Hanson : That\u2019s correct. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : I actually have two. The first one was to go back to the view towards operating synergies. As you end the near of the end -- near the end, I\u2019ll get there, of the Covidien synergy opportunity, where else are you going to be able to pull levers to get that leverage? Omar Ishrak : Well, like I mentioned little earlier and like we\u2019ve stated all long, the first area that we are already beginning to see some benefit from is in operations consolidation, in reducing our manufacturing footprint, consolidating many of the operations that we\u2019ve had around the world that we\u2019ve sort of instituted over time. So, we expect some gross margin improvement as a result of that and that\u2019s our first focus. Beyond that through the Covidien integration, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to put in place a new IT system and SAP. And I think the benefits of that will play itself out over a longer period in the next few years as we reduce our back office footprint in different centers around the world. I think those are the two big ones. I think following that we are also looking at creating more-efficient shared services in some of our functions, which again the availability of an IT system facilitates that as well. So, those are the approaches that we are going after and we are building a pretty solid strategic roadmap to execute that. Joanne Wuensch : That\u2019s helpful. And as my second question, we\u2019re a little bit over a year on the implementation of the CMS bundled payment program in the U.S. What observationally have you learned and how have you incorporated that into your business practices? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Yes. We\u2019re over a year into the first one, the auto program and the uptake from different hospitals has been relatively slow; I think they are picking up on it and I think that\u2019s progressing. We\u2019ve got our own offering that you will start to hear about more this year. But in addition, what\u2019s equally significant is that CMS has introduced some cardiac bundles, and we are also in the process of coming up with offerings in those areas. We are actually -- we have a lot more experience and clear data that we already have of benefits that we can get by looking at the therapy over an extended period. So, we still are supportive, very supportive of CMS\u2019s move toward these value-based bundle payments. I think these programs have clear outcome measures. They identify the patient cohorts that get these treatments. And these are areas where we can have -- we can make contributions, both in the care pathway itself working with our physician customers and partners, as well as in technologies. So, we are very supportive of these, and we are seeing hospitals beginning to start to implement these procedures. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Matt Miksic : So, I have got one, I want to dive a little deeper into the transcatheter valve business and also maybe just to touch deeper into spine. So, TAVR, put up a very strong worldwide number, better than what you are expecting and highlighted the impact of larger size valve. Mike, I was wondering if you could provide any color or tone on maybe the market by geography, for example referrals in the U.S. or other factors and let us [ph] recall on other dynamics, potentially impacting Europe? And then I had one follow-up on spine for Geoff. Mike Coyle : Certainly, U.S. growth has been robust, high 30s for the U.S. market, I think it\u2019s being driven by two things, one is penetration into the intermediate risk, which of course we haven\u2019t had opportunity yet to participate in beyond our current trial enrollments, given that we don\u2019t have approval on that segment, but we do expect to get it here by the end of the summer. And then secondly, we have been taking share and exceeding the high risk patient population, principally driven by the presence of the 34 mm valve that was the segment that we described as being 30% of our mix. And that\u2019s proving to be true as we mobilize [ph] the market. But the other thing it does when we obviously have that full amount range of products is it lets you participate more broadly in the accounts. And so, we\u2019ve been expanding account penetration as well as expanding share in that segment. And obviously now the opportunity to bring Evolut PRO into the market, given its improvement in terms of both rates of PDL as well as reductions in pacemaker rates, we think really position us well to continue to kind of grow and pick share there. Europe was much more of share capture story as 34 mm came in later there. So, it seems the same dynamic in the U.S. but we also obviously have the benefits of some market dynamics there with the Lotus recall [ph] opening an opportunity for us to take some additional share as well. So, we had meaningful sequential share capture taking place there. There are obviously other dynamics there with some of loading of shelves in Germany at one of our competitors that even when we -- when we shift that, we see very significant share capture. And obviously we are continuing momentum in the OUS markets, probably low-20s overall growth or so. So I think that pretty much summarizes where the market is. Matt Miksic : And just to clarify, one of your colleagues in the U.S. market had talked about peers, I should say maybe not colleague but they have talked about smaller centers kind of surprising to upside in terms of productivity. Any color on that dynamic, the kind of core centers versus some of the newer TAVR centers? Mike Coyle : Well, they certainly are and the attention in terms of improving the productivity of patient flow through those centers and we are seeing that. So, I think that is opening up capacity but we are also seeing more centers actually being able to qualify to be TAVR centers, and so that number is well over 500 now and we continue to participate in probably 450 of those and we are going to expand as we move into the intermediate risk. So, I think all centers realize how important it is to be able to participate here given the patient demand and just the clinical benefits for patients to get TAVR technology. So, we continue to see -- for capacity to grow within existing centers and then for new centers to come on stream. Matt Miksic : And then, just -- thank you, Mike. And then, Geoff, the numbers for spine were also better than expected and in a market that frankly in the first quarter was maybe a little slower than we expected when we look across the group in general. And I wanted to just get a sense in the U.S. in particular, maybe just focus on, not so much the double digit, low double digit BMP growth but, but the core implants and rest of the business, the robots and any other initiatives, you mentioned a couple of products, what you call out in the U.S. that\u2019s helping sort of maybe reinvigorate that business a little bit? Geoff Martha : Sure. I would say excluding biologics and to answer your question, I\u2019d say there is three things. One, it\u2019s a steady launch of these new products in core spine, so whether it\u2019d be inter body changes, [ph] or a fixation, a steady launch of those and doing that as we talked about before at scale. So, it\u2019s a more simplified -- it is a sales force. It\u2019s a more -- and a lot of physician partners. So, we\u2019re launching these things in a steady cadence, a purposeful cadence, it\u2019s tied to procedures and when we launch them, we launch them at scale, all the stats, all the training, all that is happening in a tight window, much tighter window than we used to. We used to do this over nine quarters; we\u2019re now doing it over two. And that is having an impact in and of itself. So, the number of products, steady cadence and the way we\u2019re launching it at speed and scale initiative we\u2019ve been talking about. The second is the surgical synergy strategy. So, our view on -- a lot of people like to call it robotics and I think that\u2019s kind of a shallow thinking quite frankly. As we look at this, it\u2019s way beyond the robotic arm, it\u2019s a bunch of enabling technologies like navigation or operator imaging, the robotic arm, surgical planning, all this technology come together to go after these procedures and lower the cost or improve the clinical outcomes; that we\u2019re not placing a lot of that technology in exchange for incremental implant volume. And so that is having another impact. So that\u2019s the second big impact, because as we place that equipment in exchange for incremental volume. And then the third is our sales force is reinvigorated. They are seeing all this coming and what the future holds. And so they are very excited. And a lot of the competitor reps that are coming are also helping as well. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust Robinson. Bruce Nudell : A couple of quick questions for Mike and then one for Omar. So, Mike, your PCR and I was really struck by the net clinical benefit of left atrial appendage closure. Given the limitations of oral and quad [ph] therapy, is Medtronic in play and how big do you think that market gets? Secondly, [indiscernible] it was kind of hinted that the U.S. pivotal four transcatheter mitral valve replacement might start this year 2017, how big is that trial; how long might it take? And then for Omar, I met with a TAVR company from China yesterday and the price point is 25 grand but reimbursement is only to the tune of 30% or so. So, the question is, should we forever think of some of these emerging markets as low technology or basic technology plays or might that situation for high-tech stuff change over time? Thanks so much. Mike Coyle : Bruce to answer your question, just starting on LAA, that\u2019s the segment we don\u2019t currently participate in; that\u2019s a segment that our business development team keeps a pretty close watch on. We think there are puts and takes with the existing technology we think there maybe some better ways to go about this, we haven\u2019t seen anything yet that has caused us to want to jump in. But it\u2019s like anything else, we continue to look at it and then the progress follow the market and then technology that it is available. And then on your question around TMVR, it would be pretty mature to talk about this specific study design. We\u2019re still in discussions with FDA and what that might look like. We are now at essentially 50 implants with our existing intrepid system. We are increasingly enthused that we have the right design to go into clinical trials and we are working on the study design with FDA and will probably have more to say about that over the next quarter or two. Omar Ishrak : I think on the China question, that\u2019s actually a very good question, in terms of emerging markets in general. As these markets go to universal coverage, there will be a tendency to kind of homogenize the products. I think that\u2019s sort of encouraged us to take our value based healthcare analysis and business models to these emerging markets much more rapidly and in a much more accelerated fashion than we were thinking because the key to getting the differentiated pricing, if you like, is to demonstrate differentiated outcomes, which we think we can. And so that\u2019s how this is going to go and play there as well. We will demonstrate additional value with these differentiated products. If there is no value, we shouldn\u2019t be getting more price. And so, I think that\u2019s the way we have reported and it\u2019s really a slight sort of reprioritization of our own strategies in the sense of the value based healthcare effort is now getting increasing traction in some of these emerging markets. We\u2019ve previously thought that that was in access only situation but we think now access couple with value based healthcare, in fact making sure that we get differentiated products with fair pricing in all these markets as universal coverage kicks in. Karen Parkhill : Before we end Q&A, I want to correct a statement that I made on the guidance around the quarterly gating. We do expect revenue growth for the full year, as I said, to be in the 4% to 5% range and looking at the first quarter, I had said the fourth quarter but I meant to say the first quarter. Looking at the first quarter, we would expect total Medtronic revenue growth to be similar to that annual range. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Thank you, Karen. And thanks to all of you for your questions. On behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q1 call which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, August the 22nd. Thank you all very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Darla and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Medtronic First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning. Please go ahead. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thank you, Darla. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our first quarter which ended on July 28, 2017. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook as well as details related to our patient care, nutritional insufficiency and DVT divestiture to Cardinal Health. During this call, many of the statements maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 and rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis. Finally, other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Good morning and thank you, Ryan and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $7.4 billion representing growth of 4%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.12 growing at 11%. Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our underlying businesses and the stable growth of our markets as well as the diversification benefit of our groups and regions. While the temporary sensor supply constraint and an IT disruption affected first quarter revenue growth, we continued to drive operating margin expansion. This margin improvement combined with the previously communicated tax benefit this quarter translated into strong earnings leverage. Looking ahead, we have now entered a period of clear acceleration in our innovation cycle and we expect to see increasing revenue momentum from several important new product launches over the balance of the fiscal year. Before discussing the details of the meaningful progress we are making in each of our growth strategies, let me briefly cover two specific issues that affected our first quarter performance. In our Diabetes Group, we are experiencing strong demand around the world for our new diabetes technology. This demand is a direct result of our differentiated strategy to move towards fully closed loop systems, which utilized our algorithms and CGM sensors to automate insulin dosing. We launched the MiniMed 640G in international markets in 2015 and the world\u2019s first hybrid closed loop system the MiniMed 670G with Guardian Sensor 3 in the U.S. in June. These advancements have increased our installed base and market share resulting in a large increase in CGM demand above our already high expectations. To put it in perspective in just the past 10 quarters since launching the 640G, our overall sensor unit demand has more than doubled. The increased demand is largely for the new highly accurate generation of sensors enhanced in light in international markets and the Guardian Sensor 3 in the U.S. and has temporarily outstripped our production capacity. We accelerated plans to increase sensor production capacity last year. But these lines are not expected to be ready for commercial production until our fourth quarter at which time we expect to have the capacity needed to meet the rapidly growing sensor demand. Until then we have to prioritize sensor fulfillment towards our installed base of customers. In the short-term, this leaves less available for high revenue generating new patient system sales. It is also important to note that our priority access program necessitated by the early approval of the 670G which allowed customers to purchase a 630G and then swap it for 670G once available for a small fee has been very successful, with close to 32,000 enrollees exceeding our original expectations. However, because we only recognized a small portion of deferred revenue when exchanging the pumps the program currently affects both revenue and margins. We expect to complete fulfillment to our priority access customers later this fall. owards the end of the fiscal year, we expect our diabetes group to be in a position to capitalize on its differentiated innovation in the marketplace with stronger revenue and profit growth not only from increasing sales of our leading insulin pump technology but also ongoing sensor annuity revenue. Next, let me update you on the IT system disruption that occurred in June. As we communicated over the course of the quarter publicly, including an 8-K and 10-K filings, we experienced a global disruption to an IT system on June 19 that affected our ability to process, ship and manufacture orders globally. During the days following, we mobilized resources as quickly as possible to not only identify the underlying issue, but also put in corrective measures to restore the system. As a result our system was subsequently and fully operational later in that week. After the system had been fully restored we engaged Ernst & Young to conduct an independent root cause analysis in partnership with our own technology experts and our vendor partners. The independent analysis concluded that the root cause was due to inadvertent human error which caused the mis-configuration within certain data storage systems and resulted in our IT system becoming inoperable. Both our internal analysis and the independent analysis found no evidence of external actor involvement, data exposure or compromising this event. Based on our internal findings and that of UI, we are taking appropriate actions to prevent this type of event from happening again, including but not limited to improvements aimed at IT network design, hardware and software systems enhancements, operating processes and execution and governance. While the IT disruption did have some impact on our overall performance for the quarter it was not material for our quarterly revenue or earnings per share. We continued to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and double digit EPS growth in line with our long-term expectations. This event could have had a more significant impact in the quarter if not for the outstanding work and commitment of our employees around the world and the understanding and the partnership of our customers. Our team rose to the occasion to ensure product was available to customers and patients during the discussion and then worked tirelessly to fulfill backlog that built up during the event. This resilience and round-the-clock commitment of our Medtronic team made all the difference and ultimately allowed us return to normal operations expeditiously and effectively. There is no longer any outstanding backlog associated with this event and our IT system is operating normally. We are pleased to put this event behind us. Now let\u2019s discuss each of our growth strategies; therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. In therapy innovation we are seeing strong adoption of our innovative new products across all of our business groups. In our cardiac and vascular group which grew 6% we are leveraging the breadth of our products and services as well as our strong positions in important rapidly expanding markets to drive sustainable growth. In the first quarter transcatheter valves, AF ablation, LVADs, transcatheter pacing systems, insertable diagnostics, atherectomy and drug coated balloons all contributed to CVG\u2019s strong performance. In TAVR we delivered growth in the high-30s in both the U.S. and international markets. And looking ahead to expect our recent U.S. FDA approval for intermediate risk and global rollout of our Evolut PRO valve to drive continued TAVR growth. In coronary, we gained drug-eluting stent share with our recently approved Resolute Onyx in both the U.S. and Japan. And we expect this product to increasingly drive meaningful coronary growth as we go through the fiscal year. Next our minimally invasive therapies group grew 3% or 5% after adjusting for the divested businesses that will no longer be part of our reported results starting in the second quarter. With mid single-digit growth in our Surgical Solutions division driven by new products in Advanced Energy and Advanced Stapling. In Advanced Energy, we continue to rollout the new LigaSure instruments in our Valleylab FT10 energy platform. In Advanced Stapling, our endo stapling specialty reloads with Tri-Staple technology are driving growth. We also continue to rollout Signia, our new single-handed powered surgical stapling system that provide surgeons with real-time feedback during surgery. These innovations are providing momentum to the transition from open surgical procedures to minimally invasive procedures, or MIS resulting in better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs. At the end of this fiscal year, we intend to further our goal of moving procedures from open to MIS with the first-in-human use of our surgical robot platform. We look forward to bringing a more comprehensive value proposition to our customers across all key surgical areas : open surgery, traditional MIS, robotic surgery and services. Our Restorative Therapies Group grew 2% this quarter. And within RTG, our Spine division grew 1%. We estimate that both the U.S. and global spine markets have slowed modestly. However, we continue to gain market share which we attribute to the success of our speed to scale new product launch initiative. We also continue to gain market traction with our surgical synergy strategy growing the number of customer contracts that combine our spine implants with capital equipment for imaging, navigation and powered surgical instrumentation sold by our neurosurgery business. Our Brain Therapies division grew 7% driven by high-teens growth in Neurovascular and high single-digit growth in Neurosurgery. Brain Therapies continues to see traction from our recently launched StealthStation S8 surgical navigation system and strong low 30s growth of our Solitaire family of revascularization devices for acute ischemic stroke. Turning to diabetes, while revenue growth declined 1% given the reasons mentioned earlier, we gained global durable pump and consumables share driven by significant clinician and customer demand for our 6 series pumps. CGM revenue grew in the low 20s, including growth of nearly 50% in international markets driven by demand for our sensor-augmented pumps and improved sensors. The Guardian Sensor 3s coming off our production line consistently demonstrate the MARD, which is a measure of sensor accuracy of 10.4% in a real world setting in line with the performance we saw in the pivotal studies, with a much larger sample size. Next, let\u2019s turn to our globalization growth strategy. Emerging markets grew 12% in line with our long-term double-digit growth expectations as we continue to expand access to our products and services around the world. Our consistent emerging markets performance continues to benefit from geographic diversification, with strong results across the globe. Latin America grew 16% with double-digit growth in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina with continued strong results in China growing above the market with 12% growth as we continue to consistently perform in a complex environment that we believe will become one of our largest markets. Southeast Asia delivered 12% growth, with Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand all delivering robust results. In the Middle East, we grew 12% as we begin to see recovery in the region. In particular, Saudi Arabia grew in the mid-30s, our first quarter of growth in six quarters as customer inventory levels appear to have normalized and hospitals have to begun to purchase again. Let\u2019s turn now to our third quarter strategy, economic value. We continue to see success in our Hospital Solutions business, which grew double-digits as we are now managing cath labs and operating rooms for nearly 140 customers around the world, including our first in Mexico. We are also seeing strong growth in our TYRX value-based program for infection control and implantable devices more than doubling the accounts and the contract in the quarter to 325. Now, approximately 10% of our U.S. CRHF implantables revenue is covered under a TYRX related value-based healthcare risk sharing arrangement. In diabetes, we were pleased to announce a new outcomes-based agreement with Aetna. We are a component of our pump reimbursement with now successfully meeting clinical improvement thresholds. We are aggressively developing other unique value-based healthcare solutions across each of our groups. While we are still early in the journey, we remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improved patient outcomes over volume. As always, we expect to do this in a way that benefits patients and healthcare systems as well as our shareholders. Before turning the call over to Karen, I would like to highlight that we closed our transaction of Cardinal Health at the beginning of the second fiscal quarter, divesting a portion of our patient monitoring and recovery division. We expect this transaction to have a positive impact on our revenue growth rates and margins with modest near-term earning solution. We remain committed to the disciplined portfolio management and capital deployment that balances return to shareholders with reinvestment in internal and external opportunities that are aligned with our growth strategies and are expected to drive strong financial returns. With that that let me ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our first quarter financials and outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Omar. As Omar mentioned our first quarter revenue of $7.390 billion represented an approximate 3% [Technical Difficulty] and approximately 4% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency had a negative $33 million on first quarter revenue and tuck-in acquisitions completed almost a year ago contributed approximately 140 basis points to revenue growth, driven in part by the benefit gained from Medtronic ownership. Our revenue fell just shy of 4% growth by approximately $30 million on a total of $7.4 billion. When we updated our guidance in July, we expected our revenue would be slightly higher, but the IT disruption caused the unique dynamic affecting our visibility through quarter and as we worked to clear the order backlog including higher than expected sensor demand in diabetes. And as you know given the buying patterns of our customers we tend to have a larger amount of sales in the last few weeks of every quarter in some of our businesses. Importantly as Omar mentioned the IT system disruption is behind us and we are seeing strong demand for our new technologies giving us confidence in our revenue expectations for the remainder of the year. In the quarter we delivered continued operating margin expansion and strong EPS leverage. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.74, non-GAAP was $1.12. After adjusting for the $0.02 negative impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 11%. Our operating margin for the quarter was 26.9% on a constant currency basis representing a year-over-year improvement of 50 basis points. With the impact of currency included our first quarter non-GAAP operating margin also improved increasing 10 basis points year-over-year. Taking into account currency any the acquisitions that we have done in the past year, our operating margin improvement on an organic basis was approximately 70 basis points in the quarter. The operating margin improvement was driven by efficiencies as we continued to deliver on our Covidien synergies. This was partially offset by purposeful investments we are making in sales and marketing in the first half of the fiscal year to support new product launches. Net other expense which is included in our operating margin was $66 million compared to $39 million in the prior year and negatively affected our operating margin improvement by 30 basis points. The increase in net other expense was due in part to foreign exchange re-measurement and our hedging program which combined were $5 million loss in the quarter versus the $4 million gain in the prior year. Looking ahead we expect net other expense to be approximately $110 million per quarter and slightly higher than that in the second quarter. This includes approximately $30 million to $40 million per quarter of hedging expense based on recent exchange rates. Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $194 million, slightly less than our original expectation as income earned on our cash investments helped to offset debt expense. Looking ahead, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $180 million to $200 million a quarter. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 13% and benefited from $47 million an operational tax adjustment that became evident and were communicated late in the quarter. Excluding these adjustments our non-GAAP nominal tax rate would have been 15.7%, in line with our expectations between 15.5% and 16.5% for the remainder of the year. First quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.376 billion shares. We repurchased a net $1.1 billion of our ordinary shares in the first quarter, executing the annual return commitment to shareholders, concluding our incremental $5 billion commitment announced in January 2016, and pulling forward some of our incremental $1 billion repurchase commitment from our divestiture to Cardinal Health given our lower stock price. We expect shares to continue to come down in Q2 and then stay roughly flat for the remainder of the year given our tendency to purchase shares earlier in the fiscal year. In June, we increased our cash dividend by 7% making this our 40th consecutive year delivering a dividend increase. Combining our share repurchase activity with the $625 million we paid in dividends in the first quarter, our total payout ratio was 111% on non-GAAP net income and 169% on GAAP net income. Keep in mind, our payout ratio was elevated as we tend to execute the majority of our annually planned share repurchases early in the fiscal year. Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to reiterate our annual guidance and updated with the completion of our divestiture to Cardinal Health, which occurred at the start of our second quarter. For fiscal year 2018, we expect comparable constant currency revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 5%, which removes the divested revenue from the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2017 as well as the impact of currency. On a comparable basis, the divestiture is expected to result in more than a 30 basis point improvement given the partial year impact to our fiscal \u201818 revenue growth. This translates into a full year annualized recurring growth rate benefit of approximately 50 basis points as highlighted previously. While we recognized the divestiture as a positive impact to our guidance range, the current supply constraint in diabetes will continue to impact growth in that business until later this fiscal year. Looking at revenue growth by our business group, for CVG, quarterly growth rates have typically been between 4% and 7% in recent years. Given the strength of its near-term pipeline and easing prior year comparison, we now expect CVG to grow in the upper half of its historical range for the full fiscal year. We expect CVG\u2019s growth to be strong in the second and third quarters before facing a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter. MITG has typically reported growth rates between 3% and 4% excluding the impact of acquisitions and the divestiture is expected to increase growth by about a point. In fiscal \u201818 given the partial year impact of the divestiture and lower growth in the first quarter, we now expect MITG to grow in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. For RTG, quarterly growth have typically been in the 3% to 5% range in recent years, balancing strong growth in Brain Therapies against competitive challenges in pain therapies and a strengthening share position in a relatively flat spine market, we now expect full fiscal year growth for RTG to be at the low end of this historical range. Finally, in our Diabetes Group, historical growth before the recent market disruptions was typically in the high single-digits to low double-digits. With the impact of the temporary supply constraint, we now expect diabetes to grow in the range of 1% to 4% this fiscal year, with improvement in the second half as we fulfill the new 670G to non-priority access customers in the third quarter and increased our sensor supply in the fourth quarter. While the growth acceleration has been delayed by a few quarters, we expect to enter fiscal year \u201819 with ultimate strong double-digit growth in diabetes. Looking at the second quarter, we would expect to be in the lower half of our annual revenue growth range on a comparable constant currency basis with accelerating growth in CVG offset by a decline in diabetes in the high single-digits. Diabetes revenue is expected to temporarily decline sequentially before improving in the back half of the year for two reasons. First, we expect less deferred revenue recognition in the second quarter from our Priority Access Program as more pump shipments associated with this program occurred in the first quarter. Second while we will be able to fulfill new 670G customers after we fulfill the Priority Access customers. We anticipate that new sales will be muted until we can ultimately fulfill centers with pump. Only a limited amount of patients are likely to be willing to purchase the pump and wait for the sensors. With regard to operating margin, we expect solid improvement in the fiscal year with greatest strength in the back half. We expect our gross margin on a comparable constant currency basis to be flat for the year with modest pricing pressure offset by operating improvement. SG&A as a percent of revenue is expected to improve particularly in the back half of the year as we continue to execute on margin expansion opportunities and enabling functions, transition to centers of excellence and optimize our distribution channel. With respect to earnings, we continue to expect fiscal \u201818 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow in the range of 9% to 10% on a comparable constant currency basis. For the second quarter, we would expect temporary year-over-year decline in our growth and operating margin leading to EPS growth flat to slightly up on a comparable constant currency basis. Given the continued investments we are making to support product launches, the impact of temporary revenue declines in diabetes and the operational tax benefits we received in the prior year that are not expected to repeat. However, we continue to expect EPS growth and operating margin expansion to accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year. While the impact from currency is fluid and therefore not something we forecast if recent exchange rate which included \u20ac1.18 and JPY109 remained stable for the fiscal year. Our full year revenue would be positively affected by approximately $380 million to $480 million including an approximate $25 million to $75 million tailwind in the second quarter. Full year EPS would be affected by approximately negative $0.03 to a positive $0.01 including a positive impact of approximately zero to $0.02 in the second quarter. Finally, regarding free cash flow, we continued to expect it to grow in the high single-digit compounded annually from fiscal \u201816 to \u201818 albeit now on a comparable basis given the divestiture. To compare you should adjust for items that are considered part of the divestiture net proceeds like tax and transaction costs that affect free cash flow. These are expected to be approximately $400 million this fiscal year and $200 million next year. In addition, you should adjust for the loss of free cash flow generated by the divested businesses which was approximately $100 million per quarter. Without these adjustments free cash flow is expected to grow in the low single-digits compounded annually from fiscal year \u201816 to \u201818. Now I will turn the call back Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Karen. And looking ahead to the remainder of our fiscal year we have confidence in our guidance and visibility into the acceleration in our innovation cycle as we see momentum coming from several new product launches this fiscal year. And let me remind you of a few them. In CVG we now have intermediate risk approval in TAVR and are launching our new revenue Evolut profile. We are also in the early stages of market launch for new Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent our micro transcatheter pacing system and or MR-Conditional Quadripolar CRT pacemaker in our largest global markets. As we enter the back half of the fiscal year we expect to launch HVAD destination therapy and our next generation Azure [ph] wireless pacemaker family in the U.S. as well as the impact of to Admiral drug-coated balloon in Japan. In MITG as I mentioned earlier we are launching our Signia powered surgical stapling system and gearing up to release our surgical robot platform later this year. In RTG our product refresh in the spine continues and we are preparing to launch our Solera Voyager 5.5/6.0 fixation system. We are also seeing great traction with our StealthStation S8 navigation system and our continued partnership with Mazor and their Mazor X system. And in our diabetes group in addition to ramping up the 670G hybrid closed loop launch, we are also preparing to launch our standalone CGM system Guardian Connect in the U.S. later this year which will be combined with our sugar IQ app that utilizes IBM Watson cognitive computing. Let\u2019s now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen I will ask Mike Coyle, President of CVG; Bryan Hanson, President of MITG; Geoff Martha, President of RTG; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We want to try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question and if necessary, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question, please? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : Thank you, guys and good morning everybody. I wanted to start with two questions. So, first, there appeared to be somewhat conflicting statements and I understand part of it is legality on the impact of the computer outage. So, could you try and quantify, because obviously there is a comment in your prepared remarks as well as the press release that says that was not material. So, can you try and quantify what the impact was this quarter? And then second, obviously there is going to be a focus on the diabetes business and the step down to the outlook for the year. So, can you just spend a little bit more time on what\u2019s going on with the sensors and why now we are looking at effectively a backlog all the way out to the fiscal fourth quarter versus previously fall? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Yes. Let me quickly address the diabetes one and then I will let Karen address the IT system question. From diabetes, look, what\u2019s happened is the \u2013 our success rate with our products, which all have now sensor attachment, has actually been very high not only with the 670G here in the U.S. but with also the 640G which we launched in Europe roughly 2 years ago and that plus the Guardian Connect in Europe has really gained traction. And what\u2019s happened is the demand for the sensor really grows by multiple factors compared to just pump revenue, because for every pump, you need to supply sensors for the whole year in an ongoing basis. And so when you do that demand equation, that number comes to be a very large number and although we are accelerating the plans to add a new line, it just takes a little longer than one would want. I think that\u2019s all I can say that the attachment rates are much higher than previously envisaged that even a short while ago we were planning the number of customers who want the priority access for the 670G is also significantly higher than we were expecting. All of this leads to a multiplication of the number of centers that are required and when you do the math, it just comes to a very large number, which we just can fulfill immediately. But having said that, these are all things that are in our control and we are pretty confident that by the end of the year will be \u2013 diabetes will be able to take advantage of these new products which actually we have been driving to and are pretty revolutionary in their own right. So, Karen, you want to say something on the IT? Karen Parkhill : Yes, on the IT outage, it\u2019s very difficult to separate and quantify the impact related to the outage. We did say that it is not material to the first quarter revenue or earnings per share, so very difficult to quantify beyond that. Mike Weinstein : Okay, alright. So, just two follow-ups, so one on the sensor side, it appears part of the problem is that as you are moving to a lower MARD, it\u2019s harder to manufacture the sensors, we all are aware of that, but just it sounds like the yields aren\u2019t as good and that the reliability in terms of the life of the sensors isn\u2019t as good, so you are having to include an extra sensor in the packets that we are shipping out. So, can you comment on that? And then just the other follow-up is the change in the MITG guidance, the increase was less than we were expecting post the divestiture and that part looks like to a weaker performance in general surgery this quarter. So, could you just comment on the MITG business effectively and say why didn\u2019t guidance move up more there given the divestiture and why was general surgery weak? Thanks. And I will let others jump in. Omar Ishrak : Okay. First of all, with the diabetes, it is not an issue of yield at all. The yield is perfectly good and in line with our expectations and the number of sensors that are required are the standard number of sensors that we expect for patients to cycle through. So, that is really not the issue at all. We are extremely confident in our manufacturing, the process, the yields resulting in much more accurate sensor performance. And this is purely an issue of acquiring capital equipment that needs to be approved by the FDA and put in place. And when that happens we will release sensor capacity. This has got nothing to do with any yield differential of any or need for cycle these sensors any quicker than is normally expected? Hooman Hakami : Yes. Mike the only thing I would just add to that if you really take a look at what Omar mentioned with respect to the dynamics this is purely a function of increased demand, not manufacturing output or manufactured performance. And maybe two statistics to keep in mind, you heard in the commentary our installed base demand for sensors in Europe was 50%. We were expecting growth in Europe, but 50% was more sensor utilization than what we were expecting. The second that you heard from the commentary is that there were 32,000 priority access patients that signed up that was a 30% increase versus what we expected. So this is purely a function of increased demand not as Omar pointed out of anything to do with yields or lower marks [ph]. Our marks are great, our yields are totally in line with expectation, it\u2019s just our ability to meet demand and this is a temporary thing. Karen Parkhill : Keep in mind that our diabetes patients on 640G do not need to use the sensor attached. But they are choosing to use it more and more often because of the accuracy with that sensor. And that is one of the reasons that the demand was higher than we originally anticipated. In regard to MITG, we do expect revenue growth for the year now to be 3.5% to 4.5% and that does include the positive impact of the divestiture for the partial year of about 30 basis points. On a full year basis we would expect that to be about 50 basis points, so we are increasing our guidance in that business line. Hooman Hakami : Thank you, Mike. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Mike. We will get the next question? Operator : And from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Just a couple of questions for me, the first is for Geoff and then maybe one for Omar. Geoff, just to talk about just RTG kind of broadly for a second, sort of a tale of two cities, the core spine numbers to us looked better actually, I wonder if you could talk about your share momentum in core spine relative to what we have seen which is industry weakness amounts most of your peers in spine and then of course offsetting that is SCS and TBS [ph] businesses just based on product cycle innovation are not doing as well and when do you think those businesses can begin to stabilize and why? Then I had a quick follow-up? Geoff Martha : Yes. In the spine market look, we have seen a little bit of softness this last quarter. We had the spine market growing like 1% to 2% historically in the last two quarters Q3 and Q4 for us. We \u2013 Medtronic we were at 3% overall growth. We had the spine market, it\u2019s hard for us we are triangulating. We don\u2019t get market data for a couple of more weeks. But based on what we can see we have new market relatively flat maybe 0.5% growth. So that definitely had an impact on us this quarter. But we are still gaining share and we think it\u2019s on the strength of one our product releases and this whole methodology of launching them around speed to scale. And then our surgical synergies deals which I think will build momentum as we get continue to expand our partnership with Mazor. But right now over 5.5% in the U.S. of our core spine volume is tied in with these capital deals and that\u2019s a growing number. So the two factors that are driving the business once is just product releases and we will see that continue throughout the year. Second half we have a couple of new product releases coming and launching in the speed and scale manner and then combining them with the capital equipment. And that is obviously it when you look at as vis-\u00e0-vis the other multinationals we are performing quite a bit better. And on the pure plays I mean the gap is very \u2013 is narrow dramatically. And as we move forward with introducing robotics in the portfolio with Mazor ICS and plus our continued product launches in core spine I feel good about where we are and I see positive momentum. But you are right, that\u2019s been offset by pain stem in TBS. And pain stem has been declining in that mid single-digits, even little higher over the last couple of quarters and the catalyst for change there is going to be Intellis which we plan to launch in the back half of the calendar year. And Intellis will be the smallest implantable rechargeable system on the market 40% smaller than our current one with a state-of-the-art programmer. I mentioned it\u2019s rechargeable and it will be a fast recharge like 75% faster than our current and it\u2019s upgradable and you are right, but you are also able to download novel stim patterns and algorithms as we are investing in. And you combine that with our evolved work flow that we launched a few quarters ago, which is definitely helping us. I think that will stabilize that business. And then again, we are continuing to invest in novel stim patterns, which this Intellis platform we will be able to handle. And then DBS, that\u2019s going to take a little bit longer. I mean, we are funding that business in terms of our R&D, but it will be probably several quarters over a year before some of these new innovations come to market that we have talked about in terms of our new steerable leads, our new PC+S system and then a very novel cranial mounted rechargeable system. So, DBS is it a little bit further out and then we see Pain Stim when Intellis launch and the dynamic that\u2019s shifted as spine has gone up and Pain Stim has gone down, DBS was still performing. In this past quarter, it started to shrink a little bit as Boston got on the market in Europe with their MR compatible system. David Lewis : Okay. Thanks, Geoff. And my two follow-ups, one for Bryan, I don\u2019t know if I caught the specific answer in MITG. It did look on the margin there is a little core softness in MITG across some of the major segments. I don\u2019t know if there is anything you will be willing to call out there? And then for Omar, now that you have closed the divestiture, can you just kind of level set us in terms of where we should be thinking about priorities of future free cash and the broader balance sheet and most specifically as it relates to buyback after you complete the $5 billion dollar program? And then just M&A, how investors should be thinking about your priorities here mid-tier, larger acquisitions or more smaller growth innovative deals? Bryan Hanson : Yes. From a margin perspective in our business, I don\u2019t see anything with probably similar to the mix in the quarter, I don\u2019t see anything that would continue there. And just real quick on general surgery in a question was asked previously, it was a little lighter in the quarter likely due to surgical volumes. It reacts more to surgical volumes than our advanced energy business and advanced business overall. And so that\u2019s why we saw little bit of weakness in general surgery versus what we have seen in the past. It is almost directly impacted by these surgical volumes and that was the reason for the softness. Omar Ishrak : And with respect to the questions for me, let me start with the acquisition strategy. Look, we remain focused on tuck-in acquisitions today and they worked for us. We have converted them into the ones that we have done. We are converting them quite smoothly into organic growth drivers for us over time. We are not really focused today on transformative M&A. Remember we are still in the last year of integration of Covidien. We just did a divestiture that is separation agreements that we have got to follow through. So, we are focused on executing these big sort of bets in many ways that we made. And we continue to have very disciplined approach to pursuing tuck-in acquisitions and we intend to continue with our approach. Over the long-term, we will continue to build value for shareholders and we look at opportunities that are accretive to margins and growth trajectories that support our strategic priorities. I think Karen can comment a little bit on the capital allocation perhaps on the buyback as well. Karen Parkhill : Sure. As you have heard us talk about in the past time, we are focused on paying back to our shareholders in the form of those dividends and share purchases and that won\u2019t change. We are also focused on balancing that payback with continued reinvestment in our own business, so that we can continue to grow that long-term value of Medtronic. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Thank you, David. Darla, can we have the next question please? Operator : It\u2019s from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Thanks and good morning. Omar Ishrak : Good morning. Bob Hopkins : I just wanted to ask two questions that really sort of clarify the guidance maybe. And Karen to start out this is pretty simple math, but just to confirm the new EPS guidance for fiscal 2018 including Cardinal by my math based on your new disclosure it sums to about 475 to 480 is that correct? Karen Parkhill : Yes. We don\u2019t comment directly on exact EPS guidance. But we do expect \u2013 continue to expect 9% to 10% growth on the base of last year. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. Bob Hopkins : Well, obviously, you give all the moving pieces in your disclosures and I just wanted to make sure that we had that right, but I guess we can follow-up offline on that, but our math tend to run 475 to 480 and I guess the other EPS clarifying question that I had was it I am just trying to reconcile the old guidance to the new guidance and understand maybe what has changed I know you are now giving your growth targets off of pro forma numbers, but I mean your old guidance called for 9% to 10% underlying EPS growth on legacy Medtronic and then $0.05 to $0.10 hit and then you said Cardinal will dilutive by $0.18, those are the three sort of big pieces to your old guidance and I am just curious could you help us understand what\u2019s changed with this new guidance, obviously we can see that FX has gotten better, but as I sum through all the matter it seems like something must have gotten a little bit worse either the Cardinal dilution or maybe the base business due to other income or diabetes so I am just trying to understand what\u2019s changed relative to the old guidance you never used to give it? Karen Parkhill : Sure. I would say that the biggest thing that\u2019s changed is in our diabetes business and the impact of the lower revenue growth until the end of the fiscal year given the demand and supply constraints and that guidance does ultimately have an impact through the P&L. And so that does also affect the bottom line. Beyond that we do expect that to be offset by some better guidance in CVG than initially given. Given the strength of that new pipeline and on an EPS perspective, we do expect that the dilutive impact of the transaction is still $0.18 on a net basis after taking into account the use of proceeds on a gross basis when you are looking at the numbers that we provide to reset your base on a gross basis that would translate into about $0.23 dilutive before taking into account these proceeds. Bob Hopkins : And do you have a number that quantifies the impact of the diabetes change in guidance for this particular quarter what the impact was on organic growth? Karen Parkhill : I would say that again difficult to give you an exact dollar amount of the impact to the quarter of the demand and supply equation. But clearly it did impact us to perform under what we had initially guided for the diabetes business last quarter. Bob Hopkins : Okay, thank you very much. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Bob. Next question? Operator : It\u2019s from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Hi, guys. How are you? Omar Ishrak : Good Kristen. Kristen Stewart : I have missed you all. I guess I have just a couple of more strategic questions and I just want to clarify just on diabetes it sounds like the demand is just more overwhelmingly positive, has this changed your mind from a strategic perspective \u2013 I am sorry for the background, just in terms of wanting to change your thoughts on going more from a consumer level because you have 30% more demand for like using 640G with the sensors why not think about going more just to our base business not going more the professional route? Omar Ishrak : This for central\u2026 Hooman Hakami : So Kristen hi, this is Hooman, nice to hear your voice. The \u2013 let me just touch on that. First of all it is as we talked about purely a demand equation. And as you rightly pointed out, we have Enlite 1 sensor, our Enlite enhanced sensor, our Guardian Sensor 3. All of those are experiencing strong demand which as Omar and Karen mentioned we are working to fill the capacity in order to meet that demand. It doesn\u2019t change our strategy overall, number one. So strategically actually this increased demand means the strategy is working. With respect to sensor augmented systems and then as far as personal versus professional CGM, I would say two things. One as Karen and Omar alluded to in the commentary we are still working with the FDA for the launch of our own personal CGM which should hopefully happen in this year. The Guardian Connect sensor with sugar IQ, that\u2019s number one and on top of that we continue to go down the path within our non-intensive type 2 business to drive professional CGM more aggressively through primary care physicians. So we are pursuing all three of these angles and that\u2019s been the strategy and we will continue to try that strategy. Kristen Stewart : Okay, great, awesome. And so with the FDA just getting new lines of that just was causing more of the delay and causing the backup in demand, not I think you are pretty strong in saying Omar it\u2019s not yield? Omar Ishrak : Correct. Hooman Hakami : It\u2019s not deal, it\u2019s capacity just to meet the demand. Kristen Stewart : It\u2019s not the [indiscernible] of product and just the demand and getting more lines cleared by the FDA. Okay, perfect, that\u2019s clear. Okay. And then Omar, I am just curious on your thoughts of the recent FDA decision to kind of pull back on some of the bundled payments in terms of where care is going and the need to reduce care, but I am just curious on your thinking on whether this changes ultimately strategy and how you think about things going forward and then also just comments strategically on you there has been more consolidation in the industry, your thoughts competitively where you are stacking up and especially in light of the divestiture to kind of the evolution of Medtronic and where you are positioned now? Omar Ishrak : Okay. Thanks Kristen. First of all this year measurement it would be with the payment changes. The changes really that is not mandatory anymore. I think there is general encouragement to move more towards value based payments. And I think it\u2019s not only CMS but the commercial payers are also looking at it in that dimension. At the end of the day the value based healthcare is around improving outcomes at a lower cost. And I think that the trajectory is not going to change. I think is good realization of that. I think operationalizing this requires granular work and we are in the middle of that and we are driving that partnering with both providers and payers and CMS in doing so as we come up with the right models. So I would say that the change from the mandatory version is just that, it is not mandatory anymore. There is no real change in philosophy about the value of bundle payments and the importance of outcomes measurements. I think with respect to the industry value based care is where they industry has got to move to. Consolidation gives you a capability to have a seat at the table. It gives you more assets to use to deliver value based healthcare, because you probably need a variety of capabilities to do so. But at the end of the day, innovation in this industry that\u2019s relevant for patients is never going to go away. And let\u2019s not confuse getting broader in some ways with lack of focus in specific physician partnerships and therefore driving innovation which will then result in the higher value that\u2019s what MedTech does. And that is not going to go away. Hooman Hakami : Grea. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Thank you, Kristen. Next question please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let me just follow-up on the question that was asked earlier about weak U.S. surgical volumes and in the spine market, overall calendar Q2 was pretty mix with the large cap MedTech companies and with growth slowing, so I wanted to see if you guys could talk about why you think U.S. surgical volumes might have been weak maybe any inside on trends in July and August and why you think the spine market might be a little soft? And then I had a follow-up. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : I think there is two things on that, first of all always remember that the U.S. market is driven by innovation cycles. And as we go through our innovation cycles, the underlying market is really dominated by these growth spikes that as we get. And as we move into an accelerating phase of innovation you will see our U.S. almost go up. With respect to the underlying market there is a slight change which is in the range of changes that have happened in the past and you are right that surgical volumes overall have been a little softer as have spinal volumes. A lot of this has to do it electric procedures, people backing away from those. I think that\u2019s the best that I think that we have seen that there has been an intentional sort of conservatism if you like maybe a caution about their elective procedures right down the middle of the year. But again, it\u2019s within the range of movement of these markets over time. So, it\u2019s not anything beyond that. And I do think that innovation cycles are the ones that really moved these markets much more dramatically. And I think as we go through this period of accelerating innovation, you are going to see that. Larry Biegelsen : Any commentary on the spine softness, is that also procedure related? And just for my follow-up, maybe, Mike, there is a couple of presentations coming up at ESC that could impact your AFib business, CASTLE AF as well as renal denervation, the SPYRAL OFF MED trial. Could you talk about significance of those trials and any other color you might be able to add before the data? Thanks. Mike Coyle : Larry, on the spine market, I just \u2013 I do attribute it to what Omar was talking about these broader themes around elective procedures. A little more specifics we can rule out a few themes. I mean, we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 we do have some visibility in the payers and we haven\u2019t seen any increased pushback from payers, any increase like declines of procedures, because we do review insight into that. We haven\u2019t seen that. And then just talking to physicians, we haven\u2019t seen any other significant catalyst. They still seem pretty positive about the market. And so at this point, again like I mentioned earlier, we will get more procedural insights in a couple of weeks, because the market data has delayed a little bit, the data that we get. But at this point, we are attributing it to the broader elective procedure dynamics that Omar mentioned. Omar Ishrak : And then Larry on the questions about the clinical trials to come up here at ESC for late-breaking clinical trials, I don\u2019t have much to say on the CASTLE AF study until we actually see the results there. Obviously, our franchises are doing very well in that particular area both therapeutically with the cryoablation and continuing benefits from the FIRE and ICE study as well as obviously continued growth in the insertable loop recorder market, where frankly most of the growth that we see there is being dominated by its use in cryptogenic stroke and syncope. So, we don\u2019t expect those to be particularly impacted, but we will wait and see what those data are. As it relates to the renal denervation, obviously we have been working now for better part 3 years to basically look at the application of that therapy. We have changed the device obviously to the spiral device. We have changed where we are doing the application of energy to go more distal into the renal artery. We have changed the patient population that we are studying based on the evidence that we saw of who responded and who didn\u2019t in the original HTN-3 study. And we also have obviously now executed on randomized clinical trial, sham-controlled for the both on and off, on-med and off-med arms and what\u2019s going to be presented at ESC next week is the off-med patient cohort there. So, we think that\u2019s probably the purest look at the therapeutic value of renal denervation. There will be simultaneous publication for that and we will discuss those results after they are actually presented at ESC. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Larry. Next question, please Darla. Operator : It\u2019s from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Hi, good morning guys. I just want to ask one more question on surgical volume, so we get it spine volumes in the U.S. were slower in 2Q and there was some softness in general surgical trends in 2Q, but can you give us your expectations for the second half of this calendar year. And the reason I am asking is because one of things we have heard is that these higher \u2013 lower premium higher deductible plans are starting to push more and more cases into the fourth quarter similar to what we see in knees and hips. So, is that a possible explanation as to why we saw some softness in 2Q and is that a reason for volumes to get stronger in the back end? So I am just wanting your thoughts on that? And then I just had a follow-up question for Mike Coyle. Omar Ishrak : Okay, Bryan, why don\u2019t you take that? Bryan Hanson : Yes. So, what I would tell you is that thinking in Q2 we get \u2013 it\u2019s not a perfect science by the way. And so if you look at the variables that would drive the lower surgical volumes in a quarter it\u2019s very difficult to say what variable actually had the biggest impact. So, I don\u2019t want to draw any conclusions there. What I know is that from our own field sales organization from some of our key competitors that plan to space in their general surgery type products if there was softness in the quarter. I don\u2019t want to read too much into that though, because it\u2019s one quarter. We have quarters that are up \u2013 quarters that are down, so I am calling this a trend at all at this point. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to draw any conclusions to any strength that would be happening in the fourth quarter as result of this. One other thing I would mention in our Advanced Surgical business though we always look at surgical volumes, one of the key things we concentrate on is moving current procedures from open to MIS and that drives a lot of our growth. So, we are definite on surgical volumes, but not completely dependent on surgical volumes in that business. Glenn Novarro : Okay. And then, Mike, just two cardio questions, one maybe a little bit more color on what you are seeing in your core piecing business today given Abbott is now launched an MRI safe pacer and then you are bullish on your spend outlook over the next couple of quarters with the Onyx launch, but maybe talk about what\u2019s truly different about Onyx that could allow you to gain share in the stent market over the next, I don\u2019t know, 6 to 12 months? Thanks. Mike Coyle : Sure. On the pacing side, the market is very stable. We are seeing low single-digit to actually mid single-digit unit growth for initial implants. And obviously, we have seen some modest share loss to competitors as they have entered with MRI. But as that now we have brought out Micra both in the U.S. and Europe and we will be coming to Japan this quarter. We are obviously seeing recapture of especially the single chamber unit share at much higher prices obviously with the micro product. And as we head into the second half of this year, we will be releasing our next generation of pacing family, the Azure wireless pacer family both in Europe and in the United States. It\u2019s actually just been released in Europe and will be coming to the United States in the second half. So, we think we will actually get back into a share capture mode with that particular product. And then as it relates to the Onyx product, the feedback we have received from Europe and it\u2019s early release here in the U.S. and also in Japan is that it\u2019s the most deliverable stent in the market that it has the widest range of sizes and widths of any product that it basically can go anywhere and has great visibility. And we have seen it drive market share for us meaningfully in Europe to the point where we essentially recovered everything that had been given up as competitors are coming with their product. So, we are looking for a similar dynamic here in the U.S. and in Japan. And so we think we have obviously begun to see that. We are seeking a price premium for the product, which makes it a little slower in its ramp in terms of having to get approvals and committees to go on contract, but we are very encouraged with the feedback that we are receiving and we expect it to be a growth driver for us for the rest of the year. Glenn Novarro : Okay, great. Thanks Mike. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please. Operator : It\u2019s from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Matt Taylor : Hi, thank you for taking the question. I guess, it\u2019s the biggest change here. I just wanted to ask one follow-up on diabetes. As you are moving towards getting this new line up and running and adding that capacity, I guess can you help us understand what the gating factors are in terms of predicting that timing or what the bottlenecks could be with setting up that new line and what could push that timeline backward or forward if there is some conservatism in that guidance? Omar Ishrak : Yes. I think look the major variable here is just the FDA approval that we need for the capital equipment that\u2019s needed for the line. The rest of it is pretty straightforward. We are replicating a line, a process that we know how to do. And there is some level of things out of our control is the FDA time cycle for approval. It\u2019s not anything that\u2019s different from what we have got approved in the past and we expect this to go okay, but it is something that\u2019s out of our control. And I think that\u2019s the major factor in getting the lineup. Is there anything else from that? Hooman Hakami : No, that\u2019s exactly right. We know the equipment. We know the process. So bringing the equipment in doing all of the qualifications that\u2019s something we feel very comfortable with. Then there is obviously the variable of turning all of that over to the FDA and seeking their approval. So as Omar pointed out, that\u2019s the single biggest variable in this that has uncertainty around it, the other elements we feel very good about. Omar Ishrak : And just to make it clear, we have gotten approval for this kind of stuff from the FDA in the past without any issue. So, there is nothing that\u2019s any different, but it is something that needs approval. Matt Taylor : Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up on the presentation I noticed that CRT-D has actually declined low double-digits this quarter. So, I was curious if you could give us some color on that? I was a little surprise by the magnitude of that decline and if anything could change there, going forward to improve that? Omar Ishrak : Yes. The decline that you are seeing in the CRT-D is basically being driven by the U.S. and it is basically we are seeing low single-digit declines in initial implants for CRT-D. We are actually taking market share in the initial implants, but we are also now seeing sort of the low double low double-digit declines in replacements. This is something we talked about a year ago in Q1 and Q2 as a competitor who had a major recall at the end of our Q2 and into Q3 and Q4. That obviously drove competitive replacements for us, which masked if you will that decline that\u2019s really being driven by the extending of battery life in the CRT-D space. And that\u2019s what you are seeing sort of reflected in the numbers. The other major driver for that which is temporary to the Q1 results is that we saw fairly significant destocking of hospital held inventory in the United States in Q1, where essentially the hospitals are looking not to hold this much inventory of product and if they want to take it, they want significant discounts to restock that, which we have opted not to do. So, that is more of a temporary issue that what we think will not see this big of a magnitude of it going forward. Matt Taylor : Great. Thanks a lot for the color. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Next question please, Darla. Operator : It\u2019s from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much for taking my question. To me shift a little bit to the land of robotics, you have a new surgical robotics expected outside the United States this year and you mentioned Mazor in your comments. Could you please give us an update on your thinking about those two aspects of your portfolio? Omar Ishrak : I will let Bryan go first and then let Geoff talk about Mazor? Bryan Hanson : I couldn\u2019t hear you very well. What was the question on the surgical robotic system? Joanne Wuensch : Just an update on how you are thinking about the launch applications and differentiations and anything else you could add to the color of as we look towards that? Bryan Hanson : Well, obviously, we are pretty excited that we are in the fiscal year that we are going to get the first human use. So, that\u2019s a positive. We are in the \u2013 what I would define is the pilot phase build right now and we are obviously working very diligently for verification and validation and also any things that we need to put together for regulatory submissions. So, we are heading down the path, feel confident with what we have today. Obviously, with this complex of a product, a lot can happen in the VNV process, but we are feeling good about where we stand today. In the strategy, it\u2019s the same that I have mentioned before organization from a mission perspective is to move our patients from open surgery to MIS. This is another tool to ensure that we can do that. And we feel confident that once we have launched this, we are going to be in a unique position to bring more value than any other company in the world. We will be able to fully service open surgical procedures, traditional MIS procedures and robotic surgery as well as provide operational efficiency services within the operating room. So, we remain very confident in the product and we remain very confident in the overall strategy. Geoff Martha : And then this is Geoff on Mazor, as I think most people know, it\u2019s public, it\u2019s out there is our relationship with them has a continuum if you will and we are in this phase of the relationship is a lead sharing then if we hit certain milestones and they hit certain milestones, we move to more of a distribution. And the initial phase has gone very well. It\u2019s tested the hypothesis that we believe robotics has a strong place in spine surgery and it works well with our broader solutions around intraoperative imaging and navigation. And so we are very pleased with where the relationship is going. And I think we can talk more about this in the next quarter here in terms of moving towards distribution. In addition to that, a go forward look on tighter product integration with our navigation and intraoperative imaging systems as well as our spine implant business how this impacts their product roadmap as well, but the relationship continues to go well. It\u2019s growing. Our customers see a lot of value and not just the robot, but the robot \u2013 Mazor X robot used in conjunction with our intraoperative imaging system the O-arm 2 as well as our navigation platform StealthStation. Joanne Wuensch : Okay. Most of my questions have been answered. Thank you very much. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Joanne. Will take one more question please. Operator : And your final question will be from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Thanks for letting me in [ph] guys. I appreciate it. Want to spend a minute talking about the nature of your relationship with hospitals. There are couple of items here that have been brought upon that I thought are interesting, one was just the nature of surgical procedures and I am wondering if you are seeing any impact from the increase in prior authorization required by hospitals and payers before scheduling procedures, whether that\u2019s having an impact on volumes in spine and elsewhere in your business? Omar Ishrak : Look we don\u2019t have any direct insight into that. We don\u2019t hear of that as a specific reason. And like I said this range is within a fluctuation range that we have seen before. So we are gauging it in that light. And like we mentioned earlier electric procedures probably down a little bit, but again in the ranges we have seen before. And again let me emphasize that product innovation in this market is what really swings these markets. And we do think that for the right procedures where there is real value that the patient can see and the physicians can see the procedures that happen and they will grow when new innovation comes along. And we are in a period of accelerating that innovation, so we do expect our U.S. growth numbers to go up in the coming quarters, offset a little bit by the diabetes slowdown in the next quarter or so because that\u2019s mostly \u2013 almost all U.S. But really surgical procedures themselves I think again are in the range of history, historical trends. And we expect our product innovation to positively impact those markets. Isaac Ro : Okay. It\u2019s helpful. Maybe just from another direction I think there was an earlier comment on the CRT-D business with regards to hospital inventory, are you seeing at a higher level any change in the way hospitals manage their inventory for your products, I mean it seems like again that customer group is a little bit stretch in terms of their financial health and so just understanding how they are managing their cash flow and how that impacts you? Omar Ishrak : Well, I think the methodology for managing is more or less the same as it\u2019s always been and you go through these cycles again in the range that we have seen before. And look I hear too from hospitals just in general that they are concerned about their business flow. But again it\u2019s nothing that\u2019s more than what we have seen before and in that range. And for the right think they will do it. But their buying patterns are in line with what we have seen, nothing dramatically different. Isaac Ro : Okay. Thank you very much. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Isaac. Okay. So with that, let me thank you all for your questions and on behalf of the entire management team I would like to thank you again for your support and interest in Medtronic. And we look forward to updating you on our progress on our second quarter earnings call which we now anticipate holding on November 28 which is a week later than normal closing time needed as a result of the divestiture of the Cardinal Health. Thank you all. And have a good day. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Medtronic\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Medtronic's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Ryan Weispfenning. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thank you, Krystal. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our second quarter which ended on October 27, 2017. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. During this earnings call, many of the statements made maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and rates and ranges are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjust for our recent patient care, DVT and nutritional insufficiency divestiture, as well as the impact of foreign currency. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. Finally, other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning we reported second quarter financial results including revenue of $7.1 billion, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were a $1.07 growing 2% or 5% after adjusting for the approximate 3%, a $0.03 impact from Hurricane Maria. These financial results are very encouraging when considered in the context of a quarter in which we faced three hurricanes and the California wildfires. Hurricane Maria in particular significantly affected our manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico. The lives of thousands of our employees were affected by these natural disasters, yet the resiliency, dedication and persistence of our team to overcome these challenges was remarkable. Against this backdrop, which resulted in not only a quantifiable impact to our quarter but also an unquantifiable impact from the disruption to our teams. We delivered 3% comparable constant currency revenue growth or 4% excluding the direct impact from Hurricane Maria. Our performance continues to be driven by our growth strategies of therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. In therapy innovation as I noted last quarter, we have entered a period of clear acceleration in our innovation cycle. We see increased revenue momentum from several important new product launches which we expect will continue into the second half of the fiscal year. In Q2, organic growth in our Cardiac and Vascular Group was 6%, a sequential improvement of approximately 340 basis points and the main driver of our total company organic growth acceleration. Overall, CVG grew 7% year-over-year leveraging the breadth of its products and services, as well as its strong positions in important rapidly expanding markets to drive sustainable growth. In CRHF, which grew in the mid-single digits, we are maintaining market share in the core pacing ICD and CRT product lines while creating new markets that are meaningfully enhancing our weighted average market growth. This past quarter combined revenue from our high-growth CRHF product lines representing about a third of our CRHF business grew organically in the mid-20s. Specifically, these product lines included our infection control, diagnostics, transcatheter pacemakers, AF Solutions and Mechanical Circulatory Support systems. Similarly our CSH business is shifting its revenue mix towards higher growth transcatheter valve market which now represents about a third of total CSH revenues. In TAVR, we delivered low 40s growth in the U.S. and high 30s growth in international markets as we see both strong adoption around the world for our recently introduced Evolut PRO valve, as well as expansion in traditional U.S. TAVR centers and U.S. share capture resulting from our new intermediate risk indication. In Coronary, our DES product line returned to growth as we gain low to mid-single digits points of market share sequentially in both the U.S. and Japan driven by the recent launch of our Resolute Onyx in these markets. Next, our minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 2% less than our initially expected given the impact of Hurricane Maria. In Surgical Innovations our 4% growth was driven by new products in advanced stapling and advanced energy. In advanced stapling, growth was driven by our endo stapling specialty reloads with Tri-Staple technology, as well as Signia, our new single-handed powered surgical stapling system that provide surgeons with real-time feedback during surgery. In Advanced Energy, we experienced strong growth as we continue to rollout new LigaSure instruments and our Valleylab FT10 energy platform. These innovations are providing momentum to the transition from open surgical procedures to minimally invasive surgery or MIS resulting in better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs. As we look ahead, we see the opportunity to expand the availability of MIS procedures through the use of our surgical robot platform. The development team continues to drive toward first-in-human use by the end of this fiscal year. We look forward to offering a more comprehensive value proposition to our customers across all key surgical areas, open surgery, traditional MIS, robotic surgery and services. Next, our Restorative Therapies Group grew 2% this quarter less than initial expected given the impact of Hurricane Maria. Our Brain Therapies division had a very strong quarter with 13% growth. This was driven by high 20s growth in neurovascular with strength across the entire stroke portfolio and mid-teens growth in neurosurgery. Our Spine division declined 1%, a reflection of the hurricane impact, as well as a continued modest deceleration in the global spine market. Excluding the impact of Hurricane Maria, our core spine business performed better than the market. We attribute this is to the ongoing success of our speed to scale product launch initiative, as well as our surgical synergy strategy which combines our enabling technologies such as imaging, navigation, power systems, nerve monitoring and now Mazor Robotics with our spine implants to deliver integrated procedures. Inside the combination of our enabling technologies which are reported in our neurosurgery business with our spine revenue, resulted in 2% growth in Q2. We believe this is an indication of our overall growth in spine procedures and a more relevant comparison of our spine results against several of our competitors. Our Pain Therapies division recently received FDA approval at CE Mark for our Intellis spinal cords stimulator. While the initial rollout is affected by Hurricane Maria, the product has been received positively by our customer and we do expect Intellis to reverse the declines we have been experiencing with several quarters in the pain stem business. And finally the FDA lifted its distribution requirements in our implantable drug pump this last month and its warning letter earlier this month. The warning letter had affected not only our pain therapies division but also our brain modulation in public health businesses. Turning to Diabetes, revenue growth declined 2% better than what we had anticipated due to the strong demand from patients willing to purchase the MiniMed 670G pump ahead of the prepared CGM sensors. Although sensor supply constraints hampered overall growth, our ability to meet increasing patient demand has improved and our sensor capacity expansion plans are on track. Last month, JNJ announced that they were exiting the insulin pump market and we were pleased that they selected us as their partner of choice to facilitate the transition of the Animas patients. While the majority of the approximately 90,000 existing Animas patients are currently under warranty, we are actively working to ensure their smooth transition to Medtronic if they like to do so. Looking ahead we expect diabetes revenue growth to increase in the third fiscal quarter now that we've finished shipping pumps for our Priority Access Program and then continue to accelerate when we complete our sensor capacity expansion plans in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, our diabetes innovation pipeline remains robust across all three of its divisions. We're preparing for the international launch of the 670G and the U.S. launch of our standalone CGM system Guardian Connect with sugar IQ both later this fiscal year and our new professional CGM iPro\u00ae3 in FY 2019. Next let\u2019s turn to our globalization growth strategy. Emerging markets again grew 12% this quarter in line with our long-term double-digit growth expectations as we continue to expand access to our products and services around the world. Latin America grew 18% but Brazil our highest market in the region growing in the mid-20s. We continue to drive our channel optimization strategy in Latin America expanding our direct operations. In the Middle East and Africa we grew 13% as recovery in the region continues with strong growth in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Southeast Asia grew 12% with strength in spine, brain therapies and Coronary & Structural Heart divisions. Greater China also grew 12% with high-teens growth in RTG, mid-teens growth in MITG, and low double-digit growth in CVG. We've been outperforming the China market now for the past few years and believe we can continue this momentum over the coming quarters. Let\u2019s turn now to our third growth strategy economic value. As mentioned previously, we are seeing strong growth in our TYRX value based program for infection control and implantable devices. Nearly tripling the accounts under contract in the quarter to over 900 hospitals. This past quarter over 20% of our U.S. CRHF's implantable revenue was covered under a TYRX related value-based healthcare arrangement that links total payment to patient infection outcomes. In the past two quarters, we have rolled out additional value-based programs in CVG linking payment to improve patient outcomes that result directly from our innovative therapies. Specifically, as part of these programs a portion of our payment is tied to reducing reinterventions when using our AF ablation, AAA and DCB therapies and reducing rehospitalizations when using our ICD, CRT and AF ablation technologies. We are aggressively developing other unique value based solutions across each of our groups and regions. We remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improve patient outcomes over volume. We're increasingly partnering with additional stakeholders on the healthcare value chain, as we believe medical technology has a key role to play in delivering better outcomes while improving efficiency for healthcare systems. As always, we expect to do this in a way that benefits patients and healthcare systems, as well as our shareholders. With that, let me ask Karen to now take you through a discussion of our second quarter financials and outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you. As Omar mentioned, our second quarter revenue of $7,050,000,000 represented a 4% decrease as reported and growth of approximately 3.4% on a comparable constant currency basis or 4.3% when further adjusting for Hurricane Maria. Foreign currency had a positive $35 million impact on second quarter revenue and tuck-in acquisitions contributed approximately 30 basis points to revenue growth. While all four of our groups had some level of manufacturing in Puerto Rico, the direct financial impact of Hurricane Maria was limited to MITG and RTG. As Omar mentioned, through the hard work and determination of many colleagues, we utilized alternate manufacturing sites, directed field inventory movement, and ultimately we're able to restore operations more quickly than anticipated. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.48, non-GAAP was $1.07. After adjusting for the divestiture, the $0.01 positive impact from foreign currency and $0.03 negative impact from Hurricane Maria, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 5%. The operating margin for the quarter was 26.6% on a comparable constant currency basis representing a year-over-year decline of 100 basis points. As expected our operating margin declined in the quarter as we supported new product launches and experienced a temporary impact of lighter revenue in our diabetes group. In addition, the infusion set recall in diabetes and impact of Hurricane Maria further affected our second quarter operating margins. Despite the net decline, we continue to deliver on our Covidien synergies and expect to reach our goal of delivering $850 million of synergies this fiscal year. As we mentioned in the past, we expect to continue our focus on margin improvement even after delivery of the synergies and intent to provide detail on those ongoing activities in the near future. Non-GAAP net other expense which is included in our operating margin was $96 million compared to $65 million in the prior year, and negatively affected our operating margin by 20 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis. The change was impacted by increased expense related to our currency hedging program, as well as the prior year gain from our equity investment in hardware. Looking ahead we expect net other expense to be approximately $75 million per quarter including approximately $20 million to $30 million net per quarter related to our currency hedging program based on recent exchange rates. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 15% better than initially expected given a year-to-date impact of our recent divestiture on our annual tax rate. We now expect our tax rate to be between 15% and 16% for the remainder of the year. Second quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,366,000,000 shares. We repurchased a net $568 million of our ordinary shares in the second quarter. As we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we continue to expect shares to stay roughly flat. Combining our share repurchase activity with the $622 million we paid in dividends in the second quarter, our total payout ratio was 82% on non-GAAP net income and 59% on GAAP net income. Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to reiterate our annual revenue and EPS growth guidance. Unless specified, all of my guidance comments are comparable constant currency. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect revenue growth to be in a range of 4% to 5%. This would imply second half growth of approximately 4.5% to 6.5%, a range we would expect for both the third and the fourth quarters. Looking at full year revenue growth by our business groups, given the strength of its new products, we continue to expect CVG to grow in a range of 5.5% to 7% with growth weighted to the third quarter due to more favorable prior year comparison. For MITG we now expect growth to be in a range of 3% to 3.5% given the lower growth in the first half due in part to Hurricane Maria. This implies accelerated second half growth of 3.5% to 4.5% which is consistent with our prior guidance range. We continue to expect RTG to grow approximately 3% balancing the impact of Hurricane Maria and in spine market that is flat to slightly down with continued strength in brain therapies. Finally in our diabetes group, we expect growth to significantly improve in the second half given the completion of the Priority Access Program, as well as an expected increase in sensor supply by the fourth quarter resulting in mid to high single-digit growth for the full-year. Regarding margins for the remainder of the year, we expect our gross margin to be roughly flat year-over-year and our operating margin to reflect significant improvement in the third and stronger improvement of over 100 basis points in the fourth quarter. With respect to earnings, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow in the range of 9% to 10%. As I have previously noted, we expect EPS growth to accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year and would expect third quarter EPS growth to be at the midpoint to upper end of the annual 9% to 10% range. While the impact from currency is fluid and therefore not something we forecast, its recent exchange rates remains stable for the full fiscal year our full-year revenue would be positively affected by approximately $275 million to $375 million including an approximate $155 million to $175 million tailwind in the third quarter. Our third and fourth quarter operating margins would be negatively affected by approximately 50 to 100 basis points with the fourth quarter impact greater than the third. And our full-year EPS would be affected by approximately negative $0.02 including a positive impact of approximately $0.01 in the third quarter. Keep in mind the effect of FX on revenue, margin and EPS can differ due to the magnitude of the year-over-year change and expense related to our currency hedging program along with the timing difference of FX and cost of goods sold reflecting inventory turns on our balance sheet. Regarding free cash flow, we continue to expect it to grow in the high single-digits compounded annually from fiscal year '16 to '18 on a comparable basis given the divestiture which removes the tax and transaction costs, as well as the loss of free cash flow generated by the divested businesses. Lastly while we intend to give our fiscal year '19 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in May, I know that many of you are starting to think about your forward models. At this point, I would encourage you to keep in mind our longer-term mid-single digit revenue growth outlook, as well as our long-range plans to continue to drive operating margin expansion. While CVG is expected to ease back into mid single-digit growth next fiscal year given prior year comparisons, we are expecting MITG and RTG to grow in the mid-single-digits and diabetes to deliver double-digit growth. We intend to give our fiscal year 2019 growth guidance on a comparable basis that excludes the impact of the divestiture from the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and has the effect of lowering the base revenue by approximately $550 million and EPS by approximately $0.07. It is also worth noting that if current exchange rates remain stable through next year, we would expect a positive impact to revenue up to a $100 million and a slightly positive impact on EPS. Now I will return the call back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Karen, and I\u2019d like to conclude by noting that I realized that our shareholders are expecting consistent execution and reliable results from Medtronic. Know that your management team and Board expect the same. Over the past few quarters our performance has been affected by some extraordinary events which have masked the improving overall fundamentals of our business. That said, we aspire to be a company that can manage through even extraordinary events similar to those that we've recently faced. So we're keenly focused on solid execution, as well as leveraging our diversification and scale around the world to deliver dependable results for our shareholders. Let's now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I have Mike Coyle, President of CVG, Bryan Hanson President of MITG, Geoff Martha, President of RTG, and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We want to try to get to as many questions as possible. So please help us by limiting yourself to only one question and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have additional questions please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. So with that operator first question please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : Omar first off, let me - forget the question, let me just say that I know how tough this quarter was in Puerto Rico and Santa Rosa and just congratulations, good work that we did on behalf of all your employees that were impacted by both the hurricanes and the fires so I know it was significant let me get two questions and I\u2019ll do one question and then follow-up. The first question is on the growth outlook for the second half if I try and adjust for all the different activity, you effectively did 3% organic growth in the first half of the fiscal year adjusted for the hurricanes, you did 4% this quarter adjusted for the hurricanes. You're guiding to 4.5% to 6.5% in the second half of the year and that's organic, there is no acquisition contribution and that\u2019s despite what is a tougher comp in the back half of the year to the overall Medtronic. So besides diabetes accelerating which I think that we can all see, can you just talk about the rest of the business and what gives you confidence in the overall Medtronic acceleration despite this comps? Omar Ishrak : I think let\u2019s go through this group by group, I think they\u2019re almost all product driven on a basis of emerging market growth that continues to grow in the double digits and we\u2019re seeing that pretty consistently. And non-U.S. developed market growth in around 5% or so that we've been delivering. So if you take the U.S. which is really the recipient of most of our new products, CVG has the most exciting portfolio here with the CoreValve Evolut PRO currently launching in the U.S. and Europe to be a risk indication for TAVR. The HVAD destination therapy, as well as the Micra leadless pacemaker I think these are the key drivers for accelerated growth in CVG like we mentioned earlier and we are pretty confident given the momentum that we've seen in the just concluded quarter that this will continue. Now in the other groups too we\u2019re seeing continued improvement and you\u2019ll see a tick-up in growth in all of them and you mentioned diabetes yourself but in addition in MITG we have many product launches in FY 2018 including our Signia powered stapler and reinforced reloads instruments. And in RTG our enabling technologies are really taking hold, we had good traction with our capital equipment in Q2 and we expect that to continue. We think specifically the StealthStation S8 which brings an advanced solution to neurosurgeons we'll have this quite a bit in the upcoming quarters. So, as you can see Mike this confidence in our growth is really driven by an acceleration of our innovation pipeline and we feel pretty good about it. Mike Weinstein : And just my one follow-up, Karen can you spend a minute on free cash flow your free cash flow to the first half of the year was 1.1 billion, if I'm correct your commentary about high single upper single-digit free cash flow growth of FY 2016 to FY 2018 would imply somewhere around 4.9 to 5 billion correct me if I am wrong there, for FY 2018 so one, am I right on that and two can you just talk about cash flows and why they improve so meaningfully in the second half of the year? Karen Parkhill : For FY 2018 you're approximately right, we would expect high single digit growth compounded annually from FY 2016 on a comparable basis. So slightly high but you can do the math from FY 2016 with that growth rate. I would say on our free cash flow, know that we typically generate about a third of our free cash flow in the first half that's what we did last year what we're seeing right now. So we do remain confident about our ability to continue to grow in the high single digits from FY 2016 compounded annually. There have been some effects in the first half that we outlined on our fourth quarter earnings call. We expect a significant tax and legal settlement in FY 2018 most of that did occur in the first half of this fiscal year. We also had some payments fall into the first half that were in the second half of last year on a comparable basis specifically a couple hundred million related to the timing of the pension plan contributions, it happened in Q2 of this year versus Q3 of the prior year. And we also had some additional tax payment this first half. And then keep in mind that the divestiture of our businesses also had an impact of cash flow with both divestiture related expenses and foregone cash related to divestiture. Mike Weinstein : And Karen just so we have it, what is the FY 2016 free cash flow number that you are using obviously adjusted for the divestiture do you know that? Karen Parkhill : Yes, it is in the slide deck and it is 4.2 of free cash flow and if you look at it on a comparable free cash flow basis with the divestiture impact of about 100 million a quarter it nets to 3.9. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Just two questions from me, maybe I\u2019ll start with Geoff on RTG. Geoff kind of it\u2019s a two part question RTG related to market growth rates versus your performance, so spine obviously doing worse from a market growth perspective, SCS doing better from a market growth perspective. How do you think about the trends in those two businesses in the next two to four quarters and do you still think you can trend slightly above market in spine and with Intellis is the way to think about that getting back to market growth rates or just getting back to positive territory and I have a quick one for Karen? Geoff Martha : So thanks, I\u2019ll take the spine one first. We definitely see a pullback in the market here over the last couple quarters from I\u2019ll call it 2% flat to slightly down. We still feel very confident about our ability to perform above that and it comes from two things, one continued product launches and launching them at scale which has worked for us over the last let's say five or six quarters. So betting on the product launches, making sure with the appropriate sets, making sure we\u2019ve done the appropriate training of our reps and the physicians and launching with force and that's really helped us. And as we move forward, the surgical synergies is really taking hold, that's the combination of all of our enabling technology, power, navigation, robotics and that is having a halo effect and actually a tangible pull-through affect on our implants. We do a lot of equipment placements and that we've done over the last two or three quarters, now it will continue over the next year. And a year from now or so we'll have actually technological ties between our implants in the Mazor robots. So we feel really good about where we are in spine. I'd like to see the market go up because we given our market share globally at 30 so percent that would help but we feel good about our ability to continue to perform above the market. The other thing I\u2019ll point out is that, I think Omar mentioned it if you combine our enabling technologies with our implants we're really growing and that's how a lot of our competitors look like Globus, NuVasive et cetera that put us to about 2% growth. So we feel good. And then we have a high exposure to the global markets. The global markets outside the U.S. are growing three times as fast as the U.S. markets and we have a pretty high exposure there and are doing well. So overall spine, we feel good. I wish the market were growing a little faster though. And in Pain stem, pain pumps, the end pain stem actually are experiencing a lot of acceleration here in the last quarter. Pain stem because of the launch of Intellis, we already have launched our evolved work flow. And that does get us from mid-single digit to high single-digit declines to I would say low to mid-single-digit growth not quite growing at the market yet. I think that\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. But we feel very good about, for the next couple of quarters, well going forward here mid-single-digit growth in pain stem. And then pain pumps with the listing of the certificate of medical need that is really given that business a boost plus all of the products, the enhancements that we\u2019ve launched over the last couple of quarters, we can, - re-launching that product as its kind of a new product if you will, and that\u2019s picked up quite a bit of steam and now growing at like high single digits. So the pain business has really experienced a pretty rapid turnaround here in the last quarter. David Lewis : Then quickly carrying on, I appreciate the early comments you gave us on next year\u2019s guidance. Just in terms of thinking about that mid-single-digit corporate profile, how should we think about or what allotments did you make for various ex-U.S. pricing headwinds, whether they be China, India where the biannual Japan price cuts. Was there allotments made in that sort of mid-single digit range for those dynamics next year? Karen Parkhill : Yes we continue to have pricing pressure across all of our businesses and geographies and that is taken into consideration when we give our longer-term guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : So two questions, I will start with Karen if okay, and to echo David\u2019s comments I appreciate some of the early commentary on fiscal 2019 on both revenue growth and currency. I am just curious on the earnings front though for 2019, is there any reason not to expect that sort of 10% earnings growth in fiscal \u201819 off of what I realize is a pro forma restated 2018, that $0.07 you were talking about. But just curious if there is any reason not to expect that sort of 10% growth in fiscal \u201819 off of that new base? Karen Parkhill : Bob, we are currently working on our long-range forecast and our annual plan for next year. So we'll give much better guidance in the normal timeframe. But in the meantime we clearly do continue to expect to drive that mid-single-digit revenue growth and significant operating margin expansion that should lead to very robust bottom line growth. Bob Hopkins : So I guess for my second question, Omar, I was wondering if you could make a comment on just sort of what you're seeing in terms of MedTech market growth rates generally both in the United States and in emerging markets and to some degree this follows on the last question little bit given the China pricing announcement on ICDs and stents. But Omar, could you just talk broadly of what the trends you're seeing currently in the U.S. and emerging markets as it relates to just broadly speaking MedTech market growth? Omar Ishrak : Let me start with emerging markets Bob. You know look, the growth in emerging markets continues and we are delivering in that diversified position across the major markets of China, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. You know these are big markets where we've got significant positions and are fairly well diversified. Given that backdrop we see ourselves going in the double-digit, say in a sustained fashion in emerging markets powered by markets that are pretty robust. Now there may be variations from year-to-year in the different markets as we have experienced but we have also shown that those variations are manageable, they are not that big. They\u2019re still close to that range. And China market is perhaps going to be at sometime in the future the biggest market in MedTech. And it is one that to we expect to participate and work with stakeholders there and are confident that we can continue our performance thereof delivering double-digit revenue growth. So emerging markets we are pretty confident about and feel very good about our position for sustained delivery. The U.S. on one side the overall markets outside of spine are the surgical volumes are basically the same, around 1% to 2% with small variations which we really don\u2019t want to try to forecast at that precision level. And the spine market you just heard Geoff say has got some pressure in the U.S. for a variety of reasons probably, in the elective procedures may be being one of them. But more importantly the U.S. market in the end is driven by new product introductions and we have seen that and we are experiencing that right now. With our new product cycles, that drives the U.S. market and that's the most significant impact that we see. So that\u2019s the way I see markets, I mean not that different from what you have seen before, a lot that we can influence ourselves by our own actions and that's what we focus on doing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : I was wondering if you could go over a little bit more specifically in the diabetes business. Just what, how you're feeling about the reacceleration? How confident you are and then maybe just touch on what gives that confidence for next year to grow in the double-digit range. Just kind of the path forward to bring some of the new supply onto the market for the sensors? Mike Coyle : Kristen I'd say, you know first let\u2019s start with the back half of this year and then we can talk about the FY 2019. I'd say the acceleration that we expect in the back half of the year is really driven by three things. The first one is that our sensor capacity plans are actually not only going according to plan but slightly ahead of schedule. And so we anticipate that we are going to be in a position by the end of this fiscal year where our sensor capacity will allow us to meet all of the demand, so that's one. So as we get that back up we expect to see acceleration not only of sensor revenue but also of pump revenue. The second one is the 670G and you know the real world performance of 670G as more of those systems get into the market. This is a system that now has 13,000 patients that are uploading their data into CareLink and what's really encouraging Kristen, is that what we\u2019re seeing even at these volumes is outcomes and performance that are very similar to what we saw in the pivotal trial for the FDA. And so as those things really start to continue to take hold I think both from a physician perspective and a patient perspective, we will start to see traction. And then the third dynamic for the back half of the year which will also go into FY \u201919 is Animas and the transition of those patients to Medtronic. And then as we look forward into FY 2019 as Omar mentioned, there's a series of new product launches in addition to all of these dynamics that I just mentioned. Guardian Connect and our entry into the standalone sensor market number one, iPro 3, which will be a new professional CGM for our Type 2 business. You combine all of these things and we feel good about the acceleration into the second half and also double-digits for FY 2019. Kristen Stewart : So you have full sensor supply for fiscal fourth quarter or ahead? Mike Coyle : That's right. So we are going to ramp up and Q3 should be better than Q2. So we - our capacity expansion plans will allow us to produce more sensors this quarter than we did last quarter. And then by Q4 will be in a position where we can meet all of the demand. Kristen Stewart : And then Karen there is a question for you. Can you maybe just go through the dynamics year-over-year just kind of the gross margin the puts and takes of those? Karen Parkhill : We do expect our gross margin to be relatively flat year-over-year FY 2017 to FY 2018 and the real puts and takes are the fact that we see continued pricing pressure but remain focused on driving expense reduction in our COGS line item. Kristen Stewart : And when you mentioned for the full year I think you had said with respect to the guidance for, with respect to the hedges. Did you mean that that was going to be negative impacts from hedges with FX for the third quarter or was that positive? Karen Parkhill : Yes, from an FX perspective we talked about it on the operating margin perspective, and we said that our third and fourth quarter operating margin would be negatively affected by 50 to 100 basis points. But the fourth quarter impact a little bit greater than the third and that's assuming rates remain constant to where they are today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : One follow-up on China, and one of robotics. So Omar I just wanted to ask you directly about the proposed price cuts to drug-eluting stents hips and ICDs. You know we've heard the price cuts could be up to 40% but offset by the two invoice policy. How are you thinking about those pending changes in China and the potential for other device categories that have similar cuts? And then I have one follow-up on robotics. Omar Ishrak : Again on China look let's not forget the size of that market and access to healthcare for patients in China is a big priority for the government and a big priority for us. And we are working closely with the government to figure out the best way to optimize the distribution channels which has many factors as you noted, and now there may be certain price regulations but we're used to managing those and we feel the end that our ability to demonstrate value and our experience with value-based models will give us the right pricing in those markets, and the right trade-off between price and volume, as well as you know leading out the cost in the distribution channel working together with the government. So the many variables here in the end we feel pretty confident that we can maintain our performance in China through these dynamics which will change over time. It's a big market and a lot of work has to be done but through that we feel that we've got a team in place and products in place and a focus in place through which we can continuously deliver. Larry Biegelsen : And then on robotics, I heard your comments about doing first-in-human, I think in fiscal 2018 if I heard correctly, but my question is are you still planning to launch in select international markets this year? And I think at the last analyst meeting, you said you expect to draw robotic program that contribute 50 to 150 basis points of growth in fiscal 2019 which I think at the time equated to about 50 to 150 million in revenues. I guess the question is, are you still comfortable with that? Thanks for taking the questions. Omar Ishrak : I\u2019ll let Brian answer that robotic question. Go ahead Brian. Bryan Hanson : We obviously have a pretty complex project on our hands with a lot of moving pieces and parts on the robotics system quite literally actually, a lot of moving pieces and parts. And so there is always risk in slippage for launch but at this point in time we're sticking to the dates that we have committed to relative to launch timelines which would be consistent with what you said first-in-human at the end of this fiscal year and in full launch in FY 2019. So we are pretty excited and I would tell you just even going further beyond that, I probably feel more confident now about the robotic system then I have it any point in the past the fact that we're going have a viable and really competitive product and I will tell you why? We're already building our pilot systems off the production line. So we've already built and are continuing to build those pilot systems write off the production line. We are well passed any design development fees at this point where fully into verification and validation and although there's a lot of work ahead of us, the work really is more associated which is time to retire the work and the risk of a viable product is behind us. So we're not having a viable product is behind us. So I feel very confident about where we are. I feel very confident we're going to have not just a viable product but we continue to do so surgeon feedback and the feedback that we're getting from surgeons is that they're very excited about the technology that we have and I look forward to its launch. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Raj Denhoy : Wonder if I could just ask around the U.S. growth in MITG. It was down 5% even after correcting for the hurricanes, it was still a negative results in the U.S. and so I am curious if that's a reflection of perhaps procedure volumes or something else happening now that we're seeing in that market? Bryan Hanson : So it's less around procedural volumes because where we see a lot of pressure in our business in Q2, one obviously was a result of some of the pressure that we saw because of the hurricanes, a lot of that concentrated on the surgical business but even through that pressure we saw pretty good strength in the surgical business overall. The real pressure came in the RGR business which specifically the biggest piece of that which is respiratory where we had some really challenging comps from last year as you probably remember we had relaunched the PB980 in Q2. We had real strength last year as a result of that and that carry through in Q3 and Q4 and as expected we saw some challenging growth rates in Q2 as a result of that. But I don\u2019t see anything fundamentally in the procedures that we leverage to drive revenue that would be concerning for me. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum with William Blair. Kaila Krum : So first I got starting off on emerging market any constraints that you guys saw in the quarter. Can you just speak a little bit more to the durability of that double-digit performance and I know that you don\u2019t give too much color on fiscal 2019 but just high leveling and taking into account some of the anticipated headwinds you\u2019ve mentioned. Is it fair to assume that sort of growth continues in the next year? Omar Ishrak : First let me take the emerging markets, like I said we've demonstrated double-digit performance in the emerging markets almost on a quarterly basis now for - I don\u2019t know five years. So we have every expectation that that will continue because our position in these markets is only strengthening and there is no question about the need, you know you just need to look at the math based on population and the market requirement of our therapies and the need is clearly there. And we\u2019re working closely with different stakeholders - we continue to work closely with different stakeholders in these markets to create methods through which access is provided going beyond our products, working with the government, as well as private providers to facilitate training of physicians, to creation of infrastructure, as well as creating awareness for our therapies. So we're pretty confident that this double-digit emerging market growth will continue given the size of that opportunity and given the diversification that we have across the different major emerging markets. I think the second question in terms of growth into next year the color that we provided really goes down to our three growth strategies built on a reliable and emerging market growth coupled with our new product launches that will become more. So uniform across our different groups, led by a strong recovery in diabetes, but also good improvement in both MITG and RTG like we mentioned. I think all of this put together gives us confidence that we can continue our mid single-digit growth trajectory that's in our short and long-term plans. Kaila Krum : And then I guess it was in spine, I mean clearly you\u2019re continuing to put up solid growth in the biologic segment of your business and you\u2019re investing those incremental dollars in field research. But I guess there is some question is that the value of biologics as more companies introduce porous or titanium technologies that they require less biologic use, so I guess what's your view on that dynamic longer-term? Thank you. Bryan Hanson : Look I think there is a lot more research that needs to be done on the impact of the surface technologies in the porous surface edgings on some of the inner bodies, but we'll also participate in that market as well. We're just launching our first titanium porous cage and so we\u2019re watching it. I think though that to dismiss the use of some of the biologics is premature based on the results we've seen over the last decade. And we\u2019re so confident that we're investing $90 million over the next several years in clinical research. We feel very good about it but we are intrigued on the surface coatings and we\u2019re going to invest in that as well, but I think dismissing the biologics, the existing biologics is a little premature and I think more of the questions are some of the new claims around stem cells and things like that, that is where the pressure is that's what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re not seeing it for example on Infuse, if that\u2019s the question. We are hearing about it in some of the new stem cell related products that there is pushback from the payers, but in terms of existing biologics we feel that we have proven track record and we're confident thus investing in more clinical data. And the porous technology is intriguing but there's still lot to prove on that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Josh Jennings : Just had a question for Mike Coyle, congrats on the CVG performance in the quarter. Having concerns, some concerns about competitors of ICD launches and for the CRM business specifically, it sounds like that competitor had almost limited in the quarter but just wanted to hear if you had any updated thoughts on your competitive positioning and ability to defend the share gains you capture for the last two years and did you see any impact from those launches in October? Mike Coyle : Josh thanks for the question. As you mentioned those products were launched in mid-to-late September by both of our competitors and so we now have eight or nine weeks of experience with the launches and frankly we have not seen a lot of impact on our unit share in the high power segment. And I think there are a number of reasons why that is true, the first is that the competitive offerings that they have are really not matching up to what we already have in the market, it's not just the three test labeling that we have, but also they have very significant labeling restrictions on their product and workflow negatives when you try to implement to their labeling. And that obviously it works to our advantage but probably the bigger reason there hasn\u2019t been a meaningful detectable shift is that this really was just labeling expansion, it\u2019s really the same products that they have been selling and their field had done a good job I think of indicating to customers that when they got the approval for MRI say that they would be able to basically perform MRIs on implants even before the approval right. So that basically put them in a position where we never saw the kind of share shift that we saw in Brady, where they was a special lead and they had to wait until they had actual approval of the product before they could start selling it. So most of the share shift that we've seen from our product line is really come from features that are embedded in our devices that are highly differentiated like our busy AF or the smart shot technology that we have or the adaptive effective CRT features and these features have not been matched up with the products that have come in from competitor. So they represent 70% to 80% of our product mix, so we were not expecting to see a big - major share shift away from us as MRI labeling came in from competitors and at least eight or nine weeks into the launch we have seen that happen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Omar just wondering if you could comment on your views for the overall healthcare utilization environment in electric procedures in particular. Just kind of curious what\u2019s baked into your outlook for the back half of the fiscal year? And the reason I ask is, the managed care and kind of provider community has struck - I would say a little more cautious tone on the quarter that they trend here as we went into the end of the year and it seems like the device companies have been a little bit more constructive around their expectations for underlying trend. So if you kind of maybe spend a minute reconciling that view a little bit as to what you're seeing that will be helpful? Omar Ishrak : Well like I mentioned before, some of our procedures are acute procedures that are needed. It's almost on an emergency basis and those procedures will continue and there's a demographic statistical need for that and we don't see that changing if anything with the demographics will even increase slightly. And then beyond that you have core surgical procedures like I said some of which were elective but most of it - is required and there we\u2019re seeing a pretty steady performance in the marketplace. The spine area which I think is probably because of the elective nature of some of those procedures, we seen some pressure but not completely out of line with what we\u2019ve seen historically in different phases and one that we expect to stabilize going forward. So from a procedural perspective we don't really see that much change, some shifts between the different areas that we're in primarily I think driven by the elective nature of some of these procedures. I think overall though like I mentioned before and I want to emphasize new product introductions in MedTech in general drive the market far more than these shifts and that\u2019s what going to see us get the kind of accelerated growth that we are projecting into the second half and into next year. Isaac Ro : And then Mike maybe a follow up for you on TAVR, just curious what\u2019s baked into your outlook for the rest of the fiscal year in the U.S. and Europe for that business it\u2019s obviously done well in the last couple of quarters here in competitive landscape does figure to shift again as we move into calendar 2018 so be interested in kind of how your game planning for TAVR in the contest of your guidance? Thank you. Mike Coyle : We're obviously fairly early into the launch of Evolut PRO both in Europe and in the United States really which the last quarter was really the first full quarter for that product. It\u2019s doing exceptionally well in terms of not only the improvements in lower paravalvular leak rates but the physicians are really being able to use that system to have lower pacemaker rates as well. So we really feel well positioned relative to our product line now obviously with both Evolut R and Evolut PRO available to our customers. And obviously the intermediate risk approval in the United States allowed us to really access where the growth in the market is and now we're expanding centers to basically take advantage of that. And then obviously the Evolut R approval in Japan is also driving significant growth. So the overall market remains robust in through the low to mid 20s and obviously we are in share capture mode, we think our product lines are well positioned to compete against any new entrants that come into the marketplace and obviously we continue to invest and expanded indications for use including low risk and looking at things like bicuspid indication. So we think there is plenty of room for continued expansion. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Navarro with RBC Capital. Glenn Navarro : A question for Karen on tax reform. Medtronic had an advantage versus competitors given its inverted status. So Karen, based on what you're seeing out of Washington D.C. in tax reform today, I wonder if you can give some of your initial thoughts on reform. Does it - what part of reform helps Medtronic? Is there any part of reform that puts you at a disadvantage? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Thanks for the question Glenn. We pleased that Congress is working on potential tax reform right now. We do continue to support reform in general including the establishment of a territorial system and a lower U.S. corporate tax rate. As you know, the House has advanced its potential reform with the passage of a bill and the Senate has only just released last night its legislative draft. But we recognize that both Houses need to reconcile their versions into one bill so we are staying very close to this process. I would say it\u2019s too early to speculate on the final version of the bill and its impact if any to us but the most positive impact of potential reform to us in the long-term would be the ongoing access to our OUS cash that is limited obviously today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Matt Taylor : Karen I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the things that impacted operating margin that you called out in the prepared remarks this quarter to help us quantify kind of the temporary impact of those product launch support programs and the hurricane. And then you eluded to you beyond the Covidien synergies some additional thing that you can do in operating margin. Can you give us any clarity on what those are and if there any different from what you laid out in the prior plan? Karen Parkhill : So we did talk about a margin decline that we had this quarter and that was really driven by four things, the impact of lower revenue - lighter revenue in our diabetes business along with the impact of the hurricane, as well as the infusion set recall in diabetes. And so going forward we do expect to improve our operating margins particularly this year in the back half substantially more in the fourth quarter. And that is really driven by the strength of revenue along with our continued focus on driving cost synergies and driving cost down where we can. Looking longer-term we do expect to continue to drive operating margin improvement as we\u2019ve discussed in the past beyond the delivery of the Covidien synergies which we expect to close out this fiscal year. And the movement that we expect to do going forward is continued plant consolidation, increase used of shared service, continued focus on our enabling functions on a global basis driving center of excellence and improving our processes et cetera. So we do expect to continue to drive margin expansion going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : Can you tell us sort of or share with us philosophically how you think about guidance I appreciate your verbiage in the prepared remarks regarding of you towards consistency but as we think about the second half of the year and then your remarks going into next year what you depreciated, how do you think about putting all of those pieces to the puzzle together? Omar Ishrak : Well like we mentioned we feel that we've got a set of businesses driven by growth strategies of therapy innovation of emerging market growth and of - drive towards value based healthcare which helps us with pricing and some new business models. You take all three of those things together across the spread of our businesses, we feel that we can deliver on the mid single-digit growth and I think we've demonstrated that, we've had issues in certain quarters for a variety of reasons and which we\u2019re not happy about but in general on a yearly basis we certainly delivered that and we have every expectation that that will continue. And to do that that this fiscal year we need an acceleration in the second half which we have line of sight to given the new product launches and the dynamics that we see in our different businesses. So really is a straightforward as that, we think our new products fill this on a base of strong double-digit emerging markets growth. Joanne Wuensch : And just as quick follow up, of the new products which are the two or three you really think are the drivers for the next 12 to 18 months. And then thank you. Omar Ishrak : It varies quite a bit - as we go through the next 12 to 18 months but CVG and cardiovascular we continue to have traction and our CoreValve Evolut PRO in TAVR in addition to the intermediate risk approval that we got is driving both market growth, as well as our own share position in the U.S. and across the world. We're really excited about our HVAD destination therapy approval that's a real game changer for us in that market and we're pleased with the success that we've seen with that product line. And then also repeating the Micra leadless pacemaker, which is the only leadless pacemaker that exist and we continue to benefit from full CMS reimbursement for that product in the U.S. and we're seeing a very strong growth in that segment as well. So all three of those areas in CVG continue to grow in addition to the other product lines. So we're pretty confident that will go on. There will be dynamics through the different quarters that we go through the year it will be higher earlier in the next 12 months rather than later in CVG. But then that\u2019s supplemented by continued growth in MITG where we have regular cadence of launches that we're seeing deliver successful results specifically in surgical innovations but the other businesses also are contributing. And in RTG, in addition to the capital equipment that we\u2019ve talked about like the StealthStation S8 and the O-arm and to some degree our partnership with Mazor Robotics, we also have Intellis platform that we should really look at which is a big turnaround and take us towards positive growth in spinal cord stimulation. In addition to the removal of the warning letter and the consent decree requirements that were in place for the pain pump in that product line. And then finally in diabetes, we've gone through a fairly difficult phase mostly to do with our supply shortage in sensors but very strong demand from patients for our highly differentiated technology. And we\u2019re only in the beginning stages of the growth in diabetes with that kind of differentiated hybrid closed loop technology. And in addition to that, we\u2019re supplementing that with our Guardian Connect with sugar IQ product which is a CGM product to be launched in the U.S. sometime later this fiscal year which is highly differentiated from anything that\u2019s available in the market. So you put all that together, we see that while the relative dynamics of the different businesses may vary quarter-to-quarter, overall we've got enough diversification in the markets that we serve that we can maintain the mid-single-digit growth. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Chris Pasquale : One for Omar or maybe Mike, and then one quick one for Karen. Omar you highlighted the expansion of value-based contracts in CRM, based on your estimates it likely event rates into those contracts, what's the implied net impact on your pricing. Is this a situation where you're effectively getting a price increase by taking risk off the hands of the hospital and if so can you quantify that? Omar Ishrak : Yes, I think a better way to look at that is to - so we demonstrate the translation of the clinical value to economic value in the financials of the hospital that's what we\u2019re doing. The clinical value is reduced reintervention rates for example for which we've got evidence, we\u2019re not just guessing this we\u2019ve got clinical trial evidence that shows that and that translated to the financials of the hospital is our value base healthcare program where the variables are highly technology driven or innovation driven. So then few other variables, our technology we know through evidence and clinical trials create this improved clinical benefit which we then translate to the hospitals financials as an economic benefit. And we think that through that, indeed pricing is not only protected but to some degree we would get enhanced overall pricing because in the end the hospital is better off financially with this new technology than without, that\u2019s the essence of value based healthcare programs. And we\u2019ve - as the overall payment model changes, we\u2019re gaining a lot of experience as to how to create these contracts with providers in the existing fee-for-service model. As we translate more to a pay-for-value model, we think we\u2019ll be very well positioned to even broaden the scope of these business arrangements. Chris Pasquale : And then Karen, you bought back a lot of stock in the first half of the year. I know a piece of that was sort of one time and tied to the PMR proceeds, but if I do the math on the free cash flow guidance and then add in a dividends in the back half of the year, it looks like you're on track to basically return a 100% of free cash flow to shareholders for the third straight year. How sustainable is that as we look ahead to 2019? Karen Parkhill : Our commitment on return to shareholders is greater than 50% of our actual free cash flow that we generate, and while we did use a portion of our divestiture proceeds to repurchase stock which does elevate our return to shareholders this year, going forward we would expect to stick with that greater than 50% of free cash flow commitment. Omar Ishrak : Okay, so with that let's close the call up. Thank you very much for all your questions. And on behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. And for those of you in the U.S., I want to wish you and your families a very Happy Thanksgiving. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q3 call which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, February 20. Thank you all very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Krystal. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our third quarter which ended on January 26, 2018. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. During this earnings call, many of the statements made maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 and rates and ranges are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjust for our recent patient care, DVT and nutritional insufficiency divestiture as well as the impact of foreign currency. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. Finally, other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported our third quarter financial results including revenue of $7.4 billion representing growth of 7%. Q3 non-GAAP operating profit grew 8% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.17 growing 12% and representing EPS leverage of 580 basis points. These results effected solid quarter for Medtronic and as we expected a strong turnaround from the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to execute in our broad sustainable growth strategy driving therapy innovation and global market penetration while delivering enterprise synergies to enable margin improvement. Each of our four groups delivered strong results with mid-single-digit revenue growth in MITG and RTG, high-single-digit growth in CVG and low teens growth in diabetes. Geographically, we also have a strong diversified performance with mid single-digits growth in the U.S. and non-U.S. developed markets and low double-digit growth in emerging markets. At the same time, we completed our $850 million Covidien synergy commitments. We recently launched a new program Enterprsie Excellence designed to increase our effectiveness and enabled reinvestment for growth along with driving continued margin expansion and EPS leverage. As we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver meaningful EPS leverage on mid-single-digit revenue growth this fiscal year, just as we have for the past five fiscal years. In therapy innovation, we are seeing a clear acceleration driven by several important new product launches across our four groups as well as our strong positions in the fastest growing therapies in MedTech. Our Cardiac and Vascular Group grew 7% again this quarter delivering sustained growth by leveraging the breadth of its products and services, as well as its strong positions in important rapidly expanding markets. CVG is an impressive new product in infection control, diagnostics, transcatheter pacemakers, and AF Solutions generated combined growth in the mid 20s and now represent about a third of our Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure divisions. Mid teens growth in our Coronary & Structural Heart divisions was led by the launch of our Resolute Onyx, drug-eluting stent in the U.S. and Japan as well as our high growth transcatheter valve business. In TAVR, we grew in the low 30s with mid 20s growth in the U.S. and low 40s growth in international markets driven by the strong global demand for Evolut PRO valve and expanded indications for use. Our minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 6% driven by 7% growth in Surgical Innovations with strength in new products including our Signia powered surgical stapling system, our LigaSure vessel sealing instrument, and our Valleylab FT10 energy platform. Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal grew 3% driven by broad based growth in GI and Hepatology, strength in Nellcor pulse oximetry sensors given the high incidents of flu in the U.S. and strong adoption of our microstream capnography monitoring products. This offset the decline in our Airway and Ventilation business. We are enthusiastic about the development of our Surgical Robotics platform, which we expect will strengthen our strategy of advancing minimally invasive procedures and we continue to make progress towards its launch. While we had intended first clinical use in humans in next couple of months, our final software and hardware integration and testing is taking longer than we initially expected. This is not unusual with systems of this complexity. We are excited about the product performance that we already seen and intend to update timelines as we near the commercial launch. At our Investor Day in June, we intend to share incremental details of our system and update you on our progress. As we mentioned before, the expectation of meaningful revenue from this system which will be depending on regulatory approval in developed markets. Regardless, we remained confident in our ability to grow MITG in the mid-single-digit next year and over the longer term. Our Restorative Therapies Group grew 5% this quarter with robust growth in our Brain & Pain divisions. In Brain, the strength of our entire strong portfolio drove high teens growth in neurovascular and strong sales of our StealthStation navigation and O-arm imaging technologies led to low double-digit growth in neurosurgery. In Pain, we are seeing very positive customer reaction from our Intellis platform and our evolved workflow driven, which together drove high single-digit growth reversing the declines we have seen for several quarters. While our Spine division was flat this quarter, it was in line with the global spine market. Growth in BMP continue to offset declines in core spine, also when coupling our spine revenue with the spine enabling technologies that are reported in our neurosurgery business, our combined revenue grew over 1%. We believe this is a more relevant comparison of our spine results against our competition and an indication of our overall growth of Spine procedures. We attribute this growth for the ongoing success of our surgical synergy strategy, which combines our enabling technologies such as imaging, navigation, powered instruments, nerve monitoring and Mazor Robotics with our spine implants to deliver integrated procedures. Unexpected diabetes returned to double-digit growth this quarter driven by the continued adoption of our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system in the U.S. We now have over 20,000 patients of our 670G system and we continue to receive highly positive feedback from the patients from this ground-breaking technology with real world results consistent with those reported in our pivotal study. Our growth was further enhanced by the strong international demand for our 640G system. Our sensor attachment rates with all of our 6-Series systems globally remains strong and then as we continue to shift to our customer base from standalone funds to sensor augmented pumps, we expect sensors to be a key component of our growth. Our efforts to increase our sensor capacity are progressing well. We are now able to meet the sensor demand of our existing customer base and remain on track to fully meet our predicted demand from both existing and new users in the fourth quarter. In addition, we benefited in the quarter from consumable revenue from legacy Animas users and the transition of Animas users to Medtronic continue to progress well. We are also excited about the prospects of our standalone CGM system in Guardian Connect. Outside the U.S., we see strong utilization and retention of the patients from the system and with expected increase in our sensor manufacturing capacity; we are preparing to increase our customer base. In the U.S., we have been closely collaborating with the FDA and expect to bring this innovative technology to market shortly. Guardian Connect features unique predictive alerts. And in the U.S., we utilized sugar IQ with the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to detect important patterns and trends for people with diabetes. Turning now to our globalization growth strategy, emerging markets, which represent 15% of our revenue again, grew 12% in line with our long-term double-digit growth expectations. Our consistent emerging market performance continues to benefit from geographic diversification with strong balanced results around the globe. Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa and China all grew double digits. In addition through investing in traditional market development, our differentiated strategies of participating in public and private partnerships as well as optimizing our distribution channels are driving our sustained performance. The emerging markets represent the single largest opportunity in MedTech. Our remaining growth strategy economic value is a real accelerator for our therapy innovation and globalization strategies. We are pleased with our continued progress in creating new value based business models that directly linked our therapies to improving outcomes. We now have over 1000 hospitals under contract and over 25% of our U.S. CRHF implantables\u2019 revenue is covered under a TYRX-related and value-based healthcare arrangements that linked total payment depletion and inflection outcomes. Beyond TYRX, we have also commercialized five other value-based healthcare programs, covering various therapies including ICDs, CRTs, AF ablation, drug-coated balloons, and the aortic stent grafts, where a portion of our payment is tied to specific patient outcomes. Collectively, these five programs in addition to TYRX cover over $615 million in mostly U.S. based device revenue. Across Medtronic, we remain focused on leading the ship to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improve patient outcomes of our volume. We are increasingly partnering with additional stakeholders and the healthcare value chain including payers, providers and other interested organizations to lead the change for FIFA service models to value-based programs. It is our strong belief that Medtronic is uniquely positioned to leverage our global technical, clinical and disease - expertise to deliver better outcomes to the patients while improving efficiency for healthcare systems around the world and we are doing this in a way that we expect to benefit our shareholders as well. With that, let me ask Karen to now take you through a discussion of our third quarter financials and outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Karen. Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Omar. As mentioned, our third quarter revenue of $7.369 billion represented a 1% increase as reported and growth of 7% on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for both foreign currency and a patient care DVT and nutritional insufficiency divestiture. Foreign currency had a positive $177 million impact on third quarter revenue. GAAP diluted loss per share was a $1.03. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.17. After adjusting for the divestiture and a $0.01 negative impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 12%. The majority of our non-GAAP adjustments were driven by a $2.2 billion tax charge primarily related to the transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings as part of U.S. tax reform. This tax will be paid over the next eight years with less of a cash impact in the first five years. Medtronic has been advocating for U.S. tax reform for many years and we are pleased with the final package included the ability to gain access to our future earnings outside the United States. We now will have access to the vast majority of our cash flow and we expect to deploy with discipline in accordance with our capital allocation strategy of balancing reinvestments for future growth and providing meaningful returns for our shareholders. The operating margin for the quarter was 28.8% on a comparable constant currency basis representing a year-over-year improvement of 30 basis points. This was primarily driven by a 40 basis points improvement in SG&A. As announced last month, we have reached our goal of delivering $850 million of synergies from the Covidien acquisition. We also unveiled our enterprise excellence plan that is expected to deliver over $3 billion in annual growth run rate savings over the next five years. We expected to enable reinvestments for future growth as well as drive continued operating margin expansion and EPS leverage. Non-GAAP net other expense, which was included in our operating margin was $94 million versus $20 million on a comparable basis in the prior year. This change was driven primarily by increased expense related to our currency hedging program. Foreign exchange in total had an approximate 90 basis point negative impact on our operating margin. This was more than expected given currency market volatility in the last month of the quarter, which resulted in the large foreign exchange impact on our inventory in late January as well as increased expense due to net balance sheet remeasurement on certain foreign currency denominated balances. These were also the primary reasons for the mismatch between the FX benefit on our revenue and FX headwind on EPS. Our third quarter non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 15.6%. Based on our current estimates of the impact of U.S. Tax Reform. We continue to expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be between 15% and 16%. Third quarter average daily shares outstanding on a non-GAAP diluted basis were 1.365 billion shares. As expected this was roughly flat sequentially and we expect our share count to remain roughly flat for the remainder of the fiscal year. Combining our $1.6 billion of year-to-date share repurchase activity, with the $1.9 billion we paid in dividends over the same period, our total payout ratio was 76% on a non-GAAP net income. Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to reiterate our annual revenue and EPS growth guidance. Unless specified, all of my guidance comments are comparable constant currency. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 5% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow in the range of 9% to 10% from the prior year comparable of $4.37. For the fourth quarter, we would expect total Company revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. Looking at the expected fourth quarter revenue growth by our business groups. We expect CDG to deliver 4.5% to 5.5% growth, and MITG to grow in the range of 3% to 3.5% both driven by continued strengths of new products amidst more difficult fourth quarter comparisons. We expect RTG to grow in the range of 3% to 4% balancing the impact of a slower spine market with continued growth in pain therapies and strength in brain therapies. Finally, in our Diabetes Group, as we have been forecasting for some time, we expect double-digit growth in the fourth quarter given increased sensor supply and the strength of the 670G launch in the United States. With respect to earnings. We delivered strong EPS leverage in the third quarter, and we expect it to continue in the fourth with EPS growth of 11% to 13% of the prior year comparable of $1.25. While the impact from currency is fluid and therefore not something we forecast, if recent exchange rate remains stable for the fiscal year. Our full-year revenue would be positively affected by approximately $480 million to $500 million, including an approximate $300 million to $320 million tailwind in the fourth quarter. Our full-year operating margin would be negatively affected by approximately 70 basis points, including approximately 150 basis points in the fourth quarter and our full-year EPS would be negatively affected by approximately $0.04 including a negative impact of approximately $0.02 in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind the effective FX on revenue margin and EPS can differ due to the magnitude of the year-over-year change in expense related to our currency hedging program along with the timing difference of FX and cost-of-good sold reflecting inventory turns on our balance sheet. While we intend to give our fiscal year 2019 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in May, the fiscal year 2019 commentary that I provided on last quarter's earnings call still stands. Also while we expect to continue to drive operating margin improvements and EPS leverage, keep in mind the following headwinds to our projected EPS growth. We expect less interest income reflecting planned positioning of our investments for greater flexibility and liquidity in support of capital allocation. We will anniversary the full-year benefit from the accounting change on stock based compensation and we expect to begin to transition services related to our divestitures to Cardinal Health, eliminating the income in the back half of the fiscal year. Combined this could amount to a few 100 basis point headwind to EPS growth which we will be working to partially offset. In addition, given recent changes to exchange rates, if current exchange rate remains stable through the next fiscal year we would now expect an approximately $500 million positive impact to fiscal year 2019 revenue and over $0.10 of benefit to EPS. Finally, I would like to note that we plan to hold our biannual Institutional Investor and Analyst Day on Tuesday June 5th in New York City. Now I will return the call back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Karen. And to conclude, Q3 was a solid quarter where innovation and technologies, strong positions in the fastest growing markets in MedTech and enterprise synergies produced solid returns. We have driven a strong turnaround from our first half results and we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and meaningful EPS leverage this fiscal year and beyond. We expect this to lead to robust free cash flow generations that we can deploy with discipline. Finally, we remain keenly focused on executing to deliver dependable results for you our shareholders. As we continue to leverage our global diversification scale to fulfill our mission of elevating plain, restoring health and extending life for millions of people around the world. Let\u2019s now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I have asked to join us. We want try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have additional questions please contact Ryan and our investor relations team after the call. With that operator, first question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question come from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Thanks for taking the question and appreciate it. A quick question for Karen and then for Omar. First Karen, just to start-off thank you for the preliminary thoughts you are providing on 2019 since I know I\u2019m going to get a lot of questions on it as I assume everybody else will. I just want to makes sure I hear exactly what you are saying. My interpretation of what I just heard is that perhaps the FX benefit is roughly offsetting some of those incremental headwinds you talked about and that perhaps high single-digit earnings growth is a rough preliminary way to think about 2019. So is it fair to say that some of those headwinds you mentioned will be offset by FX and that roughly high single-digits is a good preliminary way to think about 2019 earnings? Karen Parkhill : Yes, that\u2019s roughly in line Bob, at this stage we are still working on our annual planning process and we will give guidance on our fourth quarter call in May, but your summary is roughly right. Robert Hopkins : Okay, thank you for that. And then, Omar I wanted to ask you about revenue growth, because obviously this is some of the best in those balance revenue growth. We have seen out of Medtronic for some time, so congratulations on that. I guess my question to be from a macro perspective, can you talk a little bit maybe about the drivers of the growth? How much of this was just particularly strong execution and new products versus strong markets. You know where there any significant one-time benefits in Q3, maybe just talk from a macro perspective about the revenue growth in the quarter and the sustainability? Karen Parkhill : Well, like I have always mentioned our revenue performance is highly dependent on new product launch process and when we got new products, the revenue growth goes up quite significantly especially with respect to the market. Overall, the market normally really with major changes since before we expect what we said in November is about still holds the same in terms of surgical procedures and in terms of other procedures, some electric procedures and diabetes in particular have a ramp-up in December, which then tails down in January. So, these are all normal patterns. I think the only thing that I will point out is of course that we are pleased with the diabetes business as promised and expected with the sense of shortage issue being addressed bows to double-digit growth, which clearly existed on its own helps. The other thing I'll point out actually is Pain division, where again we have been experiencing declines in growth and this quarter, we came up to high single-digits, which based on new product introductions. So, those two are the outstanding drivers. I have encouraged CBG as usual performed and this was particularly good quarter with a variety of new products, which I detailed and MITG continued with their introduction of products. So really, product pipeline introduction is the main driver that we see in this performance and we are quite pleased with what we have seen. Robert Hopkins : Great. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Bob. Next question please, Krystal. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan. Michael Weinstein : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of items to clarify. So, last quarter, Puerto Rico was about $60 million headwinds of the business. How much of that do you think you dropped back this quarter? And then second, I think we are probably all a bit surprised by the reduction in EPS guidance, because of FX this quarter. You commented on your prepared remarks that the fourth quarter will see a 150 basis point headwind to operating margins, because of the fact that that\u2019s pretty severe. So, can you just spend a minute on that and maybe just help me with what I guess one, why the FX impact hot worse by the weakening of the dollar from last call and two, why it\u2019s so severe on this fourth quarter? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. So on Puerto Rico, we did realize an incremental revenue from Hurricane Maria in the third quarter, but it was relatively minor. So the vast majority of the 7% growth in Q3 was related to improved underlying financial performance. In terms of foreign exchange, this quarter, given the significant volatility in foreign exchange rates, particularly in the last month of the quarter. We did have an impact on our balance sheet from a remeasurement perspective of certain balances late in the quarter and then we also did have an impact to our inventory, which given inventory turns take some time to run through cost of goods sold. That said for fourth quarter, we do expect to have a continued foreign exchange headwind, both on margin and the bottom-line in the fourth quarter. We expect in the fourth quarter on the bottom-line to have FX if rates remain stable to where they are today of a negative $0.02 for the fourth quarter while we do have a period right now, where a foreign exchange is benefiting revenue given the roll-off of our hedging program, we are seeing continued slight negative headwind to the bottom line. Next year, with the strength of the dollar and the roll-off of most of our older hedges, we do expect a foreign currency benefit both on revenue and expense, and we mentioned at this stage, if rates remains stable for FY 2019, a positive impact on revenue up to $500 million and over $0.10 impact positively on EPS. Michael Weinstein : Thanks, Karen. And maybe just one follow-up on cash flow. Karen, your guidance that seems to imply that you would do about $4.3 billion in free cash flow this year, and that\u2019s again going back to that FY 2016 base and then adjusting it for the divestiture. You have done $2.8 billion year-to-date is the expectation that you will get to that call it roughly $4.3 billion target? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Yes, thanks for the question. We do have a slide in our slide deck on cash flow and you will see, operating free cash flow year-to-date of $3.6 billion and yes, $2.8 adjusted that on a comparable basis $3 billion year-to-date. And the guidance still stands for the full fiscal year, where we expect to deliver high-single-digit growth on multiyear basis from 2016 to 2018, which would equate to approximately the cash flow forecast that you mentioned. Michael Weinstein : Great. Thank you, Karen. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Mike. Can we get the next question, Krystal please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Great. Good morning. Just got two questions, one for Omar and one for Karen. Omar, I just want to come back to revenue and then some obviously very strong quarter here in the third. If I think that the top end of your guidance sort of implies your 5.5% for the fourth quarter, but also your commentary implies some deceleration and franchises like CVG and RTG. So, were there any one-time dynamics in the third quarter or pull forward, because of the hurricane dynamics or perhaps the fourth quarter reflects some type of conservatism? Omar Ishrak : Well, I think the hurricane dynamics we rose were minor, but there was some applied, but clearly that was rose to the minor a bit on the overall base of our revenue. I think in Q4, it's mainly tougher comparisons year-over-year that are driving this in some areas like diabetes, we expect continued strength and I think CVGs had a strong high almost high single-digit growth rate over the past several quarters and we are running into a tougher comparison in Q4, so that's a lower that has been running. But still we are in the mid-single-digits as we expect. I think with MITG what you saw in the Q4 was a slight enhancement, because of our sales and the pulse oximetry business because of the flu season, which was \u2013 and the requirement for that product was particularly high even given the historical levels. That's going to tail down in Q4, so that\u2019s dampening the growth a little bit. I think those are the key dynamics that I\u2019m looking at. It\u2019s still well in the mid-single-digit well in our guidance and we expect to close the year in the range that we had talked about in a fairly tough year. David Lewis : Okay. So, continued momentum and the major changes across your key franchises sounds like in the fourth quarter. Omar Ishrak : That's correct. Yes, it's just a quarter-over-quarter dynamics and some one-off issues here and there. David Lewis : Okay. And then Karen, just as far as the next year\u2019s outlook, I\u2019d appreciate the comments you have provided. Just two sort of follow-up questions here. I would have great numbers, but it looks like underlying margin performance for fiscal 2018, it looks like it will comment somewhere around that 30 to 50 basis points range, perhaps 40 basis points of underline margins. How do you think that number trended into next year, can you do better than 30 to 40 basis points of underlying margin improvement, in fiscal 2019 is it possible at all to give us some range on the net change in hedging accounting into fiscal 2019 because that\u2019s sort of the big change on a relative basis? Thanks so much. Karen Parkhill : Okay. Sure, thanks for the questions. In terms of margin benefit for FY 2018, you are correct, we did deliver on a constant currency basis 30 basis points of margin improvement this quarter and would expect that momentum to continue to drive full-year margin benefit to be higher than what we have this quarter. In terms of net fiscal year, we do intend to continue to drive operating margin improvement and strong EPS leverage based on current exchanges rates where they are right now, you know we would expect a positive impact to the bottom line from FX and also not a headwind on margins. So it\u2019s been potentially positive benefit on margins too. So we will obviously give our guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call, but I would expect continued positive momentum on margins from here. Particularly driven by our enterprise excellence program which we announced at the JP Morgan conference. David Lewis : Great, thanks Karen, thanks Omar. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks David. Next quarter please Krystal. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Kind of been a nice quarter to you guys. So maybe be my first one Omar and maybe Mike Coyle can add to that. Value based care this is something you have spoken - Omar. It just feels like you know we are getting more traction, you know we had some numbers on the revenue of rhythm management right where a lot of I think the street is concerned on this to compare your dynamics. You have a huge trial coming in, the Rapid Trial. Can you talk about how those value based contracts in particular in CRM, TYRX would change once you get the trial readout and could this possibly lead to more share gains and positive growth in that business in a few quarters? Omar Ishrak : You know I know I have spoken a lot about value based healthcare, but I\u2019m particularly pleased to see this translate into real numbers which have real differentiating value for Medtronic and the person who read that actually is Mike Coyle in CVG and while TYRX is one example where innovation is linked directly to an outcome when we built a business model around it. We have actually got four, five other programs which are equally interesting, we are in the starting phases, but I will let Mike just comment overall on the subject then also onto the specific question on TYRX. Michael Coyle : Sure, relative to TYRX, we are quite pleased with the level of uptick that we are seeing in with over 1000 hospitals now participating in the program where we actually have linkage back to essentially make a payment that will go to the account if the patient comes back with device related infection within six months. And I think what that has been able to do is TYRX is not separately reimbursed and so by doing this we have been able to create a guarantee that basically is very appealing to accounts who know that they will obviously have a patient who is significantly impacted by an infection. They will lose money at the provider level, at the hospital level, because of that redo procedure that\u2019s required and of course the payer is now out two separate procedures for payments. So this really is a win, win, win the way we have structured it and I think it\u2019s been seen that way by the accounts, but it also allowed us by being able to see the appeal of this approach to then apply it to numerous other parts of our business, including reductions in Heart Failure re-hospitalization with the adaptive CRT, a feature of our CRT devices. Our Smart Shot Performance Guarantee program which basically pays when patients come back with inappropriate shots from an ICD, the drug-coated balloon reintervention prevention program which basically tie to patients coming back for target lesion reduced in SFA disease. And then in our cryoablation business, basically we have a program that pays when patients coming back with either repeat hospitalizations for AF, or for repeat procedures with the ablation. And so collectively, these programs have now been rolled out really just been the last year since the TYRX program really got momentum in January a year ago and these newer programs are really only a quarter or two old, but as we mentioned in the script, we have over $650 million of revenue mostly in the U.S. tied to these programs and we continue to see opportunities to do more of them. Vijay Kumar : Maybe one follow-up on cap allocation. Karen, you have access to $14 billion plus of cash and I think you mentioned for fiscal 2019 less interest income. So I\u2019m just curious wouldn\u2019t debt pay down offset some of that or can you just walk us with the mat on how that cash is going to be used and why should be an interest income headwind for next year? Karen Parkhill : Sure. So yes, we do have $14 billion of cash on our balance sheet and we have access to the vast majority of that post Tax Reform. I think the biggest benefit to us will be the access to our ongoing cash generation though going forward, but with respect to the existing cash on the balance sheet, we have been paying down debt this year, we have another $2 billion of debt to mature in the fourth quarter this year, which we expect to let retire and we also have the Puerto Rico tax settlement still waiting out there. It is under appeal, we have a hearing date set for mid March and so we are hopeful and feel strongly about our position there, but should the Appeals Court uphold the prior settlement, it does mean that we would have to pay a large tax settlement from that transaction. So the greatest benefit again is our access to our ongoing cash generation going forward. Vijay Kumar : Thank you guys. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Vijay. Krystal, next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two pretty straightforward questions I\u2019m asking both. Now Karen, I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, but the tax rate in fiscal 2019 are you assuming 100 to 200 basis points improvement over fiscal 2018, sorry if I missed that earlier on. And Omar, I was struck when I looked at the JP Morgan slide in January, few tuck-in M&A deals you have done in fiscal 2018 versus prior year. So I guess my question is why is that the case and any color you can provided on what we should expect going forward would be helpful. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Okay let me take the acquisition one first. A number of things, first of all we do acquisitions when we meet certain guidelines, that means where we think that the acquisition will add to our strategies which are very clear in the disease areas that we have got, especially tuck-in acquisitions in the disease areas that we have got presence in and it fills out our overall capabilities. We have got to have the management bandwidth and the financial bandwidth to do the deal and it is an interesting acquisition we do, then we haven\u2019t been shy from doing some reasonably big ones in the past two years. I think the improved access to cash that we have with the new tax reform will actually help, open our financial bandwidth in doing some of these deals, but remember they all go together. There is financial bandwidth. There is management bandwidth. There is most importantly the strategic alignment of the tuck-in acquisition and our ability to integrate it properly with the right team. And I wouldn\u2019t read too much into any particular year, it is really overall, we have created a pretty good track record of doing these and we intend to continue. Karen Parkhill : And Larry on the tax rate question, our initial estimates indicated that we would benefit from a slightly lower effective tax rate beginning in fiscal year 2019. We did not have the basis points improvement, but we did say we expect it to be slightly lower. We continue to work through the complexity of the new reform and additional guidelines that come out from an U.S. treasury to refine our estimates and certainly, if in that process, our initial estimates change, we will certainly let you know, but at this stage, we expect a slightly lower effective tax rate. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions guys. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Larry. Krystal, next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back on the comments on the robotics platform. I was just wondering if you could expand upon any other comments that you made earlier, just going on what exactly are some of the delays there? Omar Ishrak : Like I said Kristen, that\u2019s a fairly complicated system with multiple computers being put together and it\u2019s the event that we have had some experience with, and when you integrate a system of this level of complexity, there may be some time line shifts as to when will be ready for first-inhuman use and so it\u2019s taken just a little longer than we thought earlier. We are very excited about what we are seeing, I mean we have seen the thing operate and the performance is very compelling. I think it\u2019s best if we wait till Investor Day when we will give you some more insights as to the nature of this product, which we are really excited about and also as we get closer to commercial launch, we will give you some dates. So I think that\u2019s the best way to look at it. It makes no mistake this product is an outstanding product and the sorts of integration hiccups you get are not uncommon at all with systems of this magnitude and one that we know will get through, and we will be ready for the launch of the suitable type. Kristen Stewart : Okay. But you said do you still expect first-inhuman use to the event? Omar Ishrak : No. Look we are not at a stage to give you dates like that, but once we wait till Investor Day and then we will give you an update on our overall performance and really, we will stick to timelines when we are close to commercial launch. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then just a question on diabetes franchise, can you give an update on the continued growth monitor? Michael Coyle : Hi, Kristen. The central ramp-up is actually progressing well. It was a key contributor to our growth rate in Q3. Just to maybe put some additional color on it, our guidance since its reproduction in the third quarter was twice as high as what we experienced in the second quarter. So that should give you an indication of how things are progressing and as the commentary alluded to, we are on track to fulfill all the sensor needs of our install base this quarter and by the end of this quarter, we will be able to meet unconstrained demand as we have been staying all the long. Now the other thing I will just point out is the performance of the sensor itself not just capacity, but as Omar talked about in the commentary, the MARDs that we are seeing on over 20,000 patients in the install base is fantastic and continues to really essentially marrow what we saw in the pivotal trial. So, we are very pleased not just in terms of the output, but also the quality of the sensor. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Perfect. Just timing in the U.S.? Michael Coyle : For the Guardian Connect standalone? Kristen Stewart : Yes. Michael Coyle : Yes. That one is with the FDA. Kristen, we are very confident that we are going to be able to get this out shortly. It\u2019s hard to predict exactly when the FDA is going to approve it, but we are working very closely with them and all indications are that we will have an approval here in short order. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Thanks very much everyone. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Kristen. Take next question please, Krystal. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Good morning guys. Thank you. Kristen, a question for you on the $3 billion growth cost savings goal that you guys have said. If I look correctly, the FY 2018 was the base here and so now that you guys are most the way to year one, could you give us a sense of what net savings have been today just so can triangulate how that translating into margins overtime? Karen Parkhill : Sure, Isaac. On the $3 billion gross savings, we do expect annually incrementally between $500 million to $700 million each year over the five-year period. So next year, you can expect that incremental savings, not all of that will follow to the bottom-line, because we will be focused on using some of it to offset pricing pressure and to reinvest, but it is this program that will drive that strong margin improvement and EPS leverage that we have talked about. Go ahead. Isaac Ro : No, I\u2019m sorry. You were speaking. Karen Parkhill : In terms of the $500 million to $700 million annual incremental each year, expect it to be more in the lower half of that range in the beginning years and more in the upper half of that range in the later years. Isaac Ro : Okay. And so when we get to let\u2019s say next Investor Meeting or thereabout, would you start talking about net savings that you expect out of this program either a cumulative or on an annual basis? Karen Parkhill : Yes. We will be talking about every year when we give annual guidance, the net savings as we see impact that we would expect to see from a top to a bottom-line. Isaac Ro : Okay. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Isaac. Krystal, next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Matthew Taylor : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So I wanted to follow up on two points that you just put a final point on two areas that you have already touched on. One is, it is encouraging to see the diabetes turn around and you talked getting to a point where you are now meeting demand. I guess could you help us sequentially understand from here how much improvement you could see in terms of your ability to grow beyond that and actually go after new customers and maybe just touch on it a little bit more detail, the enema has changed and how that could help your pump as you said you are the preferred provider? Omar Ishrak : Sure, Matt. When we say by the end of this quarter, we will be able to meet on constraint demand that\u2019s not only talking about pump users and our ability to satisfy the sensor needs of those patients who are on pumps. It\u2019s also about our ability to go after new markets like standalone sensors which I had talked about with Guardian Sensor 3 three and the pending approval in the United States. So we really feel confident that by the end of this fiscal year we will be in a position to really go after our existing market as well as start to really penetrate aggressively new markets that we currently don\u2019t plan. That\u2019s number one, as far as Animas goes I would say that\u2019s progressing very well, we are generating today consumable revenue from that transaction and we are transitioning patients that are out of warranty from Animas to Medtronic as planned and things are going very well with that and we are getting some incremental growth out of that and the way I would characterize it is even - if we exclude Animas we would have been double digits in Q3, but we are very pleased with how that\u2019s going and we look forward to just continuing the transition. Matthew Taylor : Thanks and then just a follow-up maybe for Mike Coyle or anybody else who want to jump in on CVG. So are really encouraged by the growth this quarter in the mid single-digit expectations going forward. Could you just touch on specifically whether you are seeing competition from the recent MRI labels of your key competitors and how you are able to offset that and talk about TYRX but any kind of further color in that one pain point result? Michael Coyle : Yes, obviously we play in a lot of statements and we see various momentum coming from all new product launches and competitive new product launches and you know we are seeing at the margin some share loss in the initial implants in the ICD segment just as MRI has come in for the both competitors and they are basically going to their user friendly accounts and getting some of that share back. Of course on the flip side we are taking share in the - segment of the market because if not only Micra but also because of the CRT-P quadripolar product as well as the strong position we have now with our next generation wireless facing pacing that just entered the U.S. market. And obviously you also saw we are taking market share in both the coronary and [indiscernible] segments. So basically when you net it all together, we are really just taking advantage of the size and scale that we had as an organization for diversified growth and we think we can continue to deliver above the market growth and our segment market growth is between 4.5% and 5% typically. So that 4.5% to 5% we are talking about next quarter really is just a function of a very strong Q4 a year ago and then we expect to be able to continue or participate across our broad portfolios that is above market growth. Matthew Taylor : Thanks Mike. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Matt. We will take the next question please Krystal. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Danielle Antalffy : Thanks so much. Good morning guys thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really strong quarter. Omar I was wondering if you could talk about new product contribution to growth in the quarter, obviously new products are a key part of this and also how we should think about the contribution of the new product growth factor in fiscal 2019, not asking you to give guidance, but it just seems like that\u2019s going to become an increasingly important part of the growth story. Omar Ishrak : Yes, I think first of all I don\u2019t have the exact number in front of me, but that is a major component of the growth in this last quarter and it will be going forward and the Company is really based around therapy innovation, so that\u2019s not surprising. I do want to point out clearly that our value-based healthcare programs are economic value programs that are all accelerators for our new products and we realized that the connection of technology to demonstrating clear outcome improvement is the way to get value for these products even in the current fee for service environment and to get differentiated pricing for these products, because of the credible promise and commitment to improve the outcome which our customers see. So you will see an increasing drive towards newer and newer therapies, but the linkage to the outcome and the value that that creates is what will give us our differentiated strategy and then over time of course these products then go into emerging markets and drive further acceptance in those markets in penetration, but the new products in our business are the fundamental sort of value that we have and the linkage to outcome as what the value is to our customers and an ability to join these two together as we are successfully able to do now will differentiate us, will give us momentum. Danielle Antalffy : Great. And just one quick follow-up to that given the importance of new products, can you talk about the gross margin profile of these new products sort of overall is it in line with about corporate average is that the right way to think of new products generally? Omar Ishrak : I think the new products yes, in general, I mean sometimes they are so attractive in the market when we make a tradeoff with pricing volume, but in general you know with the new feature, the new value and the price is justified by the value that the customers and the objectives we realize. And so this is not an arbitrary thing that the value we get the price and in general you see that and you will see the offset of older products overtime. So overall pricing surf numbers that we put previously I think will takes us hold and our ability to maintain them depends on these new products. Danielle Antalffy : Okay. Thank you so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Danielle. Next question please, Krystal. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO. Joanne Wuensch : Thanks for taking the question. Very nice revenue growth this quarter. Can we talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the TAVR market, you had you indicated your opening up new centers and is there anything specific that we should look for at ACC? Michael Coyle : Yes, I think the market dynamics have remained very strong there in terms of overall market growth in the low 20s on a constant currency basis and that\u2019s pretty well balanced across the U.S. and international. We obviously have been in share capture mode here over the last couple of quarters based on really the performance of the Evolut PRO product, which has being extremely well received in terms of its lowering leak rates, lowering pacemaker rates and so it\u2019s really being received as an excellent product. But also obviously the expand indications for use into intermediate risk and of course we continue with enrollment in the low risk patient population and of course we have entered the Japan obviously with the Evolut product as well. So all of those collectively are helping us drive above market growth in the overall market. There is nothing particularly new at ACC coming in terms of - really just additional data in some of our larger registries and studies, which obviously continue to support the performance of the products and especially Evolut PRO. So you will see those at ACC. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you and as a follow-up question. Your Resolute Onyx is gaining fair momentum this quarter, is there anything qualitatively you can share with us as a positive being rolled out? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Yes. What we think that is one of our customers tell us it\u2019s probably the best handling stent in the marketplace in terms of high visibility, is there a good visibility, it\u2019s got a great deliverability. We also expanded the size metrics and have actually some unique sizes that other companies don\u2019t have. And the other thing it does for us is in conjunction with resolute integrity, which is also a very well performing product gives us a little more balance in terms of how we can provide multiple price points into the market to deal with pricing pressures. And so collectively, those things have really allowed us to both stabilize pricing and to drive market share capture across that segment and of course, it\u2019s still a very large product segment and highly profitable, so we are glad to see the growth that we are getting out of the product in both the U.S. and in Japan. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Joanne. Krystal, next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Navarro with RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Navarro : Hi. Good morning. Two questions on spine. First, it looks like the Spine market had another challenging quarter, do you guys have any incremental insights anything you may have regarding the challenges that are facing the market, anything new you may have picked up in the last three months and then as a follow-up ticking with Spine, I\u2019m wondering how much has the major robot helped drive your business and has it helped pull through any incremental hardware and biologic sales? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Glenn, on the market, I have no new insights from the last quarter, I mean the formula that we had been seeing in call it FY 2017 and even in Q1 FY 2018 is more of a kind of 5% procedural growth with maybe 3% price reductions for a net 2% growth on a global basis. And that formula has come down to maybe a 2%, 3% procedure growth of 2% or 3% price decline to get you basically flat and that\u2019s what we have been seeing over the last couple of quarters. We do think that\u2019s going to go up from here to a point of net growth or so over the next couple of quarters is what we are seeing, but no new insights in terms of what is driving that. I mean there is definitely a more pricing. I think there is another point of pricing pressure in here and with hospitals consolidating, getting more sophisticated in their buying patterns and they are tendering and they are consolidating their vendor base and for us, its tail 2 cities, one given our product preps and implants plus our enabling technology we end up usually a net benefactor when you consolidate vendors, but it is resulting in some price declines. So that\u2019s what we are gaining from share. In terms of Mazor, it is starting I mean the distribution relationship is relatively new and it is starting to pull through revenue. There is too tangible. We haven\u2019t seen the benefit of it yet, we will see it in the coming quarters. There is two tangible way that pulls through revenue, one is when we have placed a few sorts of equipments and that accounts in return for incremental spine shares. So in the last two quarters, we have started doing that with Mazor and that it lags maybe six months before those contracts take effect and we actually see that incremental revenue. So we haven\u2019t seen it yet, but it\u2019s locked in if you will. And then going forward around the December or January timeframe, we will have Mazor integrated into our broader spine enabling technology. So, it\u2019s fully integrated with navigation and operative imaging or O-arm and in that case, the advanced features of that platform will only work with Medtronic implant. So, it will be a technology type in with the platform that will further pull through. So, it is starting to drive the revenue, you don\u2019t see in our economic shift, but it will be coming in the coming quarters and those are the two reasons why. Glenn Navarro : Geoff, just one clarification. Did you say going forward, your thought procedure volume would improve, offset by maybe slightly greater pricing pressure so net-net no change in the market going forward on the quarter basis? Geoffrey Martha : It\u2019s hard to project us as we are looking at net-net anywhere from no change to maybe 100 basis points improvement on net. Glenn Navarro : Okay, great. Thank you, Geoff. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Glenn. Now, we will take one more question please, Krystal. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Josh Jennings : Good morning. Thank you. I was hoping to follow up Omar, on your comment on your economic value creation strategy. Historically, you have talked about 40 to 60 basis points of organic growth contribution coming from the services and solution business. I\u2019m wondering if you could update your thoughts that should we still be considering the annuity revenue growth from hospital solutions, some of your peer services business like Cardiocom as well as the value-based programs driving 40 to 60 basis points, organic growth or should we thinking more about the implant benefit with some of those programs driving growth more on the implant side going forward? And I have one follow-up. Omar Ishrak : Sure, look I think both. We haven\u2019t been able to hit the 40 to 60 basis points. We talked about it as a target closer to the 20 to 40 I\u2019d say and our growth in hospital solutions continues and we had actually a particularly strong quarter with the VA in our care management services business. So, I mean those have done an easy revenue actually continues to grow. We are increasing the number of hospitals. We are pretty excited about the spread of contracts that we are getting in hospitals around the world now in Latin America and in the Middle East as well as in Western Europe to our hospital solutions and that\u2019s increased from our cath lab managed services or operating managed services as well. So, there is a strong focus in the company around that and that will deliver increased annuity revenue. I think though what we found is that the bigger benefit and that\u2019s the value, but the bigger benefit actually is the linkage with our new therapies, which is then driving incremental share in our new therapies and incremental pricing in some situation, where the innovation and value are directly linked. And so that\u2019s why we started to look at this in a much more integrated fashion and the contribution we can only value actually to our innovation program is greater than the annuity revenue although I\u2019m not, by any means, saying we are going away from that in any way. Josh Jennings : Thanks for that and just a follow-up, one of the drivers behind the response of acquisition hip and knee offering was your services business and the opportunity there. Any change if you can give us an update just on the performance of your hip and knee offering relative to internal expectations and the updated thoughts on the Medtronic\u2019s drive to add breadth and scale to the orthopedic unit? Thanks a lot. Omar Ishrak : I think we are still in the early phases of that and I\u2019m going to ask Geoff to kind of comment on risk management. Geoffrey Martha : Yes, sure. As Omar said, I mean we are coming into the ortho market; we want to come in a disruptive way both from a device standpoint and from the services standpoint. And so we remained really encouraged about the opportunity, but it is taking a little longer than we thought, we are still working on this and we are getting good engagement from customers both on the device side. Our knee is out there and we are seeing operate it on a number of centers and you know we have had 50 or so patients that has been implanted in, but again we are continuing to tweak the instrument design on that to get it exactly where we want it, and the hip is from an FDA approval standpoint several quarters out. So we are continuing work on that and be encouraged by the demand for this value proposition on the device side and on the servicer side this is more of a care pathway offering, also very encouraged by the customers we have engaged with. You know several hospitals and also some outpatient surgery centers. Again not ready to fully ramp this, because that takes in investment of capital that until we get the exact formula right to be disruptive and scale this in a profitable way we are not going to ramp it. So we are still working on this and will update you in the future on this. Joshua Jennings : Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Josh. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Thanks to all for your questions and on behalf of the entire management team I\u2019d like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic and we look forward to updating you on our progress and results for our full-year on our Q4 call which we currently anticipate holding on Thursday May the 24th. Thank you all very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Shelby and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronics Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Ryan Weispfenning : Great, thank you, Shelby. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic\u2019s Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 which ended on April 27, 2018. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. During this earnings call, many of the statements made maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. References to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and references to annual results increasing or decreasing our comparison to fiscal year 2017; references to organic revenue growth excluding the impact of material acquisitions, divestitures and currencies, references to pro forma exclude the impact of material divestitures. Unless we say otherwise, quarterly and annual rates and ranges are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjust for material divestitures as well as the impact of foreign currencies. All of these adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. Finally, other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. I am pleased to announce that this morning we reported strong fourth quarter financial results. Revenues grew 6.5% organic, coming in 100 basis points above the high-end of our guidance range. This marks the second straight quarter of 6.5% organic top-line growth enabling us to more than overcome a very tough first half of the year. Q4 non-GAAP operating profit grew 8% pro forma and 9% adjusted for currency, while non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 14% and 15% respectively. The operating margin expanded 80 basis points, pro forma constant currency and as we enter FY 2019, currency at current rates looks to be a tailwind to both margins and earnings for the first time in years. For the full fiscal year 2018, revenue of $30 billion grew 4.6% organically with a further 40 basis points from acquisitions. Non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 9% pro forma and 10% constant currency. The second half of the year was particularly strong overcoming several first half challenges including an IT disruption, multiple hurricanes, fires in Santa Rosa and supply constraints in diabetes. Despite all of this we recovered well and came in at the high-end of both the revenue and the EPS guidance we established at the start of the year. We also continued to drive margin expansion, reduced debt leverage, and returned $4.3 billion to shareholders.  We made significant progress against each of our growth strategies. In Therapy Innovation, we executed a number of meaningful product launches and advanced a pipeline of increasingly ground-breaking medical technologies. We are creating new markets disrupting existing markets and leading in several of the fastest growing growth markets in medtech. In globalization, we continued to lead our industry in expanding access into markets around the world including delivering another year of double-digit growth in emerging markets. In economic value, we continued to develop new partnerships and business models to accelerate adoptions of our innovative therapies.  Our ability to overcome multiple challenges to deliver at the level that we did in the second half of the year reflects the dedication of our 86,000 employees around the world each of whom make a difference to benefit patients and fulfill the Medtronic mission.  In FY 2018, together with our physician partners, we served over 71 million patients or more than two patients every second. In the fourth quarter, each of our operating groups delivered strong results with mid-single-digit revenue growth in CVG MITG and RTG and over 20% growth in diabetes. Geographically, it was a strong diversified performance with 5.3% growth in the U.S. and 4.6% growth in non-U.S. developed markets including 4.4% growth in Western Europe and 5.5% growth in Japan. We also had a strong finish to the year with 15.5% growth in emerging markets. At the same time, we expanded our operating margin and delivered 290 basis points of operating leverage. This helped EPS growth of 14% pro forma and 15% constant currency. As we look to FY 2019 and beyond, we have increasing confidence in our ability to deliver operating leverage and margin expansion as a result of our Enterprise Excellence Program which is now fully underway.  Looking now at our Group results in the quarter, our Cardiac and Vascular Group grew 5.4% delivering sustained growth by leveraging the breadth of its products and services, as well as its strong position in important rapidly expanding markets.  In Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, we had a very good quarter in pacing with high-single-digit growth driven by the continued rollout of our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, as well as the recent launch of the Azure next-generation family of pacemakers. We also continued to see strong growth in Infection Control, AF Solutions and our Mechanical Circulatory Support business. Coronary & Structural Heart delivered impressive 12.8% growth, driven by the rollout of our Resolute Onyx, drug-eluting stent in the U.S. and Japan as well as, low 20s growth in the transcatheter aortic valves. This was driven by continued strong global demand for our Evolut PRO valve and expanded indications in the U.S., which has resulted in above market levels of growth for the past five quarters. In addition, during this past quarter, we received approval for our Global pivotal trial of Symplicity Spyral, a new therapy for treatment-resistant hypertension. With this innovative adaptive Bayesian trial design, which leverages prior enrollments in our previously reported off-med clinical study cohorts, patient enrollment is now well underway. Positive results of our Symplicity Spyral ON-MED clinical trial were presented yesterday at the EuroPCR Meeting in Paris validating the role this therapy can have in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension as an adjunct to medical therapy. Our minimally invasive therapies grew 4.8% led by 5.9% growth in Surgical Innovations with strength in Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy and we capitalize on the conversion of surgical procedures from open to minimally invasive. Our innovative products improving outcomes and driving growth including our Signia powered surgical stapling system, which uses our Tri-Staple 2.0 reloads, as well as our ValleyLab FT10 Energy platform and new iterations of our LigaSure vessel sealing instruments.  Our Restorative Therapies Group grew 6.1% this quarter, its best quarter of organic growth since we established the Group eight years ago. This is despite the well-known challenges in the Spine market and reflects strong execution and robust growth, in particular, in our Brain & Pain divisions. In Brain therapies, we are leading the development of the endovascular therapy market for the treatment of ischemic strokes resulting in high-teens growth in neurovascular. We also had a great quarter in neurosurgery with low-double-digit growth reflecting strong demand for our StealthStation S8 Navigation systems, the Mazor X robotic guidance systems for our spine surgeries and our Visualase MRI-guided laser ablation system. In Pain Therapies, the turnaround is officially underway with back-to-back quarters of strong growth. Our spinal cord stimulation business grew mid-teens this quarter including high-teens in the U.S. We are seeing great acceptance of our new offerings in Spinal Cord Stim including our Intellis stimulator, our Evolve workflow algorithm and our Snapshot reporting. This is a dramatic turnaround for a business that declined in the mid-single-digits in FY 2017 and low-double-digits in the first half of this year.  In Spine, we grew 1% better than the global market, which we estimate is slightly declining. We are seeing emerging strength in our differentiated spine products and procedures including high-single-digit growth in BMP and [OLUS] [ph], strong double-digit growth in Prestige LP Cervical Discs and strong customer adoption of our new SOLERA VOYAGER 5.5/6.0 fixation systems and ARTiC-L 3D printed titanium cage.  In addition, when coupling our Spine revenue with the Spine enabling technologies that are reported, in our Neurosurgery business, our combined revenues grew 2.7%. We believe this is a more relevant comparison of our Spine results against our competition and an indication that our Surgical Synergy strategy is working and driving our overall growth in Spine Procedures. Diabetes had a very strong finish to the year with low-20s growth driven by U.S. patient demand for our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system. We now have over 70,000 trained active users in our 670G system. And we continue to get positive feedback with real-world results in line with our physical study data.  Importantly, we have completed upgrades to our sensor manufacturing lines and now have capacity to meet expected global demand going forward. Outside the U.S. we continued to see strong demand for our 640G system. We experienced another quarter of strong performance in Europe and recently received regulatory approval for the 640G in Japan. All of this led to our IIM division growing in the mid-20s internationally.  Based on the strength of the 6 series systems, IIM\u2019s share grew sequentially to 70% of all durable and consumable parts globally. In addition our sensor attachment rates continued to increase as we shift our customer base from standalone pumps to sensor augmented systems. As this happened, our business is seeing an increasing revenue mix from CGM sensors which creates a strong consistent annuity stream for our diabetes group. We are also excited about our entry into the $1 billion standalone CGM market with our Guardian Connect systems. As our sensor capacity increased, we ramped up our commercial efforts for this product in Europe this quarter and expect to continue commercial expansion into the new fiscal year.  In the U.S. we recently received FDA approval for Guardian Connect and intend to start our broad launch in the first quarter. Guardian Connect is the only standalone sensor that transmits directly to its platform. It features unique predictive alerts and in the U.S. when utilized Sugar.IQ which is based in the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to detect important patterns and trends for people with diabetes.  Turning now to our globalization growth strategy, emerging markets which represent 15% of our revenues grew 15.5%. It is important to point out that it is not just one market driving growth, but several and reflects our broad diversification.  Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Eastern Europe and China all grew double-digits in the fourth quarter. China, our largest emerging market grew 12.7% in the fourth quarter and finished the year with over $1.8 billion in revenues. This is a significant increase from the less than $0.5 billion of revenue in the region when I joined Medtronic seven years ago.  Our differentiated strategies of public and private partnerships, optimizing the distribution channel and driving local manufacturing and R&D are making a difference, not only in China, but in our emerging markets around the world. We are investing to build strong leading businesses in emerging markets as we continue to collectively represent the single largest opportunity in Medtech.  Our remaining growth strategy, economic value is an accelerator for therapy innovation and globalization strategies. We continue to make progress in creating new value-based business models that directly link our therapies to proving outcomes. With our direct related value-based healthcare arrangement, we now have over 1100 hospitals under contracts, covering over 30% of our U.S. CRHF implantables revenue helping to drive sequential market share gains in ICDs, CRTs. This is one of the reasons why our performance in CRHF has been better than the street was expecting six to nine months back. The other region is innovation where we lead the developments of several important and often disruptive technologies such as Micra.  Finally, I want you to know that across Medtronic, execution is our top priority. You\u2019ve seen that in our results in the past two quarters. In our resurgence following a string of challenges in the first half of the year, and in our ongoing commitment to cost management that began by achieving our Covidien cost synergies and is now being extended into our enterprise excellence initiatives. We know there is much more to be done, but we are excited and optimistic as our direction is clear, our pipeline is full, and our team has never been stronger.  With that, let me ask Karen to now take you through a discussion of our fourth quarter financials. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Omar. As mentioned, our fourth quarter revenue of $8.144 billion represented a 2.9% increase as reported and organic growth of 6.5%. Foreign currency had a positive $315 million impact on fourth quarter revenue. GAAP diluted earnings per share was a $1.07. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.42.  After adjusting for the divestiture, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 14% pro forma and 15% constant currency. The operating margin for the quarter was 30.2%, representing an 80 basis point improvement on a pro forma constant currency basis. Gross margin was down 50 basis points reflecting our sales mix in the quarter. The impact of mix on our gross margin this quarter was more than offset by a 150 basis point improvement in SG&A on a pro forma constant currency basis, reflecting our company-wide initiatives on expense leverage.  Net other expense, which is included in our operating margin was $188 million. This was slightly higher than expected primarily due to mark-to-market on some of our investments.  Foreign exchange in total had a 160 basis point negative impact on our operating margin in the quarter, primarily due to the year-over-year change in currency gains and losses related to our hedging program. But the good news is that based on current rates, we expect the currency headwind that flagged us for several quarters on the operating margin to turn into a tailwind in fiscal 2019 starting in the first quarter. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 14.9%, slightly better than expected given favorable IRS audit resolution. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a non-GAAP diluted basis were 1.366 billion shares. As expected, this was roughly flat sequentially.  Combining our $1.8 billion of net share repurchase in fiscal 2018, with the $2.5 billion we paid in dividends over the same period, our total payout ratio was 65% on non-GAAP net income and 118% on free cash flow. Free cash flow for fiscal 2018 was $4.7 billion, above our prior guidance range and after adjusting for a $1.1 billion prepayment to the IRS related to our Puerto Rico tax litigation. While the litigation is still in process, given our access to cash post tax reform, we elected to put as much of this potential $1.5 billion liability as possible behind us. By prepaying, we were also able to stop the accrual of significant interest.  In the quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $3 billion allowing us now to focus on other capital allocation priorities going forward. Given U.S. Tax Reform, we will be continuing the liquidation of some of our investments overseas, note that this will negatively impact interest income, but it will enable increasing access over the next several quarters to our formerly draft cash on our balance sheet. We intend to put this cash to work by investing in our business and returning to our shareholders.  Now looking at the picture ahead. For fiscal year 2019, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 4.5%. By business group, we expect CVG. MITG and RTG to grow 4% plus or minus. With CVG likely on the minus side, given the anniversary of major product launches in Coronary and Structural Heart, and MITG and RTG to be more in line with the 4%. We expect Diabetes to grow in the low double-digits, with a stronger first half off of low comparisons.  For the first quarter, we expect total company revenue to be consistent with our guidance for the year. In addition to CVG, we expect MITG to be on the minus side of the full year, given more difficult comparisons from Endo Stapling and Catheter sales, offset by more robust growth from Diabetes with continued 670G strength. Turning to margins, we expect operating margin expansion in fiscal year 2019 of approximately 50 basis points on a pro forma constant currency basis driven by our Enterprise Excellence initiatives. For modeling purposes, we would assume a slight improvement in the first quarter with increasing improvement through the remainder of the fiscal year.  We expect our tax rate to be between 14% and 15%, roughly in line with our fiscal 2018 tax rate. With respect to earnings, we expect fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.10 to $5.15. This implies EPS growth of 10% at the midpoint of the range.  For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.12 off the fiscal 2018 base of $1.03. We recognized that the street didn\u2019t have the full picture on first quarter comparisons pro forma for the divestitures until we shared the last week in an 8-K. So hopefully that filing helped.  Also keep in mind, we had a lower tax rate in the first quarter last year from benefits not expected to repeat creating a roughly $0.03 headwind in the first quarter.  Finally, on free cash flows, we expect $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion in fiscal year 2019. This excludes a potential final $400 million payment to Puerto Rico related to our pending litigations that I referenced earlier, the timing and outcome of which is uncertain. Over the next couple of years, we expect to make significant progress in improving our free cash flow conversion as litigation and tax payments are expected to diminish and we benefit from programs we have put in place to improve working capital.  While the impact from currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, our full year revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $50 million to $150 million. Recall the time of our third quarter earnings call, it was a $500 million positive impact. However, despite this $600 million swing, FX is still not as positive for fiscal 2019 margins, earnings and free cash flow because of our hedging program.  If recent rates hold, we would expect a reported operating margin of 28.5% for the year and a $0.05 tailwind to full year EPS. For the first quarter, if recent rates hold, revenue would be positively affected by approximately $90 million $130 million, operating margin would have a slight benefit, and EPS would have a $0.02 benefit.  Before I turn the call back to Omar, I would like to note that we plan to hold our biennial Institutional Investor and Analyst Day on Tuesday June 5th in New York City. We intend to discuss our long-term strategies and share our long range plan at that time.  Now, I will return the call back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Karen, and to summarize, we have delivered two consecutive quarters of strong revenue growth to finish our fiscal year. We also expanded our operating margin and delivered meaningful EPS leverage. Looking ahead, we feel good about the growth opportunities in our markets and our competitive position in these markets.  We expect continued revenue growth and margin expansion and we also focused on generating strong free cash flow conversion and making the right investments to drive shareholder value. And finally, execution is our top priority.  Before we turn to Q&A, we have the benefit of Mike Weinstein joining us earlier this month. Given his recent transition, we thought it might be helpful for him to make some comments. Mike? Mike Weinstein : Certainly. Thanks, Omar. I\u2019ll make a few comments. I think we started - I think with a great quarter. There is a lot of work to do and I\u2019d certainly don\u2019t to want the street to get out ahead of us. But this was a good quarter. Six to nine months ago, when I was on the other side of this call, we on the sell-side were all worried about growth in the companies that always have to queue with the pace of competition, competitors introducing MRIs and tablet pacers, ICDs, deep brain simulators, Insertable Cardiac Monitors et cetera and now here we are six months later that Medtronic has delivered back-to-back quarters in 6.5% organic growth.  Again, I don\u2019t want everybody to extrapolate on that historic modeling 6.5% going forward, but I do think I speak to the breadth of the franchise and the number of growth drivers moving in the right direction, which honestly the street, myself included underestimated or missed six months back. RTG as you\u2019ve noted Omar had its best quarter in years, growing 6% organic despite all the challenges we are aware in Spine market. Neurovascular grew high-teens, Neurosurgery grew low double-digits and the STS Pain Stim business has had a remarkable turnaround growing mid-teens this quarter after a meaningful decline in the first half of this year. So, that\u2019s all heading in the right direction. Diabetes, obviously had a fantastic quarter growing 20% plus, well north of what the street was modeling and Guardian standalone hasn\u2019t launched yet in the U.S. and that\u2019s going to start this quarter. So I should go on and back off four operating groups, CVG, RTG, MITG and Diabetes the better than the street was modeling. But the good news is that it\u2019s not just the top-line, margins are starting, and I emphasized starting to go in the right direction.  Gross margins beat by 20 basis points, SG&A beat by 80 basis points, the FX headwinds margins which was severe this quarter at 150 basis points which we are all focused on three months ago, should go away as we head into FY 2019, obviously assuming at current rates. But there is a long way to go. And I think the good news is that we all know that as Omar said, execution is the number one priority right now and we are not going to let one or two good quarters go to our heads.  But I feel good that we are clearly heading in the right direction and Investor Meeting on the 5th will give us a chance to talk about us more. Omar Ishrak : Good. Thank you, Mike. And let\u2019s open the phone lines now for Q&A. In addition to Karen and Mike, I have asked Mike Coyle who is President of CVG, Bob White, President of MITG, Geoff Martha, President of RTG and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us.  We want try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. And with that, operator, first question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Thanks very much and congratulations on a great finish to the fiscal year. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Bob. Robert Hopkins : Yes, it\u2019s a very clear strength and great to see. So I have a quick question for Karen and then a follow-up for Omar. Karen, to start with on operating margins, it\u2019s obviously been a focus point for investors. You delivered 80 basis points of underlying margin in Q4 and 20 basis points for the full fiscal year and you are guiding to 50 for 2019. So I was wondering if you could just talk about the 80 basis points of underlying improvement in Q4, which was a little shy of what you were hoping for at the 100 basis points you talked about. And then more importantly, for fiscal 2019, can you talk about your goal of delivering 50 basis points of underlying margin improvement, which is above the 20 basis points you did this year. So, what are the drivers of that? How much of that is from the restructuring? Just, what gives you confidence, if you can do 50 next year when you did 20 this year? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Yes, thank you for the question, Bob. We were pleased with the operating margin improvement in the fourth quarter of 80 basis points. Keep in mind that that was driven through Covidien synergies that we are now benefiting from, as well as the company-wide focus on expense leverage and it was delivered mostly through improvement note at a 150 basis point improvement in our SG&A. But going forward, we do expect to continue to drive operating margin improvement, we have a company-wide program around Enterprise Excellence, which is intended specifically to drive margin improvement and also to help us offset pricing headwinds and continue to reinvest in our company. That Enterprise Excellence program is well structured, well underway and we are confident in our ability going forward to continue to drive this margin expansion. We\u2019ll talk more about it at Investor Day as well. Robert Hopkins : Okay. And then, I did want to follow-up with Omar on the emerging market growth, because it just, it really seems like a standout in the quarter. It drove over two points of growth in the quarter. So, maybe talk about the sustainability of that emerging market growth. Were there any one-time things impacting emerging market growth in this quarter? And kind of what do you assume for fiscal 2019 in terms of emerging market growth? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Well, thanks a lot. Like I mentioned earlier, the story in our emerging markets is our diversification and our presence in multiple geographies. While China is still the largest, we have significant presence in the Middle East and Africa and Latin America. And in the fourth quarter, all of these geographies grew in the mid \u2013 sort of in the mid-teens. And so, that helped a lot in the fourth quarter performance. Going forward, we certainly expect double-digit growth in the emerging markets. I\u2019d say in the low double-digits, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been performing consistently over time. There was certainly no one-time swing here in the fourth quarter. I think the diversification is playing out well for us with at least three big sort of geographic collection of countries that are well diversified amongst themselves. So that\u2019s what gives us a confidence that we can continue to do this and above all the biggest confidence that we have is that we\u2019ve been delivering this for the past five years. So there is nothing other than better performance to expect going forward as our strategy start to play out. Robert Hopkins : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Couple questions for Karen. Karen, just talking about, I want to start off with the growth. So, you mentioned that first quarter growth guidance, you are sort of assuming is comparable for your growth guidance for the remainder of the year. But, the first quarter is also the easiest comp of the year and if you go back to fiscal 2018, the defining element of that year was the first half was dramatically weaker than the second half. So, I guess, said more simply, what drives the momentum in improvement in the business across the remaining three quarters, if the first quarter is going to be comparable with the remainder of the year? Karen Parkhill : So, I would remind everyone that our first quarter comes off the heel typically of a very strong end to our fiscal year and the first quarter is typically not our most robust growth quarter. The second quarter will be the quarter next year that comes off very low comparisons, much more so than the first quarter. So we are confident in the guidance that we\u2019ve given for the first quarter consistent with our annual guidance of 4% to 4.5%. But I would remind folks that both for CVG and MITG in the first quarter, we do expect both businesses to be on the minus side of that 4% with MITG having difficult year-over-year comparison from endo stapling and [capital] [ph] sales and CVG seeing the anniversary of some major product launches last year. David Lewis : Okay, very helpful. Karen. The second question is just on cash flow. I know improving cash flow is a big focus for 2019 and beyond, I imagine it will be a focus for the Analyst Day in a couple weeks. But can you just talk about for fiscal 2019, the operating cash flow assumptions, CapEx assumptions, free cash flow conversion, and maybe a little bit about some of the executive compensation changes that maybe happening around free cash? Thanks so much. Karen Parkhill : Thanks for the question, David. On free cash flow for FY 2019, we said that we expect it to be between 4.7 and 5.1. We have improved our conversion ratio and honestly we expect to improve that conversion ratio going forward specifically over the next couple of years. In terms of things that impact cash on cash from operations, we expect that to grow in line with earnings, on CapEx, we expect CapEx to be roughly flat year-over-year. We intend to spend a little over $1 billion in CapEx like we did this year. And we will have certain other payments related to our restructuring program, some continued legal payments. But we do expect tax specifically when you include the $1.1 billion payment related to the Puerto Rico litigation to decline meaningfully. We will still have that potential $400 million payment to Puerto Rico, it\u2019s unclear whether or not that payment will need to be made in fiscal 2019. It will be dependent on the outcome of the litigation. But, we will have that as well. David Lewis : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter here. So maybe, Karen, you are just talking about the guidance and the cash conversion rate. So, for the EPS guidance what kind of assumptions are we making on capital deployment? When you talk about cash conversions improving, what should be a normalized cash conversion for this business? Can Medtronic go to in a 90% or north of 90% over the medium-term? Karen Parkhill : So, on EPS, we are assuming this is organic. We obviously don\u2019t assume that we make any acquisitions or divestitures. On tax, I did say that we expect 14% to 15% tax rate for the year and on our debt, we expect that to remain relatively stable now that we have completed the debt paydown that we have talked about. In terms of return to shareholders, we did announce recently that we expect to repurchase $1.2 billion in shares throughout the year. That was commensurate with us talking about some debt tendering that we were doing. In terms of a normal cash conversion, keep in mind that our Medtech industry is typically around the 80% conversion rate and we expect to be improving to that range over the next couple of years. We are very focused on it and we expect particularly some of the one-time charges that we\u2019ve had over the past will be diminishing. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s extremely helpful. And maybe one for Omar. Medtronic has done a fantastic job on the top-line, right. I think the issue has always been for us, maybe modeling some of the FX impacts in the moving parts, at the prior Analyst Days, Omar, a lot of the focus was on innovation in top-line, what\u2019s happening with Medtronic, right. And when we think about the upcoming Analyst Day, is there anything going to be different at this Analyst Day in terms of focus? Should we be expecting any update on the Robot or anything else that you want to highlight? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Well, I can assure you that technology and innovation will still be at the top of the agenda. That\u2019s what we are most excited about. That\u2019s what fuels this company. And we have got many \u2013 our pipeline is fuller than it\u2019s ever been and we are extremely excited about it and we\u2019ll be \u2013 and really looking forward to sharing all of that with you at Investor Day. But equally, we are laying out an enterprise excellence program and our focus in operating margins, our focus on cash flow are elements that are serious and I expect that will come through at Analyst Day. So, again, there is going to be no drop-offs in our excitement here on technology and if anything is increased, and you will see exciting examples from all our groups. But I do want to emphasize that the operating margin focus and our cash flow conversion focus is driven by our enterprise excellence program will be clear as well. Vijay Kumar : Sorry, on the robots, should we be expecting any update on the robot? Omar Ishrak : Well, look, we will, Robot is a major program for us. And obviously, we are going to talk about it. Vijay Kumar : Thank you guys. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Vijay. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One on TAVR and one on just the new product launches in fiscal 2019. So, maybe for Mike Coyle, by our math it looks like, the worldwide TAVR market did slow a bit in calendar Q1. Is that accurate? And what are you seeing in the market? At PCR today, one of the presenters said that you would be presenting your low risk data at ACC in 2019. I just want to confirm that\u2019s accurate, that would be pretty impactful. And just lastly on TAVR, Mike, any expectations for the MEDCAC, do you think it\u2019s more likely to expand, keep the same or decrease tenors? Michael Coyle : So, thanks for the question, Larry. In terms of the TAVR growth profile for the quarter, we would peg TAVR growth at somewhere in the vicinity of the high-teens, which obviously is a slowdown from two years ago in mid-20s. But for the fiscal year, it was low-20s, but still that\u2019s very strong growth given the size that that market that\u2019s grown to and for us, obviously, we\u2019ve been growing faster than that in the low-20s. So, it\u2019s been an important growth driver for and we expect it to continue to be an important growth driver for us. In terms of pipeline, we are going to cover that at the Analyst Meeting. Next Tuesday, we will show you what we have in terms of beyond EnVeo with the system that is now going on the United States and into Europe, we will talk about that pipeline in terms of both iterations and then some of the more significant platform investments that we are making in TAVR going forward and as mentioned what we are doing in mitral. And then, in terms of the MEDCAC, our position is a bit intermediate to what we hear coming from the society as I meant from some competitors in the sense that, we believe that all current news \u2013 the current mass coverage \u2013 decision to coverage all of the indications we use for TAVR that are approved and we don\u2019t see constraints at the moment in terms of being able to meet demand. We do think it\u2019s the \u2013 what the societies are proposing as adopted that we can see upwards of 35% of the centers now falling out of the ability to provide TAVR and we think it would a problem for the access for this life-saving technology. And so, our view would be to maintain the national coverage decision until there is an expanded FDA approval for indications that are not covered by the MTD. And that would then give us time to basically evaluate the question of our centers that are smaller and a lower volume actually performing worst than those at high volume. And frankly the data that we have seen today would not support a conclusion that we are seeing meaningfully worst results in those smaller centers. So we think, the MCD as it exists today is good. We will support its continuation and we think it might be the right time to look at that maybe in a couple of years. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thanks, Mike. And Omar, I know you have your Analyst Day, obviously in a week or two. But just for \u2013 just to give us confidence in your guidance for fiscal 2019, what are the product launches that you are most excited about for fiscal 2019? Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Omar Ishrak : Thanks. I\u2019ll just name a few and as you mentioned, we will go through our overall pipeline in greater depth. The Pain business, this turnaround in Pain is very significant and we are extremely excited about what we are seeing and we are seeing that with the Intellis product, our Evolve workflow in our snapshot reporting. I think it\u2019s a unique element in that industry and it\u2019s a massive turnaround as recently as in the first half of this year and something we are getting a lot of traction. So I think, continued momentum in Pain is something that we will definitely see. Diabetes is the other one. I mean, we are just starting there to get the full benefit of the 670G in the U.S. and we are extremely excited about what we see. But equally, we\u2019ve got penetration of the 670G into global markets. On the back of the 640G which is already very successful. And then the Guardian Connect is a whole big opportunity which I mentioned was also is a big area for us. I think in CVG, you heard Mike talk about it. But there is many areas here. One that, I don\u2019t know the exact contribution to growth, but I am extremely excited about its further evolution of the Micra product, which is a revolutionary product for us and one that we are extremely proud about. And the consistent growth that we\u2019ve seen in surgical technologies within MITG will continue. We have a rich pipeline of products and they come out regularly and that will be sustained into next years. So, we expect an exciting year, full of new products, which will continue to fuel our growth. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Larry. Next question, Shelby? Operator : Your next question comes from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Robbie Marcus : Hi and congrats on the good quarter. Omar Ishrak : Thanks. Robbie Marcus : Two of the businesses that stood out were Diabetes and Spinal Cord Stim and Omar, you touched on this just briefly in the last question. But, do you have new product launches there maybe you could give a little more color into what you are seeing in the dynamics with the product launches? And how you think that's impacting the market? Omar Ishrak : Sure. I\u2019ll let the two group leaders kind of briefly comment on that. So, Hooman, do you want to go with Diabetes first? Hooman Hakami : Sure. Robbie, I think that the quarter was really strong. We had some great balanced performance across businesses, across geographies. I\u2019d say, there were really two main drivers. The first is strong global pump growth that we saw and Omar just touched on this a second ago. The first was just continued strong uptake of the 640G in markets outside the United States, but in particular, Europe. And then, we have seen continued strong performance out of the 670G in the U.S. and this is really encouraging, because in many ways, we are just getting started here. So, you look at those dynamics, all of those things led to six points of share gains for us across both consumable and durable pumps this past quarter which we are obviously really excited about. The second big driver for us was the pull-through of sensors. This is as we sell more integrated systems, we are seeing more sensor pull-through. So both the 640G, the 670G are driven by sophisticated algorithms where the pump and the sensor work together to keep a patient in control. As we sell more of these systems, the more sensors we pull-through. So those two dynamics were really the catalysts for us this quarter and then, looking forward, we expect both of these things to continue and for us starting to capitalize on a standalone CGM market that we are just starting to get into. Omar Ishrak : And Geoff, say few words about Pain. Geoffrey Martha : Yes, sure. Sure, Robbie. Obviously, Intellis is off to a strong start for a couple of reasons. One, the device itself, I mean, it\u2019s much, much smaller than the competition. It\u2019s a much faster, three or four times faster recharged, very little battery saved over time, MR compatible, et cetera. And so, just a real compelling differences there. And in addition, our Evolve Workflow which really drives the outcome has been, I believe underappreciated. And these two things taken together get us back in the game. Regarding Evolve, we are still building credibility as we produce more robust data over time. We just launched our Vector trial which is our prospective clinical trial testing multiple aspects of Evolve. We are thinking enrollments underway and on schedule and we anticipate the first release of this data at NANS in January of 2019. In addition, we published some other data from, we call the Verdolin data from Dr. Verdolin. We\u2019ve presented that recently at two scientific meetings and we got really strong results. So this is an independent physician study nearing real world outcomes and we had 83% of the 114 patients, 114 patients had 75% pain reduction. So this is really good result. So after three months, we saw similar results. So, we are seeing really strong data from Evolve and that\u2019s going to continue to build over the course of the year and I think help us access a whole new group of physicians and patients. So, we are \u2013 as Omar indicated, we are really excited about the Pain Stim business and the strong market growth and how we are positioned within it. Robbie Marcus : Thanks and a quick follow-up for Karen. With FX moving so much, maybe you could help us think about how it might impact the gross margin and the other income line? And with higher interest expense run rate, what that might be for next year? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : So, in terms of FX, with the recent movement over the last month in currency rates, we do now expect a bit of a headwind for the full year from FX on revenue and I mentioned between $50 million to $150 million. But I also mentioned the good news is that we still expect a positive impact from FX on our operating margin, on our EPS and on our free cash flow and the key reason for that is our hedging program. Based on where rates are today, we do expect gains in our hedging program that shows up in our net other expense line item and positively impacts our operating margin. You had a second question, Robbie. Will you remind me that one? Robbie Marcus : Just the - how will FX impacts down the P&L and what interest expense might look like given the higher run rate? Karen Parkhill : Right. So on interest expense, obviously, interest expense \u2013 the interest rates have been increasing. So we will have a modest impact from that on an interest expense perspective. On an interest income perspective, I did mentioned that, we are focused on continuing to liquidate our overseas portfolio and as we do that we will have interest income coming down a little bit. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Robbie. Take the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Good morning guys. Thank you. A question on the 2019 op margin expansion guidance that you gave for that 50 basis points, if I think about your prior plan for that $3 billion in gross cost savings through 2022, could you help us understand kind of what\u2019s embedded in the 2019 guidance for margin expansion as it relates to that program to be helpful to understand the pacing there and the net effects? Karen Parkhill : Sure, so, when we gave our enterprise excellence, when we announced our enterprise excellence program and talked about the over $3 billion in savings and leverage that that would deliver through 2022, we also said that we expected over $500 million to $700 million impact or positive savings in leverage annually each year. That is now embedded into our forecast. So that program is designed to offset pricing pressure which we expect continued pricing pressure. It is also intended to help ensure that we can continue to reinvest, particularly in R&D and it is intended to drive operating margin improvement and expansion. And for next year, I mentioned, we expect operating margin expansion of about 50 basis points pro forma constant currency. Isaac Ro : Okay, got it. And then, maybe just a follow-up question on couple product specifically on SCS. Omar, you called out the mid-teens growth there. I think a little bit better in the U.S. and just trying to understand as we think about the sequential trends from here as Intellis ramps, and do you expect that growth rate to accelerate on a year-on-year basis? Trying to figure out kind of what\u2019s embedded there? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : And Geoff, Do you want to take that? Geoffrey Martha : Yes, sure. Look, it\u2019s clearly off to a strong start. I\u2019ve cautioned you to not extrapolate continued further growth in terms of market share until some of this data comes out. The data that I mentioned a few minutes ago is going to take some time and that will \u2013 I think drive incremental growth, but we do think it will maintain. This is a sustainable growth driver, but in terms of acceleration, we really, I think need to provide more data in order to accelerate that growth rate. But it is not kind of a one-time blip. We do think this is going to sustain. Isaac Ro : Okay, thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Isaac. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Raj Denhoy of Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : Thank you, Anthony for Raj. Maybe two product questions and then an operating margin question. Just to clarify on 670G share gains, is that from prior on the MDI patients who are existing pumps/CGM users? So that\u2019s the first product question. The second would be on SPYRAL. You had data out at EuroPCR. Maybe just to recap on why this program is different from the prior Symplicity program and what the update on market opportunity is there? And then on operating margins, can you clarify that mark-to-market gains and losses on securities? How that could impact operating margin next year? And if the company is contemplating shifting that out of other income? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Hooman, do you want to go? Hooman Hakami : Yes, with respect to the 670G, we are getting penetration of the 670G really across, I would say, patient populations certainly our own installed base competitive conversion and MDIs. So we are seeing all three. I think as you look forward though, we do expect more penetration within MDI, because as the data comes in and now we have, as you heard from the commentary, 70,000 trained patients where the results are in line with the pivotal. As more of this data comes through and as physicians see this data, I anticipate, we will see even a greater penetration within MDI. Omar Ishrak : Mike, do you want to take Spyral? Michael Coyle : As it relates to Spyral, there are a whole bunch of things different about the data that were presented here both the Off-Med that we\u2019ve shown back at the ESC last fall, as well as the data shown yesterday at the PCR Meeting. For one thing, the device is different the HTN3 data we are studying the Flex device. This is Spyral which basically is targeting in different part of the anatomy going more digital in the renal artery, which is where we are seeing congregation of the nerves that we are trying to denigrate. So, that has been an important contributor to the reliability of the denigration. Number two, the patient population is different. In the original study, we had mostly loaned systolic patients, older patients involved to a very extensive, if you will hardening of the arteries which were less responsive to the treatment. And so, that by moving to a patient population that is actually a bit left sick, but has both systolic and diastolic tension. We\u2019ve seen a much higher response rate which was shown in the HTN3 data and obviously has now elevated here. In addition, we are using ambulatory blood pressure measurement as the basis for the analysis which gets away from a lot of the whitecoat and hypertension issues that were shown. But probably the biggest difference here is that, what\u2019s become clear is that patients are non-compliant to their medications and we showed the data that basically 40% to 50% of patients who say they are taking medication are not taking the medication. We were able to validate that by looking at not only your analysis but also blood levels. And it\u2019s very clear that that was a huge confounder to the original HTN3 data and then it created case variability in the statistics. And so, by carefully factoring that out in our analysis, we were able to now show, not only with the Off-Med study that we\u2019ve shown, but now with the On-Med study that we\u2019ve shown yesterday that we have not only statistically significant, but clinically significant reductions in the blood pressure levels. And so, we are now rolling into the pivotal study using the adaptive Bayesian design, which means we are already 35% through the enrollment phase of the study for the pivotal trial. So, it\u2019s a very exciting program for us and something that we spent a lot of years fixing and now we are moving ahead with the pivotal trial. Omar Ishrak : Karen, do you want to take that? Karen Parkhill : And on operating margin, yes, I did mention we had some mark-to-market losses in the quarter. They were primarily related to the warrants that we own on Muzor and yes, we are planning to shift mark-to-market gains and losses going forward into non-GAAP reporting. Anthony Petrone : Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Anthony. Next question, Shelby. Operator : Your next question comes from Bruce Nudell of SunTrust. Bruce Nudell : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Omar, a question for you and then, a couple questions on products. So, firstly, just looking at the midpoint of top-line guidance next year, it\u2019s feeling like, you are thinking developed markets for Medtronic grow 2.5% to 3% and emerging markets more 12% to 15%. Is that the right way to be thinking about it? And is that really the slowdown in developed markets really just due to the product introduction timings? Omar Ishrak : Emerging markets are in the double-digits and I think that\u2019s the way you should model it. I think we\u2019ve got confidence in that and then the remainder is the developed markets. So, I think if you build the model out from that, that\u2019s the basis you do it. So, we are pretty confident on the double-digit emerging market as a baseline and then the swing will be in developed markets which is usually driven by innovation cycles. Bruce Nudell : Okay, thanks so much. And then, Geoff, just on the spinal cord stimulation, what\u2019s the internal confidence that the low kilohertz, sub-perception is really close to 10 kilohertz and that waveform optionality is also very important to having durable long-term pain relief? Geoffrey Martha : Well, that\u2019s been our position in our data is proving that out that we believe that patients benefit over time from the optionality between high dose and low dose energy. And we are going to continue to do more and that\u2019s really the heart of Evolve Workflow. Right, so, one, make it simple, one having the flexibility to between high dose and low dose, we think over time, produces the best outcomes. However, you need to provide physicians with a recipe for doing that. So they can get consistent outcome and mitigate complex patient follow-up and that\u2019s our Evolve Workflow and we are very confident in that. Not just internally, but you are seeing external confidence building, I mentioned the Verdolin data that we just talked about in the couple of scientific conferences recently and that our Vectors trial, that we will be \u2013 announcing the data on that in NANS 2019. Bruce Nudell : And my final question is, SAPIEN 3 showed very good results extracted from the TVT registry in bicuspid patients. I am pretty sure you guys have done the same sort of analysis and could you just say how core of that was looking in that registry amongst bicuspid patients that of course important once the low risk label is garnered? Geoffrey Martha : Yes, Bruce, we are prepared to show the data, but we are absolutely doing that analysis as the basis for an approval for bicuspid. And obviously, the rich dataset of TVT is going to provide us the basis for being able to see what the effect is. But we are very optimistic about that analysis being supportive of seeing similar outcomes to what we see in the intermediate risk and higher risk groups. Bruce Nudell : Thanks so much. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Bruce. Shelby, we\u2019ll take one more question, please. Operator : Your final question comes from Steven Lichtman of Oppenheimer. Steven Lichtman : Thank you. Hi guys. Just first question on core spine. As you mentioned during prepared remarks, the recent soft patch here is well-known. Just wondering what your latest views on the market are? Maybe most recent dots on the drivers of the growth challenged and do you think we could see a pickup and if so, what would be the driver there? Omar Ishrak : Well, first of all, look for Medtronic Spine, I am pleased with our performance against the softer market that you mentioned. We grew our Spine business as reported 1%. And then when you combine that with our enabling technologies, which like \u2013 things like, Spine Navigation, and Robotics, we grew closer to 3%. So, we believe this is definitely outpacing the competition. Now, regarding softer market, I mean, look, what we are seeing is that, historically, the procedure growth has outpaced the pricing pressure for maybe a net 2% - 3% global market growth. But in the last couple quarters, that procedure growth has softened and it has not outpaced the price declines, the price pressures. So, you are seeing more of a flat to slightly down market. That\u2019s why I am pretty excited about our performance and that\u2019s been driven by the Spine and the Core Spine and biologics piece is in the high-single-digit growth and BMP and our lateral approach called OLIF, strong double-digit growth with our PRESTIGE LP Cervical Discs, and then, we\u2019ve got a number of new product launches that are just starting to take hold, our SOLERA VOYAGER 5.5/6.0 system, ARTiC-L 3D printed titanium cage, and then, coming up here shortly, we\u2019ve got an INFINITY posterior cervical system coming to market. So that's the whole speed to scale strategy of our Core Spine business. And then on top of that, our Navigation, Robotics, power tools, nerve monitoring, all that together, in its further integrating that, and helping physicians to use these tools to improve both clinical and economic outcomes. We believe that combined with our Spine business is going to be growing 3% plus going forward. And the final thing I would say that\u2019s helping our Spine business maybe versus some others as our global exposure. In China for example, which is a big business for us, our Spine business growing 8%. So our OUS growth is stronger than our U.S. growth and pulling up the business. So, those three things continued speed to scale of our product launches within Core Spine, enabling technology and improving clinical and economic outcomes and really differentiating us and helping our core spine business. And then, finally, the mix of OUS growth, particularly in our emerging markets. Those three things will help us grow faster than the market in terms of predicting the market, it\u2019s that hard to do. We think \u2013 we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get much weaker. We do think maybe a slight uptick, but it\u2019s very hard to predict that. Steven Lichtman : Great. Thanks for that. And then, just last thing, Karen, the clarification on capital allocation in FY 2019, you are clear on the reduced interest income as you position the balance sheet post Tax Reform. But are you assuming any uses of that freed up cash whether through reinvestment in the business or enhanced buyback beyond the $1.2 billion that you\u2019ve previously talked about? Karen Parkhill : No, at this stage, we \u2013 the liquidation of these assets probably will take some time. So we are not necessarily anticipating any large change in capital allocation other than what we\u2019ve already communicated. Steven Lichtman : Okay, thanks guys. Omar Ishrak : Okay, so with that, thank you all very much for your questions. And on behalf of the entire management team I\u2019d like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to discussing our long range plan with you at our Investor Day, a week-and-a-half from now on Tuesday, June the 5th and we also plan on holding our next earnings call, the Q1 earnings call, Tuesday, August the 21st. So, thank you all very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our first quarter which ended on July 27, 2018. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. During this earnings call, many of the statements made maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. References to quarterly results increasing, decreasing or staying flat are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and references to organic revenue growth exclude the impact of material acquisitions, divestitures and currencies, references to pro forma exclude the impact of material divestitures. Unless we say otherwise, quarterly growth rates and ranges are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjust for material divestitures as well as the impact of foreign currencies. All of these adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Good morning and thank you, Ryan and thank you to everyone for joining us. I am pleased to announce that this morning we reported strong first quarter results. Revenue grew 6.8% on an organic basis marking the third straight quarter of 6.5% or better organic revenue growth, with strong growth across all four groups and regions. Operating profit grew 7% and non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 13.6% pro forma and 8.7% adjusted for currency. We are executing against our strategies. We are growing our markets and driving share gains across multiple businesses and multiple geographies. Businesses that were challenged 12 months ago are now headed in the right direction as evidenced for the past three quarters. We continue to execute in emerging markets and with our differentiated programs that deliver improved economic value to payers and providers. Our execution is not only in the top line, but also down the P&L. We delivered margin expansion for our Enterprise Excellence program, whether increasing our investment in R&D to fuel future growth. Looking at our group results in the first quarter, each of our operating groups delivered strong results, with over 6.5% growth in RTG, mid single-digit growth in CVG and MITG, and mid-20s growth in diabetes. Our Cardiac and Vascular Group grew 5% led by 10.9% growth in Coronary and Structural Heart. CSH, a strong high-teens growth in transcatheter valves driven by sustained global demand for our Evolut PRO valve. CSH also continued to see very strong adoption of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent, including low 30s growth in the U.S. In cardiac rhythm and heart failure, we had robust growth in Infection Control, AF Solutions and our Mechanical Circulatory Support businesses. In addition, our pacemaker business had mid single-digit growth, driven by the continued rollout of our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System and the Azure next generation family of pacemakers. In our Aortic, Peripheral & Venous division, our endoVenous business grew in the mid-teens driven by growth of our VenaSeal closure system. Across CVG, we are seeing great success of multiple new value based business models that directly link our therapies improving outcomes. We now have nearly 1,700 active customers participating with associated revenue from these programs representing an increasing percentage of our U.S. CVG revenue. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 4.9% led by 5.8% growth in surgical innovations as we capitalize on the conversion of surgical procedures from open to minimally invasive driven by new products. In Advanced Energy strong adoption of our recently launched enhancements of the LigaSure vessel sealing instrument resulted in low double-digit growth. In Advanced Stapling, we grew in the mid single-digits driven by sales of our innovative Signia powered surgical stapling system and our Tri-Staple 2.0 reloads. Our Restorative Therapies Group posted the best quarterly performance in its history growing 6.8%, led by mid-teens growth in our brain and pain divisions. In Brain Therapies both neurovascular and neurosurgery grew in the high teens. With the adoption of our endovascular stroke treatments, driving growth in neurovascular and the strength of our imaging, navigation, robotic and ablation systems driving growth in neurosurgery. In pain therapies, our spinal cord stim business growth accelerated to the low-20s this quarter, including high-20s growth in the U.S. driven by customer preference for our new offerings including the Intellis stimulator, Evolve workflow algorithm and our Snapshot reporting. We also had low-teens growth in Targeted Drug Delivery as we have delivered the best quarter of SynchroMed II sales growth in over 6 years. In Spine, while growth was flat this quarter, when our spine revenue is combined with our sales of spine enabling technologies that are reported in our neurosurgery business, our overall revenue grew 4%. We believe this is a more relevant comparison of our spine results against our competition and an indication that our surgical synergy strategy is working driving above market growth. Our Diabetes Group had its best quarterly performance in more than a decade with 26.3% growth driven by sustained strong demand for our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system. We now have over 97,000 trained active users of our 670G system. Outside of the U.S. our Diabetes Group grew in the high-teens, driven by sales of the MiniMed 640G and we are now just beginning to commercialize the 670G in international markets. Our strong global results led to over six points of share gain this quarter in pumps. In standalone CGM, the U.S. launch of our Guardian Connect product is off to a solid start, taking share in the $1 billion standalone CGM market. With the Sugar.IQ assistant, Guardian Connect is the only Smart CGM using the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to give personalized insights and predictive alerts. The higher CGM sensor attachment and utilization that we are seeing with integrated pump users combined with the sensors that are used with Guardian Connect are not only driving strong CGM sales growth which was nearly 50% this quarter, but also creating a consistent long-term annuity stream for our Diabetes Group. Turning to geographic revenue growth, we are continuing to execute well in emerging markets which grew 11% and represented 15% of our revenue this quarter. Several markets drove our performance reflecting broad diversification, China grew 12%, the Middle East and Africa grew 16%, Southeast Asia grew 14%, Eastern Europe grew 10% and South Asia grew 11%. Our differentiated strategies of public and private partnerships and optimizing the distribution channel are making a difference in emerging markets around the world. Today, Medtronic has leadership positions in almost all of the fastest growing markets in med tech and as a management team we are intentionally allocating our capital to higher growth markets and new opportunities. We have seen the early benefits of our top line performance in the last three quarters with the bigger picture, which we outlined at our June Investor Day is that we are increasing our RAMware, our weighted average market growth rate by shifting our mix of businesses to faster growing therapies and geographies. As we invest in these opportunities our goal is not just to continuously innovate, but also invent and disrupt and our intention is to lead in all three areas. This is reflected by technology pipeline which we detailed in our Investor Day to mention just a few of the highlights. In CVG, we are investing in Micra AV, which will allow us to access over half of the pacemaker markets with our disruptive transcatheter pacing systems. During Q1, we had first-in-human implants of our extravascular ICD system. We are also funding clinical programs to bring therapies to market in transcatheter mitral valve replacement and renal denervation for hypertension. Both of which has the potential to be multibillion dollar markets. In MITG, we remain on track with our robotic-assisted surgery platform as we have discussed at Investor Day. In RTG, we are investing in next-generation premium mounted and closed-loop DBS systems. In diabetes, we are developing a destructive closed loop ecosystem with advances in pump therapy, CGM and informatics to drive dramatic improvements for people to manage their condition more easily. I could go on with dozens of additional programs in every one of our groups, but suffice to say, we are executing on the strongest pipeline in Medtronic\u2019s nearly 70-year history. In addition to driving our top line growth, we are also executing in our Enterprise Excellence program as evidenced by margin expansion this quarter. As a reminder, this program is still just in its early stages and is expected to drive sustained cost savings, while also allowing for greater reinvestment in R&D over the next several years. We are working to leverage our breadth in many areas from global manufacturing and technology sharing to our clinical and regulatory expertise, shared services and global distribution. As I mentioned at the start, the message overall is that we are executing. We are allocating our capital across our business and focusing incremental resources on our biggest growth opportunities. In the process, we are driving our RAMware upwards to the right, while at the same time driving operating leverage and margin expansion. Finally and importantly, we are putting the processes in place to improve our free cash flow conversion, which will create additional capital that can be returned to shareholders and reinvested to drive future growth, all with the goal of creating long-term shareholder value. With that, let me ask Karen now to take you through a discussion of our first quarter financials. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Omar. Our first quarter revenue of $7.384 billion represented organic growth of 6.8%. Foreign currency had a positive $78 million impact on first quarter revenue. Non-GAAP earnings per share, was $1.17. And after adjusting for the divestiture, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 13.6% pro forma and 8.7% constant currency. While we came in $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance range, it\u2019s worth noting that $0.03 was driven by stronger than expected FX tailwinds and $0.01 was upside from tax. Given this, we would characterize $0.02 as operational outperformance reflecting better-than-expected revenue in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.3%, increasing 80 basis points pro forma and reflecting a slight improvement on a constant currency basis in line with our outlook. We are expanding margins and at the same time investing more in research and development to enhance our pipeline resulting in first quarter R&D expense growing 100 basis points faster than revenue as we focus on driving long-term value. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percent of sales this quarter declined by 90 basis points pro forma and 70 basis points constant currency, early evidence that we are executing on our companywide Enterprise Excellence program. Net other operating expense, which is included in our operating margins, was $60 million compared to $42 million pro forma in the prior year, with the increase primarily due to the year-over-year change in currency gains and losses related to our hedging program. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 13.3%, better than expected given favorable tax resolutions and expirations. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our tax rate to be 15% plus or minus modestly higher than our previous expectations. First quarter free cash flow was a robust $1.4 billion. Improving our cash generation is a priority at Medtronic from the top of the company on down. We can vary from quarter-to-quarter given timing of payment, so we don\u2019t want you to extrapolate our first quarter results for the full year. That said, we are pleased with our performance over the last two quarters and are beginning to see the benefit of our increased focus and discipline around cash flow. We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment, balancing reinvestment with returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders. We increased our dividend by 9% in June making it our 41st consecutive year delivering a dividend increase. And we repurchased a net $374 million of our ordinary shares in the first quarter. Our total shareholder payout ratio was 66% on non-GAAP net income and 98% on GAAP net income. And the increased investment in organic R&D that I mentioned earlier is an example of our reinvestment focus to increase our return on invested capital and create long-term shareholder value. Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to update our annual revenue growth and EPS guidance. For the full fiscal year, we are increasing our organic revenue growth guidance from a range of 4% to 4.5% to a range of 4.5% to 5%. And I will go a step further in saying we are comfortable with the higher end of this upwardly revised range. For the year, we now expect CVG, MITG and RTG to grow 4% to 4.5% versus our prior expectation of 4% plus or minus. We expect diabetes to grow in the low to mid-teens, up from low double-digits previously with a stronger first half versus second half based on prior year comparisons. It\u2019s worth noting that while we have had three straight quarters of 6% to 7% revenue growth, we don\u2019t expect to grow 6% to 7% every quarter. Some of our businesses faced tougher comparisons particularly in the back half of the year and others are in more challenging markets. Our guidance takes all of that into account along with the diversification of our end markets, strength of Medtronic. Turning to margins, we continue to expect operating margin expansion in the full fiscal year of approximately 50 basis points on a pro forma constant currency basis, driven by our Enterprise Excellence initiatives. And with respect to earnings, we are increasing our fiscal year \u201819 implied constant currency EPS growth forecast from a range of 8% to 9% to a range of 9% to 10% on the heels of our strong quarter. However, recent rates foreign exchange looks to be neutral to full year EPS versus a $0.05 benefit prior. So despite the increase in our constant currency EPS forecast, given the recent currency volatility, the ongoing discussions around trade tariffs and the fact that it is still early in our fiscal year, we have elected to leave our non-GAAP EPS guidance unchanged in the range of $5.10 to $5.15. While the impact from currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, our full year revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $420 million to $520 million. Despite the incremental headwinds on the top line, given the benefit of our hedging programs, FX is still a slight positive to fiscal \u201819 operating margins and neutral to earnings and free cash flow. For the second quarter in particular, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6%. We expect CVG to grow approximately 4%, RTG and MITG to be in the range of 5% to 5.5% and diabetes to grow 20% plus or minus. And given the impact of the hurricane and infusion set recall in the prior second quarter, we expect our operating margin improvement this upcoming quarter to be a little more than the full year. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1.13 to $1.15. This guidance reflects solid revenue growth and margin expansion offset by a higher tax rate and an FX headwind of $0.02 at recent rates which is $0.03 unfavorable to what we had expected at the time of our last earnings call. And if recent rates hold, revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $100 million to $150 million, operating margin would have a slight benefit and EPS without have $0.02 headwind as previously mentioned. Finally, on free cash flow, we continue to expect to generate between $4.7 billion and $5.1 billion in fiscal year \u201819. And as we mentioned at our Investor Day, over the next couple of years, we expect to make significant progress in improving our conversion of earnings into free cash flow as litigation and tax payments are expected to diminish based on what we know today and we benefit from programs we have put in place to improve working capital. The past couple of quarters are a great start towards delivering on this goal. Now, I will return the call back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Karen. Before we go to Q&A, I want to thank our more than 86,000 employees for their tireless work ethic and relentless execution once again this quarter. This was another strong quarter for Medtronic not just in terms of the headline numbers of organic growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation, but as importantly, we are executing in our strategies and positioning the company to create long-term shareholder value. One, our pipeline has never been stronger. As I outlined in June, everything at Medtronic starts with technology. We are innovating, we are inventing and we are disruptive. With the advancements in our pipeline in the last few months, I have never been more excited about our end-markets, our opportunities and our competitive position. Second, we are allocating capital efficiency across our business. Third, we are leading the development of emerging markets for our therapies and we are capitalizing on our leadership and value-based healthcare to our investments in the higher growth markets and higher growth geographies, we are shifting our RAMware upwards and to the right. Lastly, we are consistently improving our free cash generation and we are in the early stages of implementing our multiyear Enterprise Excellence program, which should enable us to drive multi-year margin and reinvestment for long-term growth. We know there is much work to be done, but I am excited about our progress in our positioning. With that, let\u2019s now open the phone calls up for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I have asked Mike Coyle, President of CVG; Bob White, President of MITG; Geoff Martha, President of RTG; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We want to try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question and if necessary, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rick Wise of Stifel. Rick Wise : Good morning, Omar. Good morning, everybody. Congrats on the excellent quarter for sure, but I want to focus if I could first on the sales outlook. I appreciate it\u2019s early in the year, Karen, you certainly helped us understand that and then you want to stay conservative. But \u2013 and you have just got us to 5.5% to 6% for the second quarter. If I focus on the second quarter, help me understand to be as I think about the second quarter very similar to the fiscal first quarter in terms of comparisons, I mean, the tremendous pipeline performance, ongoing cost reductions etcetera. Maybe if you could give us a little more color on why the fiscal second quarter wouldn\u2019t be even better than that guidance 5.5%, especially given the relatively easy comps, the hurricane impacted year ago numbers. Is it something maybe we need to understand better about some of the headwinds out there that keep you more in the 5.5% to 6% range? Omar Ishrak : Let me take that. First, thanks for the questions. And first thing that I want to mention is that overall, we feel very good about this business. Our momentum is strong. Our end-markets are good and we are in the right end markets and that\u2019s why we increased our FY \u201819 overall revenue growth assumptions. And we are really confident in our ability to deliver this strong growth profile of the year. That said, it still is very early in the year. We are focused on setting guidance that we have a high degree of confidence and if we can deliver, I think that\u2019s important to note. I think, but overall this business is performing, there is no real major concerns from a business perspective. We are in fact excited about our pipeline and excited about our execution across the board. And so we look forward to a business that can consistently deliver and we have a great deal of confidence that we can in fact do that. Karen Parkhill : And I would just add, Rick, that on the second quarter in particular we did say that we expect 5.5% to 6% organic growth in the second quarter, which is higher than the other quarters given the comparison. Keep in mind we do have the anniversary of some major product launches particularly in CVG and Resolute Onyx and Evolut PRO. We also have some pricing pressures in certain geographies this fiscal year, most notably Japan and Australia and all of that is baked into our guidance. Rick Wise : Great. And just a follow-up on diabetes, another outstanding quarter here best in a decade as you say, again I assume this was as you mentioned 670G driven, but you launched the standalone sensor in mid-June, do we expect this growth to simply continue with these kind of levels given this kind of performance, but if I \u2013 when I reflect on it seems still early in the launch of the Guardian sensor, you highlighted the OUS rollout, why wouldn\u2019t growth actually accelerate from here in Diabetes and maybe just give us a little color on how widely available the Guardian sensor is at this point? Omar Ishrak : Yes. Let me take that again. First of all, we are excited about diabetes and we are excited about a market that we are leading and created. And this market is going to go through a tremendous amount of change and we expect to be right in the leadership position in that. The Guardian sensor is launched extremely well the Guardian Connect and have to add that we are really \u2013 our sensor is differentiated by the addition of Sugar.IQ which is a cognitive decision support system that provides insights to patients. But having said that our position in the hybrid closed loop is something that\u2019s really setting the standards as to how patients with type 1 diabetes in particular can manage themselves. And really in the beginning of that journey and we expect that this product will continue to innovate over time and we will be leading that innovation sort of the roadmap. Now having said that, we are coming up against some pretty difficult comparisons because if you recall we went through a period last year at this time where we had a shortage in our sensors, we overcame that according to our plans. And so although we expect diabetes to maintain like we said mid-teens growth profile for the year. The present rate is really advantage for the comparisons that we have had over last year, but expect an exciting double digit growth business certainly for this year and over the long-term a business that will set the standards for growth of Medtronic and that\u2019s what we expect from it. Rick Wise : Thanks Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Rick. Next question, Lori. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Well, great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about emerging markets, obviously it\u2019s been a source of tremendous growth for the company and just over the course of the last three months to four months, it\u2019s been a period sort of extraordinary volatility in certain emerging markets, so Omar I was wondering if you wouldn\u2019t mind just kind of commenting on emerging market trends in the quarter and the sustainability of those trends as we look forward given all that\u2019s going on? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Bob. First of all, I couldn\u2019t agree more. Emerging markets has been stable and strong deliverer of growth for us over the years and something that will be sustained. And I do think here too we set a leadership profile in the med tech industry as to how to approach these emerging markets by going direct to our customers by helping these markets develop their own healthcare systems. As you know the need in these emerging markets is tremendous. You just need to look at the amount of penetration that our technologies have in these markets even the most people who can afford these therapies. And so that need is always going to be there. And despite economic sort of uncertainties and economic variations that will happen, it is an area where there is the continued need and that need doesn\u2019t go away. Peoples fall ill irrespective of economic conditions, so there is certain degree of base stability in these markets that we depend on and that we have seen happen. In addition to that, what we have in a differentiated way compared to other med tech companies is that we have got a very diversified profile within emerging markets where China is clearly our biggest market where we have consistently delivered. But in addition, we have got strong positions in the Middle East and Africa and Latin America and Eastern Europe and also in Southeast Asia. So, putting all that together, the inherent stability of these markets because of the disease needs in this market and the amount of penetration that\u2019s required for our therapies amongst people who can afford it given the fact that we are diversified across these geographies, given the fact that we are leading the way in creating these markets and working with both public and private partners gives me a great deal of comfort that the baseline that we have established of double-digit growth in the emerging markets will continue in the foreseeable future and I have got complete confidence on that and really excited about what we can do there. Bob Hopkins : Terrific. I appreciate the detail and clarity. One follow-up for Karen, congrats on the outperformance on the margin side, just want to dig a little bit deeper though on the margin performance in the quarter, it looks like on an operating margin basis, excluding the impact of currency, operating margins were roughly flat year-over-year on an underlying basis. It looks like you took the opportunity to spend more in R&D given the strength in the overall business. I was wondering if kind of that\u2019s the right read or were there other sort of moving pieces in the quarter that impacted underlying operating margins? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : You have the right read. Thank you for the question. We did increase our investment in R&D in the quarter, particularly in CVG and diabetes. In CVG, we had ahead of plan enrollment in some key clinical trials, including RDN and mitral. In diabetes, we purposely accelerated our focus on driving an advanced hybrid closed loop system. And in fact, our R&D investment by our calculations was 30 bps higher than Street consensus. We did also absorb a mix impact on our gross margin, which I talked about where we saw some revenue strength from some lower margin businesses that did impact our gross margin and we drove strong SG&A improvement that more than offset it. So we still did have a slight improvement in our overall operating margin, which we were pleased and was in line with our original outlook. Bob Hopkins : Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Bob. Next question, Lorie? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Karen, just I want to start with you on the organic growth outlook and I noticed some questions on the second quarter, but if you think about this year, I mean, your guidance sort of implies 6% performance in the first half and maybe 4% performance in the second half. So, I wanted to focus more on the second half, if your first half guidance is sort of correct, you still need to see some momentum acceleration in the business in the back half of the year to deliver sort of that 4% type number? Can you just sort of talk about some of the drivers of how you get that momentum acceleration in the back half just given the very material difference in sort of first half versus second half comparables? Karen Parkhill : Yes, thanks for the question, David. Appreciate it. In the second half, as Omar mentioned first and foremost, we are really pleased with the performance of our business, the strength of our underlying end-market, the momentum that we have, we do expect that momentum to continue throughout the year. We have increased our overall revenue growth guidance for the year as a result of that. Keep in mind, as we have talked about in the back half, we do come across some tougher comparisons from the prior year. And as I mentioned earlier, we do have the anniversary of some key product launches that impact us even more in the back half and we have got some pricing pressures from certain geographies that I noted Japan and Australia, but we are very excited about the continued momentum underlying. It\u2019s really just the comparison in the back half. David Lewis : Okay. And just to follow-up Karen on free cash, we appreciate that conversion this quarter was obviously materially higher than what you had suggested it would be by this point, but I know we are not going to make this a trend, but how should free cash trend, what are some of the factors that would sort of erode the relative run-rate of free cash across the year? And then kind of related to that, could just update us on the Puerto Rico tax settlement, there were some new dynamics that played out late last week and maybe just remind us the path forward on Puerto Rico and any impact on tax rate or payment scenarios? Thanks so much. Karen Parkhill : Yes, thank you David. We were really pleased with our performance on free cash flow in the quarter. This is the focus as we have talked about from the top of the company on down to drive free cash flow improvement and we have been able to do that in the last two quarters, the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter this year. In terms of trend, keep in mind that free cash flow can be lumpy and it does depend on the timing of larger cash payments, particularly in tax and legal. So I certainly would want you to extrapolate this first quarter for the rest of the year, but we are focused on delivering free cash in our full year guidance of $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion. We are confident in our ability to do that. We have been focused on working capital improvement in this quarter did drive improvement in both accounts receivable and accounts payable in particular. And so we are confident in our ability to deliver on this free cash flow and improve the earnings conversion. In terms of Puerto Rico and the settlement last week, we did have the appellate court rule basically remanding the case back to the lower court for additional fact finding. I would say it\u2019s really important to note that this was merely a procedural decision. It is not a ruling based on the merit. The appellate court determined that it needed additional analysis from the tax court in order to rule on the merits. So we still believe our initially filed tax returns were correct and we will continue to defend our position. In terms of what that means on the impact on cash flow given that the case has been remanded back to the lower courts and it will take some time. We don\u2019t expect at this stage any additional tax payments related to this case this fiscal year. Omar Ishrak : David, let me also just add a little color to the question on the growth profile, look there are some quarterly dynamics which Karen went through and we are setting guidance that we have confidence in delivering. But let me tell you our pipeline has never been stronger and in the next 12 months or so I am really excited about what we can do in our pain business, our Intellis and Evolve workflow is really hitting the mark here and our strong turnarounds which we expect to continue. Our Micra which I have talked about a lot before is the disruptive technology, we are the only player in this space. It\u2019s the market which we are disrupting we created and now we are disrupting ourselves. It currently addresses only 20% of the single-chamber market and we have got the roadmap to make this 100%. The core valve Evolut R is another one that is building on the success of the original launch of the platform and finally the Guardian Connect in the 670G like I mentioned earlier are highly differentiated. So I just want to lay that out that these are not like promises for the future, these are right now. And we are extremely excited about these technologies and we expect sustained growth and leadership positions in all of these areas. I had to make that point David. David Lewis : Thanks Omar for clarity on the second half. Thanks Karen as well. Omar Ishrak : Thanks David. Take the next question please Lori. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the good quarter. Karen, maybe just a follow-up on free cash flow, we all saw that the performance this quarter, we know it\u2019s now part of the compensation for management, so clearly a priority, can you kind of run us through some of the changes strategically and operationally the company is making to improve free cash flow over the long-term? Karen Parkhill : Sure Robbie. Thank you for the question. We talk about it being a focus from the top of the company on down. It is a clear focus in all of our monthly financial reviews. It\u2019s the clear focus in our quarterly business review. Honestly, when we had our recent officers meeting, we have spent the entire day talking about how we could improve free cash flow. So there is a very strong focus and as you already noted it\u2019s an important part of our compensation, it will represent about a third of our compensation, our annual incentive compensation. Omar Ishrak : I think in addition maybe I can add a few things more. We are creating systems, sort of IT systems through which we can track free cash flow better, rolling it down across our businesses to a pretty granular level. We are creating systems to reach our forecasting processes is using the latest tools in IT NAI for that matter. And so I think this is an area of continued focus for us and continued upgrade of our capabilities. And it\u2019s something that we do \u2013 are confident to deliver and improve over the next few years. Robbie Marcus : Okay, great. And as a follow-up maybe a two for robot question, saw very strong performance in the brain therapies division you called out the Mazor X robot is one of the drivers and maybe you can give us some early insights to that and then at the same time it\u2019s been a few months since the Analyst Day, any update on the robot in surgery, anything can add in terms of functionality or timing or viewpoint on it? Thanks a lot. Omar Ishrak : Let me just give a short overview and then I will let both Bob and Geoff comment in their specific robots. But let me tell you this, the integration of capital equipment in this case, the robot with implants and our sort of high value consumables is a unique competence that we are delivering and it\u2019s something that would set us apart and use our scale to really create these markets in a new and differentiated way that will set us completely apart from competition. So, it\u2019s an area that we are really focused on and really excited about the progress that we are seeing, but more importantly, excited about the future. So with that, I will let Bob go first and then Geoff. Bob White : Sure. Thanks, Robbie. This is Bob. We are excited about where we are at with the surgical robot. We remain absolutely on track with what we talked about during Investor Day. We continue to get really good surgeon feedback. In fact, we have got additional surgeons in this week who are providing us feedback on the system. So, our program remains on track. We continue to get good feedback. And importantly, again with the spiral design process, we are doing it in delivering the system that based on the input and the features that our surgeons want most. So, I think we are well-positioned to deliver what we said we are going to do. Geoff Martha : Yes, Robbie, it\u2019s Geoff. For sure, the capital equipment within our brain business is one of the two big drivers of that in neurovascular, but it\u2019s more than \u2013 it\u2019s much more than Mucorex. For us, it\u2019s a suite of enabling technology, the navigation, the inter-operative imaging, which is our O-Arm, the Mucorex, the Arm, the robotic arm and our Midas Rex powered instruments. And one other key competencies that in addition to what Omar said is that we are doing and integrating these tools, so that for the surgeon workflow and delivering it. And so that what the robotic tailwind has done is increased \u2013 it\u2019s gotten surgeon interest in robots, but now that\u2019s driving for us is increased interest in navigation. Folks that weren\u2019t looking at navigation before are now looking at it and it\u2019s been a tailwind for all of our enabling technology and quite frankly the more revenues coming from the O-Arm and navigation in Midas Rex and the whole integrated suite. And so we are excited about that for that reason alone, but in addition, look at that as a leading indicator for our spine business as our implant business, as this technology comes more proliferated and you are going to see that helping our implant business as well. So, again, it\u2019s more than the robot when it comes to spine. It\u2019s all of these other enabling technologies that are integrated together. Robbie Marcus : Appreciate it. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Robbie. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Hi, good morning guys. Two questions. First, for Omar, another good quarter with free cash flow, but the company has been very quiet on the M&A front here recently, is this more a function of the targets, the valuations for some of the targets, the discussions that you are having, the valuations are too rich. So maybe talk a little bit about the pipeline and why we haven\u2019t seen much on the M&A front lately? And then I have a follow-up. Omar Ishrak : Sure. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Glenn for the question. First of all, M&A remains important to us and we have got a strong balance sheet and we expect to use it as we generate, our free cash flow profile improves, we are in a stronger and stronger position to execute on that. Let me also tell you a few other things though. First of all, let\u2019s not take our eye off our performance in organic growth and that\u2019s the highest return investments that we can make and we can do it. Now, M&A supplements that and our focus in M&A has been tuck-in acquisitions, so it will remain to be tuck-in acquisitions and then lot of activity in that area. We continue to monitor the space. When the right opportunity comes along we will act. We are very active there and that will complement what we are doing organically. It\u2019s also important to note that like I said earlier tuck-in acquisitions are the major focus and because that\u2019s where our size and scale can immediately complement any other company out there without benefit of that size and scale. So, that is our focus and we are in a strong position to execute on that and you will see activity from us, but we will do it in a disciplined fashion like I have said earlier protecting our margin profile, moving up into the right November and making sure that we have both the financial and the management bandwidth to execute. So these are things that we have said before and things that we continued to do and certainly our eyes are wide open as to what\u2019s available out there. And we expect to be a strong player in this space. Glenn Novarro : Alright. And then you had very strong numbers out of surgical innovations up mid single-digits, is this a signal that surgical volumes accelerated in the second quarter or is this more a function of market share capture? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : First of all the overall healthcare market is pretty stable, I am not sure that there was any significant inflection point in the growth of procedures or anything like that, it\u2019s more or less stable both in the U.S. and in other developed markets around the world. I think our technology innovation continues and that helps us drive this growth profile. In surgical innovations, we have a stream of technologies that come out all the time. And as you have noticed our momentum has been pretty consistent. And I do think that our technology leadership has played a role there. I do want \u2013 I will ask Bob to also make a few comments on this because he is really closer to it\u2026 Bob White : Yes. Thanks Omar and thanks Glenn. And you are right we had an excellent quarter inside of MITG seeing really good growth from advanced MIS as well as stapling. So we are really pleased by our new product performance. We have not seen significant change in the procedural volumes in the U.S. market, particularly in the high acuity space where we participated seeing that stable procedure growth. But it\u2019s important to note I think as Omar alluded to, it\u2019s really our product innovation is far more impactful to driving our results in the underlying procedure trends. So we are pleased with where we are at and we are really pleased about the pipeline that we continue to see across our businesses here in MITG. Omar Ishrak : Let me just add a few more to that. I have spent a lot of time now with the surgical innovation group understanding the technology and what they are doing. I can tell you I am very impressed by the nature of this technology, this sophisticated closed loop little system that go on, that gives feedback to the surgeons and there is a lot of room for innovation in these end effectors and one that we will continue to invest in and lead in over time. Glenn Novarro : Okay, thank you. Thank you for answering the question. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Glenn. Next question please Lori. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Josh Jennings : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the strong results here in fiscal Q1. I was hoping to start off maybe for Omar and possibly Geoff, just to get updated thoughts on how you see your orthopedic efforts proceedings, do you feel the need or desire to get bigger in orthopedics over time and just any update on the progress you are making with your current offerings in knee and whether you have hip approval yet and whether or not there is any opportunity with the ultimate transition of \u2013 to my procedures and to the outpatient setting? Omar Ishrak : I will let Geoff comment on that in a minute, but let me just say that our portfolio right now is strong and robust. And we have got diversified positions in high growth market segments and that\u2019s our priority to maintain that, to continue to grow that and add to that in terms of tuck-in acquisitions. The orthopedic space is an adjacent space and there are some areas where we can add value and we have done some early work in that area. And I am going to ask Geoff to kind of comment on it, but let\u2019s not take our eye off our main goal which is our core markets where we intend to like I have said several times intend to set the standards and technology and keep driving those markets up. So Geoff, do you want to say a few words about orthopedic\u2026 Geoff Martha : First, it\u2019s the Micra comment, do we feel a need to run orthopedics, I would say no. It\u2019s not a need. If there is an opportunity for us to be a disruptive and scale the business in a disruptive way then we think we can do that and they will move more aggressively. So we are evaluating that and looking at it from several angles. One device side, our knee is out there and we have a limited release getting some clinical experience and feedback. The hip is not yet approved, it\u2019s coming in the next couple of months and we did the same with that. Get some limited release, get some feedback. And we are evaluating, we are still looking at spine ortho bundles and unique business models. But again, until we see something that is a disruptive path forward and it has to be a better opportunity and some of the other organic opportunities that we have. And so that\u2019s where we are. Josh Jennings : Understand. And thanks for that answer. And just maybe a follow-up for Mike Coyle just thinking about the CVG performance in the quarter, maybe you can help us understand what went better than expected minus 4% was the guidance you guys hit 5% organic growth. And maybe also just touch on your performance in TAVR specifically and your outperformance of the market. And what do you think the drivers are there? Thanks for taking the questions. Mike Coyle : Thanks, Josh. Certainly, coronary and structural heart was the big leader for us in the quarter both on the TAVR side and in the coronary side, obviously Onyx continues to do extremely well in the United States, where we are at sort of all-time high shares for our coronary business, but obviously the transcatheter valve business continues to have very good strength with nearly 20% growth on a global basis. That\u2019s really being driven by the Evolut PRO product release that\u2019s now available both in Europe and in the United States and we have supplemented that with the EnVeo delivery system, which is really being well received across the geographies. And we have had strong share capture in both Europe and Japan and have seen share momentum in the United States as well. And in Japan, we are just about to release now what we are releasing here in August, the Evolut PRO there as well. So, we expect that momentum to continue. But even in CRHF, we continue to see very strong growth in the atrial fibrillation business, our LVAD business with HVAD now has thoracotomy indication in addition to destination therapy and then within the APV business, the endovenous business is really doing extremely well and we haven\u2019t seen quite the hit we expected from the reimbursement reduction in drug-eluting balloons as the patient benefit of that has really been seen clearly by our customers. And so we have actually done quite a bit better than we expected in the plan despite that reimbursement change. Josh Jennings : Thanks Mike. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Josh. Next question please, Lori? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale of Guggenheim. Chris Pasquale : Thanks and congrats on the quarter. Karen, you mentioned the ongoing noise around trade tariffs as one reason for some caution in the full year outlook. Could you spend a minute on how you are thinking about the potential impact on the business from what\u2019s going on there and maybe highlight any particular product categories where you see exposure? Omar Ishrak : Let me first give you a little overview and then I will let Karen take over. First of all, the sorts of things that we sell are inherent needs for patients and we are confident that the healthcare systems around the world will lead our products and therefore in the end, there is a core demand that we will fulfill and that will continue. Now, having said that, clearly there are areas that are in the news and trade discussions that go on and we are a global company and we are affected by that. However, our overall confidence in our outlook and the way in which we are planning internally we are confident we can offset any real pressures in that area. And in the end, you have got to remember that the inherent demand for our technologies is something that no country can walk away from and it\u2019s something that we feel responsibility to fulfill for patients around the world, but Karen, maybe you can give a little more color to that? Karen Parkhill : Sure. I would just add from a trade tariff perspective, it obviously depends on where we manufacture and where we export to China. And so, it\u2019s mostly impacting right now our MITG and RTG businesses to a lesser extent its impacting CVG. As Omar said, we are focused on at least as the current discussion fits on offsetting that as best we can. And as we noted, we did not change our EPS guidance taking into account the impact of the trade tariffs as they sit today. Omar Ishrak : So, overall it\u2019s a modest impact and one that we feel we can cover. Chris Pasquale : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then one question for Hooman, another very strong diabetes results this quarter, so just comment on the impact of the Animas wind down and the pace at which that\u2019s progressing you guys are offering some on-warranty patients the opportunity to switch early, is that accelerating this process to the point where we might see the bulk of that benefit here in the first year versus the 3 or 4 years that it would have taken just based on the timing of warranty expirations? Hooman Hakami : So, Chris thanks for the question. Maybe a little bit of sort of color around just the revenue streams from Animas, the transition actually here is actually going pretty smoothly and we are really working well together with J&J on that. Now, your question is around the in-warranty, but let me remind you that there is actually three parts to the dynamic with Animas. They have got and they had roughly 90,000 patients in their installed base. The majority of those patients were under warranty and were coming off of warranty at a steady cadence. Now, starting this quarter, there are really three ways that were driving revenue. The first is for all the patients that are under warranty and remain under warranty, we are actually supplying those patients with consumables and we are recording that revenue. That revenue actually will start to anniversary in Q3 of this year. Second, for all the patients that are out of warranty, we are working to convert those patients to Medtronic, that\u2019s going extremely well. And we are converting them at least at the rate of our share position. And then the final one that your question touches on which really was a program that started in Q1 of this year is where we take certain in-warranty patients who have an Animas pump and we upgrade them to a Medtronic pump. And for those the convert there is we get compensated by J&J for that. And so the way that, that is going is actually well, it\u2019s ramping up. This was the first quarter where that\u2019s actually taking effect and we expect it to accelerate, but I think you have got to offset it with some of the other dynamics that I mentioned like the anniversary of the consumables. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Chris. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Can we spend a little bit of time on your Pain Therapies business and discuss the uptake of Intellis? And if you could also parse that a little bit, the difference between what\u2019s going on in the United States and what\u2019s going on internationally? That would be helpful. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Joanne for the question. The second part of the question is specifically about Pain Therapies. Joanne Wuensch : Yes, please. Omar Ishrak : Yes, okay. Alright, okay. Okay, Geoff go ahead. Geoff Martha : Sure. What we are getting it\u2019s a combination and the uptake is a combination of Intellis, the system based on the features of the system combined with the evolved workflow, which is really driving the outcomes. And as you heard Omar say earlier in the commentary is it\u2019s we are getting very strong global growth, but even stronger growth \u2013 stronger growth in the U.S. And so what\u2019s converting is two drivers, one is the better system, it\u2019s smaller, faster recharge and physicians and patients are really like seeing the benefits of that. The second is the evolved workflow, where patients are \u2013 physicians and patients are seeing real world outcomes and it\u2019s being supported by some data that has been released and we plan to release some more interim data at NANS in January. So, we are very excited about it. And I don\u2019t know in terms of difference between o-U.S. and U.S., I think look the U.S. market is I think based on some of the opioid crisis and other things, there is more of a tailwind and we are seeing even a faster pickup, Omar mentioned 30% growth in the U.S., but we are still seeing 20% growth outside the U.S. So, it\u2019s pretty much a global phenomenon, but there is a stronger tailwind in the U.S. based on the opioid crisis and physicians and patients just looking for solutions to this crisis. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. And as a follow-up in September we are going to see both TCT and NASS, anything you can comment on that we should look forward to? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Mike, you want to take the TCT and Geoff on NASS. Go ahead, Mike. Mike Coyle : Yes, TCT, there will be good information flow coming on just the long-term performance of the TAVR products. We will be showing 5-year data on the core valve U.S. pivotal high risk patient cohort, which is important to showing the durability of outcome as well as being able to demonstrate that the durability of the products. And then we will have 2-year data on the [indiscernible] real world results randomized to the TAVR. So those will be I think important data points leading into what will be, I think an even more important meeting, which is ACC in the spring, where we will be showing the data on the low risk patient cohort in TAVR as well as the rapid results for our TYRX products. So, those are important data flows taking place over the balance of our fiscal year. Omar Ishrak : Geoff? Geoff Martha : Yes, we have a couple of things at NASS. One is the Mazor X Stealth Edition. So this will be the Mazor X with our Stealth Navigation System fully integrated which will provide a better workflow and ultimately we think better outcome. So, we are very excited about that. And then the second is our navigated Infinity system for spine. Our Infinity is our posterior cervical fixation system and again it is being released with a good workflow with our enabling technologies. Like I said, it\u2019s navigated. So, those would be two things I would highlight for NASS. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Joanne. We will take one more question please, Lori. Operator : Okay. Your final question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter here and thanks for squeezing me in. So maybe one first starting off on the guidance, so Karen, it looks like FX was incrementally $0.05 worse or about 100 basis points of headwind. It looks like the top line was up by 50 basis points. So, what\u2019s top line improved by 50 basis points, but FX was 100 bps drag and despite that your EPS was maintained. Can you just comment on whether this underlying margin expansion where it\u2019s coming from just given Q1 trends? Karen Parkhill : Sure. Thanks for the question, Vijay. We have got the intra-quarter timing of rate movements and mix that impacted our results both on the top line and on the bottom line, but really the benefits from our hedging program at this stage or what\u2019s positively, the key thing that\u2019s positively impacting our earnings. Vijay Kumar : Well, I guess I meant for the guidance, FX was 100 bps headwind but top line was just up by 50 bps, it implies operating leverage should be coming in better than expected in the back, is that the underlying assumption? Karen Parkhill : Yes. Clearly, we are focused on delivering operating margin improvement and we are committed to that 50 basis points margin improvement. Where we can we would like to continue to invest more in R&D and to accelerate R&D like we did in the first quarter. So we will continue to focus on that through the rest of the year. And obviously we did have the $0.05 impact on our bottom line, which we have noted. Omar Ishrak : Vijay let me also say just to add to that, like I have said several times before we feel very good about this business both from a top line perspective and our programs in margin expansion that we are executing on to our enterprise expense efforts. Although that\u2019s still early, we are beginning to see results there. We want to set guidance that we have a high degree of confidence that we can deliver in. So, please read that into what we are saying here and we expect to execute and deliver and then we feel really good about this business both from a top line perspective as well as the margin expansion program perspective. Vijay Kumar : I appreciate those comments, Omar. And just one quick follow-up to maybe Mike Coyle, so Mike, maybe your commentary around the TAVR side is talking about pricing competition in Europe. Maybe from your perspective, can you comment on any changing and comparative pricing dynamics, is it worsening, has it stabilized or what\u2019s going on in Europe? Thank you. Mike Coyle : Pricing is reasonable stable in Europe. There is a small segment in the market that reacts to price, which is basically being driven by some of the smaller players in the market, but the major players have had really good pricing discipline and we expect that to continue in the balance of the year. Omar Ishrak : Okay. With that, I want to thank everyone for your questions. And on behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We are excited about this business. As you can hear, we are excited about our pipeline, about our growth trajectory, about our margin expansion programs and we look forward to updating you on our progress in our second quarter earnings call, which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, November 20. So thank you all very much. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s Medtronic first quarter earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

My name is Athenia [ph] and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic's Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr.Ryan Weispfenning. Sir, you may begin your conference. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer; will provide comments on the results of our second quarter which ended on October 26, 2018. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and the revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. During this earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. References to quarterly results increasing, decreasing or staying flat are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and references to organic revenue growth exclude the impact of any material acquisitions, divestitures and currency. Unless we say otherwise, quarterly revenue growth rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis, which adjust for the impact of foreign currency. All of these adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with earnings press release. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Ryan and thank you to everyone for joining us. Let me start today's call by taking a few minutes to remember Earl Bakken, the Co-Founder of Medtronic who passed away last month. Earl led our company for 4 decades retiring as Chairman in 1989. He remained a beloved figure at Medtronic and continued to serve as Chairman Emeritus throughout his life. Earl watched the company he started in a modest Minneapolis garage, grew into the industry-leading multi-billion dollar company that we are today. Earl remained steadfastly committed to the Medtronic mission, which he drafted nearly 60 years ago and remains the guiding principles of our company today. I was fortunate to spend some time with Earl and treasure the memories of visiting him over the years. Earl improved the lives of millions of people, built a major corporation, and established an entire industry. We're excited to continue living his vision every day at Medtronic. Turning now to Q2; this morning we reported another quarter of strong top and bottom line performance. Organic revenue grew 7.5% marking the fourth straight quarter of 6.5% or better underlying revenue growth, reflecting once again strong growth across all groups and regions. Adjusted operating profit grew 11.3% or 10.6% adjusted for currency. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% or 13.1% at constant currency. This was an outstanding quarter for Medtronic; as you can see from the numbers and as you will hear over the course of this morning's call, we're executing on multiple fronts. Our comparisons will naturally turn more difficult in the back half of the year, but we're growing both our market and our share across multiple businesses and multiple geographies. Our new product team continues to be robust with a series of recent launches driving both share gains and new market developments. We're also pleased with our sustained execution in emerging markets, where we grew 13.5%. Our results this quarter were not just in the revenue line but also down the P&L delivering 130 basis points of operating margin expansion or 80 basis points when adjusted for currency. This performance reflects the focus throughout our organization on margin expansion and some early results from our enterprise excellence program. Our organization is highly focused on improving free cash flow; in the first half we generated over $2.4 billion of free cash flow compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year; in all, an outstanding quarter. But what I want to share with you today that it's even more exciting than our quarterly and year-to-date results is the progress that we're making in our pipeline where we see more opportunities for growth, both nearer and longer term, than at any time in our company's history. I'll cover the pipeline story shortly, but first, let's review our performance this quarter in a little more detail. It's worth noting that each of our operating groups delivered organic growth ahead of street expectations for the third consecutive quarter. Our results are based not just on one business or segment but across multiple businesses and geographies, all executing against their plans. Growth this quarter was led once again by Diabetes growing 27%, reflecting strong demand for our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system, both in the U.S. and now outside the U.S. as we enter international markets. We have over 135,000 trained active users of our 670G system, and we continue to generate strong, real world clinical outcomes with time and range exceeding 70%. Emerging Technologies revenue more than doubled this quarter driven by the launch of our Guardian Connect standalone CGM. We continue to be pleased with the introduction of this product as it takes share in the $1 billion standalone CGM market. With the Sugar.IQ assistant, Guardian Connect is the only Smart CGM using cognitive computing capabilities to provide personalized insights and predictive alerts. Overall, sales of CGM from both the Guardian Connect and the sensors attached to pumps grew 70% with over 90% growth in the U.S. Revenue from CGM now exceeds our pump revenue and is establishing a consistent long-term and dependable revenue stream for our Diabetes Group. Our Restorative Therapies Group posted another record performance growing 7.8% with very strong growth in the pain, brain, and specialty therapy divisions. In pain therapies, our growth in spinal cord stim accelerated to the mid-30s this quarter, including mid-40s growth in the U.S. Customer feedback continues to be very positive with Intellis, with it's Evolve workflow algorithm and Snapshot reports. In addition, our Targeted Drug Delivery business grew low-double digits this quarter with SynchroMed II continuing to perform well. Specialty Therapies was led by strong mid-teens growth in pelvic health driven by sales of the InterStim II neurostimulator. Transformative Solutions also grew in the low double-digits with strength in Aquamantys sealers and PlasmaBlade dissection devices. In Brain Therapies, we had another strong quarter led by mid-teens growth in neurovascular reflecting broad-based strength across stroke therapies. In particular, our Solitaire Platinum stent continues to lead the market growing in the high-20s. Neurosurgery also had a good quarter with strong capital sales of navigation and robotic guidance systems. In September, we announced our intent to acquire Mazor Robotics and plan to close the acquisition in our third quarter. We believe that integrating the Mazor X Robot with our StealthStation navigation and O-arm imaging equipment, as well as with our spine implant creates a long-term competitive advantage for us in the spine market; one that we intend to capitalize on. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 6.8%, driven by balanced growth across both our SI and RGR divisions. Sales of advanced energy products grew in the low-double digits driven by the adoption of enhanced LigaSure vessel sealing instruments and the F10 energy platform. In Advanced Stapling, we grew in the high-single digits as our innovative Signia surgical stapling system and Tri-Staple 2.0 endo stapling reloads continued to perform well in the minimally invasive surgery market. Our Respiratory, GI & Renal division grew 7.3% with strong results across all businesses. Our Patient Monitoring business grew in the high single-digits driven by robust sales of Nellcor pulse oximetry, microstream capnography and BIS anesthesia monitoring. The GI business grew in the low double-digits including mid-teens growth in GI Diagnostics resulting from the launch of our Calibration-Free Bravo and the adoption of the EndoFLIP Imaging System. Our Cardiac & Vascular Group grew 4.4% this quarter, with high single-digit growth in both CSH and APV divisions. CSH benefitted from mid-teens growth in transcatheter valves driven by global demand for our Evolut PRO Valve. CSH also continues to see strong adoption of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent posting low-20s growth in the U.S. APV's results were driven by solid growth in drug-coated balloon and improved performance in abdominal aortic stent graft, and the continued rapid adoption of the differentiated VenaSeal vein closure system. In Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, our pacemaker business grew high single-digits, including low double-digit growth in the U.S. and low-20s growth in Japan on the strength of our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System and Azure wireless pacemaker. This offsets mid-single digit declines in heart failure reflecting the headwind of fewer CRT-B replacement sales given our introduction of longer lasting implants over the last several years. Now turning to our revenue growth by geography; as I mentioned earlier we continue to execute well in emerging markets which grew 13.5% representing 15% of Medtronic revenue. Importantly, our years of experience in investment are paying off in not just one geography but in multiple geographies; China grew 13% this quarter, Eastern Europe by 27%, the Middle East and Africa by 20%, South Asia by 14%, and Southeast Asia by 9%. Our differentiated strategies of public and private partnerships and optimizing the distribution channel are making a real difference in emerging markets around the world. Today Medtronic has leadership positions in most of the fastest growing markets in MedTech, and we're intentionally allocating our capital to higher growth markets and new opportunities. As we invest in these opportunities, we're looking to go beyond, simply improving and innovating on existing products and therapies. Our goal is to invent and disrupt market with our focus squarely on market leadership. Pleased as I am with our results this quarter, even more important is the progress we're making in our pipeline which contains more opportunities for growth than at any time in our company's history. Let me know first give you a glimpse of some of what we have coming in the back half of this fiscal year. In RTG, the launch of the Mazor X Stealth, an integrated robotics and navigation platform should accelerate our spine and enabling technology growth. In brain therapy, the React Catheter and Riptide Aspiration System, along with the next-generation Solitaire revascularization device should contribute to growth in the back half of the year and into FY20. In CVG, our recently approved Valiant Navion Thoracic Stent Graft System is expected to capture share and drive incremental growth, especially in the U.S. and Western Europe. In Japan, we look forward to the continued rollout of our recently launched CRT-P Quad and Azure line of pacemakers or IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon, and the third quarter introduction of our [indiscernible] system. We also anticipate the release of two landmark clinical trials in the American College of Cardiology Meeting in March. The first is the interim results of our more established study which has the potential to expand indications to the Morris [ph] patient population. The second is a rapid trial of TYRX antibacterial envelope which could enable guideline changes in cardiac rhythm implantables. The pipeline at MITG is equally impressive with expansion as the key specialty areas of our Tri-Staple Technology and our Sonicision ultrasonic dissection platform, as well as the launch of our next-generation consumable for the Capnostream 35 portable respiratory monitor, all being introduced in the back half of this fiscal year. And lastly, our Diabetes business should benefit from the global launch of the 670G in the multiple markets around the world. We're launching at least the next-generation of Sugar.IQ algorithms to accurately predict hypoglycemia upto 4 hours in advance which will set the standard for predictive alerts. All these things I just highlighted represents realization [ph] enabling us to grow our market and take market share. We have plenty of such opportunities in FY20 as well. The Reveal LINQ 2.0, our next-generation insertable cardiac monitor is just one example; this product will include Bluetooth connectivity, 5-year battery longevity and the ability to monitor additional physiologic parameters. Another example is our next-generation of CoreValve platform in TAVR; there is Evolut PRO Plus. The Evolut PRO Plus feature is a low profile and improved predictability of placement for enhanced ease-of-use. But what excites me even more than these examples of continuous innovation are some of the more CVG Technologies that will follow, including the Micra AV, our transcatheter cardiac pacemaker, which we're targeting for late FY20 approval enabling us to access and disrupt 56% of the eligible peacemaker market, up from 16% today. Our Extravascular ICD, where we're nearing the completion of our feasibility study and plan to start our U.S. [indiscernible] in early FY20. Our Intrepid Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement System, now enrolling it's U.S. digital [ph], and Symplicity Spyral, our renal denervation system for hypertension patients, now enrolling in a pair of randomized sham-controlled trials building off the positive clinical results present in Euro PCR [ph] earlier this year. Moving to being disruptive technology in CVG has the potential to be multi-billion dollar market opportunities. In MITG, we're preparing for an FY20 launch of our robotic assisted surgery platform, one of the largest R&D programs within the company. We believe this platform combined with our industry-leading surgical instruments and surgeon training centers around the world, can expand the market for minimally-invasive surgery. In RTG, we're developing next-generation cranial-mounted and close-loop DBS systems in our brain therapy division. In Pelvic Health, we're developing a micro-stimulator that is only 3 cubic centimeters and features full-body MRI compatibility. In Diabetes, we're developing an advanced hybrid close-loop system which we expect to launch in FY20. Our next-generation algorithms will improve time and range to over 80% by automating insulin delivery following a snack or a meal. In addition, the system will reduce the burden of carb counting [ph], enable remote monitoring and automatic software downloads. We're also making advancements in our CGM sensors and expect a steady cadence of innovation that will drive non-adjunctive labeling, reduce the need for calibration, make the sensor smaller and longer lasting or while using cognitive computing to enhance personalized insights for the patient. These are just some of the highlights of our robust pipeline. I could continue but the key message that I want to leave with you today is that we have executed on the strongest and most exciting pipeline in Medtronic in our 70-year history. Let me now Karen to take you through a discussion of our second quarter financials. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Omar. Our second quarter revenue of $7.481 billion represented organic growth of 7.5%. Foreign currency had a negative $95 million impact. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.22, and after adjusting for foreign currency, adjusted diluted EPS grew 13.1%. While we came in $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance, it's worth noting that $0.03 was driven by stronger than expected FX tailwinds. Given this, we would characterize the balance as operational outperformance including a $0.02 benefit from a modestly lower tax rate along with better than expected revenue and operating margin expansion in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 27.9%, increasing a 130 basis points or 80 basis points on a constant currency basis. We are expanding margins and at the same time investing more in research and development to enhance our pipeline and create long-term value. Adjusted gross margin improved by 50 basis points or 10 basis points on a constant currency basis, and adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales improved 50 basis points. We continue to execute on our company-wide Enterprise Excellence Program driving improved efficiency, cost savings, and generating leverage on strong sales growth. Net other operating expenses with $73 million compared to $96 million in the prior year, with a decrease primarily due to the year-over-year change related to our currency hedging program. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 13.3% which was better than expected due to increased deductions from the exercised and employee stock options along with finalizing taxes owed on certain returns. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our tax rate to be 15% plus or minus. Second quarter free cash flow was $957 million versus $661 million in the prior year. As Omar said, improving cash generation is a priority at Medtronic; from the top of the company on down. We are pleased with our performance over the last several quarters and are seeing the benefits of our increased focus around cash flow. We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment balancing reinvestment with returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders. Combining our $1.2 billion of year-to-date net share repurchase activity with the $1.4 billion we paid in dividends over the same period; our total shareholder payout ratio was 80% on adjusted net income. In addition, the increased investment in organic R&D that I mentioned earlier, as well as in organic investments we're making in tuck-in acquisitions like Mazor Robotics are examples of our focus to increase our return-on-invested capital and create long-term shareholder value. Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to update our guidance. For the full fiscal year, we are increasing organic revenue growth guidance from a range of 4.5% to 5% to a range of 5% to 5.5%. Importantly, given the strength of our first half and the upcoming product launches that Omar has mentioned, we are comfortable with a higher end of this upwardly revised range. For the year we expect Diabetes to grow in the low-to-mid teens, RTG to grow 5% to 5.5%, an increase of 100 basis points from our prior expectations, and MITG to grow 5% plus or minus, an increase of 50 basis points from our prior expectations. With regard to CVG, we expected to grow 4% plus or minus which is a slight decline from our prior expectations given a change in the accounting for third-party product going through our integrated health solutions business. Turning to margins; we outperformed in the second quarter and are making good early progress on our Enterprise Excellence initiative which is offsetting a stronger than expected headwind from MIC [ph]. Looking at the second half of the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the 50 basis points of full year underlying operating margin expansion despite the mix headwinds and the impact of both, China tariffs and expected dilution from the Mazor acquisition. As Omar mentioned, there are more opportunities to drive accelerated top line growth than at any point in Medtronic's history; and as such, our intent wherever possible is to accelerate R&D spending while still delivering on our margin expansion commitments. With respect to earnings, as mentioned earlier, our strong operational performance including tax benefits have resulted in $0.08 of outperformance in the first half of the year versus the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. This has allowed us to absorb nearly $0.10 of headwinds, including foreign exchange, that is a net $0.05 worse than the beginning of the year, as well as the expected second half impact of China tariffs and Mazor dilutions. For these reasons we have elected to leave our adjusted EPS guidance unchanged in the range of $5.10 to $5.15 which implies constant currency EPS growth of 9% to 10% at current rates. As such, we continue to be comfortable with fiscal '19 street consensus. While the impact from currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, our full year revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $420 million to $520 million. Despite the incremental headwind on the topline, given the benefit of our hedging program, FX is still expected to be a modest positive to fiscal '19 operating margins and neutral to earnings and free cash flow. Moving from the year to the upcoming third quarter, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 4.5%, and while we say it's tougher comparison, we are also comfortable with the high-end of the range. We expect Diabetes to grow in the high single-digits, RTG and MITG to grow 4.5% plus or minus, and CVG to grow 3.5% plus or minus. We also expect continued operating margin improvement consistent with our full year guidance. We expect third quarter adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.23 to $1.25. If recent rates hold, revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $120 million to $170 million, operating margin would have a slight to modest benefit, and the impact to EPS would be neutral. Finally, on free cash flow; we continue to expect to generate between $4.7 billion and $5.1 billion in fiscal year '19, and over the next couple of years, we expect to make additional progress on improving our conversion of earnings into free cash flow as we continue to drive increased focus across the organization. Now, I will return the call back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Karen. And before going to Q&A, I want to thank all of our employees around the world for another strong quarter of execution and dedication to the Medtronic mission. As I mentioned at the start, this was outstanding quarter, we're executing on multiple fronts, our end-markets are strong and we're leading several of the fastest growing markets in Medtech. In addition, we're allocating our capital across our business and focusing incremental resources on our biggest growth opportunities. In the process, we're driving our WAMGR upwards to the right, while at the same time driving operating leverage and margin expansion. We're also improving our free cash flow conversion with major emphasis on this across our entire organization. This will create additional capital that can be returned to shareholders or reinvested to drive future growth creating long-term shareholder value. Finally, over the balance of this fiscal year and into FY20, our pipeline contains numerous growth opportunities and has never been stronger. We expect to develop and bring to market a long list of technology innovations which will improve the lives of millions of people around the world, help healthcare systems become more efficient, and ultimately grow the intrinsic value of Medtronic. We know there is much work to be done but we're up for the challenge and I'm excited about these opportunities. With that, let's now move to Q&A. In addition to Karen, our core group President, Mike Coyle; Bob White; Geoff Martha; and Hooman Hakami are here to answer your questions. We want to try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question; and if necessary, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : First of all, Omar, your tone today on the pipeline and the innovation coming out of Medtronic seems even more confident than you expressed at the Analyst Day earlier this year. So in light of that, kind of, how would you characterize the potential for upside to your goal of 4% plus revenue growth? Is there upside to that in light of what you're seeing in your business today? Omar Ishrak : First, look, you're right about the pipeline, we're more excited today than we've ever been. And sure, our goal is to make those opportunities count, and -- over the long-term, certainly we expect to perform better than what we've said, that's always been our goal and that will continue. The most important thing is that we're executing, and that gives us increased confidence. We're executing from a revenue perspective, we're executing from a margin perspective, and most importantly the products are coming out on time, the products are delivering the impact that we think that they should deliver; and if you put all that stuff together, we're really optimistic about the future. At this stage, we have a plan that we presented at Analyst Day, it's only been 6 months, so we just keep it the way it is. But make no mistake, this company is executing, we've got a tremendous opportunity pipeline, and we'll deliver. Bob Hopkins : And then, just one quick follow-up for Karen on the earnings. Could you just quantify specifically the -- in the back half the impact of FX, China tariffs, and Mazor? And then maybe give us a sense will any of those things make it hard for you to meet your EPS growth targets when you look forward into next fiscal year? Karen Parkhill : We are excited about the strength of our underlying business and the strong execution that we've had so far in the year. That strength and that operational performance has enabled us to absorb headwinds that we didn't anticipate at the beginning of the year and still maintain our EPS guidance for the year. So those headwinds include the impact of FX which we now believe for the year have a negative net $0.05 impact on EPS, and China tariffs and Mazor combined have another $0.05 impact to our original guidance. Bob Hopkins : And then for next year, are any of those -- are those going to limit your ability to achieve your goals for next year? Karen Parkhill : For next year, our fiscal year '20 starts the beginning of May, and so really, we're just in the early phases of our annual planning process, so it would be premature for me to give you more specifics on next year, but I would use our long range guidance that we gave at Investor Day as a guide for next year, and we'll certainly give you more color when we're ready, and obviously give our additional guidance for next year on our fourth quarter call. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Omar, I think the key question this quarter, obviously, a great quarter -- just given the divestiture last year in the hurricane, it's sort of hard to decipher if the second quarter results reflect a material acceleration in the growth and obviously your guidance implies stable net during the back half of the year; so can you sort of help us characterize how you see the first half of the year for Medtronic relative to the second half of the year for Medtronic? Should investors think about the business now as being more stable? On your mind on an underlying basis, is this business accelerating into the back half of the year or there's a potential for it to accelerate out on a momentum basis into the back half of the year? Omar Ishrak : First of all, the main point to kind of take away from this is that, sure, there were some favorable comps from the hurricane and so on, but the underlying growth that we've delivered in the last few quarters has definitely continued into this quarter and we expect that to continue into the back half, that's why we're raising the guidance. And like I said, the underlying growth and the momentum from all the products that we've talked about give us a lot of confidence that we will certainly deliver on that. The pipeline for the back half, like I mentioned very specifically, is there, and we expect those to convert into real momentum. So, I've got no qualms at all about the underlying growth of the business, that's steadily getting better as new products come out. Now on the back half, obviously, there is some tough comps, but going back to the overall underlying growth and looking at it over the past several quarters and looking at it into the future, there is a steady improvement as we go forward. David Lewis : And Karen, just thinking about the -- in the first quarter you talked about second quarter being a better margin improvement quarter for the company. Obviously, you delivered that with 80 bps of expansion. You suggested at our conference maybe margins could get even better into the back half of the year, so can you help us understand just given your comments on investments, what we saw here in the second quarter, how should we think about back half margin improvement versus the first half? And I'll jump back in queue, thanks so much. Karen Parkhill : We are focused on delivering that 50 basis points of margin expansion that we outlined at the beginning of the year. As we have opportunities, we are also focused on increasing our R&D investment to accelerate our pipeline where we can, and so as a result, despite the fact that we have worked hard on operating margin expansion and delivered this quarter, we're focused on the 50 basis points for the full year. That does imply operating margin expansion in the third quarter roughly in line with our guidance for the full year and fourth quarter slightly higher than that just given the math. And typically, we deliver more leverage at the back half and in the fourth quarter than we do in the front half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Robbie Marcus : Karen, I wanted to ask you about the free cash flow because this is now several quarters in a row where we see really nice year-over-year improvement in free cash flow; so can you talk to the sustainability of this and maybe touch on some of the programs you've put in place to improve that from prior years? Karen Parkhill : We are very pleased with the free cash flow that we've enabled to deliver in the first half of $2.4 billion which is a significant improvement over the first half of last year. And it's really due as Omar said, to a very strong focus throughout the company on improving cash; not just through earnings growth but also through working capital improvement. In the first half, we had some strong improvement in accounts payable and accounts receivable, in particular, but also a focus on managing our larger one-time items as best we can, and staying within the parameters that we've outlined on those one-time items. So we're focused on free cash flow, we believe that this focus is highly sustainable, it is obviously been built into our incentive comp metrics throughout the company, and we're focused on achieving what we outlined at Investor Day. Robbie Marcus : Another question I just wanted to follow-up on is; there has been a lot of noise on two of your key product lines in the market this quarter, both in Diabetes from some competitors about the timing of your next-generation pumps, and then in the spinal cord stim market about what the true color [ph] on a volume basis is there. You put up great results in both, so can you talk about the sustainability of spinal cord stim market growth? And then, comment on the reiteration of the fiscal year '20 for your next-generation pumps? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : I'm going to ask Geoff to take this spinal cord stim, I think he is very anxious to give a reply. Go ahead, Geoff. Geoff Martha : Yes, sure. Robbie, I appreciate the question. I was thinking about how it's going to work the stim, anyway. We're seeing really strong market growth, that is in the low-20s, and we see that sustaining, it's just a lot of innovation and new clinical data coming out in the space and with a very nice patient impact, and we see it continuing; so I saw and read the comments from one of our competitors, and I -- and we're just not seeing that. Obviously, we grew 35% in spinal cord stimulation in Q2 worldwide and 45% in the U.S. Hooman Hakami : And Robbie on Diabetes; your question about our advanced hybrid closed-loop system, there has been no change to the timing of that product versus what we said at Analyst Day and also at ADA. We know who is communicating this information and it's just incorrect, there's no changes from the timeline and it's just a simple as that. I'd say beyond those timelines we're just really excited by what this technology and this product promises to bring, we've done a lot of work, we've got three feasibility studies done, those feasibility studies indicate a time in range that is close to 80%, and to put that in context, a person without diabetes has a time in range of 85%; so we're really excited about that. And when we take a look and compare our performance against published data from what's out there on competitive systems, our nearest competitor is going to have a time and range that's less than what we have with our 670G System and with a higher targeted glucose range. So timelines are holding, we're making great progress and were excited about what the system is going to be able to do. Omar Ishrak : And let me also add, there is a little -- these two that you've pointed out -- these two segments are the -- one, we're excited about many things but these two we're very excited about, we're going to own these segments and I'm personally engaged with both of these groups on a very regular basis. I'm interested in it, and I'm very confident that we will not only introduce these products as we talked about, with the features that we talked about where we will lead in these markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : So maybe just back to the earlier question on -- comments on pipeline; increasing confidence on the growth outlook. So maybe Omar, in a couple of points that you mentioned, TYRX, that could in a changed guidelines here, some comments on robotics being your largest R&D program; should I just tie into -- tie those two comments to the confidence you're expressing here on growth? I think something incrementally changed here in robotics and TYRX and is this now going to be big drivers for you guys or how should we be thinking of your LRP of 4% to 4.5% just given all the comments you laid out on the pipeline? Omar Ishrak : First, with respect to TYRX; what's changed is the fact that these clinical results will be published shortly, I mean it's a program that we knew was coming but the time has come for it to be -- for those results to be released and we'll see where we go from there, that's an important event. It's something we planned for, so in that sense, it doesn't change but the fact is that it's happening, and we're executing, and it's coming to fruition and we'll see how the results pan out. With respect to the robotics program, that was simply a confirmation there we're on-track, it is the most important program in terms of financial commitment for Medtronic at this stage, it is one that we're very excited about, not just in the short-term, but in the long-term in the way that will address both the general surgery market and the minimally invasive market. So we just highlighted those examples, there are several other examples that we talked about but there is nothing to take away from that, something has changed except our increasing confidence of the delivery of the results animating from those programs that obviously would be clinical trial work which would results are [ph]. I think that's the best takeaway here. Like I mentioned earlier, we just put our long range plan in place, we've put certain numbers in place with increased guidance for the second half of the year based on our underlying growth, and I think that's as far as we want to go right now. We're executing this year and we're feeling confident about the future. Karen Parkhill : And Vijay, I would just say that our long range plan did not have a cap of 4.5% like you mentioned, it was not a range of 4% to 4.5%, it was 4% plus and it was meant to consistently deliver year-after-year and in years where we have very strong pipeline we can deliver more. Vijay Kumar : I'm going to put forward to 10% now range in my model [ph]. Just maybe one quick follow-up on the 3Q guidance cap allocation; so 3Q, is this all the China tariff -- is that why the EPS is below -- where street marks are? And cap deployment, I mean it looks like share repo came down, Q1 it was $400 million, 2Q versus $800 million; you have a sizeable balance sheet capability, can you maybe just comment on priorities for use of cash? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : As you know, we are focused on balancing return to shareholders with reinvestment in our business. Where we see good reinvestment opportunities we are focused on driving that because it does drive the long-term value of our company. We balance that with share repurchase because we do not intend to hoard cash on our balance sheet. We've had very good reinvestment opportunities, not just in our R&D but also in acquisitions, we've just announced the acquisition of Mazor, and so we're focused on balancing both. We will continue to repurchase our stock though as we see opportunities, and we're committed to delivering at least a minimum of 50% of our annual cash generated to our shareholders. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro of RBC. Glenn Novarro : Two pipeline questions; first for Mike Coyle. On mitral valves, Mike, can you give us an update on where you are with the transseptal approach? And then, can you give us some of your thoughts on the repair market and your plans there? Then I had a one follow-up for Bob on robotics. Mike Coyle : We're still digesting the results that came out here at the CTT [ph] from both, the study as well as the mitral valve [ph] study as they both came to some pretty different conclusions about the role of mitral repair. And so we're trying to digest those relative to the internal investments that we've made. We are still very strongly leaning towards the use of replacement because of the improved hemodynamics that you get relative to repair, and we are continuing to execute on our product development pipeline to get to that transseptal product which we think is going to be very important to the long-term growth of the replacement market. We're not ready to update timelines on that yet since the work is still -- I would describe it as being in sort of what we call Phase Zero [ph] or feasibility stage, but we do see a path to getting to a transseptal system and we are continuing to execute on it. That said, we think the mitral repair market actually looks quite interesting, we have a couple of internal programs; one purely internal, one with an outside incubator that are also in sort of Phase Zero development stages. And we will decide how we want to proceed with that as we see the results of the technology development. Glenn Novarro : And then Bob on robotics; so you're reiterating your launch in fiscal '20; can you give us a little bit more clarity is it the first half of '20, the back half of '20? And will the first cases be international or U.S.? Thanks. Bob White : I think the key takeaway message is, very consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day, preparing for that FY20 launch. I'm not going to get too specific relative to first half or back half but we feel really good about our progress, in fact, we've made really important progress across the hardware/software and the verification of validation testing; so we're proceeding really well across that. And I would say you can expect that the first launch will be outside of the U.S., we are in active discussion as you can imagine with all the competent authorities around the world, but that certainly will happen outside the U.S. first. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry [ph] of Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : One for Geoff on SES [ph] and one for Hooman on Diabetes. So Geoff you've done really with Intellis but you start to anniversary the launch; so how should we think about the sustainability of the growth in this business? I heard you talk earlier about the market but your business and specifically, what's next for the business? From an innovation standpoint would you consider looking externally at emerging SES technologies? And I have one follow-up. Geoff Martha : Like I said to Robbie's question, the market is strong, we are seeing this low 20% growth. And the other thing I forgot to mention was that -- because I heard this as well, our growth is based on volume, not price increase; so it is a strong market and there is like I said a lot of innovation. And as we anniverse [ph], we are investing in -- first of all, we have clinical data coming out, we'll be presenting interim clinical data on our vectors trial at NANS [ph], so I think that we've seen the clinical data really move competitive surgeons. So there is a lot of surgeons for us out there that are kind of waiting for some incremental data from us, and -- so we think there is upside for Intellis and the overall workflow as that data comes out. In addition, we're investing in other new indications through some clinical work that we're doing. And then to your point, there is a number of technology innovations out there that internally and externally that we're reviewing; so I wouldn't say anything off-the-table internally or externally, but clearly, we're going to continue to invest in the segment. One of the thing that has really helped RTG overall, you've seen our performance over the last two quarters or last several quarters; has been systemically allocating capital to the high growth segments in our area, and so this is clearly one that we see sustainability, both technology and clinical innovation. And so I wouldn't take anything off-the-table. Unidentified Analyst : And Hooman, just to follow-up on Robbie's question earlier; first, it looks like the implied second half guidance for Diabetes is mid-single digits, I know it's high single digits for the third quarter but a little lower in the fourth quarter, just on an implied basis. Is that how we should think about Diabetes going forward? And is there any update on the Harmony Sensor timeline? And what's the regular -- regulatory pathway for Harmony and 690G? I heard the fiscal 2020 launch. Thanks for taking the questions. Hooman Hakami : Right. So there was a number of different things in there Larry, let me just maybe knock them off one-by-one. As far as the back half goes, you heard that we're reiterating from Karen the fact that we expect to grow for the full year low to mid-teens; this obviously translates to an implied deceleration of growth from what we've seen over the past four quarters, there is no doubt about that. But let me just remind you that, when -- if you go back to last year, during the first half of last year we had CGM capacity constraints that prevented us from not only meeting full CGM demand but also pump an integrated CGM system demand. Then we started to increase that capacity in Q3 of last year and we're at full capacity in Q4. And so we had a lot of pent-up demand, we had some back orders, and so that revenue catch-up that basically came in the back half of last year is impacting our comps for the back half of this year. The other dynamic I'd point out Larry is NMS or Anniversarying [ph], two out of the three revenue components in Q3 of this year; so all of the consumables revenue, all of the out-of-warranty conversions are really going to no longer provide a year-over-year benefit, now that's just commentary on comps but if you take a look at it, there is going to be these quarterly fluctuations, we're really excited about the opportunity that we have here, we talked about our pipeline, advanced hybrid closed-loop in FY20 which we're committed to delivering; this is a multi-year growth opportunity for us, for the company, and we keep an intent to innovate and to lead. Now very quickly from a CGM perspective, what you're going to see from us are sensors that are going to come out with non-adjunctive labeling, IPGM standard, and then following that what we're going to achieve are smaller sensors, longer life sensors with continued accuracy that also feed in cognitive capability into it. And so as far as the sensor pipeline goes there has really been no change versus what we said at -- either the Analyst Day or ADA and the teams are executing against the plan that we laid out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raj [ph] of Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : Maybe one on spine and then one for Karen. You know, on the spine business, the underlying growth there still noted is flat and you did highlight that move with Mazor now and the integrated system you hope to launch, maybe we could see an acceleration in that? Any timelines on when you expect to see improvements in the underlying spine business? And maybe you could also comment just on an underlying market conditions in spine which have been relatively flat recently as well? Omar Ishrak : Yes, so this last quarter was not our best quarter in corresponding biologics, and that is -- a big driver that was Infuse, it was down relative to prior year due to some customer buying patterns; however, the natural demand for Infuse is strong, mid-single-digit, so I'm not concerned. On the market -- the market is -- from our perspective, it seems to have stabilized, still slower than it was a year or two ago as price declines are now offsetting procedure growth; so you're getting either flat to low single-digit to growth but it has stabilized and it's starting to inch back up a little bit. But for us, we do feel we are very well positioned to take share in this market over the next couple of quarters and years. Three big drivers; one is you mentioned Mazor, so our robotics which is part of our surgical synergy strategy, we're seeing the leading indicators of this improvement. So, for example; robotics sales, we look at every major account as kind of like a socket if you will, and the key is the robotic sale. And we are beating our expectations and we're 2X the sales I think in the last quarter, 2X the sales of our competition, and that is before we've launched the Stealth edition, that's where we integrate our navigation into the Mazor X which just got approved by the FDA and we'll be launching in January. And of those robotic sales, 70% of those were placements, meaning that the account chose to pay for them with incremental spine share over the next 4 years -- 3 to 4 years. So we're -- these are great leading indicators, and then utilization of the robot system is up 10% over the last quarter. And then finally, use of Medtronic implants with these systems has gone from 28% in Q4 to nearly 50% in Q2; so all these leading indicators are pointing in the right direction. The other big driver for us is U.S., and we have a strong presence outside the U.S., a lot of our competitors are strong outside the U.S., especially in China. Overall, RTG grew 17% in China, big driver of that was spine. And then finally, the third one is, we talked about speed-to-scale and the path; I think we still have upside in our speed-to-scale strategy, we've got a couple of portfolio gaps that we're closing. So those three things added together, I'd feel like we're going to take share in the market whether it's low single-digits or what have you over the next couple of years. Unidentified Analyst : And maybe just Karen, quickly -- you did note the potential to increased spending rate to support a lot of these growth prospects that Omar outlined. When one thinks about the sort of 50 basis points of margin expansion you've outlined for this year and continued margin expansion into the next couple of years, how much -- if the top line continues to outperform, I mean, will you sort of spend that in a sense -- in order to support that growth or can investors really expect some of that to maybe flow through to the bottom-line? Karen Parkhill : We're committed to margin expansion and as we outlined over the long range, we talked about 40 to 50 basis points for the long range. For this year we talked about 50 basis points, so we're committed to that. We're also focused through our Enterprise Excellence programs on driving greater effectiveness and continued efficiency to deliver that margin expansion but also to enable us to increase our investment in R&D wherever possible; so we're balancing delivering that margin expansion with accelerating our R&D pipeline. Omar Ishrak : Let me also add to that; look, we're -- as you heard me say and all of us are going to comment on; we're extremely excited about our opportunities, we're excited about the fact that we're executing, internally, still we've got a tremendous internal R&D pipeline but we're not going to invent everything, and there are all kinds of opportunities externally as well. We've got a strong balance sheet, we've got lots of firepower and new [ph] CS moving ahead and those are decisions that we make overtime but I want to reiterate that the opportunities in Medtech today have been stronger than I've ever seen it, and certainly, our execution deserves us to be able to invest more, and we'll carry this forward. Having said that, we're committed to the guidance that we've given and the long reach plan that we've talked about, but I just wanted to point out the opportunity here is tremendous and we'll act accordingly. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Barclays. Kristen Stewart : I just wanted to go back to a question I think Bob had asked with respect to the guidance from the EPS perspective for the full year. If I'm looking at the commentary relative to what you reported back in August; it seems that FX is still expected to be neutral; so I just want to make sure I'm understanding the differences there because it seems like you beat by 8% but if I'm listening to you correctly, the only real difference would be the incremental tariffs, and then, also Mazor which is 5%, so usually I think about the guidance as being more conservative or are there other moving parts in other expense or interest expense or even the assumed level of share repurchase that maybe I'm not appreciating? Karen Parkhill : Sure, Kristen. I wouldn't read too much into it. We did have a beat in the second quarter and in the first half. Part of that beat we would attribute to better than expected FX that would be about $0.03 in the second quarter, and about $0.06 in the whole first half. But we do expect EPS to be for the full year to be no longer a tailwind or a headwind, excuse me a tailwind from FX, we now expect FX to be neutral for the full year. And because we've had a headwind from FX in the first half and we expect it to be neutral now in the third quarter, that just implies that we'll have a greater headwind in the fourth quarter from FX that we've built into our guidance. We've absorbed lots of headwind from an FX headwind to China tariffs and Mazor maintained our overall guidance, and we expect FX to have a negative impact in the fourth quarter. Kristen Stewart : So it sounds like it was more the timing of FX impact maybe a little bit more in 2Q than you had previously anticipated, maybe that was more of a second half assumption? Karen Parkhill : Yes, that's correct. Kristen Stewart : And then Omar, just thinking about kind of the commentary around this increased R&D spending; where do you think the appropriate level of spending should be? You're running at around 7-9 for the first half of the year, is that a good level that we should think about or something even higher than that, historically, Medtronic has been more in the 8 to almost 9; so just how much more would you increase R&D? Omar Ishrak : I think the range that you're talking about are within the range of movement according that we'll see according to the dynamics of the investment that we make at a certain point in time. So that's going to present in a chip [ph] you're going to see but the bigger point here is that indeed there are opportunities like I mentioned several times already, both internally and externally, and we'll execute on both and we'll take this on a measured way that as we see ourselves executing, as the opportunity that comes along our way is something which we can deliver on, makes sense as within the strategic alignment of our company, then we'll go forward with it. And this company is about technology, it's about R&D and -- but we're not going to be stupid about it, we'll have to be responsible. But at the same time, as we start to execute, I expect that number to go up. And I'd like it to be higher but will dig that on in a measured way depending on the opportunities that are available, both, internally and externally. Operator : Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Ryan Weispfenning : Omar, do you want to close it up? Omar Ishrak : Yes, thanks, Ryan. And thank you all for your questions. On behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank you again for your continued support and interest. And for those of you in the U.S., I want to wish you and your family a very Happy Thanksgiving. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our third quarter earnings call which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, February, the 19th. Thank you all very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic Third Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning. Sir, you may begin. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 25, 2019. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and the revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. During today's earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly revenue growth rates and ranges are given on an organic basis, which exclude the impact of any material acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency, and are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. All of these adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included in our earnings press release. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported another quarter of solid top and bottom line performance. Revenue grew 4.4% organic, reflecting the benefits of our diversified model. We leveraged our top line to grow adjusted operating profit 7.7%, and adjusted diluted EPS 10.3% or 8.5% at constant currency. Execution is our top priority, and in Q3 we executed on multiple fronts to deliver a strong quarter despite difficult comparisons we were facing in the back half of our fiscal year. Revenue out-performance in MITG and RTG, driven by a number of recent product launches offset the challenges in CVG that we talked about in January. The other big driver was emerging markets, which grew 14%, reflecting a strong quarter across all businesses and geographies. Down the P&L, we saw the benefit this quarter from our focus throughout the organization on margin improvement, resulting in 140 basis points of operating margin expansion, including a benefit from currency. We continue to execute on free cash flow, working to improve our cash conversion and ultimately drive greater shareholder value. Through the first three quarters of the year, we generated over $4.1 billion of free cash flow compared to $2.9 billion in the prior year. We made significant progress on this front, and I really appreciate the engagement of the entire Medtronic team. Overall, it was another good quarter for Medtronic, but what continues to be even more exciting than our results is the progress we're making in our pipeline. As I commented last quarter, we believe we have more opportunities for growth than at any time in our company's history. I'll come back to the pipeline shortly. But first, let's review our performance this quarter in a little more detail. I'll start with our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. MITG had an outstanding quarter growing 6.6% with outperformance in both SI and RGR divisions. Our Surgical Innovations division grew 6.4% with strong growth in both Advanced Energy and Advanced Stapling. Advanced Energy products grew in the low double digits, driven by the adoption of enhanced LigaSure vessel sealing instruments and the Valleylab FT10 energy platform. In Advanced Stapling, we grew in the high-single digits as our Tri-Staple 2.0 endostapling reloads and Signia surgical stapling system continued to perform well in the minimally invasive surgery market. Our Respiratory, GI, and Renal division grew 7%, with strong results across all businesses. G.I grew mid-single digits, led by strength in Beacon endoscopic ultrasound products and Bravo reflux testing systems. Respiratory had high single-digit growth, driven by Puritan Bennett 980 ventilators and Nellcor pulse oximetry products. Renal care grew in the mid-teens with solid sales of Bellco and renal access products. Next, our Restorative Therapies Group had another strong quarter, growing 5.5%, driven by sustained momentum in the Brain Therapies division. Brain grew 13.2% with high teens growth in both Neurovascular and Neurosurgery. In Neurovascular, we\u2019re seeing broad strength across our stroke franchise with double-digit growth in stent retrievers, flow diverters, neuro access, and embolic products. In Neurosurgery, we delivered high-30s growth in capital equipment driven by StealthStation navigation, O-arm imaging, Mazor Robotics, and Midas Rex powered surgical systems. We launched our Mazor X Stealth Edition robotics guidance platform last month, and we've received early enthusiastic feedback for this combination of best-in-class robotics and navigation capability. We believe our strong capital equipment sales supporting our Brain Therapies growth are a leading indicator for future growth in our Spine business as customers choose to link future spine implant purchases with the capital equipment that they're acquiring. As we execute more of these contracts, we would expect our core spine implant sales to grow over the coming quarters. In our Spine division, while results were flat this quarter, when combined with sales of our capital equipment used in spine surgery which is the way many of our competitors report their results, our Spine division grew 4.6% including 5.4% growth in U.S. core spine. In Brain Therapies, our performance was driven by high-single-digit growth in spinal cord stim as the market continues to appreciate the differentiation of Intellis with its evolved workflow algorithm and Snapshot reporting. Our Diabetes Group grew 6.5% this quarter. As expected, this group is facing difficult year-over-year comparisons in U.S. pump sales in the back half of this fiscal year. Despite this, we grew 5% sequentially from Q2 including high-single-digit, sequential growth in insulin pumps specifically. Our performance outside the US was especially strong with Western [ph]Europe, Latin America, and China, growing 25%, 17%, and 16% respectively. CGM as a category grew over 30% this quarter with over 60% growth in Western Europe. Our recently launched standalone CGM system, the Guardian Connect posted its third consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. Our Cardiac & Vascular Group grew 1.6% this quarter, in-line with the revised forecast we provided in early January with mid-single-digit growth in both CSH and APV divisions. Coronary & Structural Heart had another strong quarter in transcatheter valves with 16% TAVR growth in the U.S. and 15% in international markets. We're seeing solid momentum in share gains in the U.S., and in other global markets because of the clinical performance characteristics of our Evolut PRO valve and we're the market leader in many regions around the world including Western Europe. In Aortic, Peripheral, & Venous growth was driven by the continued launch of the Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft system as well as mid-teens growth in both VenaSeal vein closure systems and IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloons. In Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, with mid-single-digit growth in pacemakers and the strength of our Micra transcatheter pacing system, and the Azure wireless pacemaker. This was offset by mid-teens declines in heart failure, primarily due to a mid 40s decline in LVADs as a result of market share loss and heart transplant guideline changes. AF Solutions grew in the mid-teens, driven by continued growth in cryo-balloons. We also announced the acquisition of EPIX Therapeutics. EPIX is developing what we believe is a highly differentiated technology for the over $3 billion focal catheter segment of the ablation market. When combined with our leading cryo-balloon technology, EPIX provides us with a complete portfolio of best-in-class AF ablation catheter technology. It's worth noting that CVG services and solutions faced a number of comparison headwinds, including a revenue recognition change that started in the second quarter, a large order from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in the Q3 of last year, and the exit of a product line in Q1 this fiscal year. Excluding services and solutions, CVG's growth would have been 110 basis points higher and CRHF's growth would have been 180 basis points higher. Now turning to emerging markets, our performance continues to be strong, growing 14% this quarter and now representing 16% of Medtronic revenue. Our strength has diversified across multiple geographies with China growing 13%, South Asia by 23% and the Middle East and Africa by 20%. In addition, Eastern Europe grew 12%, South East Asia 11%; and Latin America 9%. Our differentiated strategies of public and private partnerships and optimizing the distribution channel are paying-off and making a real difference in emerging markets around the world. In addition to our solid performance in the quarter, I remain excited about the unprecedented opportunities for growth that our pipeline presents. We are building up in leadership positions in several of the fastest growing markets in med tech by intentionally allocating our capital to high-growth markets and new opportunities. As we invest in these opportunities, we're doing much more than simply improving today's products and therapies. We are disrupting existing markets and inventing new ones. And when we do this, when we successfully disrupt and invent markets, we distance ourselves from the competition and raise our weighted average market growth rate. All of this creates significant value for patients, for physicians, for health care systems and for our shareholders. It's worth highlighting some of the most exciting elements of our pipeline that, we expect to bring to market in the near future. In RTG, as I mentioned earlier, we're just launching the Mazor X Stealth, our integrated robotics and navigation platform, which we expect to drive growth in our Neurosurgery business along with creating demand for our core spine implants. In Neurovascular, we're now in limited market release of our 071 react catheter and continuing the launch of our Riptide Aspiration System. We expect to launch our next-generation solitaire stent for ischemic stroke by the end of FY 2019. In FY 2020, we intend to launch our DBS primary cell device, with unique sensing capabilities. The first of a series of disruptive product launches planned in our DBS business. In CVG, we're awaiting the presentation of two landmark clinical trials, at the American College of Cardiology meeting on March 17th. The first is the interim results of our low risk TAVR study, which has the potential to expand indications for our transcatheter valve therapy to the largest segment of the market. The second is the results of the rapid trial of our TYRX antibacterial envelope, which could enable guidelines changes in cardiac rhythm implantables. In FY 2020, we're expected to launch our next-generation TAVR valve. The Evolut PRO plus, which features a lower profile and improved predictability of placement for enhanced ease-of-use. We also expect to launch a next-generation insertable cardiac monitor the Reveal LINQ 2.0 which will include Bluetooth connectivity five-year battery longevity and the ability to monitor additional physiological parameters. In the second half of FY 2020, we're planning to launch new conventional ICD and CRT-D product families based on our Polaris high-powered technology platform and we expect to receive a new drug-coated balloon indication in the U.S. for the AV fistula market. Finally, around year-end FY 2020 we're expecting FDA approval for our Micra AV transcatheter cardiac pacemaker, which would enable us to access and disrupt over 55% of the eligible pacemaker market, up from 16% today. The pipeline at MITG is equally impressive. We're currently expanding into key specialty areas of our Tri-Staple technology and we're launching our new Microstream advanced capnography solutions for the Capnostream 35 Portable Respiratory Monitor. We are also currently launching a next-generation Sonicision ultrasound dissection system. Regarding our robotic assisted surgery platform, we're hitting key milestones that are on track for an unexpected launch in FY 2020. We've had several resubmission meetings with regulatory bodies around the world including the U.S. FDA. More than 100 surgeons have used the system and provided us with very positive feedback. We're also partnering with physician societies to develop guidelines for use of the platform. We believe this robotic assisted surgery platform combined with our industry-leading surgical instruments and surgeon training centers on the world will expand the market for minimally invasive surgery. In Diabetes, we're continuing the introduction of 670G into new geographies around the world. In FY 2020, we expect to launch our advanced hybrid closed loop system with Bluetooth, which we're calling the MiniMed 780G. The 780G will feature next-generation algorithms, designed to improve time in range to over 80% by automating insulin delivery following a snack or a meal. In addition the system will reduce the burden of carb counting and enable remote monitoring and remote software downloads. We also expect to submit our application for non-injective designation for our Guardian Sensor 3 in the next few months. So we expect the next five quarters or so to be very exciting, as we bring these innovative pipeline products to market. However, I'm equally excited about our longer-term pipeline. In CVG, we're developing several technologies that will create large and important new markets, including the Intrepid Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement System and the Symplicity Spyral renal denervation system for hypertension. We also expect to disrupt existing markets with our pulsed field ablation technology for AF and the Extravascular ICD. When launched, all of these new products are expected to create multiple new multi-billion-dollar growth opportunities. In RTG, we are developing InterStim micro a 3CC sacral nerve micro stimulator for bladder control with full-body MRI compatibility. In DBS, we expect to build on our sensing technology to develop a closed-loop deep brain stimulation system. In addition, we're planning to introduce a cranial mount DBS system, leveraging our differentiated miniaturization and battery technology. I'm really excited about our plans to disrupt the deep brain stimulation market with the series of new products and make a real impact to patients. In MITG, we continue to develop disruptive products for these markets too, with our portable hemodialysis system, as well as the next generation capsule endoscopy product called PillCam Genius. Overall, we expect to launch more than 90 products over the next five years in MITG. In Diabetes, I hope you saw our announcement this morning that the FDA has granted breakthrough device designation through our personalized closed-loop system. This system will feature real-time personalized algorithms that are designed to automate insulin delivery on a personalized basis that continuously adapts to the user. The system will also provide insights and predictive diagnostics, unique to the individual, all of which will dramatically simplify diabetes management for the patient. In addition to this product, we're also advancing our CGM sensor pipeline by reducing the need for calibration and making the census smaller and longer lasting, all while using cognitive computing to enhance personalized insights. Of course our pipeline is deeper than the few highlights that I've mentioned today. But the key takeaway is that we're executing well on the strongest and most exciting pipeline in Medtronics near 70-year history. Let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our third quarter financials. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Omar. Our third quarter revenue of $7.546 billion represented organic growth of 4.4%. Foreign currency had a negative $149 million impact and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.29 and grew 10.3%. Adjusted operating margin was 29.2%, increasing 140 basis points in the quarter and 120 basis points through the first nine months of the year, including tailwinds from currency. We continue to drive underlying operating margin improvement as we execute on our company-wide Enterprise Excellence Program, driving improved efficiency, cost savings and generating leverage on solid sales growth. As a result, our SG&A this quarter improved by 70 basis points. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 13.4%, which is better than expected due to the increased benefits associated with the finalization of taxes owed on certain returns. For fiscal 2019, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 13.5% to 14%, including the nonrecurring tax benefits that we have received year-to-date. Excluding those benefits, our full year adjusted nominal tax rate would be approximately 15%. And with the addition of changes associated with U.S. tax reform, we continue to expect a tax rate of 16% to 17% in fiscal year '20. Third quarter free cash flow was $1.8 billion. Improving cash generation is a priority for all of us at Medtronic from the top of the company on down and you've seen the results of our increased focus on cash flow in our performance over the last several quarters. We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment, balancing reinvestment with returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned $3.9 billion to shareholders, including $1.8 billion of net share repurchases, resulting at a total shareholder pay out of 77% on adjusted net income. We also remain focused on increasing our return on invested capital through strong execution with our disciplined investment process around R&D and tuck-in acquisitions, including three we recently announced, Mazor, Nutrino and EPIX. We believe that this focus combined with our strong and growing dividend can create long term value for our shareholders. Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to update our guidance. For fiscal year 2019, we are raising our organic revenue growth guidance to 5.25% of 5.5% which is the top half of our prior range. This reflects continued strength in MITG and RTG offsetting the second half headwinds in CVG and difficult comparisons in Diabetes. For the year, we now expect RTG to grow 5.5% to 6%, up from 5% to 5.5%; and MITG to grow 5.5% plus or minus up from 5% plus or minus. We continue to expect CVG to grow 3% to 3.5% and Diabetes to grow in the low to mid-teens. For the fourth quarter, we would expect growth for MITG and RTG to be between 3.5% and 4%. For CVG to look similar to the third quarter and for Diabetes to look roughly flat year-over-year. I would highlight that our expected fourth quarter growth through for diabetes is a bit of an anomaly given the prior year comparison when we were able to finally clear our large backlog for 670G and Sensor orders. And on a two year stack basis, the fourth quarter growth in Diabetes should look more normal. Most importantly, as we move into next year, we believe fourth quarter growth represents a likely bottom and as such would expect growth to improve for both Diabetes and the company. Turning to margins, we continue to forecast 50 basis points of four-year underlying operating margin expansion as we deliver to more than absorb the impact from product mix headwinds, China tariffs and the dilution from the Mazor acquisition. With respect to earnings, given our operational performance through three quarters including our ability to offset the headwinds I just mentioned, we are increasing our fiscal year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $5.14 to $5.16, up from $5.10 to $5.15. While the impact from currency is fluid if recent exchange rates hold, our full year revenue would be negatively impacted by approximately $425 million to $475 million. And despite the headwinds on the top line, given the benefits of our hedging program, FX is expected to be a modest positive to fiscal 2019 operating margins, earnings and free cash flow. Finally on the hills of strong free cash flow performance over the last nine months, we are increasing our expected fiscal 2019 range to $5 billion to $5.2 billion, up from $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion. And in fiscal year 2020, we expect to make additional progress on improving our conversion of non-GAAP earnings into free cash flow as we continue to drive increased focus across the organization. Now I'll return the call back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Karen. Before we go to Q&A, I want to take a moment to thank all of our employees around the world for executing to deliver another strong quarter and fulfilling the Medtronic mission. As I mentioned at the start, this was another solid quarter where we delivered the top line, along with strong adjusted operating profit and EPS growth. You're also seeing our ability to generate strong free cash flow. This is important as it enables us to both reinvest and return to our shareholders. As a reminder, we continue to allocate our capital to our biggest growth opportunities as we focus on driving our WAMGR, our weighted average market growth rate upwards and to the right. Our investments are resulting in a pipeline of numerous growth opportunities that has never been stronger. We expect to develop and bring to market the innovation that will improve the lives of millions of people around the world, help health care systems become more efficient and ultimately grow the intrinsic value of Medtronic. And when we do this, we expect our shareholders to benefit as well. We know there's much work to be done, but I'm excited about where Medtronic is headed. With that, let's now move to Q&A. In addition to Karen our four group presidents; Michael Coyle, Bob White, Geoff Martha and Hooman Hakami are also here to answer your questions. We want to try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan in our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just two quick ones for me here. Karen and then Hooman, as a related follow up. So Karen very helpful on tax guidance for 2020 as well as currency. Can you just help us think about margin guidance next year Karen, when I think about gross margin mix headwinds, slower growth relative to SG&A savings, is 50 basis points still a decent way of thinking about 2020? And then Hooman for you, I appreciate the fourth quarter commentary. How should we think about Diabetes heading into next year. Is this still going to be a high-single-digit growth business for Medtronic or should we start thinking more about mid-single digits as you anniversary the first wave of 670G? Thanks so much. Karen Parkhill : Good morning, David. Thanks for the questions. So on margin for next year, we are confident in our long-range plan and that continuing into next year of our ability to deliver between 40 and 50 basis points of underlying annual - underlying operating margin expansion. Hooman Hakami : David, I'll take the next one, and maybe before talking about FY 2020, it's probably instructive to talk about the comps that we're dealing with in Q3 because this impacts Q3, it impacts Q4. And you've seen a deceleration in the year-over-year growth versus what we posted for the past four quarters, but we have indicated all year that we're coming up against these more difficult comps. And I'll just maybe call out a few of the critical ones. If you recall, David, in the back half of last year, we started to increase CGM capacity that allowed us to fulfil shipment, pent-up demand for both pumps and CGM that carried over from the first half of last year. In addition, in Q3 of this year, we anniversaried Animas, and so all of the consumable revenue and all of the out-of-warranty conversions no longer provide a year-over-year benefit. And then the third thing in Q3 of last year, we also had one of the last large commercial payers approve the reimbursement of 670G. All of these three things distorted the year-over-year performance in Q3, they will do so as well in Q4 and it's primarily a U.S. dynamic. And maybe just to kind of point at it -- point out some perspective, to give you a flavor for the impact of the comps, last quarter Diabetes delivered $583 million of revenue and we grew 27%. This quarter we're delivering $610 million of revenue which is 5% higher than it was a quarter ago, and our growth rate is 6.5%; and so hopefully that should give you a sense of the difficult comps. That's going to carry into Q4 and you\u2019ve heard sort of the outlook from -- in the commentary from Karen for Q4, but from a growth rate standpoint, we absolutely expect Q4 to be the low point for Diabetes growth. We expect the comp dynamics to normalize. We expect the return to growth in Q1 of next year, and then for FY 2020 certainly the full-year comp impact will normalize, and we are very confident that Diabetes is going to grow above the corporate average as we\u2019ve indicated all along. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks David. Next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. As we go back to our models and take a look at fiscal year 2020, could you please remind us of some of the puts and takes as we think about all of that? I know you've previously commented on foreign exchange and tax, but I just want to make sure that street numbers get set up correctly as we head into next year? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Joanne. Appreciate the question. Yes, we are continuing to work our annual plan right now, so it's early for us to issue our full year outlook. We'll do that on our fourth quarter call. But from what we can see today, we are confident in our ability to deliver a 4% plus topline revenue growth on an organic basis despite the fact that our pipeline is weighted to the back half of the year and that's obviously in line with our long-range plan. As I mentioned to David too, we're also confident in our ability to continue to drive annual underlying operating margin expansion to the tune of 40 to 50 basis points, also consistent with our long-range plan. I mentioned that you should continue to model our tax rate next year to be between 16% and 17%. We're continuing to work that tax rate as well as any other additional financial levers, but at this point we are comfortable with current street consensus. And on an FX basis, FX has been a headwind for us in the fourth quarter. We expect that to -- in the third and fourth quarter, we expect that to continue into next year. From an FX perspective, we would expect FX to be about several hundred million dollars on topline on the headwind and a modest impact on the bottom line. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins : Hi, thank you. And good morning. So just one clarification, either Omar or Karen, I think you said a couple of times on the call that fourth quarter organic revenue growth rate would kind of be the low point for Medtronic. So I just - to be specific what is - could you just remind us what is your specific Q4 organic revenue growth rate? And I just want to confirm that I heard that correctly, you think going forward that's the low point? Karen Parkhill : Yes. So when you look at our full year forecast or our full year guidance for revenue growth that would imply about 3% plus or minus for the fourth quarter Bob. And that's what we're referring to as our low point. Bob Hopkins : Okay. And then the other thing I wanted to kind of follow up on is just, in terms of the upcoming ACC meeting, I was wondering if you could just help us sort of set expectations heading into that meeting? Sort of any comments around setting expectations would be helpful? And then, specifically on TYRX, may be help us, if that study is positive can you kind of frame the market opportunity and how you might be able to bundle with ICDs? Just -- if that trial is positive how should we think about incremental opportunity there? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Okay, Mike. Mike Coyle : So Bob, obviously the two late rating clinical trial presentations that we have coming up at the ACC are the low risk TAVR study and TYRX. Both of those have been accepted and we\u2019ll also have simultaneous publication. On the TYRX in particular, we would estimate right now about one-third of what we would consider high risk device implant, actually use the TYRX product. So that would imply that if we have obviously a 7,000 patient study, we do have the power to answer the question of who is going to benefit from this. That it would give us if positive ammunition to basically highlight the sets of standard of care in what we consider to be high-risk in order what -- what we consider high risk is in large device implant on ICD or CRT device, CRT-P device or any de novo implant of those or any replacement procedure including pacemakers. So again, right now we have a utilization of about, one-third of our cases are actually using a TYRX by being able to add about $1000 per procedure and given the unique nature of this technology, it's only available from us. We think we can use it to drive market share as well in terms of both initials and potentially even on replacement basis. So we consider it to be a very important technology and a very important study. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor with UBS. Please go ahead. Matthew Taylor : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I appreciate you talked about a lot of big pipeline drivers coming up here in fiscal 2020. And I was curious if you could get any kind of update on your surgical robotics program? That's one where investors have a lot of focus and we're still waiting for some more details on what that looks like and when it might come into the fold. So can you give us the latest and greatest there? And just how you're feeling about that program? Omar Ishrak : Bob go ahead. Bob White : Thanks, Matt. And appreciate the question. So as Omar mentioned during his commentary, we had actually over 100 surgeons use our robotic systems and in fact, just a couple of weeks ago I had a chance to sit in when one of them during our preclinical labs as we did a partial nephrectomy. And as I chatted with the lead surgeons you could tell, it was really impressive experience both from the aspect of the way the system performed, the procedure, the workflow associated with the system. And so, as we previously communicated we're absolutely on track for FY 2020 launch. But importantly, and I think interesting to you is once procedures have begun and we're collecting additional clinical data, they will arrange opportunities for you to experience one of these cases live. So we're excited with our progress. We're excited with the feedback we get and we're excited to bring the system. Matthew Taylor : Okay. Thank you very much. Ryan Weispfenning : Next question please operator? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Matt Miksic : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I'll keep it to one. So for Karen you mentioned that \u2013 just maybe for background, the changes you talked about in January to the tax rate and the impact on the bottom line growth. Clearly, non-op impact and you've reiterated here just a couple of questions ago I think the top line growth of 4% plus and the 40 to 50 basis points of margin improvement. So operationally, if look at 2020, I guess I'm asking a question but kind of confirming that it's fair to think about operationally the sort of long-range plan in effect and hitting on those metrics. I guess, the question is below the line you mentioned some financial opportunities and I guess, I'm thinking below the line either in the deadline or other non-off-line to sort of help offset the non-impact of tax. If you could maybe flush out what some of those might be and perhaps what some of those were as you're heading into the end of the year is to have \u2013 how you can potentially offset that be very helpful? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Matt. Appreciate your question. And I definitely appreciate the fact that you got that our long-range plan holds for next year on an operational performance basis. Below the line there are additional financial levers. Looking at our tax rate and what we can do to work to improve that. Also looking at our interest expense and income line item, and then obviously share repurchase. We will focus on all of those levers and when we have updates on that we'll be sure to give them to you. Omar Ishrak : Let me just try to put little word here. I understand operationally all the things that Karen just said and you understood and I can confirm that, but let's not forget about pipeline. Our pipeline is extremely exciting. We have some really some exciting new product introduction next year, the micro EVs one that I'm really excited about, the robotics and so on. So let's not forget that. Operationally, we'll be there but the pipeline sets us up normally for next year but for the future as well. Matt Miksic : Terrific. Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Matt. Next question please operator? Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Good morning. Very impressive short term and long term pipeline of new products, I will sit back and look at the R&D center this whole \u2013 I think it's a \u2013 potential revenues. It's been pretty consistent despite the strong pipeline. So two questions, the first one, with the strong pipeline ahead does it make sense to increase R& D spend - took advantage of your momentum? You have a new products. And second from a process perspective how is IR tracking versus your own internal expectations? And how does that changed over the last few years? Omar Ishrak : Let me just take on that. And then Karen maybe can add to it. First of all, our pipeline is funded. So we're spending R&D money to fund our pipeline and we will make sure that that happens. As we see overall operational success, the first place will put our money into its organic R&D spending because that's the highest return that we can get out of any kind of investment that we make. Having said that, we also always look at continued R&D productivity. We look at sharing between different groups, transferring of technology between one group and another that makes our R&D more efficient and it actually accelerates pipeline, miniaturization technology and back technology are the two biggest examples where our fixed capability can move across different groups and make that R&D quite efficient. So that's the way we look at that and I think from a return perspective there's certainly within our projections, the organic ones and I think most of the acquisitions too have had returns that are better than our cost of capital. So Karen you want to add to that? Karen Parkhill : Well said. The only thing I would add is that we're focused on improving our overall return on invested capital for the whole company and obviously our R&D pipeline is a big part of that. And as we look at tuck-in acquisitions, we\u2019re focused on making sure that those ROICs are strong and accretive for the company too. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Pito. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice print there. So just may be I\u2019ll limit myself to one question. Maybe I'll have two bits in that question, but Omar for you. If you look at the organic for the company its coming really, really strong we're looking at close to 5.5 for fiscal 2019. You are talking about pipeline. When we think about first half versus second half of next year, are we looking at first half may be at the low end of your four to five, and maybe back half coming in at the high-end? When these pipeline -- when it actually comes to fruition, is that organic going to accelerate in that fiscal 2021? And then Karen for you just quickly on margins. 40 to 50 bps at constant-currency, but I think I heard you say FX headwinds a few hundred million dollars on top, but more modest. Does that imply their FX is going to be a benefit drop next year on margins? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Okay. First of all I think you're right about the pipeline that it is backend loaded towards the second half of the year and as the quarters progress you'll see the benefit of that in our growth rates and I think you read that correctly. But I think more importantly the other point that you made is that product introductions are the starting point. These things carry through into FY 2020, 2021 and filling these products will get approval in other countries and other new products will also come up towards FY 2021. So again from a product introduction perspective you'll see a gradual increase backend loaded like you mentioned and the growth rate will correspondingly follow that lower end of first half, higher in the second half. I think that's the right way to look at it. Karen Parkhill : And then the other thing I would add Vijay is that we mentioned that we think that our fourth quarter growth rate is a low point for us and so you can think about that as you look ahead next year too. And then from a benefit, your question about benefit on FX on operating margin line. We see FX as being a headwind for us and you can expect a little bit of a headwind on the operating margin line right now at least where we are today and where our hedging is right now. Vijay Kumar : All right. Thank you, guys. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Vijay. Next question please operator. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for the question. Hooman, I wanted to circle back to diabetes and you talked about the outlook for 2020. But I want to touch on the breakthrough designation you got this morning for the Personalized Closed Loop pump. Maybe talk about with the recently acquired Nutrino Health adds to this? When we might see data and approval of this in the U.S. and outside the U.S.? Is there a new hardware involved on the CGM and pump side ? And maybe touch on how this compares to where you think the competition is in next-generation systems? Thanks. Hooman Hakami : Okay. Thanks Robbie. What I'll say is there's probably not enough time on this call to do first-line closed loop justice, but I'll give you kind of a flavor for it. We really think that Personalized Closed Loop is going to be a system that truly paves the way for a true closed loop system. And because of that we just - we don't feel that closing a loop is aspirational any longer, it's actually achievable. And if you really think about today's algorithms, Robbie, they essentially behave the exact same way for every single patient even though every single patient is different. Personalized Closed Loop changes all that. It's real-time system. It automates all facets of insulin delivery in a way that is personalized and adaptive to the user. In addition the system is going to provide unique insights to help the patient, help them with predictive diagnostics which we think is going to dramatically simplify diabetes management for the patient. And so we really think this is going to be a transformative system and we're thrilled to have received breakthrough designation for it from the FDA. Now, as far as launch date goes and all of that, we just received a breakthrough designation. For competitive reasons, I think it would be premature to talk about launch dates, but what I will say and you touched on this is that we're investing heavily in Personalized Closed Loop. Our acquisition of Nutrino was made with Personalized Closed Loop in mind. We are fully resourced from an R&D standpoint to drive this program as aggressively as possible and we're excited to share more details with you as we progress with the program. Robbie Marcus : Is that something we might see data at ADA 2020? Hooman Hakami : Yes. So, ADA 2020, I think, we will outline for you more details around Personalized Closed Loop for sure. And I think what you will see as we start to more articulate what the system is and what the capabilities are, you'll see that it will be completely differentiated with respect to -- not only what's out there today, but what's also coming. Robbie Marcus : Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Rob. Operator, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Bruce Nudell : Good morning. And thanks for the question and congratulations on a very balanced quarter given the challenges you had. I have a question for Mike. Mike I know the upcoming trials at ACC are embargoed, but could you just help investors think about on the basis of death and stroke, in particular, is superiority needed to change the paradigm of surgery versus TAVR in that low-risk population? And I think it's important because there are probably around 3,000 surgeries that suddenly come on a table. Just your thoughts about -- surgery might be great, but does TAVR go to the runner or do you actually need superiority to kind of change the discussion between patients and practitioners? Thanks so much. Mike Coyle : Well, certainly, we've seen patients be highly enthusiastic about less invasive approaches to therapy. And so there is a large patient pool that is associated with these technologies in TAVR and ultimately, in the mitral space. So I think non-inferiority is certainly a good starting point at this stage, if that's where it ends up. But over time, from my perspective, as we get more experience with these technologies and we see durability in the technology, we're going to see significant patient pool to expand in the market. Bruce Nudell : Thanks so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Bruce. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro : Good morning, guys. Thank you. Omar, I had a question, I guess, for you and both Karen, on expense growth in the context of your margin goals. You have a number of pretty compelling technologies on the table between robotics, the TAVR market expansion, diabetes, heading into next year. So I'm interested in how you - if you could help frame the way in which you're going to fund those growth initiatives whilst delivering the margin expansion? Are there other couple areas of obvious savings on the SG&A line that would help a lot with that? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : You're right. Look, there's two big areas that we look at. In the SG&A line, we're looking at better productivity in our go-to-market methodologies. In our \u2013 primarily on the back office, commercial back offices, which we're concentrating and putting into one place. That actually saves a lot of money. We're also using new types of technologies to be able to do these processing tasks much more efficiently. So the commercial back office and the commercial go-to-market, not from a sales person perspective, but more from a support perspective is a good area of opportunity for us and that will yield a lot of dividends. The other one which we've mentioned all along in our program is in full flight and we've got a program to reduce the number of manufacturing sites we have, from, I don't know, 80 or 90 a few years ago, to more like 50 to 60. And, I mean, that clearly gives us some level of productivity. In addition to that, we have a continuing effort in each factory to improve the efficiency of our lines through different quality processes that are continuously improving. And improving in sites which already have those processes and we put them into new sites as they get ready for production. So I think those are the main drivers to which we get cost reduction. The back office, commercial back office and the cost down programs we're concentrating on manufacturing sites. Our supply -- our overall indirect and direct supply also, because of our sites is the leverage point. And finally, our services from our functions are ones that we monitor a lot like HR, finance, legal, et cetera. We monitor those services and we compare them to benchmarks against companies of our size and we expect to be best-in-class in one or two of those areas or higher, because of the integration we had to do. But over the next few years we'll get them to best-of-class and that will also give us \u2013 free us \u2013 free some extra funds to do the R&D which we're focused on. I think I covered it. Karen, anything to add? Karen Parkhill : You totally covered it. I would just say that our Enterprise Excellence Program is specifically designed to drive that operating margin expansion and enable us to continue to invest heavily in R&D. Isaac Ro : Got it. Thanks very much guys. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Isaac. Isaac Ro : Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Operator, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One for Karen one for Mike. So Karen, on the guidance in fiscal Q4 is about 3% organic you said and you expect that to be at the bottom. I guess my question is, when we look at a first half of fiscal 2020, why would it be higher than that 3%? What drives the improvement? Anything besides the diabetes comps getting easier? And then Mike, I think drug-coated balloon that mid-teens growth this quarter came in better than people expected. Just any color or commentary on the outlook for that business? Thanks for taking the questions. Karen Parkhill : Sure. Thanks Larry. You are already noted the comps which is a big deal. We had very tough comps in the back half and that changes as we move into next quarter. When we think about CVG too, we expect that to improve as we launch new products. But also keep in mind that we will anniversary the revenue recognition change that we made to the services and solutions part of CVG in the first quarter. And then we'll also anniversary the MCS decline in the third quarter. So hopefully those things help you. Mike Coyle : And Larry as it relates to drug-coated balloons, we actually -- we're quite pleased with the growth profile of the business. Obviously in January we're a little concerned when that med analysis came out where we saw certain accounts basically kind of pushing the pause button on utilization, while they waited for additional data. I think the communication across the board from the manufacturers looking at their own data in detail and especially our randomized controlled data in both the U.S. pivotal trial, the Japan trial and our Global Registry Data were helpful in terms of providing a patient level analysis. And then we've seen independent publications like the one we saw in JAMA here last week, that basically we showing on claims databases, no correlation with desk for paclitaxel. So as more and more data come out, it's obviously getting the market more comfortable with the conclusions around the performance of the technology. We know it off a significant efficacy benefits relative to standard balloon technology. And for us, we are looking at continued expansions and indications for use into new areas. We should have U.S. approval for AV fistula indication in FY 2020 and we continue to do work on below the knee. So we see that technology as an important strong long-term growth driver for our AVF business. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Larry. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with SVD Leerink. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. Mike a quick question for you on heart failure business and as expected, we saw some weakness in LVAD. Just curious how you're seeing that continue to play out there? How much of that would you characterize was impact from competition versus the change in the transplant guidelines. Just trying to get a sense of the go forward outlook just for that market and for that business overall? And then I had one quick follow up. Thanks. Mike Coyle : Sure. Well, the two issues that identified at the JPMorgan Meeting were almost simultaneous, right, the approval of the competitive HeartMate 3 product and the changes to heart failure guidelines. As we went through the quarter the front end of the quarter really took the brunt of that -- sort of market correction. We think the U.S. market was down 20% to 25% as basically LVADs -- patients with LVAD were kind of put to the bottom of the list where heart transplants. And obviously a lot of those patients are now being bridged to transplant with technologies like ECMO. So the question will be, how did they do in their transplant surgeries when they're on a less robust support system over time? And obviously that's going to take new quarters to play out in terms of being able to look at, what it does to the overall market. But clearly, the bigger issue for us was the competitive share shift that we saw. Our competitive brought out a meaningful improvement over their older technology. There was a lot of interest in the market to try it and see how it was performing. We had seen some of those accounts coming back, but there is a big correction that now has taken place. And I think whereas we were looking at sort of a 35% market share prior to that new product coming in. During this quarter, it was closer to 20%, on a global basis it has settled out at sort of a 25% share price for us. I think that is probably a good way of thinking about the go forward for the overall market. We obviously have a lot that we're working on in terms of our dichotomy indication for a less invasive surgical placement for the HVAD technology and we have a number of important technology developments that are taking place to the system that we think can help improve complication rates to both go-to-market and grow our shares. So but at least in the short term, this will be a headwind for us for the next several quarters. Danielle Antalffy : Okay. And you answered my follow-up on what's next. So thank you so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Danielle. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Please go ahead. Kristen Stewart : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Karen, I just wanted to quickly make sure I understood your comments correctly on the consensus EPS for next year. I think you had said you're comfortable in that and that implies about \u2013 I guess 5.6%-ish growth. I thought in January you guys were saying that it might be 150 basis points off the CAGR. How should we just think about that overall kind of growth for next year? And then just longer-term, I think in the breakout commentary Mike had mentioned something about growth perhaps coming in a little bit higher in 2021, because of some of the new products and just want to kind of flush out how should we really think that 8% mark? Karen Parkhill : Thanks for the question, Kristen. So FY 2020, we've talked about \u2013 we've got the big headwind of our tax rate. We also have some FX headwinds that I mentioned. So at this point, yes, we are comfortable with current street consensus and we will give our annual outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. We're continuing to work our long-range plan. But at this point, I would say, we're comfortable. As we think about the strength of our pipeline though, it is weighted towards the back half of next year and beyond. And so we're really excited about that and beyond piece of it. Omar Ishrak : Yes. Just to sort of confirm that Kristen clearly as the pipeline comes through it's going to \u2013 the growth rate is going to accelerate and we're very confident in the plan that we've laid out the 4%-plus growth rate overtime and it's too early to talk about \u2013 tell you what are these plan, but clearly the expectation is as the quarters go by here the rate will grow \u2013 will rise and just the pipeline itself would imply that. So we're confident in increasing growth profile over time as we look into the future. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then I think the two things that you mentioned on the pipeline Intrepid and simplicity longer term. Just quickly on that Intrepid are you now able to do that transeptly and any sort of data that we could be expecting on neither that program or simplicity in the near-term? Omar Ishrak : I think Mike go ahead. Mike Coyle : So on Intrepid we continue to enroll in the APOLLO study. We've been very pleased we have not seen any drop off in enrollments rates in the wake of collapse data. And we continue -- these are all typically delivered technology or products right now. We continue to work on the pipeline for transfemoral, and obviously we're still making a strategic decision around how small do we need to make the profile of the device, we can make it transfemoral right now or in a trance assignment. It's a large technology. So the decision whether to actually make that a -- engineer a smaller solution and then go into market with it, or into clinical trials with it or to go with a larger version that we're currently developing is still a work in process. And then on the Simplicity trial ,we continue to enroll in both the off med on med pivotal trial results which will be the basis for the PMA approval. We would expect data availability for that early in FY 2021. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Kristen. Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question please. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Raj Denhoy : Hi, thank you. Good morning. May be, Omar I could ask about emerging markets? Another very strong quarter. I think it contributed about -- a little over two points of your growth in the quarter. So maybe could help us understand if there are particular products that are driving that? And how we can get comfortable with the sustainability of that contribution going forward? Omar Ishrak : Well, yeah, I'm glad you brought that up. I was going to make a comment anyway because for sure our pipeline is exciting, but the emerging markets performance and consistency and its gradual increase over time is something that we feel pretty good about. And I think the way to look at that is look -- there's no question about the demand rising and the fact that there\u2019s a huge opportunity to increase penetration of existing products, which have been approved like for years. And we've over time built core expertise in how you do that in aligning patient awareness, helping build infrastructure and training physicians and then deploying our technologies. So that process -- and then going direct or optimizing our go-to-market strategies in those emerging markets. You put all of that together that's our strategy. Now that is something that you just flip a switch and you do it. You build that expertise over time and we've done that over the last I'd say at least five to seven years. And we have got a pretty clear understanding of how to continue to grow on that platform. And so we're pretty consistent -- we're pretty confident about the consistency of this double-digit profiling in emerging markets. I'm sure there will be macroeconomic changes here and there but by enlarge the health care need is somewhat independent of that and also the geographic diversification we have within emerging markets has proven to be an asset in enabling us to demonstrate consistency. So yes we are very confident in emerging markets of maintaining the double-digit profile and one that we've built a track record on, build experience on, and one you can depend on. Raj Denhoy : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Raj. Omar, do you want to finish? Omar Ishrak : Yeah, sure. Thanks. Thanks everyone. Thanks for question. And on behalf of the entire management team, thanks for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress and the results for a full year on our Q4 earnings call, which we currently anticipate holding Thursday May, 23. So thanks again to everyone for participating and for your support. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019, which ended on April 26, 2019. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and the revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. During today's earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. References to organic revenue growth excludes the impact of material acquisitions, divestitures, and currency. References to pro forma exclude the impact of material divestitures. Unless we say otherwise quarterly rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis which compares to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 after adjusting for currency. Unless we say otherwise annual rates and ranges are given on a comparable constant currency basis which compares to fiscal year 2018 after adjusting for currency and the fiscal year 2018 divestiture of the patient care, DVT, and nutritional insufficiency business. All of these adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported a solid finish to a strong fiscal year for Medtronic. We delivered revenue growth, operating margin, and EPS all ahead of Street expectations. Q4 revenue grew 3.6% organic, with outperformance in RTG and MITG offsetting challenges in CVG and difficult comparisons in Diabetes. In addition, Emerging Markets continued to be a big driver, growing 12%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points, including currency, reflecting our entire organization\u2019s focus on Enterprise Excellence. On the bottom line, we grew adjusted diluted EPS 8.5%, or 9.2% at constant currency.  For the full fiscal year 2019, revenue, EPS, and free cash flow all came in above the guidance ranges we set at the beginning of the year as we executed against our commitments. Revenue of $30.6 billion grew 5.5% organically. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% on a comparable, constant currency basis and 11.5% pro-forma. Free cash flow of $5.9 billion grew 62%, much faster than earnings, reflecting the focus of our entire organization on improving this important metric. Last June at our Investor Day, we set a target to improve our free cash flow conversion to 80% over the next two to three years, and we achieved it in just one year. FY 2019 free cash flow conversion was 83%, notably above our peer average. In FY 2019, we invested our capital into future growth platforms, with a focus on returns, while at the same time increasing our returns to shareholders through share repurchases and a rising dividend.  In Q4, we overcame significant challenges and relied upon the diversification of our business to deliver another quarter of solid top- and bottom-line results. Let\u2019s discuss some of the more important drivers of our performance, starting with our Restorative Therapies Group, which had another very strong quarter, growing 6.5%. The launch of the Mazor X Stealth navigated robotic system is off to a strong start and building momentum. We sold 26 systems this quarter, increasing our spine robotic market share to more than 70%, with an installed base that is now more than three and a half times that of our closest competitor. While Mazor sales are driving Brain Therapies growth, we believe they are also a good leading indicator of future growth in our Spine division, as customers that are purchasing our Mazor system are also choosing to increase their share of Medtronic spine implants.  In fact in Q4, over 80% of our Mazor systems were sold to customers who chose to enter into combined capital and implant contracts, and the percentage of Mazor robotic cases that use our Medtronic spine implants continued to climb, exceeding 60% in Q4, a double digit increase from Q3. When you combine our Spine division sales with the sales of our capital equipment from our Brain Therapies division used in Spine surgery, our Spine division grew 5.6%, with the U.S. Core Spine business growing 11%. This is how our competitors report, and a strong indication that our enabling technologies robotics, navigation, imaging, and powered surgical instruments will help increase sales of spine implants.  In RTG, I\u2019d also highlight Neurovascular and Pain Therapies. In Neurovascular, our market-leading stroke portfolio continues to perform extremely well with double-digit growth in stent retrievers, flow diverters, coils, and neuro access products. In Pain Therapies, we continued to gain market share despite the market\u2019s recent slowdown. Our Pain Stim business achieved a number one share position in Q4 for the first time in two and a half years, driven by our differentiated Intellis system, with its Evolve workflow algorithm and Snapshot reporting. In MITG, we grew 5.1%, driven by strength in Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy. This is an impressive performance, as the Surgical Innovations business overcame challenges resulting from the shutdown of a major sterilization supplier\u2019s facility. I just cannot say enough about how our teams stepped up and successfully managed this issue, quickly identifying alternative suppliers and rerouting our supply chain to get inventory to the right place at the right time. We expect to be back to full sterilization capacity late in Q1.  In CVG, we grew 1.1% as we faced challenges in drug-coated balloons and LVADs as well as CRM replacement devices given where we are in our replacement cycle. At the same time, multiple product lines showed exceptional strength in the quarter with high-teens growth from our Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder, and mid-teens growth from both our Micra transcatheter pacing system and our Arctic Front AF ablation catheters. We also continued strong, double-digit growth in our TAVR franchise. Our TYRX antiinfection product grew in the high-twenties, and we saw a notable pick-up in its utilization following the WRAP-IT data presentation at the American College of Cardiology meeting in March. In Diabetes, we grew 0.6%, an anomaly given difficult prior year comparisons that we described on our last earnings call. Despite the challenging comparisons, Diabetes delivered mid-teens growth in international markets and our fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth in standalone CGM. Looking ahead, we expect Diabetes growth to reaccelerate in the first quarter and to be accretive to total company growth in FY 2020. At the ADA conference in June, we plan on hosting an investor meeting where we will update you on the progress of our pipeline and an exciting series of product launches we have planned over the next 24 months.  Now, turning to Emerging Markets, our performance continues to be strong, growing 12% this quarter, and representing 16% of Medtronic revenue. Our strength was diversified across all four groups and across multiple geographies, with China growing 13%, South Asia by 22%, and Southeast Asia by 20%. In addition, Middle East & Africa grew 13% and both Eastern Europe and Latin America grew 8%. Our strategies of public and private partnerships, optimizing the distribution channel, and in some markets localization of R&D and manufacturing are driving growth and differentiating Medtronic. Overall, it was another solid quarter despite the noted headwinds, and a really strong year for Medtronic. But as we look forward, we\u2019re even more excited about what lies ahead, as the investments we\u2019ve been making in our pipeline begin to pay off with accelerating revenue growth, and ultimately, value creation for our shareholders. We expect our top line to accelerate over the course of FY 2020 and into FY 2021, driven by the anniversary of recent headwinds, combined with major products that are launching now or will launch over the next 12 months. It\u2019s worth highlighting some of these near-term launches. I\u2019ll start with CVG. In our TAVR business, we are expecting low risk indication expansion in the U.S., as well as launches of our next-generation TAVR valve, the Evolut Pro Plus. We intend to launch this valve across all sizes, including a large, 34 millimeter valve. In CRHF, two of the biggest launches we have in FY 2020 are number one, our Reveal LINQ 2.0 insertable cardiac monitor and number two, our Micra AV transcatheter pacing system.  LINQ 2 will feature Bluetooth connectivity, five year battery longevity, enhanced sensing specificity, and the ability to monitor new physiological parameters. Micra AV, which is one of the most disruptive products in our pipeline, is expected to launch around fiscal year end. It will enable us to access and disrupt over 55% of the eligible pacemaker market, up from 16% today. In MITG, we continue to make great progress with our soft tissue robotics program, and we\u2019re now preparing for our initial launch in FY 2020, consistent with our commentary over the last several quarters. Our initial launch activities will occur outside the U.S. and support our clinical and regulatory strategies in geographies around the globe. I know everyone is anxious to see the robot, and for competitive reasons, we\u2019ve obviously kept this program close to the vest. The good news is that we plan to host an analyst event this Fall to show the robot. We\u2019re in the process of working on dates, and as soon as we get everything confirmed, we\u2019ll be sure to send the analysts an invitation. In RTG, as I mentioned earlier, the launch of the Mazor X Stealth is off to a great start, and we expect this will continue to drive growth in our Neurosurgery business, along with creating demand for our Core Spine implants. In Neurosurgery, we are preparing for the launch of the Midas Rex MR8 drill platform in the first half of FY 2020, and we expect its differentiated features to drive share growth. In Neurovascular, we just launched our next generation stent retriever, Solitaire X, and our React 071 aspiration catheter, advancing our leadership in the treatment of ischemic stroke. In Pain Therapies, we expect the full launch in FY 2020 of our Accurian nerve ablation platform.  In Diabetes, we expect to file for a non-adjunctive indication for our CGM sensor in early FY 2020, thereby allowing us access to the U.S. Medicare market for the 670G. In addition, in FY 2020 we expect to launch the MiniMed 780G, our Advanced Hybrid Closed-Loop System with Bluetooth connectivity. The 780G will feature next-generation algorithms designed to improve time-in-range to over 80%. The system will reduce the burden of carb counting, enable remote monitoring as well as remote software downloads, and include several key enhancements to our CareLink system. What all this means for the company as a whole is that we expect our growth rate to accelerate over the course of FY 2020, with the second half growing faster than the first, as we one, anniversary recent headwinds, and two, bring these innovative products to market over the next several quarters. Moreover, we expect our top line momentum to build heading into FY 2021, as we get the increasing benefit of the FY 2020 product launches that I just mentioned, as well as the benefit of several products that we expect to launch early next fiscal year, such as : our Percept deep brain stimulation system, the very first deep brain stimulator with sensing capabilities; our DiamondTemp focal ablation catheter system, which will initially launch in Europe; and our Interstim Micra 3cc MRI-compatible sacral nerve stimulation system, which is fully rechargeable and 80% smaller than our current, market-leading device. While there isn\u2019t enough time today to go through the longer-term pipeline, with all of these products launching, the takeaway that I want you to have is that each of our four groups has the potential to see accelerating growth in FY 2021. Let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our fourth quarter financials. Karen? Karen L. Parkhill: Thank you. As Omar mentioned we delivered fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 3.6% and EPS growth of 8.5%. For the full year our adjusted operating margin expanded 120 basis points including 50 basis points on a constant currency basis and in line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. We remain focused on our enterprise excellence programs better leveraging our size and scale and driving improved effectiveness and efficiency across the company. This past year in particular the benefits of the program are most evident in SG&A where we drove 40 basis points of improvement. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 31.5%, an improvement of 140 basis points or 50 basis points on a constant currency basis. In addition to driving expansion by executing on our enterprise excellence program we also absorbed the unplanned expense of China tariff as well as a negative 20 basis point impact on our operating margin from the sterilization issue with purposeful cost control throughout the company. In the fourth quarter we successfully executed a 7 billion euro debt offering and used the proceeds to reduce U.S. dollar denominated debt. The new euro issuance carries a weighted average coupon rate of 7/8% lowering the effective interest rate on our long-term debt portfolio and providing savings for the company for years to come. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 14.1% for the quarter and 13.6% for the year in line with the expectations we said on the third quarter call. Excluding the non-recurring tax benefits we received in fiscal year 2019 our adjusted nominal tax rate would have been approximately 14.75%. Perhaps most exciting is our annual free cash flow at $5.9 billion, a significant improvement over the $3.6 billion we generated last year and well above our guidance and expectations. All of our colleagues have made improving free cash flow a priority and this focus is yielding strong results enabling us to achieve our conversion goals well ahead of the schedule I gave you at our Investor Day in June. Going forward, you can expect our free cash flow to grow largely in line with earnings as we continue to target an 80% conversion rate above our peer average over our long range plan. Before I move to guidance, I want to reiterate our commitment to balanced capital deployment. We continued to invest in future growth through disciplined investment in R&D, along with tuck-in acquisitions like Mazor and Epix, among others. And, we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders. In fact in fiscal 2019, we returned $4.6 billion, 78% of the free cash we generated to our shareholders through both dividends and net share repurchase. Our total shareholder payout for the year was 65% on adjusted net earnings. Now, turning to our guidance for fiscal year 2020. As a starting point, we expect organic revenue growth to be 4% plus or minus. While the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a negative impact on full year revenue of approximately 1% to 1.5%. By business group, we expect MITG to grow 4.5% to 5%, RTG to grow 4% to 4.5%, Diabetes to grow 6% to 8%, and CVG to grow 2%, plus or minus, all on an organic basis.  We expect our first quarter growth rate to be lower than normal on the heels of a better than expected fourth quarter, transitory headwinds from the sterilization shutdown in MITG, and a slowdown in our Peripheral business from paclitaxel-coated balloons. Given these, we expect organic revenue growth in the first quarter to be in the range of 2% to 2.5%, with currency having a negative impact of 2.1% to 2.6% at recent rates. By business group, MITG and RTG are expected to grow 3% to 3.5%, CVG looks flat, and Diabetes is expected to grow 5%, plus or minus, all on an organic basis. From there, we expect our revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year, with constant currency growth closer to 4% in the second quarter, and north of 4% in the second half. We expect to continue to drive margin expansion of approximately 40 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by our Enterprise Excellence initiatives. For modeling purposes, we would assume a modest improvement in the first half of the year, given lower revenue growth and a slight FX headwind, with increasing improvement in the second half. We expect our tax rate to increase from 13.6% last year to 16% to 16.5% in fiscal year 2020, given the changes associated with U.S. tax reform that we discussed previously.  Of course, we remain focused on optimizing our underlying operating tax rate over time under these new regulations. With respect to earnings, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.44 to $5.50, which includes a negative $0.10 impact of currency at recent rates. For the first quarter, we expect a $1.17 to $1.19, including a $0.04 currency headwind at recent rates.  After delivering on each of our commitments in fiscal year 2019, I couldn\u2019t be more excited about fiscal year 20 and beyond. As Omar outlined, we expect our revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year as we anniversary recent headwinds and launch a series of major products. And, we expect this momentum to build into fiscal year 2021, with each of our four groups having the potential to see accelerating growth next fiscal year. Now I will return the call back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Karen. Before we go to Q&A, I\u2019d like to acknowledge our 90,000 Medtronic employees who work tirelessly and are dedicated to fulfilling the Medtronic Mission in alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for so many around the world. In fiscal 2019, our employees together with our physician partners, served over 75 million patients or more than two patients every second. Let\u2019s now move to Q&A. In addition to Karen, our four group presidents, Mike Coyle, Bob White, Geoff Martha, and Hooman Hakami, are also here to answer your questions. We want to try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question, and if necessary, a related follow-up. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question this morning comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins : Hi, thank you and good morning. Congrats on a strong finish to the year. I just wanted to kind of ask a little bit about some of the revenue forecast that you're making, so two very quick things; one, given your first quarter guidance of about 2 to 2.5, can you just walk us through in as much detail as you're willing to provide some of the incremental headwinds that you're seeing in Q1 or that you're forecasting in Q1 versus the 3.6% growth that you put up in Q4? And then I'll just go ahead and ask a quick follow-up right here, you know this is a question for Mike, just wondering if you could comment on TAVR and what you're seeing since the presentation of the data at ACC because the TAVR number looked maybe a smidge lighter than we were thinking so those are the two questions, thanks for taking them? Omar Ishrak : Karen, you want to take the\u2026 Karen L. Parkhill: Sure, thanks Bob, appreciate the question. So, in the first quarter we have guided to 2% to 2.5%, and as you know the fourth quarter came in a little better than we expected. Recall that we had guided around 3% for the quarter and we came in at 3.6%. So given the strong finish to the fiscal year it's likely that we'll see a little bit of softness in the first quarter. We also have the lingering effect of the sterilization issue in MITG. We did use our inventory on hand to help mitigate that in the fourth quarter and now we have less on hand as we move into Q1. We expect the sterilization issue to be behind us as we said at the end of the quarter but will face some slowdown in revenue given that probably to the tune of about 20 million to 30 million which is about 100 bps of MITG growth there. And then, as you know, Q1 will be the first quarter, the full impact of the DCB issue following the uncertainty of the FDA announcement in June. That could be another $20 million to $30 million headwind in CVG and about 100 basis points of CVG growth. But as we noted on the call we do expect our growth to accelerate over the course of the year as we anniversary various headwinds and we introduce our strong pipeline. I'll let Mike answer the TAVR question. Michael J. Coyle: Yeah Bob thanks for the question. We were quite pleased with the TAVR number. I think the overall growth rate for both -- the global growth rate was around 11%, U.S. growth rate around 12%, and we were very much in line with that. The announcements at ACC obviously were for low risk and there have been no low risk approvals yet. And of course there's no reimbursement for products that are unapproved. So, we didn't see a marked increase in penetration of that group that will follow after the FDA does the actual approvals of the expanded indication for use. But I would point out that a year ago we were much more active in terms of opening up new accounts which carries with it stocking that would have -- could have more revenue in the prior year number. So, implant growth rates for us were more in the mid-teens rate in the U.S. So, we're very pleased with obviously the momentum in the business and especially with the potential to further grow it in the low-risk patient population. Bob Hopkins : Great, thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Bob. Next question please Carol. Operator : Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Hi, good morning. Just one for Karen and one for Hooman here. So Karen, I wondered if you could help us with earnings per share for 2020, other income was a significant driver of EBIT in 2019, we also had a very significant debt restructuring. So, as you think about 2020, can you just sort of help us understand our assumptions what they should be as it relates to other income and more specifically, actually interest expense because to us the earnings guidance looks a little conservative, so any help there will be very helpful? Karen L. Parkhill: Sure, thanks for the question David. So, on other income, it was a little strong this quarter, and we had a significant strength in it from just the currency and our hedging program. But we also did have other royalty expense come in better, and as we focused on driving improved royalty income where we can, you're seeing that play out and that should continue. In terms of the debt restructuring, we were obviously pleased with the euro debt offering in our U.S. debt tender, and going forward you should expect around 200 million to 210 million a quarter in interest expense from us. David Lewis : Okay, that's very helpful. And then just, Hooman a quick question on diabetes. I think, in the recent months, there's been sort of this emerging concern that the industry is changing very rapidly just given reimbursement, regulatory, and various technology changes. I just wondered if you could help us understand how is Medtronic positioned over the next one to two years from a share perspective in both your pump and CGMS business, and do you think an independent diabetes business would allow you to adapt or grow more quickly? Thanks so much. Hooman Hakami : Sure, thanks David, let me actually take the second one first. We get a lot of benefits from being part of Medtronic. The scale and breadth of the company we leverage every single day with respect to things like wafer scale technology that we're doing with CVG. As we think about global expansion, we leverage our regulatory resources and relationships around the world so there's tremendous benefit and I think that helps us drive the growth that we need. Now with respect to the competitive positioning and all of that, for all that's been said and written about the competition and its impact on us let me just maybe give you a few data points with respect to how we finished. First our installed base in FY 2019 grew by mid single digits. This is true globally as well as in the United States. In addition our patient retention rates were in line with historical rates globally and as we think about FY 2020 we see a lot of things to be excited about, international that you heard from the commentary is going to be and continue to be a big portion of our growth. This is about 45% of our global revenue and it's growing in the mid teens and we expect it to grow in the mid teens.  And the other dynamic that we outlined at the Analyst Day is the CGM penetration and the CGM growth of our installed base as well as standalone CGM growth which had four consecutive quarters of triple digit growth. You put all of those things together David we feel really good about our ability to be accretive to overall Medtronic in FY 2020 and that's even before we talk about the pipeline that we will share with you at ADA which is incredibly exciting and will bring a whole host of new innovation over the next 24 months. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks David, can we take the next question please Carol. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, congrats on a nice quarter here. Two quick ones for me one product and one maybe on the guidance here. On the product side Omar you know the robot at the Analyst Day this is new information to this, there had been some concerns maybe this could get pushed out. I'm just curious on is this now the preview of the robot, does that mean we could see a launch of the robot end of the year, some really nice Mazor X number so is that sort of a preclude to what we could see on the surgical robotics side in terms of RAM? And then on the guidance front Karen you mentioned tax headwinds, are the tax regulations finalized and if they are finalized when we think about fiscal 2021 are there any tax planning new structures that you could put in place to offset some of this as we look forward for 2021? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Okay, let me start on the robot and I will let Bob also comment on it. First of all you'll see the actual robots when we invite you, that is the product that we intend to commercialize. And I think our commitment for an FY 2020 launch is delayed [ph] as I mentioned in the commentary. But let me just say a little bit about the comparison of the Mazor X, as you know Mazor X is a different robot. But this methodology of combining our high value consumables which in the Mazor case are actually are tools as well as the spinal implants.  In commercial packaging with the capital equipment is a big differentiator for Medtronic and I can tell you that Bob's team is all over this looking at the experiences that we are getting with the Mazor X launch and will translate them. And this is not just the commercial framework, it's how we structure the sales force with the training and whole variety of other areas. So, I don\u2019t know, Bob do you want to add anything. Bob White : No, perfect Omar. Vijay, again thanks for the question. We are excited about where we are at with the program. We look forward to learn a lot more this fall when we hold the Analyst Day for you. For obvious reasons we're not going to go into the details of our global launch, and which countries and when. But consistent with Omar said, and consistent with what we said in the past we are preparing for an FY 2020 launch. Karen L. Parkhill: And Vijay in terms of the guidance on the tax headwinds the final regulations are not yet out so it is not final. We will obviously be focused on optimizing our tax rate over time and we've been working on that already. And so you've seen our guide in taxes move from a range of 16.7 to the lower end of that range 16 to 16.5. And of course once the regulations are final we will be focused on continuing to optimize where we can. In terms of FY 2021 our hope is that we can improve from there but we'll see. And if you just think about the guidance that we've given with the tax rate headwind, tax is about $0.20 a headwind on our year. We've offset some of that with the debt offering that we did, call it about $0.08 and we've got the $0.10 headwind on FX. So when you look at all of that together, if you look at our adjusted EPS growth it would be about 8% to 9%. Vijay Kumar : Thank you guys. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Vijay. Next question please Carol. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Great and again congrats. Either maybe for Karen or Omar if you could just talk about some of the product launches into fiscal 2020 and then fiscal 2021, did that give you confidence in accelerating growth throughout the course of this year and also I think it's great to hear accelerating growth in fiscal 2021 as we sit here over a year out from that. What are the products that gives you confidence? Omar Ishrak : Well there's a whole series of them and I'll go through them because they're all contributing and they're all exciting. First the low risk indication on the TAVR plus they have a little pro launch which gives you a launch of [indiscernible] sheets, that's in FY 2020. Together with that the LINQ 2 which we're really excited about with more accuracy, with more physiological parameters as well as Bluetooth connectivity. That sensitivity like straight up in FY 2020. And then in RTG you have the recurrent RF ablation system in the [indiscernible] MRI. I mean these are continuous innovation products that we think will make a difference and then back to CVG actually the Micra AV which will have an October submission and we expect sometime late in the year sales to start, will also have a carryover into FY 2021 on a strong basis.  And then last but not the least diabetes which we expect the 780 to launch towards the end of the year as well as the non-adjective [ph] labeling which will allow us greater market access and that will happen much sooner in the year. So, those are things that we can talk about like right now in FY 2020 and all of these will in many ways carry on into FY 2021. But there are specific ones and I will repeat the Micra AV because that'll have a full year benefit and that's a big disruptive program for FY 2021. But also the DiamondTemp RF ablation catheter that comes out of CVG and then RTG has all series of products. You know the DBS percept product from neuro modulation which is the first product of sensing that will be launched in FY 2021.  In addition to that in terms of health the interest in Micra which we will launch again early in FY 2021 maybe towards the end of FY 2020. And the diabetes will have continued roll out of the 780G which will have significant benefits which are mentioned in the commentary. And again RTG the soft tissue robotics which I just talked about will launch in FY20 but the full benefit of that we will start to see in FY 2021. So that's a lot of products and I'm telling you I didn't even mention all of them. There are some in staplers and other areas in neurovascular, and so there is a whole series of products that continue our momentum in CRHF. So, we're pretty excited and the pipeline here is solid. These are solid products, many of them very close to launching and others close to approval. So we're really excited about this. Karen L. Parkhill: And Robbie our pipeline is the most exciting but I would just remind you too that particularly in CVG we have some anniversary of some headwinds that will help us with the growth acceleration as well. We had the accounting change in our services and solutions business in Q2 which is one anniversary. We'll anniversary the loss of our MCS share loss in Q3 and then we'll have a partial anniversary of the drug coated balloon issue in Q4. Robbie Marcus : That's really helpful. And maybe Karen just a follow-up for you, appreciate all the commentary on the operating margin progression through the year. Is there any help you can give us on maybe gross margin versus operating margin and how currency might flow through that line item? Thanks. Karen L. Parkhill: Thanks for the question. On gross margin, the gross margin as you know can be impacted by our product mix. And so you haven't seen at least in FY 2019 expansion in gross margin. We've driven the expansion in operating margin and SG&A. While our enterprise excellence program is designed to offset the pressure that we have in pricing and mix there could be some years where we see expansion in gross margin but I wouldn't count on a lot there. In terms of FX we do have an FX headwind next year and that should show up some in the gross margin line. Ryan Weispfenning : Great, thank you Robbie. Can we go to the next question please Carol. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you for taking the question, can you hear me okay. Omar Ishrak : Yes we can, go ahead Joanne. Joanne Wuensch : Wonderful, I have two questions, the spinal cord stimulation market could you please give us an update on your view of that, I think you mentioned that you believe that Medtronic grew faster than the market in the quarter? And then my second question has to do with the paclitaxel panel that's upcoming, what do you think we should expect out of that? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Okay, thanks Joanne. I will let Geoff take the spinal cord question and then over to Mike. Geoffrey S. Martha: Yeah, so Joanne, how are you doing. On the spinal cord stimulation market it is a little bit down, flash to even down last quarter. But we did -- and Intellis is performing strong relative to the competitors. We are getting great feedback on the battery, the recharge speed, and how long the charge lasts, and the outcomes we're getting from the overall workflow which will be published in the Vectors [ph] trial and the Vector study. So we're getting a great feedback and we've picked up by our estimates about two points a share year-over-year and we're back to the number one share position which is first time in two and half years. So we're feeling good. Now the overall market like I said I wish it were growing faster. It has slowed and we have a couple thoughts on that. I mean one is that we see a lot of technology that's been -- we are on the back-end I would say of a nice wave of technology, innovation, and clinical indication expansion and we are in the back end of that. And then there are -- I wouldn't say there's new payer policies out there but there is increased payer scrutiny that we're seeing really primarily driven by the performance of our competitors devices that is as far as the market. Michael J. Coyle: And then on the question of the paclitaxel, obviously we are looking forward to that opportunity to broaden the discussion of the data that's available on paclitaxel product. Obviously we have full visibility to our own data and are very confident in the performance of our admiral product because we have over 1800 patients worth of data that has been carefully followed. So from my perspective the discussion to date has really focused on the three PMA submissions from Medtronic -- and I think there's a much broader set of data to be looked at in all cases it is more favorable from our perspective. First, there's additional follow up that capture patients who wants to follow up in the data that we have been doing and it's certainly been helpful to the overall numbers for the submissions on the PMA data which will be presented at the session.  In addition we have other data sets, the Japan randomized controlled study of 100 patients that basically not only showed no statistical difference in death rates between PCP and balloons but also showed a numerical higher rate in the PTA arm. And then we'll also be submitting data from the impact deep study which is in the critical and ischemia group which is a study that was sized very similar to the FFA study at the FDA referenced 358 patients and followed after five years. And in fact there we saw a higher death rate associated with the PTA arm then the DCB arm is five years. So these additional data sets we think will be helpful. They are also data sets that we would expect to see from patient net analysis that they are doing as well as we think there will be interesting data from claims analysis that should be helpful. Of course we don't have visibility to all of the other company's data. So we'll only see those when we get to the actual panel itself but everything we have seen has us even more comfortable than we were in the beginning in terms of the safety of these products and they are profoundly efficacious for limiting reinterventions in the patient group.  So we go into the meetings, we believe the data is very strong but it's important to understand that no studies have been sized to answer the question of mortality in this patient group and so it's going to be important to us that we look at the risk benefit of these datasets and as I said everything we've seen from our own data sets which are the largest in the industry make us very confident. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much and good quarter. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you Joanne. Next question please Carol. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Please go ahead. Matthew Taylor : Thank you for taking the questions. I just had one follow up on the paclitaxel question, I wanted to understand if you had a view on PCR statement that came out this week, it seems relatively favorable. If you could talk about how much of a headwind is baked into your guidance or maybe if things go well in June, how much of that you think could come back? Omar Ishrak : So, we were pleased to see the PCR statement, it certainly was a more encouraging or let's say softer statement than FDA had made basically pointing out the limitations as a matter of analysis data that has been shown. And reinforcing the efficacious nature of these products in terms of improving patient outcomes. So, they were clearly more balanced in their view than we have seen in the FDA discussions. Now obviously we'll see more data coming in and we'll have to weigh that. In terms of how we have provided guidance we're basically assuming that what FDA has stated is going to remain for the entire balance of the year and obviously we've seen how the market has reacted to that and so we just extrapolated that out through the rest of the year. So if FDA were to become more favorable in their commentary obviously that could have improve outcomes. But right now our guidance would assume there will be no change coming out of it. Matthew Taylor : Thank you. And then just wanted to ask one question on neuro. So, the neurovascular growth is very strong, could you talk about some of the components of that and whether you're seeing a stronger market there, are there any product launches that help you this quarter? Michael J. Coyle: Sure, first of all in neurovascular we have -- Medtronic we have a broad portfolio playing in every segment and that is our strategy and we're in number one positions in both ischemic and overall hemorrhagic. And we've recently refreshed that entire portfolio. Nobody else can say this but it's a very strong market, we're very well positioned across every segment. Now what's driving our growth in the near term is first of all entering the aspiration market, we have already launched the 068 and now the 071. Riptide systems are catheters and we've got, we're getting really, really positive feedback on both. The 068 started out a little slow because we had to make some adjustments to. We had soft launch, made some adjustments to the product and now it's picking up. The 071 hit the ground running, we're getting great feedback, and we estimate that we're somewhere around 15% of this market already, well ahead of our plans in the aspiration segment, well ahead of our plans. We see ourselves getting to 25% by the end of the fiscal year and we think we will eventually get to 50% of this aspiration market. And on top of that we just launched our next gen stent retriever to maintain and extend our lead in that segment. So those are some of the things that are driving it. And I think the other big drivers is the global nature. We're just growing very fast in China and so the fact that we're global is also helping especially in China. So it is a global and broad refresh product portfolio. Matthew Taylor : Thank you, great color, thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Matt, next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Barclays. Please go ahead. Kristen Stewart : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to just talk a little bit just about the free cash flow. You guys did a great job of really improving the metrics there. How should we just think about the deployment of capital, I know in the prepared remarks you talked about the commitment to at least 50% to shareholders but how should we just think about more on the M&A side, I think you mentioned tuck ins but should we expect an increase in the rate of maybe acquisitions going forward and more focus on products and really leveraging the portfolio or just how should we think about that going forward? Omar Ishrak : I think Kristen you're sort of on the right track there. Yes, we have a lot of fire power here and we're building it and we intend to use it in M&A and focus on M&A indeed isn\u2019t tuckins that accelerates our growth. And examples of things that we've already done expect more of the same. We just said the title [ph] is fine acquisition with Epix Therapeutics earlier in the year with Nutrino Health which is a great bug into diabetes by far with the nutritional database and you will see that, that works through into our next generation pumps. And then the Mazor X obviously which is -- I congratulate Geoff on that one because that's a great acquisition and what it is really pulling through in spine. So, those are examples and they're not all exactly that small either and we expect more of that. Now we will always be disciplined about this. We will look at the returns that we get and it has to be above our cost of capital. We look at the strategic fit and we look at the earnings impact and we look at those three things in a balanced manner as well as our team's ability to execute and put all that together and that's the strategy that we have for M&A and we've got tremendous firepower and you will see us accelerate that process as much is available. Kristen Stewart : Okay, so it sounds like kind of taking the M&A focus and driving more depth across the businesses versus going broader, you feel like you're in all those spots that you are and need to be? Omar Ishrak : Yeah, that is correct. They are sticking out there that helps the growth of our current business. Kristen Stewart : Okay, thanks very much. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Kristin. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. One high level question for Omar, one product related question for Geoff. So Omar it feels like there's been a little bit of a shift in the regulatory environment towards more post market action from FDA. Do you agree with that, has anything changed on the premarket approval side, and what are the implications for Medtronic? And second for Jeff, there's a new competitor coming out in sacral neuro modulation space potentially second half of this calendar year. So what's your plan for protecting your position in that market and just remind us of the timeline for your next generation smaller rechargeable device, I think I heard earlier fiscal 2021? Thanks for taking the questions guys. Omar Ishrak : Okay, you know first of all the FDA question. Look The FDA's fundamental mission is to protect the safety of the American public and they do an excellent job in fulfilling that mission. And I think as more data becomes available they're using it wisely to make sure that their post market studies and that the approval process has in it enough of the safety profile and we are completely supportive of that. They're working closely with the industry in making sure that approval process are accelerated the right way but not compromising safety at any time. So we are pretty supportive of the moves that they're making. And we don't really see any major changes to the device approval framework that it has in place. I think that's about it. Geoff, you want to talk about sacral nerve. Geoffrey S. Martha: Sure, hey Larry. So good question. I think first and foremost regarding our new product that come into market we expect it to launch in the beginning of FY 2021 and it is going to be this is a rechargeable device with really strong MR labeling and about a 3cc device. So, with our overdrive battery technology on this which we've proven with Intellis and pain stim it's just superior. And so between the size and the overdrive technology we think this is a winner. The product that a competitor is launching here in the near-term will also be a rechargeable device but I think it's 5.5cc. So I think we compare it very well and the gap between when they launch, we expect them to launch. We don't know -- we don't really know, we don't know how the FDA is going to treat things like cyber security and things like that. So we really don't know when they're going to launch but conservatively for us we expect a three to four quarter gap there. And look Larry, I can say this, this isn't the first time that we have faced at RTG a new competitor coming into our markets that we've pioneered and we maintain a high share. And I'd like to think and matter of fact I'm confident we've learned from these experiences which have been painful especially like pain. When you go back to think about pain stim we have learned, we have built these lessons learnt into our commercial playbook. We changed our commercial leadership across RTG and all I can say is we are ready. And I don\u2019t know what else to say we're ready for this. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you guys, thanks for taking the questions. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Larry, next question please Carol. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Matthew Miksic : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So I thought maybe just a couple of quick pipeline type questions if you could expand on your thoughts around a few things. Just one on uninterrupted any update on the transeptal delivery system pathway forward on that and thoughts on left atrial appendage closure which is something that you ought to be and I'm sure you plan to be exposed to? And then the second just kind of general topic, we see often in these meetings a lot of activity, clinical evidence, interest around innovation kind of rebounding for both hypertension and arrhythmias and just if you could update us on your intermediate or long term strategy for returning simplicity to commercial products, appreciate your thoughts? Michael J. Coyle: So I'll take those questions, uninterrupted we do expect in the fiscal year to do our first transeptal [ph] version of it. So that work is progressing and we're confident we're going to find a path forward to just as we did in the TAVR world to start with the valve that was critical [ph] but then move up to transeptal delivery system. On that appendage closure we do not currently have a product in development that we very -- follow developments in this space very carefully. We do have a lot of competency in our structural parts business that's applicable to this space. But we also would want to have a superior product before entering into that type of market. So we have a list of designs that we're interested in but we have no announcement to make today on that topic. And renal derivation is actually progressing as we discuss. We expect to have the pivotal trial result presentations next spring which will be sort of key to the FDA approval cycle.  But as you pointed out there's a lot of clinical evidence being generated around this topic that has been presented both at -- PCR meeting here the week as well as at the HRS meeting two weeks ago. In support of both of those clinical trials is both very supportive of the technology. And the ones on atrial fibrillation were particularly interesting. We sponsored one that was presented to both clinical trials here this week at PCR. It basically showed a 60% reduction in patients who develop atrial fibrillation in a highly selective group of patients who had hypertension and were randomized to renal renovation. So the data continues to be very encouraging but obviously given the events of the [indiscernible] study results it will be very important that we have highly controlled data to show the efficacy of this product and we're very confident based on the pilot studies that we have already published on and the trial we are executing with FDA that when we get to next spring we're going to have some very good efficacy and safety data to discuss. So, we are excited about that market. Matthew Miksic : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to ask Mike just about curriculum in heart failure and the road to recovery there is about half of the revenue pie for CVG. And maybe you could just focus on the anchors, high voltage and LVADs whether we just had to wait for anniversaries or is there anything incremental you can share in terms of returning those businesses either to flatter or back to growth and then just to add on follow-up at each rest you had some really interesting data on some pipeline products post field ablation and the extra vascular ICV and just any incremental thoughts there in terms of the signal that those data sets provided and your outlook for those two platforms? Thanks a lot. Michael J. Coyle: True, starting with the portfolio of product lines. Actually on the CRT side we have I think some very exciting product development activities in addition to some easing headwinds and obviously the biggest challenge we've had in CRT has been we've significantly extended the battery life of these products. We have run into that replacement headwind and as you know in the CRT space for high power half the market is replacements. We still have a few quarters to go in terms of those headwinds being significant but as we head into next year into FY 2021 we actually see that go neutral and that will really help us in terms of just the overall growth profile of the business.  But beyond that at HRS we launched the first active fixation Quadripolar [ph] lead for use in CRT for both CRTD and CRTP which physicians seemed very excited about and we have our new Galaxy platform, our next generation of ICD's releasing in the third quarter which basically will both add Bluetooth connectivity to the product but also some very important pacing features that both will enhance the performance of our products from atrial fibrillation perspective as well as from heart failure rehospitalization rate. So those will be I think really helpful in terms of just getting our CRTD and CRTP product lines accelerating from where they have been and then obviously we'll get the headwind going away as we head into FY 2021.  On the LVAD side obviously we saw a fairly significant reduction in market share that took place at the middle of the year as a result of competitive product launches. We are going back on the offensive with our lateral data to basically take advantage of the smaller size of the HVAD system to basically show lower complication rates in surgical implants of the thoracotomy approach to the placement of the device. And we also think the data sets around the stroke are going to be in our favor as we get further evidence of the performance of these products. And so obviously the anniversary in the second half of next year is going to be very helpful to our overall growth rate but then obviously we're hoping to take sequential market share as we take advantage of the performances of the product. And then in terms of your question around the PSA and EVICD [ph], we're very excited about both of those programs. We would expect to basically go into pivotal studies with the EVICD this year which obviously has the benefits over existing sub cue products of actually allowing antitachy pacing and post op pacing to be done with the products. So, that we think will provide a big advantage. It's also got a footprint that looks like a standard ICD as opposed to much larger device you see in the sub cue application. And so we believe that will carry with it benefits at implant including potentially lower infection rates. And then PSA is probably the most exciting thing that we see in the holy atrial fibrillation ablation space. This allows us to actually do ablation without thermal energy either heating or cooling by essentially disrupting the miosites directly which has the potential to really address all of the major complications associated with atrial fibrillation or ablation of atrial fibrillation. So that coupled with our entry into the focal ablation segment with the Epix device, the DiamondTemp device really now significantly broadens our portfolio from what we have traditionally been cryo company focused on PAF ablation. So really nice work by the team to basically expand our product offerings. Both EVICD and PSA of course are beyond the FY 2020 window but we will speak to those I'm sure at the Analyst Meeting next year to give you more guidance as to when we expect them to be major revenue drivers for us. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Josh. We'll take one more question please Carol. Operator : Our next question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Good morning guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. A few questions on China. China is obviously a very important market for you guys. It looks like revenues in China slowed in the quarter to 13% from 16% last quarter. How are the tariffs impacting that business, what growth are you embedded within the 2020 guidance and how should we think about the doubling of tariffs and how that impacts your growth in that market? Omar Ishrak : Well, first look we're really excited about China and that is an important market like you point out and it will be the biggest health care market just by the size of the population and opportunity. So it's a market we intend to be present in. And look we are quite pleased with our performance. I mean, the business certainly grew sequentially quarter-over-quarter and it continues to grow and we expect pretty reliable double-digit growth from China on a very consistent basis and we're getting that. And so it is a market that we are committed to, one that we see is a big growth driver for us. The tariffs do pose somewhat of a headwind in terms of our margins but it's one that we will cover and we will offset. We faced some of that in FY 2019 which we successfully managed to offset and we don't expect a major increase in FY 2020 but there may be some towards the back half of the year which we will manage. But more importantly the need for our products in the Chinese population is very clear. So the demands from both the doctors and the patients and we will follow through with that. We have an outstanding team there with scale, with critical mass, presence in the big cities as well as the outlier regions in private hospitals as well as the government hospitals. And all of those are growth drivers for us across the board and in all our businesses. So make no mistake China is a big priority for us that we're all focused on and we're very confident that it will be a continued consistent growth driver in the double-digits for Medtronics. Pito Chickering : Okay, and one follow up, this is a very big quarter on Mazor, because the pipeline looks for new robot sales in 2020 and how does this spike similar market share and households we had robot installed for over a year changed. Michael J. Coyle: Can you repeat the second part of that question, the first part was... Pito Chickering : Leave it. For hospitals where the robot has been for over one year how would you spike assumable if market share changed within that year? Michael J. Coyle: Well, I will start with that question. I mean we are definitely seeing where we have robots installed and to your point up and running and we've trained the physicians and the surgical teams and our reps. We're clearly seeing faster growth and greater market share versus accounts that we don't have a robot. And that same can be said to maybe a slightly lesser degree when we have navigation in the OR without the robot. So basically we have enabling technology, our value proposition is better and we're seeing faster growth and better market share. We're seeing it quite a bit different and especially in competitive accounts. And the difference I'd say from a competitive standpoint between just having nav in OR versus having nav arm and the robot is the amount of competitive accounts that we're getting into. Customers that are big spine centers where we were zero and our competitors had these accounts very well covered. They're calling us and we're getting in there and not only getting robotic share but we're getting non-robotic cases. So, it is quite dramatic and so we're very happy with it. It's the overall value proposition of all of this technology working together. And the path to better outcomes for patients and better financial outcomes for the hospital and we're building evidence around both of those. So in terms of the outlook going forward we feel bullish. So far it's much better than our deal model, Mazor sales and for a variety of reasons. And we feel that we continued strong double digit growth in this area based on the existing -- we just launched the Mazor X edition with navigation, we just launched that. And so that still has a lot of runway but we have a series of continuous innovation on top of that, things like so we can navigate with the robot more of our enabling technology like more of our mileage platform drills and such. And then we will be which I don\u2019t want to talk about for competitive reasons we will be adding other features that I think are even more differentiated that will improve basically the spine procedures. Take time out of these spine procedures and also drive more consistent reliable outcomes. So we feel very strong and that's what's generating excitement around the robot is the improvement in outcomes. Pito Chickering : Great, thanks so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Pito, Omar do you want to\u2026 Omar Ishrak : Yeah let me just close out, thanks to all of you for your questions. And on behalf of our entire management team thank you for your continued support and your interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q1 earnings call which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, Aug 20th and with that thank you again very much.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s fiscal year 2020 first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on July 26, 2019. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. During today\u2019s earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. For this call, unless we say otherwise, rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis, which compares to the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 after adjusting for foreign currency. References to organic revenue growth exclude the impact of material acquisitions and currency. Reconciliations of these and all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning we reported solid quarterly results and we are off to a good start to the fiscal year. Despite tough comparisons, we delivered revenue growth, operating margin and EPS all ahead of Street expectations. Q1 revenue grew 3.5% constant currency with outperformances in CVG, MITG and RTG, while diabetes matched our expectations. This reflects the success in the market of our innovation and the benefit of our business and geographic diversification. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points, including currency and 70 basis points, constant currency, as we continue to see the benefits of our enterprise excellence initiatives particularly on the SG&A line. On the bottom line, we grew diluted EPS 7.7% or 9.4% at constant currency, despite a 230-basis point headwind on EPS growth from the increase in our non-GAAP nominal tax rate. Let\u2019s discuss some of the more important drivers of our performance, starting with our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which delivered another strong quarter and surpassed our expectations, growing 4.8%. Through diversifying our sterilization supply network, we overcame the challenges related to a suppliers sterilization facility shutdown in February, returning to full sterilization capacity during the quarter. In Surgical Innovations, Advanced Stapling grew mid-single digits and Advanced Energy, high single digits. This was driven by new innovations in our Tri-Staple and LigaSure franchises, including our new EEA circular stapler with Tri-Staple technology and our Ligasure Exact dissector. Respiratory GI and renal also had a strong quarter, led by double-digit growth in GI Solutions and mid-single-digit growth in respiratory and patient monitoring. In CVG, we grew 1.4%, which was ahead of our expectations. CVG\u2019s growth continues to be tempered by challenges in drug-coated balloons, LVADs as well as CRM replacement devices given the longer life batteries we launched several years ago. Regarding DCBs, we are encouraged by our better than expected performance, but there are case volume increased following the FDA panel in June. We were also encouraged by the path forward outlined by the FDA in their letter to physicians earlier this month. In CRHF our pacing business is strong, growing 5% as our disruptive innovation in the micro single chamber transcatheter pacing system is taking share and expanding the market. Our U.S. single chamber pacemaker share is now over 65% with our revenue share over 80%. In TAVR, we saw both the market and our growth accelerate to the mid-teens in Q1 on the back of the low risk, data presentations at ACC. CMS published the final TAVR NCD memo in June and we expect this will result in approximately 200 new TAVR centers in the US. We\u2019re already in active negotiations with about half of these centers, which are ready to start as we aim to become their preferred partner in TAVR devices. In CVG, it is also worth noting that double-digit growth contributions from our Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft or VenaSeal Closure System and also our TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope, which continue to accelerate both rapid data presentation at ACC. In addition, both our Reveal LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor and Arctic front cryoablation products grew in the high single digits. In diabetes, we grew 5.4% and this was despite our U.S. business declining mid-single digits because of competitive challenges and the difficult comparisons versus the prior year when our U.S. business grew 33%. Our International business, which represents approximately half of our diabetes revenue grew 20%, The MiniMed 670G, which drove strong growth in the U.S. last year, is now experiencing that same strong consumer demand internationally as we launch into new markets. We now have approximately 200,000 people using the 670G system globally. In addition, we experienced strong adoption of the Guardian Connect Smart CGM system, which grew in the high 80s. In RTG, we had another strong quarter, growing 4.6% as we successfully offset declines in our pain therapies business. Our brain business continues to deliver exceptional results, growing 11.4% with strength in both neurovascular and neurosurgery. In neurovascular, we grew in the mid-teens, our market leading share improving through the strong adoption of our recently launched Solitaire X stent retriever as well as our Riptide aspiration system and React catheters. In neurosurgery, our capital equipment sales continue to be robust. This is led by our Mazor X Stealth navigated robotic system, which not only is meaningfully outpacing the competition, but is also resulting in strong pull-through of our other market leading and differentiated capital equipment. Sales of our StealthStation navigation system grew over 20% this quarter and our O-arm surgical imaging system grew close to 30%. In Q1, our organic spine revenue growth was the highest in nine quarters. In addition, when you combine our Spine division sales with the sales of our capital equipment from our brain therapies division used in spine surgery. Our spine division grew 4.7% with our U.S. Spine business growing at 6%. This is how our competitors report and it represents a strong indication that our strategy of offering our enabling capital equipment with our spine implants is working, as we are growing well above the spine market growth. Now turning to emerging markets, which represents 16% of our revenue, we continue to drive strong growth in these markets as we optimize the distribution channel and in some markets localize R&D and manufacturing. In Q1 we grew, emerging markets 12% with strength coming from markets around the globe. China grew 11%, Eastern Europe 23% including 28% growth in Russia, and the Middle East and Africa grew 15%. In addition, South Asia grew 13%, Southeast Asia 12% and Latin America grew 9%. Our strategy of emerging market diversification around the world is working as evidenced by our consistent delivery of double-digit growth every quarter, overcoming economic cycles over the years in the different countries. As a result of this quarter\u2019s outperformance and confidence in our outlook, we raised EPS guidance this morning, Q1 was clearly a good quarter, despite several headwinds and otherwise tough comparisons. As we look forward, we\u2019re even more excited about what lies ahead. As we expect the investments we\u2019ve made in our pipeline to begin to pay-off for the multiple pipeline catalysts, accelerating revenue growth and value creation for our shareholders. In CVG, upcoming launches include TAVR low risk indication, which we just received last week, our next generation Evolut PRO plus, TAVR valve and our DCB AV fistula indication. CVG also had several launches coming up in CRHF including the Reveal LINQ 2.0 and suitable cardiac monitor, the Diamond Temp ablation system in Europe and our Micra AV pacemaker. In MITG, we\u2019re excited to host Analysts and Hartford next month, at one of the world\u2019s leading robotic centers, where the analysts will experience a robotic assistant surgical procedure that is part of our development and clinical testing process using our soft tissue robotic system. In RTG, we\u2019re launching the Midas Rex MR8 drill platform this quarter and continue to advance our Pelvic Health pipeline having started the regulatory approval process for InterStim II with MRI, recharge free system and our InterStim Micro with MRI, which is 3cc in volume and rechargeable. We expect to launch both of these products next spring. In addition, we have a next generation products In neurovascular and spinal cord stimulation, all of which are launching or preparing to launch in the next couple of quarters. In diabetes, we submitted our non-injunctive labeling application to the FDA and we are preparing for the launch of the MiniMed 780G, our advanced hybrid closed loop system with Bluetooth connectivity in the second half of this fiscal year. We\u2019re also making good progress on our pivotal trial for ZEUS. Our next generation iCGM Sensor that will reduce finger sticks by 95%. There of course are several more product launches that we are preparing for across the company. I won\u2019t cover them all today. But I will say that we were making great progress across the portfolio and we keep you updated as we progress through this fiscal year, and I\u2019ll leave you with what I noted last quarter that we expect our growth rate to accelerate over the course of FY \u201820, with the second half going faster than the first, as we anniversary recent headwinds and bring multiple new products to market over the next several quarters. Moreover, we expect our top line momentum to build in FY \u201821 with each of our four groups having the potential to accelerate revenue growth next fiscal year, as we get the increasing benefit of the FY \u201820 product launches as well as the benefits from the products, slated to launch in FY \u201821. Let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our first quarter financials. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you. As Omar mentioned, we delivered first quarter revenue growth of 3.5% and adjusted EPS was $1.26, growing 7.7%, while we came in $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance, it\u2019s worth noting that $0.02 resulted from better than expected FX, which at current rates we\u2019ll give back over the balance of the year. The other $0.06 was operational outperformance including better-than-expected revenue and operating margin expansion and a modest benefit from tax. Our adjusted operating margin was 28.2% reflecting improvement of 90 basis points with currency or 70 basis points constant currency. We delivered a very strong improvement in SG&A, as we continue to implement and drive efficiencies and improvements across the company under our enterprise excellence program. In addition, we are seeing the benefits of the recent inclusion of operating margin as a component of our annual incentive plans across our groups and regions, which is driving increased focus on this important metric across the organization. In the first quarter, we successfully executed a \u20ac5 billion debt offering and use the proceeds to reduce U.S. dollar denominated debt. This followed a similar \u20ac7 billion transaction we executed in the fourth quarter. The combined \u20ac12 billion issuances carry a weighted average coupon of less than 1%. The result of the combined fourth and first quarter transactions is an annualized reduction to our net interest expense of over $300 million, a savings that will benefit Medtronic for years to come. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 15.1% lower than expected due to the increased benefits associated with the finalization of taxes owed on certain returns and changes in operational results by jurisdiction. Generating strong free cash flow remains a priority across the company. First quarter free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We continue to target an 80% conversion rate above our peer average over our long-range plan. We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment, balancing investment in R&D and tuck-in acquisitions with returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and net share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned over $800 million or 70% of the cash we generated, resulting in a total shareholder payout of 50% on adjusted net earnings. We also increased our dividend by 8% in June, making this our 42nd consecutive year, delivering a dividend increase. In fact, our dividend has grown by 77% over the past five years. Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to update our annual revenue growth and EPS guidance. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect organic revenue growth to be approximately 4%, while the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a negative impact on full year revenue growth of approximately 80 to 120 basis points. Looking at annual organic growth by group, we now expect CVG to grow 2.5%, a 50 basis point increase from our prior expectation of 2% plus or minus. For RTG, we continue to expect growth of 4% to 4.5%; and for diabetes, we are comfortable at the lower end of our 6% to 8% range. Finally for MITG, we now expect growth of 5%, an increase versus our prior expectation of 4.5% to 5%. We expect our second quarter organic revenue growth to look similar to the first quarter with currency having a negative impact of 70 to 130 basis points at recent rates. By group, we expect organic growth in CVG and RTG to look similar to the first quarter for diabetes to grow low single digits as we await new product launches and for MITG growth to accelerate to 5.5% to 5.75% driven by new products. And as I noted last quarter, we continue to expect our total company organic revenue growth to accelerate north of 4% in the second half of the fiscal year. Turning to margins, we continue to expect operating margin expansion in the full fiscal year of approximately 40 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by our enterprise excellence initiatives. For the second quarter, we would expect a more modest improvement in operating margin, offset by a slight currency headwind, as we invest ahead of multiple new product launches. Given our recent euro debt offerings that I mentioned earlier, we expect our non-GAAP interest expense to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. In addition, we continue to expect our adjusted nominal tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% per quarter for the remainder of the year, which when combined with our Q1 non-recurring benefit would imply an annual range of 15.8% to 16.2%. We remain focused on optimizing our underlying operating tax rate over time, as U.S. tax reform regulations are finalized. With respect to earnings, we are increasing our fiscal year \u201820 EPS guidance to a range of $5.54 to $5.60, a $0.10 raise from the prior range of $5.44 to $5.50. This includes the negative $0.10 impact of currency at recent rates, with a slightly worth impact over the balance of the year offsetting a better than expected benefit in the first quarter. For the second quarter we expect EPS of $1.27 to $1.29, including a $0.02 currency headwind at recent rates. Now, I will return the call back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Karen and let\u2019s now move on to Q&A. In addition to Karen, our four group presidents Mike Coyle, Bob White, Geoff Martha and Hooman Hakami, are also here to answer your questions. We want to try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question and if necessary, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins : Great, thank you and good morning. Just wanted to first say congrats on a really strong quarter and see if I could get some commentary about two product areas. First on diabetes, noted that you were nicely in line this first quarter, but if switched the guidance to the low end of the range just curious if you can talk about that a little bit? And then the other part of question I had was just on the robotic focused Analyst Day for September 24, really looking forward to that day and getting all the details. But I was just wondering if in front of the day you would be willing to give us at least a little directional sense for just launch timelines in the U.S., is that more than a year away within a year? Thank you. Those are the only two questions I have. Omar Ishrak : I will let Hooman and Bob comment a little bit. First of all on the diabetes, I know we sort of tone down the numbers a little bit, but that doesn\u2019t remove our excitement regarding the upcoming launches here. The advanced hybrid closely with Bluetooth connectivity, in particular towards the end of the fiscal year is one that we are zeroing in on and the clinical trials and so on are in progress. We have had more competitive pressure than we\u2019d like in the U.S. in the first quarter. So taking that into account, we decided to be prudent about what our guidance should be. But let\u2019s not take anything away from the product launches that we\u2019re anticipating in the second half, those are on time and we will see what the result in, but we are pretty excited about them. I don\u2019t know Hooman if you want to add anything to that or? Hooman Hakami : Sure, Bob. Thanks for the question. Maybe first a little bit of color on the dynamics that drove Q1 and that I think also sort of drive the guidance. If you recall from ADA the quarter was pretty much in line with what we talked about at ADA. We anticipated strong o-U.S. growth check, we \u2013 in the U.S., we expected consistent consumables in CGM revenue from the installed base, check. We said that we expected to renew our patients coming out of warranty in line with historical rates. We were able to do that and then we said the most volatile thing was really the conversions in the U.S. of patients coming from MDI. And that also sort of factored in. We\u2019re able to balance all of that and deliver in Q1. Now as far as the rest of the year goes it\u2019s largely as Omar stated, it\u2019s a function of the pipeline, which remains on track versus what we discussed at ADA. Now in Q2, we did expect to get some reimbursement for 670 in Germany. And we were hoping that, that would be an incremental contributor to offset some of the U.S. pressure that was discussed. But we are now assuming, we don\u2019t get this and we will get it next quarter, so for all of the reasons mentioned. This is why we are maintaining the range what leaning towards the lower end of the range. Omar Ishrak : Bob? Bob White : Yes, sure. Bob thanks for the question regarding the robot, we are excited as Omar mentioned to heavy investment community experience a preclinical validation lab in Hartford next month. And the reason we are doing it there is certainly part of our pre-clinical testing and experience and it\u2019s actually, you get to see it in action versus just on a state. So it\u2019s really important event as we continue to gather preclinical data and experience on our system. And in addition, during the day, there will be panels with us Medtronic\u2019s executive management will have some expert surgeons there as well and I know that Ryan sent to save the date out recently \u2013 save the date out recently and the invite will be coming from Ryan over the next couple of weeks. But as respect to your question Bob, we\u2019ve not changed our commitment on our launch timelines to launch the product, again, you specifically asked about the US, but of course we\u2019re going to launch outside the U.S. in FY \u201820. This is a team that continues to hit its milestones. We\u2019re excited about the program and we look \u2013 we are looking forward to seeing you next month. Bob Hopkins : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Just two from me one for Karen and one for Geoff. Karen, Karen, just thinking about the guidance in the second quarter I think last quarter you suggested 4% growth for the second quarter, now you\u2019re sort of suggesting something closer to 3.5%. So is the relative change simply diabetes and you still need some momentum improvement frankly sequentially to get to that number and what drives that confidence? And then just for Geoff. Just on surgical robotics, I\u2019m sorry, on spinal robotics, you definitely saw a significant change in relative growth versus market sequentially. So things definitely improved in the Core Spine business. Just kind of \u2013 can you grow above market in Core Spine this year and if you could give us the Mazor or system placement number in the quarter that would be great? Thanks so much. Karen Parkhill : Yes, good morning, David. Thanks for the questions. In terms of 2Q excited about the growth acceleration that we intend to drive in the second half. In 2Q, we\u2019re seeing some U.S. softness in diabetes that we talked about and we\u2019re seeing some pain market issues, but beyond that, we are very excited about the acceleration that we\u2019re going to drive and it\u2019s just the first quarter. So we are working on delivering as we move through the year. Geoffrey Martha : Hey, Dave, it\u2019s Geoff. So regarding the Spine question, yes, we\u2019re definitely seeing strong momentum Mazor has been a huge addition to our Surgical Synergy strategy and it\u2019s help \u2013 it\u2019s having a pretty significant network effect. I\u2019ll call within RTG, one as you pointed out on the implant side and can we grow above the market. But we are expecting to grow above the market here. We think that the whole enabling technology and robotic strategy that\u2019s where the market is going, it\u2019s going to cause the market to consolidate around a few players and we intend to lead that and take share now and going forward. As for the other impact that by the way that the robotics \u2013 Mazor is having is on the rest of our capital equipment portfolio which it\u2019s not something I completely expected. I mean our still our standalone stealth for spine and neurosurgery as well as our O-arm both grow over 20%, O-arm actually grew close to 30%. These are the products that have been in the market for a while and I think this is the impact of having a larger capital sales force and a lot of excitement around these products. So \u2013 and as for the placement in a number of unit sales, I guess, I have been told that I mean maybe given too much information in the last few quarters on this topic. So I am pretty excited about it maybe, got a little, but I can just tell you at this point, we are doing really well. I think others we would that we are doing really well above our expectations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Robbie Marcus : Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a good quarter. Karen, maybe we could start with a question on the P&L. This is the first time SG&A has been down year-over-year since first quarter 2017 you mentioned the operational excellence program. What exactly is driving the declines and how sustainable are they? Karen Parkhill : Thanks for that question, Robbie. Yes, we were pleased with our SG&A performance, which clearly drove our operating margin expansion of 70 basis points on a constant currency basis. And on SG&A, we are very focused on driving enterprise excellence programs to drive further leverage and efficiency. We also introduced at the beginning of this year an incentive comp metric down into the organization on operating margin and I think that metric is also helping to drive good cost control well down into the organization. Robbie Marcus : Okay. And then on the guidance or the balance of the year, you had a nice beat on the top line in the first quarter, you have a number of product launches hitting towards the back end of the year. Can you help us just maybe with cadence for the balance of the year, how you\u2019re thinking about the 4%? How conservative is that number still given you only added first quarter here and some of the big product launches and how we should think about those impacts to the top line? I appreciate that. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Well thanks for that question too. So look, we just finished our first quarter and we had a strong first quarter. And we\u2019re really excited about the acceleration that we\u2019re going to drive in revenue growth throughout the year, particularly in the back half, that growth is really focused on strong product launches and the exact timing of approval and launch It\u2019s hard to predict, but we\u2019re excited about launching those in the back half that will drive the acceleration. At this stage that back half is going to have to be decent amount higher than we had in the first half to end the year at 4% and we\u2019re excited about that. Omar Ishrak : So let me just also emphasize, Robbie, look we laid the formula out, we had a good first quarter. The second quarter, we actually have the advantage of some of these comparisons being better in Services and Solutions in the LVAD and other areas. And so there is some growth there as well. In terms of product launches, everything that we said is still completely in line and they\u2019re coming through. We just got the lowest TAVR approval. That is something that we were expecting actually a little later, we got a little earlier, so all the other programs are completely in line. We\u2019re very excited about them. But it\u2019s only the first quarter, so we want to guide what we guided at the beginning of the year, but look there\u2019s no hesitation in our part about the quality of these launches, when they\u2019re coming out, how excited we are about them, so that there may be no sort of confusion about that at all, and just take it in the context of this just the first quarter. Robbie Marcus : Very clear, Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Robbie. Next question please, Regina. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Yes, no, I am on. Congrats on a really nice sprint here. Just two quick ones on the guidance here, Karen, if you step back to the early part of this year, a lot of confusion around tax regulations, EPS headwinds and I think you guys were very clear about LRP not changing, correct? With the guidance raise this morning, at the high-end, we\u2019re looking at 7% plus on the EPS. Did you say \u2013 can you walk us through what the implications is? Because is the LRP going up because the execution is coming in better for this year? And as a follow up, I think our tax rates we were expecting some clarification in June, July time frame. Any clarity on what the tax rates readout and implications for the medium term? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Thanks for the question, Vijay. Our long-range guidance on the bottom line is 8%-plus over the long range time frame and that has not changed and will not change. Yes, in terms of the new guidance on EPS, largely driven by the beat we had this quarter and our ability to lower our interest expense which helps to offset that tax rate increase. Our guide is above 7% on a constant currency basis on an actual basis for EPS on the high end. In terms of whether or not this year over the long range plan we\u2019ll get to the 8%, we\u2019ll see. But we\u2019re confident in our guidance right now. And on tax regs, certain regulations have been finalized. There are numerous regulations to still be finalized. We do anticipate all of the regulations to hopefully be final prior to the end of our fiscal year. We will continue to focus on opportunities to optimize our tax rate. And where the regs are final, we are beginning to take action to optimize. But I would say, it\u2019s very early and too early to tell what our tax rate will be on the long-term basis going forward. In the meantime, we expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in that range of 16% to 16.5%. We did have some favorability in the first quarter by some non-recurring items, and so that helps drive our year tax rate to what we guided to about 15.8% to 16.2%. Hope that\u2019s helpful. Vijay Kumar : Thanks, guys. Yes. Very helpful. Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Vijay. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. A couple of product specific questions. First, on Pain Stim, can you quantify the inventory destocking you saw there and where do you think that process will be played out in 2Q \u2013 or in 1Q or will continue to be a drag? Omar Ishrak : Go Geoff. Geoffrey Martha : Yes, sure. I am not going to quantify specifically. But yeah, we had a really strong Q4, first of all, and that contributed to some of this and the market slowdown also contributed to it. So I don\u2019t think the destocking will be a continued drag. The market slowdown is obviously, I think, caught the severity of it, it caught us and our competitors a little bit by surprise, and that to me is the bigger issue. Chris Pasquale : And then on the DCB front, can you just update us on the expectations for your franchise going forward? Do you think utilization has bottomed now post the physician communication? And if use is limited to high risk patients, what does that mean for the growth potential of the business going forward? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Mike, go ahead. Michael Coyle : So back in March when the original FDA notification went out where they basically were saying, for most patients the risk would outweigh the benefits, we saw a fairly significant contraction. It was about a 50% reduction in U.S. volumes versus what they had been before, and on a global basis, within the \u2013 in the low 40s. Obviously, as we came out of the panel meeting, there was a lot more data that was presented, updates on patient follow-up where we got to almost 95% follow up on our patient base, which improved the safety profile of the devices, and then some very significant incremental data was presented from claims based analysis and very large data sets that basically showed that \u2013 the second went away in these large numbers. And so we were very encouraged by what we viewed as incrementally constructive FDA notification here that basically said that for a certain high-risk patients who are at risk for reintervention, that, in fact, the benefits of DCB technology outweighed the risks. And so we have now seen instead of the reduction that we had indicated something more like a 40% US reduction, low 40s, and on a global basis, that\u2019s down into the low 30s reduction. So we think it\u2019s stabilized. It\u2019s actually improving since those data were put out. And we think as more data becomes available, this is going to shift from a discussion of class effect to basically individual performance of the individual products. I mean we are very encouraged by that because we have a very significant randomized controlled data sets in the U.S., FDA support for FFA for the Japan study we have our global registry data as well as some new data sets that are going to be released in other indications. So our AV fistula indication is going to be \u2013 the data is going to be presented at the upcoming CIRSE meeting next month and we are very encouraged that the more data that is coming out, it\u2019s basically focusing on the efficacy of these products and also showing that the signal that was a concern as more data becomes available is becoming less of a concern. And so we expect there to be an improvement, but obviously we need to see return to growth until we get to the second half of the fourth quarter. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Chris. Take the next question please, Regina. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Raj Denhoy : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on TAVR if I could. So you mentioned there\u2019s been a couple of developments recently about the low risk approval and the NCD. So I guess on those fronts, on the low risk approval, I\u2019m curious what your expectations are for that will do to market growth? And secondly, for the NCD, you did mention you\u2019re in negotiations with a number of the new centers now that are looking to come online. And I\u2019m just curious upon what basis those negotiations are going. Has there been any discussion of price or anything in terms of how those centers are choosing that they are going to with here in terms of their TAVR programs? Omar Ishrak : Mike? Michael Coyle : So we would estimate if you \u2013 by customer indication which we expect will be an area focus with additional data availability that the low-risk patient population basically expands the available market by about 50%. And so that, with the addition of the NCD where we expect to see approximately another 200 centers come online, it obviously is going to give an opportunity for an acceleration of growth from where it was, let\u2019s say, last quarter which was for us around 12% up into the mid-teens and maybe a little bit higher than that, and that basically is really being supported by these new indications for use. And in terms of the basis of negotiations with the NDT sites, they are really no different than what we have had with a pre-existing sites in terms of the compelling clinical evidence around these products basically makes any center that wants to be a full-service aortic valve center, they need to be able to do both surgery as well as transcatheter valves. And as a result, this is more about training and education and getting them up to speed on optimal techniques for use of these products, and that\u2019s exactly what we are focused on. Raj Denhoy : Great, thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Raj. Next question please, Regina. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning, everybody and very nice quarter. A number of new products that are launching over the next 12 to 18 months, can you please give us a highlight of which ones are you the most excited about? And also, on the same vein, you have got two major medical meetings coming up with NASS and TCT. What should we expect to see there, and will any of those new products be there? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Okay. I am going to take that. Thanks, Joanne. First, like you point out, there\u2019s a number of new products coming out and there\u2019s many, but I\u2019m going to go through a few of these that I think are the most exciting. First of all, a general surgery robotic system, which you\u2019ll see live and in person in September 24 and I promise you that will be an exciting and eventual event for you, so we\u2019re excited about that. Now beyond that, the micro AV, look, we\u2019ve got 80% share in the single-chamber market, covering only 15% of the pacemaker population, that\u2019s growing up to 55% of the population. And I\u2019m not going to pre to 80% share, but that\u2019s at least what I expect. So that\u2019s a product I\u2019m really excited about. The LINQ 2.0 which is a second-generation diagnostic device. It has got a 5-year battery life. The Evolut PRO plus which is now coming in the heels of the low rick TAVR approval. The diabetes 780G minimum, the MiniMed 780G, that\u2019s got Bluetooth connectivity, it\u2019s a hybrid advanced hybrid closed-loop system, it\u2019s a second-generation of the closed loop, based on our experience and the database that we have on patients already. The InterStim Micro which is rechargeable device 3cc in volume for Pelvic Health which we\u2019re expecting approval in the second half, the Diamond AF ablation catheter which has got temperature sensing, which is some unique technology which we launch in Europe in second half. And then there is the percept DBS System 2, which has sensing capability the first time in this kind of a system and a great platform for the first time closed-loop system in DBS. Now in addition to these launches, like you mentioned, some of these meetings in \u2013 we\u2019re expecting to sort of share some data as well. The US pivotal trial results for the impact AV fistula access program for dialysis patients, that\u2019s one we\u2019re going to share. The Symplicity renal denervation program, we expect some exciting results out of that and the data from that we share. The diamond AF ablation catheter I just mentioned that, that\u2019s a leapfrog technology because of temperature sensing like I mentioned. We launch that in Europe but will share data on that in the upcoming meetings here and then finally the diabetes system will also expect to complete enrollment of the patients for the next few weeks. Specifics to those two specific events, Mike, do you have any comments? Michael Coyle : Well, as it relates to TCT, that\u2019s a little bit sooner than some of these data sets are going to be available, so I think I would steer you more toward meetings later in the year and into early next year so we will \u2013 around the AHA time we\u2019ll be talking about the MARVEL 2 data, which is the Micra AV performance. And then as we get into next year as we look at the ACC, we would expect to be able to present the offmed components of the Symplicity Spyral study. And also, as Omar mentioned, between here and there, we will also have the impact Admiral ADF data. So there should be very meaningful data sets coming, but they\u2019re more going to be later in the year and into next year. Omar Ishrak : And then NASS? Michael Coyle : So NASS, we all claimed talk to you guys about a number of things. First, in core spine, we have a number of launches, probably the biggest of which this year is corpectomy device this T2 stratosphere. We\u2019ve got single position and then, of course, the type which we just closed. Integration is going very well. And we\u2019ll walk you through how that\u2019s going to impact our overall portfolio. But I\u2019d say think of Titan as a surface technology platform that can apply to our existing broad-based spine portfolio. We\u2019ll also talk more about Surgical Synergy and robotics, as I mentioned earlier, and how that rollout is going. And our road map for new features that we are going to be adding to the enabling technology specifically kind of all enabling technologies, specifically robotics because we do have a very specific road map that goes up over the next two weeks few years, all meant to basically drive procedural improvement both from a health economic standpoint and the clinical outcome standpoint. And then finally, Biologics, we have a General Manager we put in charge of our Biologics business about year and a half ago and he\u2019s really done a good job in investing not only in infuse, but our broader bio portfolio, which we can talk to you more about that which I think is kind of underrated right now. It\u2019s actually helping drive some of our growth. And then finally, one thing that\u2019s not NASS related and I think Omar ran out of breath before he got to, we did on Pain Stim, we did we have a new next-generation Telus device, which we haven\u2019t spoken about before, that we can talk about later in the year at NANS. So, this gets back to not NASS, but obviously the broader product launches we are excited about. We haven\u2019t really talked about this and so at the NANS this year we\u2019ll be talking about that as well as some new stem pattern work we\u2019ve been doing and then, of course, our 12-month vectors data will be talking about at NANS as well, because I think this paint stim market as super sensitive to innovation and then where the market a little bit of innovation law versus where we were in the past 18 months and I think it\u2019s going to be launches like this will get that market going again. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you so much. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Joanne. Next question please, Regina. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Kristen Stewart : Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a good quarter. Not surprised for Omar\u2019s ability to speak without stopping given he\u2019s climbed Kilimanjaro. So just want to just circle back on the product front, two kind of product categories I just want to dive a little bit deeper into. So, on the InterStim Micro side, you had mentioned that that\u2019s FY \u201820, and I think you\u2019d also mentioned I guess a rechargeable version. I just want to clarify that I understand that product a little bit more. Is that going to be a smaller device? And what\u2019s kind of just the confidence around getting both of those products out in FY \u201820? And then I have one follow-up. Omar Ishrak : First, it is rechargeable and it\u2019s 3cc, so it is more but Geoff, you can add some... Geoffrey Martha : Yes, I think we began, Kristen, on the regulatory process the current InterStim II device the primary self by adding MRI capabilities to that, but the bigger one will be obviously the rechargeable device as Omar mentioned, is very small. This we are anticipating happening the initial launch in Europe in the spring and a little later in the U.S., but so when you say FY \u201820 in Europe and then U.S. would be late FY \u201820 or early FY \u201821. And because we\u2019re submitting a PMA supplement, we don\u2019t think we need to a separate clinical trial and we\u2019ve been talking about this with the FDA to confirm our thinking. So, we\u2019re really excited about this and the features the combination of our smaller size, I\u2019m talking about rechargeable the micro, the smaller size, the 3cc, the overdrive battery technology and the MRI capability, it really is advantage is a big advantage for us no matter what the competition is saying on this. Yes, this is the same technology combo platter that\u2019s powering Intellis, whose performance has surprised many of us and propelled us back to leadership in FCF. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then the other device was just the same size InterStim today, but just MRI safe version? Geoffrey Martha : Exactly. One of the things that I think is important is that and I think people are starting to realize this, but rechargeable is not meant for every patient. So, having both a primary cell and a rechargeable, on a very small rechargeable I think is going to cover will cover a much broader spectrum of patients than just the rechargeable. Kristen Stewart : Okay, perfect. And then just broadly I guess with micro AV, about seems to be the more significant launch you guys or I guess Omar you were just saying that you were hoping that you could see I guess an 80% share in that market category as well. How are you just feeling about bringing that to market? And then also maybe just talk about the extravascular ICD as well and just kind of the timelines there. I think you were supposed to be starting or did start your pivotal studies with that product. Thanks a lot. Omar Ishrak : Without being biased towards one thing, I will tell you that this is the one product that I\u2019m certainly most excited about because of the if nothing else is symbolism that the Medtronic was started as a company which invented the pacemaker market and here we are 60 years later disrupting that market with the device that is way ahead of any competition and the 80% share is actual fact and the 15% will be cover. So, an expectation that, that kind of share trend should continue over time is quite realistic. But I\u2019ll let Mike add some more color to this. Michael Coyle : Well, remember, there are two aspects to this. One is obviously the procedural penetration and then there\u2019s also the price increase that we get over the device which is essentially in the single-chamber market is about 3 times the prevailing pricing in the standard device system. So, the reason you see a procedural share, including our traditional single-chamber system in around 65% range and then having an 80% revenue share is because of that step up in price. Now as we move into the Micra AV, we basically have been to date really confined to patients who needed ventricular pacing who also had atrial defibrillation. Now any patients with AV block in conduction in the normal rhythm in the atrium becomes a candidate for this device. And so, the available market goes from 15% up to 55%, 60%. And so that\u2019s why we view it as a big opportunity to drive share and then the real benefits of this technology are even though pacemakers are relatively safe for implant, almost all the complications come from each of the either the pocket of the lead and so by being able to put a device directly into the heart and having a 10 to 12 year battery life, this really offers significant clinical advantages to patients, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re excited about it. Kristen Stewart : EV-ICDs. Michael Coyle : And EV-ICD, we will be are beginning the pivotal trial associated with that, we haven\u2019t talked a while about that trial design, but it is getting underway now. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Kristen. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS. Matt Taylor : Good morning, Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start with the quick follow-up on the AV question. So, Mike or Omar, is there anything different about AV versus single-chamber in terms of the speed of the launch? I mean you have people trained on single-chamber now. You have reimbursement in place. Could this uptick actually be faster than single-chamber? Omar Ishrak : Well, I\u2019ll let Mike answer that. I think it is a new concept though, so that requires some buy in maybe. I don\u2019t know, Mike... Michael Coyle : On the one hand, the procedural aspects are very similar, almost identical to the single-chamber device. And of course, as you point out, we\u2019ve done the training associated with this. But there are number of physicians who basically said, they don\u2019t do enough single chamber devices to make worth their time to do training, now we get this device and we\u2019re going to see more physicians coming on stream who want to learn the technique, which is going to be helpful for us not just in this new indication for use, but even in the traditional single-chamber pacing. So that will be helpful. There are some aspects of their patient follow-up that are different and we\u2019re going to be spending as we did with the initial launch a lot of time making sure that the physicians are trained and what to look for both on the implant procedure and in the discharge process. And so we are going to be very careful in terms of rolling out updated training even to those who have been trained before. But to your point, I think it should have a marginally faster adoption rate than what we saw with single-chamber. Matt Taylor : Okay, thanks. And just on surgical robotics, I was hoping you could maybe talk about the strategy as it relates to Mazor and how that informs what you might do with the soft tissue surgical robot. And are you thinking about using robotics anywhere else? Hooman Hakami : You want me to take the first one. Look it\u2019s a great question. The work that Geoff and his team has done with Mazor absolutely is influencing how we think about our commercialization approach with the soft tissue robot. As Omar has mentioned many times in the past, Medtronics uniquely positioned with high-value consumables and if you think about our leading position with the end effectors in the surgery space and that trusted brand that we have with surgeons, the ability to pair those instruments with our robot is incredibly important. And of course, we\u2019ve been training surgeons on surgery for over 60 years and we\u2019ve pioneered innovations in that space. And so, when we look at what Geoff and team have done with RTG from a service capability, from a commercial model capability, I think we are very much aligned to learn from that piece. Geoffrey Martha : Yes. Let me also add answer the question regarding other areas. Let me tell you that in virtually every area that we have a procedural presence, we will look at robotics because that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be. And we\u2019re learning from our current experience, but I can tell you that the data analytics capability, we\u2019re just beginning to evolve. Combination with the robot with other capital equipment, especially ones with visualization and for navigation, that we\u2019re showing with Mazor is not only restricted to spine along. Planning procedures, planning the procedure upfront and then using that to guide the robot in specific ways, that\u2019s a core capability that we\u2019ve that we\u2019re starting to develop with Mazor, but we\u2019ll translate across into surgical robot at sometime in the future, the procedure is different. There are some core areas where we are learning which we will apply to virtually every area that we\u2019ve got procedures. And I can tell you it\u2019s a big area of focus for us, both organically as well as inorganically. And one that we expect over the long-term, not just in one procedure, because across all procedures, and be the company who rewrites the way surgery is done in the next decade. So, make no mistake, this is a core area for us and we\u2019ll see much more of about robots than just the two that you\u2019re looking at today in the future. Omar Ishrak : One area though short-term that we are moving into would be other cranial procedures, so we have the Mazor Renaissance, which is indicated for cranial procedures. In Medtronic, we\u2019re launching another cranial, a smaller cranial robot. And these robots will be used for lead placement, for example, and deep brain stimulation procedures, EEG placement for epilepsy as well as tumor resection, so tumor resection itself. So those are two different robots applied to various cranial procedures, brain procedures as well. Matt Taylor : Thanks for all the color. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Matt. Next question please, Regina. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Matt Miksic : Thanks for taking the question. So, I had just a couple of product-related follow-ups. The first for Mike on, TYRX the antibacterial product for CRM. The rapid results obviously didn\u2019t get the same attention that low risk TAVR did at ACC, and yet this could be over time another potential share gainer for this business, and just wondering Mike if you could give us an update on what\u2019s been happening since the data was presented, what kind of response have you gotten? Maybe what are the next steps and drivers we can look at over the next 12 months or so? And then I had a follow-up for Geoff. Michael Coyle : So, we\u2019ve been very pleased with TYRX performance since the ACC presentation, the rapid data. We have seen meaningful acceleration of its adoption as a result of those data. This past quarter, we were mid-30s growth for the product. As you point out, it not only helps us in terms of revenue per procedure. And we view the at-risk patient population to represent a little over half of the patients because it applies to essentially large devices, so ICD, CRT devices, in initial procedures as well as all replacements, including pacemaker replacements. And so, as a result, it\u2019s helping us not only in terms of our overall revenue share, but we actually are seeing in the high-risk patients then selecting Medtronic because they want these TYRX product and that\u2019s helping us with initial implant share across our portfolio, especially on High Power and on the CRT side of things. Matt Miksic : And then in terms of guidelines or things that may for over the next 12 months or so? Michael Coyle : Well, we are working with the data sets and the professional societies to see if we can get this into indications for use. We also are expanding application of the envelope to other parts of the Medtronic business, including the neurostimulation devices, both for the brain, as well as for pain as well as for Pelvic Health. And so, it\u2019s helping us in both regards. I\u2019m not yet ready address timing of any indication or guidelines to the expansion, but we are working on that. Omar Ishrak : Let me add that the TYRX is a core technology that we\u2019ve essentially developed. And while that in itself is one thing, what it pulls along with it in terms of our devices is something that will become a true differentiator for Medtronic in the long term. And we\u2019re investing in that area to make sure that we can sort of broaden the usage of TYRX over time. So that\u2019s a key technology area of focus for us which we think we\u2019re well differentiated. Michael Coyle : It also has helped us immensely in our value-based health care programs from the standpoint that having performance guarantees is something that our customer base really is looking to as us having skin in the game as they shift to that risk sort of arrangements with payers. And we now have over $1 billion in revenue associated with essentially performance guaranteed programs and $800 million of that is tied to TYRX. Matt Miksic : And then over Geoff, if I could, on spine and pain. So, spine implant growth over 2% in the U.S. and 2% worldwide. That does look like it\u2019s ahead of market growth to me at this point. Geoff, if you could maybe just provide a little bit of color? Obviously, you\u2019re happy with the placements in the quarter, but maybe a color as to how the pull-through dynamics work on the systems you placed over the last few quarters? And on pain, I know you\u2019d mentioned during your prepared remarks, it\u2019s still kind of a softer market or a tough market to sort of project. Maybe some sense of when that settles down, we get a better sense of spinal cord stimulation and what that markets really growing at? Thanks. Geoffrey Martha : Sure, Matt. So, I\u2019ll take the spinal one first. So, to kind of break it down, I mean we\u2019ve talked about the use of spine robotics and the linkage with our implants and how as the utilization of Mazor goes up, we\u2019ll get more pull-through. And we\u2019re in the early, early stages of that. So, we\u2019re getting, if you\u2019re looking at three kind of metrics on that, we\u2019re getting the robot sales, that\u2019s kind of the socket race. So, we\u2019re doing very well there, as indicated. And when they use Mazor, our customers are using Medtronic and that attachment rate is close to 70% and that\u2019s going to go higher as we get more of the Mazor X Stealth addition out there where the navigation is into Mazor. Remember when we talk about placements also, we\u2019ve got a much Mazors out there that we\u2019re upgrading to Stealth addition. So, our attachment is really strong. And so, what we\u2019re really driving here is the utilization, that involves a lot of training and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve got all kinds of demo labs and training labs at different customers. And we\u2019ve built up a whole new 100-person component of our sales force that\u2019s like a SWAT team that goes into these accounts and works with the surgeons, with our team, the surgical staff and I guess our reps to train everybody and get them comfortable doing robotic procedures. So, we\u2019re in the early innings of that, and as that increases, you\u2019re going to get more pull-through. But what we\u2019re seeing now is that these robots are getting into the competitive accounts where and giving us something to engage on with surgeons, and the C-suite, quite frankly, are very engaged in this for a variety of reasons. And we\u2019re using this to get into competitive accounts and once we are in there and we walk in with our broad or our good service, our broad portfolio, which now includes Titan, that\u2019s having a more immediate impact. So, if there\u2019s an initial impact as we get into competitive accounts and then there\u2019s a longer-term impact as we drive utilization. So, I guess that this strategy has a long runway ahead of it and we\u2019re in the very early stages and we\u2019re already seeing impact. For spinal cord stimulation, look, I\u2019m kind of like a little embarrassed for industry our competitors and ourselves don\u2019t have a more specific answer as to what is driving in the short term. But look, I think tell you, I think this is a very innovation sensitive market and we had a lot of innovation come out in a pretty condensed period of time from us and our competitors. And now it\u2019s come down a little bit. And then seeing that, we\u2019ve made some trade-offs in RTG and have accelerated our spinal cord stimulation and prioritized our spinal cord stimulation pipeline. So, like I said, we\u2019ve accelerated the next generation Intellis into this fiscal year. And I don\u2019t want to get in too much of the features, I\u2019m going to talk about that at NASS, what that means but it is a next-generation device. Behind that, we have a and the next year behind that, a new primary cell device coming out, which like I said, in Pelvic Health, same applies for spinal cord stimulation. You need a broader set of both rechargeable and primary cell devices. And then in addition to that, we\u2019re working on closed-loop for spinal cord stimulation. We have a very active program on closed-loop or you may have heard it\u2019s called e-caps out in the market space. So, we\u2019ve got that coming as well. That\u2019s a little further out, but we\u2019ve got a pretty robust pipeline that we\u2019ll have a pretty regular cadence and I think that\u2019s going to drive the market. I do think this market should be a high single-digit grower based on all the demographics as well as the opioid crisis here in the U.S. and a few other markets. Matt Miksic : Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Matt. We\u2019ll take the last question, please, Regina. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks, so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really solid quarter. Karen, I wanted to follow-up on the question Robbie has regarding SG&A. And it does feel like that you are seeing benefits from including operating margin as a component of the annual incentive plan. Just wonder if you can parse out exactly where you are in rolling out that process across the organization and if you can quantify where you are relative to where you expect to be at longer term as it relates to that and parse out how much that\u2019s contributing to this quarter\u2019s operating margin expansion versus some other dynamics, i.e., the product pipeline or improving product mix? And that\u2019s all I have. Thanks so much. Karen Parkhill : Sure. Thanks, Danielle. We introduced operating within incentive comp at the total company level last fiscal year. And then this fiscal year, we drove it down into the organization. It\u2019s hard to parse out the benefits of that, but I would say we do have a strong cost control around the company that started last fiscal year and has continued into this fiscal year. But we\u2019re also purposely driving greater efficiencies across the company as we work to leverage our size and scale in our back offices and our customer service centers and across our enabling functions. And those programs are all driven as part of enterprise excellence, and we\u2019re clearly seeing the results. We are tracking the savings. And you\u2019re seeing it now show up in our margin expansion. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Danielle. Okay. So, let me close it out. First, thanks for your questions before I completely close it out, I\u2019ll just a couple of more sentences. We talked a lot about our product pipeline today, but let me just remind you that almost everything we talked about is actually in the second half of FY \u201820. This momentum is not going to stop going into FY \u201821. And as was noted earlier, if I had more breath I could probably continue until we\u2019ve launch in FY \u201821, I\u2019m not going to stop. And I really mean it and we all mean it when we say that, today, we have the strongest and the broadest pipeline that we\u2019ve ever had in our history. And you\u2019ll see that thing play out in the upcoming quarters. So, it\u2019s with great excitement that I really want to close this call out. And on behalf of the entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for your continued support, your interest in Medtronic. And we look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q2 earnings call which we\u2019ll be holding on Tuesday, November the 19th. So, thank you all very much for your interest. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would like to hand the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fiscal year 2020 second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our second quarter, which ended on October 25th, 2019. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and the revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. During today's earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. For this call, unless we say otherwise, rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis, which compares to the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 after adjusting for foreign currency. References to organic revenue growth, exclude the impact of our Titan Spine acquisition and currency. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachement to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported another quarter of solid results with organic revenue growth and EPS both coming in ahead of Street expectations, reflecting our continued focus on executing to our commitments across Medtronic. Q2 revenue grew 4.3% in constant currency and 4.1% organic, and acceleration from the first quarter with outperformance in RTG, MITG and diabetes. We also delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in emerging markets. Our adjusted operating margin expanded approximately 20 basis points, in line with expectations and included key investments ahead of several major new product launches. Our enterprise excellence initiatives where we leverage our size and scale to improve our effectiveness and efficiency continue to benefit our P&L, particularly on the SG&A line. On the bottom line, our diluted EPS grew 7.4% or 9% at constant currency, despite the headwind and EPS growth from the increase in our non-GAAP nominal tax rate. Overall, our broad-based performance this quarter demonstrates the consistency of our execution, the strength of our innovation, and the benefit of our business and geographic diversification. Let's take a look now at the drivers of our quarterly performance, starting with our Restorative Therapies Group. RTG delivered a particularly impressive performance, posting 6% organic growth, which was 150 basis points ahead of our expectations. Strong sales in spine and brain therapies more than offset slower growth in pain therapies. Our surgical synergy strategy for spine surgery, which combines the enabling capital equipment in our Brain Therapies division with the implant in our Spine division is having an exceptional and sustained impact on RTG\u2019s growth. Our Spine division grew 5.5% organic in the U.S. and 3.5% organic globally. This excludes the early contribution from our Titan Spine acquisition, which is off to a good start. Organic revenue growth in spine hit its highest level in 2.5 years with strong double-digit growth in infused bone graft sales as well as 3% organic Core Spine growth both globally and in the U.S. This was driven by our surgical synergy strategy, where surgeon use of our capital equipment in particular our Mazor robot is resulting in increased sales of our Core Spine implants In fact, when you combine our spine division sales, with the sales of our capital equipment from our Brain Therapies division that are used in spine surgery, which is how our spine competitors report results our Spine division grew a robust 6.7% organic with our U.S. spine business growing 7.7% organic, well above the market. As I just mentioned, our surgical synergy strategy is also benefiting our Brain Therapies division, which sells the capital equipment used in spine surgery. Brain Therapies delivered another above-market quarter of 11.3% growth. In neurosurgery, we had double-digit growth at all three of our offerings, Robotics, Navigation and Imaging. Our Midas Rex powered surgical instruments also grew double-digits, as we fully launched the new Midas Rex's MR8 system in the U.S. during the quarter. In Brian Therapies, our market-leading neurovascular business also had a very strong quarter with high-teens growth reflecting strength in both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Our ischemic stroke business grew in the high twenties and strong adoption of our Solitaire X stent retriever, Riptide aspiration system and React catheters. In Hemorrhagic stroke, we grew low double-digits, as expanded indications of our Pipeline Flex for diversion system continued to drive growth. This was Geoff Martha\u2019s last quarter leading RTG, before taking over as President of Medtronic earlier this month. Over his four-year tenure, Geoff revitalized the group. He implemented a strong strategy, built a robust management team and invested in an innovative pipeline. It is also noteworthy that he named a successor from within RTG. Brett Wall has done an outstanding job, leading our Brain Therapies division, and he has played a vital role in the turnaround of RTG. We look forward to his leadership of the group. In the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, we had another very strong quarter, growing 6.1% and ahead of expectations, driven by very good performances in both surgical innovations and RGR. In Surgical innovations, we grew mid-single-digits in both Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy. Advanced Stapling growth was driven by new products in our Tri-Staple line, including our EEA circular stapler and Tri-Staple 2.0 re-loads. Advanced Energy growth benefited from continuous innovation in our LigaSure Franchise, including our LigaSure Exact Dissector. Respiratory GI and Renal delivered another exceptional quarter growing 6.1%. The GI Solutions business grew high single-digits led by strong sales of Bravo calibration-free reflux system, EndoFLIP imaging systems and PillCam systems. Respiratory and patient monitoring also grew high-single-digits, on strengthening Nellcor Pulse Oximetry, Microstream capnography, and BIS brain monitoring consumables, Puritan Bennett 980 ventilators and McGRATH video laryngoscopes. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, we grew 1.3% this quarter, which was in line with our expectations. CVG has gone through a series of below-trend quarters, which we believe are coming to an end. CVG\u2019s growth this quarter reflects the challenges of the last few quarters in LVADs and DCBs as well as the sustained headwind in CRM replacement devices, given the longer-life batteries we launched several years ago. In addition, during the quarter, we implemented a number of changes to our manufacturing processes for our direct product line which temporarily limited supply and affected our revenue growth in CRHF high-power. We're seeing clear signs of overcoming these headwinds. U.S. DCBs and LVADs both grew in the teens quarter-over-quarter. We have now passed the one-year anniversary of the step-down in LVADs, and we expect to anniversary the DCB challenges in March. With our CRM replacement devices, both pacemakers and CRT-D replacement -- grew sequentially for the first time in several years. We expect CRM replacement devices to be a net neutral impact to CRHF growth next fiscal year after several years of being a headwind to growth. Regarding TYRX, we launched our new manufacturing process late last month and expect production volumes in Q3 to return to normal levels. Despite these areas of pressure on CVG growth, we're seeing strong performance in other CVG businesses, including Pacing and TAVR, which combined; represent over 25% of CVG revenue. Our Pacing business grew mid-single digits globally and high single-digits in the U.S. as our Micra Single Chamber Transcatheter Pacing System continues to take share and expand the market. Beyond Micra, our global pacemaker share is benefiting from unique feature differentiation in our conventional pacemakers, including our Reactive ATP feature, which resulted in differential reimbursement in Japan, as well as the increasing popularity of HIS bundle and left bundle branch pacing, where Medtronic offers unique lead and lead delivery products that enable such procedures. In our TAVR business, we grew in the low 20s, but mid-20s growth in the U.S. Driven by expansion into the low-risk patient population, we launched our Evolut PRO+ TAVR system in the U.S. late in the quarter. And this drove some of the highest procedural implant volumes that we've ever had in the final two weeks of the quarter. We see an accelerating growth profile for CVG over the back half of our fiscal year, with the anniversary of the LVAD challenges, improving sequential growth in DCBs, improvements in pacemaker and CRT-D replacement volumes, and the benefit of multiple, important new product launches. In diabetes, we grew 4.3% slightly ahead of our expectations. Our U.S. business declined in the high single-digits, which is anticipated and resulted from competitive challenges, while we await our new products. At the same time our international business, which represents just under half of our diabetes revenue grew 19%. The MiniMed 670G which drove strong growth in the U.S. last year is experiencing that same strong consumer demand as we've launched and received reimbursement in select international markets. This demand is not only driving double-digit growth in insulin pumps, but it is also resulting in double-digit growth in recurring revenue from CGM and other consumables. Late last month, we announced our Sean Salmon who has successfully led our Coronary & Structural Heart division is taking over leadership of the Diabetes Group. Sean has an excellent track record in developing and executing competitive business strategies, including the successful launches of several important new technologies for Medtronic. Sean is actively engaged, and we look forward to the impact that he will make on the business. Now, turning to emerging markets, which represent 16% of our revenue. In Q2, we grew emerging markets 12% with contributions from geographies around the globe. China grew 13% South Asia grew 14%, as with Eastern Europe which included 20% growth in Russia. In addition, Southeast Asia grew 12%, the Middle East and Africa 10%, and Latin America 9%. We continue to drive strong growth in these markets as we optimize the distribution channel and uncertain markets, localized R&D and manufacturing. In addition, the diversified growth in markets around the world is important. We believe the geographic breadth of our business and the rapid expansion of healthcare across these markets typically insulates us from country-specific economic cycles. As a result, we expect continued and consistent double-digit growth in emerging markets. The first half of this fiscal year has gone well, as we've executed to our commitments and delivered better-than-expected results. Now as we look forward, we're even more excited about what lies ahead. As investments we've made in our pipeline begin to pay off by accelerating our revenue growth and creating value for our shareholders. And CVG as I mentioned earlier, we just launched our next-generation Evolut PRO+ TAVR valve. And we expect to see a full quarter's contribution starting in Q3. In addition, we're expecting imminent U.S. approval for our IN.PACT Admiral AV fistula indication. As we look to the fourth quarter, and into the start of fiscal 2021, we're anticipating U.S. approval and launch of our Micra AV pacemaker, our next-generation Cobalt and Chrome families of ICDs and CRT-Ds, and our Reveal LINQ 2.0 Insertable Cardiac Monitor. Outside the U.S., we are also expecting multiple new product introductions, including the European launch of our DiamondTemp ablation catheter and Japanese approvals for our Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft, our preceptor [ph] Quad CRT-P family and Attain Stability Quad Active-fixation CRT-P lead. At MITG, as we discussed in September during our event in Hartford, we're starting the global launch sequence of our soft tissue robotic system with first-in-human use in commercial sales commencing later this fiscal year. Next fiscal year, we plan to submit for CE Mark in Q1 as well as submit for U.S. IDE approval in the first half, which when approved, will allow for system placements and surgeon training, so we can begin gathering clinical data in the United States. In RTG, as I mentioned earlier, the Midas Rex MRA drill platform is being launched now in the U.S. and will be introduced to international markets in the back-half of this fiscal year. We're also planning to launch our Stealth Autoguide, cranial robotic system in Q3. In Pelvic Health, we filed our PMA supplement with the U.S. FDA last month for InterStim SureScan MRI leads and our interest in Micra with MRI, which is 3CC in volume and rechargeable. In ENT, we're preparing for a fiscal year-end launch of our next-generation intraoperative nerve monitoring system NIM Vital. In Pain Therapies, we plan to unveil our next-generation Spinal Cord Stimulator at the NANS Conference in January. In Diabetes, we continue to prepare for the launch of the MiniMed 780G, our advanced hybrid closed loop system with Bluetooth connectivity. We expect our 780G pivotal data to be presented at the ATTD Conference in February. Earlier this month, to bridge the time before our next-generation technology is available in the U.S. we\u2019ve put in place a next-tech pathway program which allows customers who are out of warranty or new-to-pump therapy to purchase a MiniMed 670G while accessing our next-generation pump technology at no additional cost when it becomes available. These are some of the highlights from our pipeline. There are course several more product launches that we're preparing for across the company. While we continue to invest in building out a robust long-term pipeline of continuous innovation, invention, and disruption. As I've noted before, we expect our growth rate to accelerate with the second half of FY 20 growing faster than the first, as we anniversary recent headwinds, and launch multiple new products. And in FY 2021, we expect our top-line momentum to accelerate. As we get the increasing benefit of the FY 2020 product launches as well as a product slated to launch next fiscal year. With that, let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our second quarter financials. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you. As Omar mentioned, we delivered second quarter organic revenue growth of 4.1% and adjusted EPS was $1.31 growing 7.4%. We came in $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by our operational outperformance. Our adjusted operating margin was 28.1% reflecting improvement of approximately 20 basis points. We delivered strong improvement in adjusted SG&A of approximately 90 basis points, as we implement and drive efficiencies and improvements across the company under our Enterprise Excellence program. Our improvement in SG&A was offset by declines in gross margin reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency and China tariff. Below the operating profit line our adjusted interest expense declined 32%, driven by our successful debt issuance and tender transactions earlier this calendar year. As you know, our cost of debt reduction is helping to offset an increase in our annual tax rate from U.S. tax reform. Generating strong free cash flow remains a priority across the company. Second quarter free cash flow was $1.6 billion, up 66% from last year. We are tracking nicely towards our full-year conversion ratio target of 80% plus. We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment, balancing investment in R&D and tuck-in acquisitions to drive future growth, with returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we returned over $1.1 billion or 71% of the cash we generated, resulting in a total shareholder payout of 64% on adjusted net earnings. Before I turn the call back to Omar, I would like to update our annual revenue growth and EPS guidance. For the year, we continue to expect organic revenue growth to approximately 4%, with revenue growth accelerating in the back half relative to the first. While the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a negative impact on full-year revenue growth of approximately 80 basis point to 120 basis points. With the strength we're seeing across several of our businesses, from neurosurgery and neurovascular, to spine surgical innovations and TAVR, we are raising the organic growth guidance for our three largest business groups. We now expect CVG to grow 2.5% to 3% up from 2.5%. MITG to grow 5% to 5.5% up from 5%, and RTG to grow 4.5% to 5% up from 4% to 4.5% previously. These three groups combined contribute 92% of our revenue. In diabetes, which represents 8% of our sales, we now expect low single-digit organic growth, reflecting competitive pressures in the U.S. while we await new product approval. For the third quarter, we anticipate organic revenue growth of 4% plus with currency having a negative impact of 50 basis points to a 120 basis points at recent rates. By group, we expect CVG to accelerate to 3.5% to 4%, diabetes to be flat to slightly down and MITG and RTG to grow 4.5% to 5% all, on an organic basis. As Omar mentioned, we are anticipating either U.S. or European approval on a long list of products, starting in the fourth quarter and building into the early part of next year. Our Micra AV Transcatheter pacemaker Precept [ph] PC Deep Brain Stimulator. InterStim micro 3CC sacral nerve stimulator. MiniMed 780G advanced hybrid closed loop, DiamondTemp RF ablation catheter and AV fistula indication for our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon. And next-generation for our Intellis SCS system, LINQ 2.0 Insertable Cardiac Monitor in Cobalt and Chrome family ICD and CRT-D. I'm sure, I left some off here. But as you can see, we have a lot of that's coming, which is why we expect fourth-quarter growth to accelerate as we begin to see the early impact of some of these launches. Turning to margins, we continue to expect our full-year operating margin to expand by roughly 40 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by our enterprise excellence initiatives. For the third quarter, we would expect slight improvement in operating margin, offset by a currency headwind. Below the operating line, we expect our quarterly non-GAAP interest expense to be similar to the second quarter for the remainder of the year. In addition, we now expect our third quarter adjusted nominal tax rate to be in the range of 15 to 15 and a quarter, and an annual range of 15 to 15.5. We remained focused on optimizing our underlying operating tax rate overtime. We are raising our fiscal year 2020 EPS guidance to a range of $557 million to $563 million to reflect the second quarter's outperformance, a $0.03 increase from the prior range of $554 million to $560 million. This includes a negative $0.09 impact of currency at recent rates. For the third quarter, we expect EPS of $1.37 to $1.39 including a $0.02 currency headwind at recent rates. Now, I will return the call back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks. Karen. As I mentioned earlier, Geoff Martha became President of Medtronic earlier this month. And at the start of the next fiscal year, I will retire as CEO, and Geoff will take my place. I'm excited with the Board selection of Geoff as the next leader of Medtronic. Geoff has proven itself as a leader who can execute and deliver strong financial performance, develop our people and enhance our company's culture. I know he will take Medtronic to new levels of performance and growth. We're working together closely to ensure a very smooth transition. Before we go to the Q&A, I've asked Geoff to say a few words. Geoff? Geoffrey Martha : Thanks, Omar. While first, I want to reiterate what an honor it is to have been selected by the Board as Medtronic's next CEO. And I'm really looking forward to leading this great company. Now looking at this past quarter's results, I'm particularly pleased to see our strategies are working in spine with strong growth in that business, driven by enabling technology like our Mazor robot. And the transition with Brett as the head of RTG has been incredibly smooth. While he officially took over earlier this month, Brett really lead the execution down the stretch in Q2 for RTG. Look, RTG is in good hands, I\u2019ll just say that. Now as I look ahead, I\u2019m incredibly excited about Medtronic's future. We have several product launches coming up, and you could be assured that executing on these is top of my list of priorities. Actually, the entire Medtronic leadership team is focused and committed to delivering on our pipeline, allowing us to build momentum as we head in the back half of the fiscal year and into the next. Also during this transition period, I'm connecting with many important Medtronic stakeholders, and thinking about how our strategy will evolve and how we will achieve that next level of performance. For starters, I\u2019m spending a lot of time meeting with our business leadership and customers beyond RTG. I also plan to meet with and listen to the investment community over the coming months. The transition with Omar is going great. We've worked together for a long time, and we know how to build off each other's strength. Additionally, I am thrilled with the support from the Board and my colleagues on the executive committee. Having continuity and a transition like this, makes life a lot easier. While it's still too early to comment on specifics on how our strategy will evolve, I'd like to share a few initial thoughts. First, one thing that won't change is our focus on the Medtronic mission, which drives us to use technology to alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life. In fact, we're looking to place even more emphasis on innovation driven growth. Technology has always been the lifeblood of this company and growth is the name of the game in Medtech [ph]. We will be laser-focused on getting our organic revenue growth rates up. Getting more aggressive with tuck-in M&A and being decisive with capital allocation to the highest growth segments. All of this will increase our weighted average market growth rate or our WAMGR. Reinvigorating our diabetes business is also a priority. This is a rapidly growing market that has huge long-term potential. And I'm confident in our ability to leverage our strength to get back to leading the innovation in this space. We have a strong foundation with which to work and a really exciting pipeline of innovation on both the pump and the sensor side. Also, I am really confident that Sean along with the rest of the diabetes business will get this right. Most importantly, he has committed to improving the patient experience. Now as we do this, along with executing on our product pipeline, we expect to return to share-taking mode. In fact, we see opportunities for share gains throughout the Medtronic portfolio. And we'll be measuring ourselves on just that. I like to keep things simple. Grow our WAMGR, and measure our business performance or whether we're taking share or not. You'll hear more on these priorities overtime. And I look forward to sharing our full plans with you when we host Medtronic's Investor Day next June. So at this point, I\u2019ll turn it back to Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks Geoff. Let's now move on to Q&A. In addition to Karen and Geoff, two of our Group Presidents Mike Coyle and Bob White are also here to answer your questions. As Brett Wall and Sean Salmon are new to their roles of running RTG and diabetes respectively, they won't join the earnings call until the next quarter. Karen, Geoff and I will answer the questions related to those two groups today. As usual, we want to try to get to as many questions as possible. So please help us by limiting yourself to one question and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator first question please? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, just a quick one for Karen and maybe a follow-up for Mike. So Karen, just thinking about the back half of your revenue, kind of two-part related question. If we think about, I appreciate the updated guidance for diabetes, but if you look into the back half of the year, you had nice acceleration here in the second quarter and it's sort of deceleration plan for the third in the back half. So anything other than diabetes suggests why the business would decelerate in the back half, and sort of related on earnings, great expansion so far this year, it's not implied much expansion in the back half of the year, and you've got your non-op tailwinds in interest and tax. So kind of into the back-half of the year, anything we should be picking up from the top or bottom line, because it looks on the margin a little conservative, then a quick one for Mike. Karen Parkhill : Yes, thanks for the question, David. Let me touch on the comps first, because I know there's some question about that. And the FY 2019 comps alone can be a little bit misleading. What dictated the cadence in FY 2019 is really what happened in FY 2018. Recall in the first half of FY 2018, we faced some significant, but transitory issues. The IT outage, the Puerto Rico hurricane, and for that reason, I would say double-stack of FY 2018 and FY2019 would be a good base comparison where our growth by-quarter with that double-stack was 4.5% 5.3%, 5.5% and 5%. But comps aside, what is really going to drive our acceleration in the back half is our pipeline. And we have indicated you should start seeing that in 4Q and continuing into next year. And related to EPS, yes we were pleased that we were able to raise our EPS guidance by a total of $0.13 so far this year, $0.03 on the heels of Q2. And while interest tax and FX are a little more favorable, we do plan to reinvest those benefits to ensure that we can fully support our upcoming launches, because they do drive our future revenue growth. David Lewis : Okay, very helpful Karen. Mike, just real quickly for me. Can you just talk to us about how share is fairing in the low-risk expansion markets, prior to the approvals, any comments you want to make this weekend on data that suggested relative differences in outperformance? Thanks so much. Michael Coyle : Sure, in terms of overall growth, we were globally growing in the low twenties and in U.S. mid-20s. So it was a little slower than the overall market principally because of the presence now with another competitor in the space, who has taken some modest share in the U.S. as well as the rate of ramp for the new centers that are coming onstream with the NCD. So we think that's going to bounce around a little bit, but we were very pleased with the growth profile clearly accelerated from where we've been in the earlier part of the year, and late part of last year. And then terms of the data that was shared at the AHA, we're still digesting those datasets. These were non-randomized datasets that were coming out of France that basically were concentrated in accounts that were heavily users of the [indiscernible] product lines. So we were not sure that the propensity matching that they did is appropriate to what we've seen. But I think the other piece of it is, they were not using Evolut PRO+ and they\u2019re certainly not using Evolut PRO+ in those datasets where the addition of the [Indiscernible] has really improved the PBL performance and now with Evolut PRO we have the lowest profile devices and we have those pericardial [indiscernible] into the large 34 millimeter size segment. So we know that there have been multiple randomized datasets that have done these comparisons, and we've not seen that kind of mortality different. So we're going to have to continue just to understand it and digest it. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks David. Next question, please Regina. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Bob Hopkins : Oh, thank you. And good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Just want to focus on the changed guidance in diabetes for a minute. I guess the specific question would be maybe if you could just go into little more detail on what specifically has changed and driven the reduction in the guidance here. Maybe a sense for U.S. O-U.S. assumptions in the back half. And then more broadly on diabetes, does -- how does this impact your view on the future growth rate of diabetes say in fiscal 2020, 2021? Thank you Karen Parkhill : Yes, thanks for the question, Bob. We -- Omar did talk about the fact that we're facing competitive challenges in the U.S. in diabetes, while we await new product launches. But international growth continues to grow well. You saw that in our results, and we expect that strong international growth to continue. In the meantime in the U.S. Omar mentioned we did initiate a next-tech pathway, which you also may have seen advertised. That means that we'll defer some revenue until we can upgrade those patients to the new technology And in terms of future growth for diabetes, we believe that that will follow our robust pipeline and we expect growth acceleration in that business with the pipeline as we do in many of our other businesses. Omar Ishrak : I just wanted to get it very clear that we're very excited about this pipeline. The 780G promises to be an outstanding product. We're making good progress in terms of our enrollment in the pivotal trial. We've already submitted for our next-generation hardware for approval with the FDA. And so that whole pipeline is on track. And we're going to go through a period of some pressure especially with new patients in the U.S. But look, there should be no doubt about our enthusiasm from this pipeline and what we see into the future in diabetes. As Geoff pointed our earlier, this is an area of focus for us and one that we will win in. Bob Hopkins : Great. And then just one quick follow-up Omar for you is, just -- just wanted to gauge your confidence in the outlook for growth in China. And the reason I ask is that another device company this quarter talked about pricing in China for medical devices being a little more pressured than they anticipated. And while it sounded like a bit of a one-off, I just wanted to make sure we got your opinion on the subject and the outlook for growth in China for your business. Omar Ishrak : Look we're very confident about China. We've had consistent results there and one that we expect to continue and continue to depend on in terms of double-digit growth coming out of China. There are some different purchasing processes that are in place, and most of these are really around more commoditized products some of which we play in, but the government has been very thoughtful about which products to put into these big tenders. And we feel that the majority of our product line is separated clinically. In any case even in those situations there are optimizations we can do in the distribution channel through which we can cover that. So look, we're completely confident about our growth, about our growth in China. The team there has performed in a very consistent fashion quarter-after-quarter and we're pretty confident that we can maintain that. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thanks, Bob. Next question, please Regina. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. Karen, I was wondering if you could touch on the cadence of growth in the back part of the year. You talked about four plus percent in third quarter. In the press release, you talked about accelerating topline growth in the back half of the year. What does that imply for fourth quarter? Karen Parkhill : Yes. So thanks Robbie for the question. We do expect growth acceleration in the fourth quarter as we continue to launch important new products. It's hard to sit here in November, and know exactly which products will hit when. And so, and you also have the possibility that some doctors maybe holding some patients as they await approval for some important things in our pipeline like DBS. So it's hard to predict and pin down fourth-quarter at this point. But we'll have a better view when we get to the call in February. And in the meantime, just know that we do expect to see growth acceleration from third quarter. Robert Marcus : Got it. And I was hoping the spine business came in very impressive growth rate here. If you could just talk about a little more detail into robotic placements, what sort of centers are buying here? What percentage of your base has a robot? Any data points you could give us, so we could think about the pull-through going forward? Thanks. Geoffrey Martha : I'll take this, it\u2019s Geoff. I'll take this one Robbie. Yes, first the results in the spine business, which the best we've seen in a long long long time. It really is a direct result of the surgical synergy strategy, which has real staying power here and has meaningfully improved the intrinsic value of our spine franchises. As you pointed out, it's the capital equipment, the Mazor O-arm navigation, significant placements both placements and sales and the pull-through of the spine implants. It's created a great competitive differentiation and a really nice business model for us. And, look we're not giving specifics on how many Mazor placements, but I can tell you, it's like the last several quarters meaningfully more than the competition. And so when you stack quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter of meaningfully more placements in the competition, our installed base has gotten pretty big. And this is we've got a lot of momentum here. And when you have an organization like RTG that with the resources and the capabilities if you can get somebody organization like that focused on something like this with this kind of momentum it's going to, it's going to continue. So we feel very good about it. Robert Marcus : Thank you very much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Robbie. Next question please Regina. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One, two-part question for Mike on CVG and one Pain Stim question for Geoff. So Mike, first on Micra AV, your confidence in approval based on the Marvel 2 data. Just that's an important product for you, but it does small dataset. And second, the sustainability of the TAVR growth you saw this quarter. It sounds like based on your comments that that could potentially accelerate from here? And just lastly Geoff, do you think we've turned the corner on the Pain Stim market for your business and the market? Thanks for taking the question. Michael Coyle : Thanks Larry. On the Micra AV, we were very pleased with the Marvel 2 data that were shown at AHA. We had essentially median AV Synchrony levels of 94% which is pretty close to what you would see with a standard pacemakers system. So obviously all the benefits that we will get on complication reduction from no pocket no leads are coming at very little trade-off in terms of the AV Synchrony. So we think that's going to be very helpful. We believe the dataset is fully consistent with what the FDA wanted to see and has seen. So we've now submitted. And so we have a high degree of confidence of having this product available in the marketplace in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. And in terms of the sustainability of the TAVR market. Obviously, we were very pleased with the acceleration of growth that we saw as we headed into the low-risk dataset. I would say, we still maintain an expectation for the overall market growth of the TAVR market to be in that $5 billion range in calendar 2021. So we're very comfortable that everything is tracking in terms of how we have expected it to happen over the last several years. And so we feel good about that growth engine for us for the next period of time. Geoffrey Martha : Okay. On the \u2013 Larry, it\u2019s Geoff on the Pain Stim business. I will split it into two pieces. Here there's the market, and then our performance. On the market, obviously it's as you can see from our larger competitors that have reported the markets come down, and in the short-term I think it's going to be I'll call it flattish. Over the medium and longer-term we do see this getting back to mid-single to high single-digit growth in the SCS space. But it has been, I'd say we're anticipating a flattish market here for the next quarter or two. And in terms of -- and I do think there's things that can be done to better position SCS space with payers, but in the short-term it is an innovation-driven segment. And we're very excited about our next-generation Intellis. As you know the first-generation did very well, over the last year plus and we already have the next-generation which we'll be talking about when we're rolling out at NANS in January. So we're excited, and over the last quarter we have seen our trialing implants and evaluations have grown the last couple of quarters, as well as our Intellis sales. We're seeing strong Intellis sales as well. So it is picking up. We do see it trending in the right way, but I don't see it getting back to the high single-digits here for a bit. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Larry. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe one on the 3Q guidance here. Sequentially organic seems to be flattish. I'm curious, why MITG would moderate comp seem to be okay in that segment. And then more importantly on diabetes, flat-to-down, how much of that flat-to-downs are you assuming a share loss versus the new, the upgrade program which you assume is you\u2019re deferring revenue recognition maybe parse out the share loss versus the upgrade program impact? Are you seeing any -- are you seeing any delays in FDA approvals because one of your other competitors seems to be having issues on the diabetes side from a regulatory perspective? Karen Parkhill : Thanks for the questions Vijay. So first on MITG, we had a very strong quarter in MITG and we're not going to extrapolate a very strong quarter in 2Q onto the back half. We still see strength in MITG and we're pleased with that strength. We did have some share gains from a competitor stapler recall in the second quarter and we'll see if that continues. In terms of diabetes, the upgrade program is an impact for us in the third quarter, and in terms of market share, our installed base is increasing, particularly as we as we put 670G's in Europe. So we're seeing an installed base increase and we're pleased with that. And then in terms of product launches, I'll let Omar comment. Omar Ishrak : No I think into the product launches, look right now, as I said, we're on track. The most important product launch we have is the 780G. And like I mentioned earlier, we've already submitted our next-generation hardware for approval with the FDA. We've completed delta enrolment and we expect to see the initial pivotal trial results at the ATTD Meeting in Europe in February. And we expect delta approval first and Pete [ph] approval will follow that. Look the exact timing is up to the FDA. There's no signal to us that things will be unnecessarily delayed or anything like that. So as far as we can see things are progressing as normal. They have their normal questions and we go through this process. So I anything out of the ordinary there. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Omar. And just one quick one on SG&A. Some of the comments you made on OpEx management. It looks like these trends are sustainable. So just curious on OpEx trends going forward? Karen Parkhill : Yes thanks Vijay. We have said that we expect to deliver 40 basis points of margin improvement this fiscal year and that hasn't changed. You've seen us drive greater improvement in SG&A and a throughout this year and that shouldn't change. We've had some gross margin pressure driven mainly by FX, but we've been offsetting that and continue to deliver the margin expansion that we've committed. Vijay Kumar : Thanks guys. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Vijay. Next question please Regina. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS. Matthew Taylor : Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Question for Geoff, you talked a little bit about some growth priorities that you have and really talked about being more aggressive on tuck-in M&A. I guess, I was wondering if we should view that as a little bit of a pivot and if you could expand on the areas that you think are really kind of right for those tuck-ins, and what kind of characteristics would you look for in the deals that you'd like to do? Geoffrey Martha : First of all, I don't want to know if I call the pivot. [Indiscernible] towards more of a focus on innovation driven growth here for the last year or so, and building up the pipeline and so no more it\u2019s got the whole company focused on pipeline execution. So that's first and foremost is our top priority is executing on that pipeline that we've built. And then, I've been working closely with the group, the group before group leaders including Sean and Brett that are new to it on a capital allocation strategy, that moves to the highest growth segments, that isn't done necessarily at the group level, that's done at a more granular level, and our goal is to through R&D investments and through using our balance sheet for tuck-in M&A to increase that the [Indiscernible] of the company. And so when we're looking at tuck-in M&A, I'm not going to comment on specific segments, but it's going to be those areas that whether it'd be within the groups or even adjacencies to the groups that are going to grow our WAMGR. And so that's, that\u2019s about it. Matthew Taylor : And just had a follow-up on the ischemic stroke market that you seem to have really strong results this quarter. One of your competitors talked about a slowdown in that market. Are you seeing any slowdown or are you gaining shares, can you talk about the dynamics there? Geoffrey Martha : Well the market is still growing pretty strong. Maybe a little bit, maybe a little bit, slightly less than it\u2019s grown over the last recent few quarters. But our performance and our performance has been I'd say better than the competition. And it's coming. It comes down to the strategy that Brett and Stacy [ph] to put in place that's really having a broad portfolio across both the ischemic side and the hemorrhagic side, having good products on all of those areas, it matters in the space. And that strategy is paying off, and we recently launched the new stent retriever, you know on top of the ischemic space, and on top of the new aspiration system, with our two catheters, you combine that with the breadth of the portfolio that's what's driving our results. And so yes, the market grew a little bit less than it has in the past. We still see this as a very strong market going forward. I mean every, every, everywhere I go in the world outside the U.S. in the U.S. you get asked about stroke, and outside the U.S. you have health ministers asking about how we can help them build out their system. It's just a very robust segment for us right now. Matthew Taylor : Okay, great thanks for the thoughts. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Matt. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning. Thanks for letting me ask the questions Omar, just a question for you. I think when you took the [technical difficulty] seated in years and creating the term economic value creation if you will, and the evolution to value-based healthcare delivery system has been a little bit slower than expected. Can you -- can you give us your view on how the trajectory of the trajectory of the evolution of the healthcare delivery system? And then just for Mike, just TAVR question asymptomatic date of the recovery trial was presented at AHA over the weekend. You've been a little bit less vocal than one of your competitors on the asymptomatic opportunity. Can you give us your read through on the recovery trial data and then any plans for an asymptomatic trial with Evolut with the Evolut platform? Thanks for taking the questions. Omar Ishrak : Okay, let me go first on that value-based healthcare stuff. It's true that when I first started that was an area that we looked at, but really, what we're focused on was what we call the economic value. In other words, we knew how to create clinical value with our products and we needed to understand how that translated into economic value for the system. And while doing so we quickly understood that a lot of the economic value is created outside of the providers themselves who were purchasing our devices. And so, we try to understand that, and through this process we realize that there's lots of stakeholders here. There's a lot of unknowns in this -- in this system. And in the end, we focused on areas where the technology had a direct impact on value creation and those models we've put in place and they've been very successful and they continue to be successful, led by directs being the most the biggest example of that. And that continues to be good. In terms of the broader evolution of these models, look this needs complete stakeholder alignment. There's not something that Medtronic can do on its own. That's, that's just not possible. And it needs clear leadership in that direction. I've got no doubt that at some point in the future, the healthcare models have to move to one that's based on paying for value. But like I said, that requires a lot of alignment and it's probably going to take some time. In the meantime, our understanding of the direct relationship between technology and value we\u2019ll continue to have, and be prepared to go into risk-based models where we have direct control because we've clinical evidence that proves that we can take those risks, and those have been successful. Michael Coyle : And then Josh in response to your question about the recovery trial. Obviously we view it as good news that there was a positive outcome for intervention, earlier intervention in aortic stenosis with in this case obviously Saber [ph] showing mortality benefit versus conservative management. So we think that's good for the overall space in terms of intervention. We have been a little cooler on the idea of using a lot of investment into the asymptomatic group just based on experiences we've had over the years with -- for example ICDs where the market was really driven by incidence pool as opposed to prevalence pool. And so the availability of the patients to come in when they're asymptomatic is a little bit more of a question. So when we've done this work, we viewed it as a relatively smaller driver of overall TAVR market growth. In fact, we don't include it in our overall estimates for the market growth. So again, this would only be good news. And we're going to continue to look at as we head into the operating plan period here for the work that we're doing in spaces like mitral, replacement mitral repair. These are large clinical trial requirements as well. Is this the best use of dollars to go after asymptomatic, we'll make that call as part of our sort of normal planning process. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Josh. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Matthew Miksic : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just one on TYRX and just one follow-up based on your last comment Mike on Mitral. So you mentioned TYRX manufacturing. I was wondering if you could give us an update, an uptake there potential plans for guidelines or enhanced reimbursement or any of the things that that you had talked about a little earlier in the year related to Rapid? Michael Coyle : Yes, so in this past quarter we were completing the move of the manufacturing facility from the manufacturing side in New Jersey that we acquired as part of that acquisition of TYRX into the Rice Creek facility here in Minnesota where we have extensive experience in drug device combinations. As we were ramping that, and obviously we had to ramp it significantly relative to the rapid results being out in last quarter's Q1 growth of in the mid-30s. We began to see yields not where we wanted them. And so we were re-engineering processes associated with that move. As you know this business, that original facility was under a warning letter, so we're being very careful about making sure we have very robust validation and verification activities taking place, which took some of our manufacturing capacity offline, while we did that work. That has now been completed at the end of last month. We have implemented these new processes and we're ramping nicely in terms of production to a point where I think we're back to normalized production here for the full quarter three. That's certainly is our expectation. So that's behind us. And we're now driving growth. In terms of guidelines, we continue to work with professional societies around guidelines. And we'll have more to say about that as decisions rollout. But clearly, the availability of the robust evidence that came from Rapid is there has really helped us in terms of being able to drive adoption of the technology as we saw in Q1. And I expect that we will continue to be a valuable to us here in the second half and beyond. Matthew Miksic : That's great. And then Mike, you mentioned you're sort of picking your spots investment in Structural Heart and mitral and replacement and repair. Just any color or update on either of those fronts if you would? Michael Coyle : Well obviously we continue to think we have a leadership position in the mitral valve replacement market. And in fact, we now have our transfemoral system locked down in terms of design, and we have approval for the feasibility IDE in that space. And so we're going to certainly be prosecuting those clinical trials. We have important investments going on internally in the repair space. We're not really prepared yet to discuss those publicly. But we do think there are some very interesting opportunities for us in that space that would be complementary to where others are investing in that space. And then obviously we continue to rollout labeling indications in the TAVR space for the bicuspid market for example is that enrollment has been completed, and we will be pursuing labeling indications or removal of labeling restrictions in that area. So as I said, we're looking at a number of other things as part of our sort of preparation, with regard to the work we're doing in -- plan in preparation for next year's operating plan. And we'll probably have more to say about that around the time of the Analyst Meeting in June. Matthew Miksic : Great. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you Matt, next question please Regina. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray Matthew O'Brien: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two here together. Sounds like a lot of the products are on schedule for introduction as expected, but the one that seems a little bit aggressive to me is InterStim II. So would just love to hear why you are so confident in the timing of that product coming out. And then secondly, Mike on the TAVR side of things. You mentioned a little bit of impact competitively, was that impact level less than you expected, more than you expected kind of inline just any kind of color there would be helpful? Thank you. Michael Coyle : Yes, so Matt on the first one, I \u2013 you know we have InterStim II and Microstream. I'm not sure, did you mean Microstream or InterStim II or both? Matthew O'Brien: Yes, any color. Thanks. Michael Coyle : Right. So the Microstream as we we've announced, we submitted that to the FDA and we believe that's on track for mid-calendar 2020 approval. And then also InterStim II which is our that's our Microstream is our rechargeable platform. Again, this is the -- this will be our first rechargeable platform. It will be a three 3CC device, fully -- a full body MR labeling with our proven overdrive battery chemistry on there. So this is going to be a great product. That's the Microstream. That is mid-calendar 2020. And then our InterStim II which will have improved, which is our primary cell device our recharge-free device. The next-generation of that will have that will come out with MR labeling around the same time. So we're feeling. Here we will have a full portfolio of both recharge-free and recharge and feeling really good about that based on the timing of our submissions and the normal FDA review. Geoffrey Martha : And then in terms of your question about competitive product entry to the TAVR space. Obviously it was March that the third competitor came into the market. And so we're now into about the third quarter of their presence in the marketplace, and we'd estimate they have somewhere between 1% and 2% market share. And that is in line maybe a little lower than we had expected when we put together our operating plan for the entrant. There's certainly trialing going on in the product, and we would expect that to continue, but we think we've done a good job securing our share positions in the face of now at their competitor. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Matt. We\u2019ll take the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : Hi good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a quick question on the U.S. piece of the business. It looks like that was pretty strong. We're coming to almost 300 basis points of growth acceleration on a comp adjusted basis. I was wondering if you could talk about how sustainable you think that is as we look over the next few quarters and maybe you point out what's sort of driving that, and I have one follow-up on CVG? Thanks so much. Michael Coyle : Okay let me take the U.S. growth. Look overall, it\u2019s in line with what we were expecting. As we've mentioned many times before, growth particularly in the U.S. is driven by innovation. So when as a new product that comes in, that that increases procedures for the right reasons. Then we get clear growth. And we expect that dynamic to continue. The baseline growth remains pretty consistent, the number of procedures and all of that remains pretty consistent. And whenever we have new product entries that drives the growth rate up, and we don't expect that dynamic to change looking into the future and we expect with the pipeline that we have, and they are all on track and we've got lots of exciting products all the way from the Micra AV pacemaker to the 780G Insulin pump to the InterStim Micro and all the other stuff that we've talked about. All of those things were launched in the U.S. will drive the market up and we'll get share gains as a result of that. So that's the way I look at the U.S. market, it\u2019s really innovation-driven. Danielle Antalffy : Okay got it. And then on CVG, Mike I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what's driving the modest guide higher in the back half of the year. I guess that it feels like LVADS should start to anniversary some of their tough comps maybe DCB start to stabilize, but otherwise just curious if you could point to what's really driving the upside in the back half of the year in CVG? Thanks so much. Michael Coyle : Sure. Danielle. The headwinds that you talked about especially LVADS one is clearly now behind us in that we've anniversaried that sort of step change in the market that happened at the end of Q2 a year ago. So that really helps in terms of overall prior year comps. And as you mentioned with DCB, we have now begun to see the sequential growth that we've been expecting as more datasets are available. That basically help address this question, about the safety signal that that has been raised. And obviously the availability of the AV fistula data which was shown at the CIRSE meeting, basically showed we did not see that mortality signal in the one-year data for those datasets, and we saw very significant reductions in reintervention rates more than 50% reductions in reintervention in that AV fistula patient population, which we think will help not just NAV fistulas, which obviously expands DCB markets, but also is going to help us with the confidence in the SFA position. So those headwinds basically becoming mitigated is helpful. We also have the headwinds associated with the replacement cycle in especially pacemakers and in CRT-D devices that has begun to mitigate and even though we still see pressure in these traditional ICD segment CRT-D is the biggest single replacement component of our market. And obviously pacemakers are a big component as well. So whereas we've had the last couple of years of very significant headwinds, as we head into FY 2021 we are beginning to see that turn into a neutral impact on our overall growth market or growth trends, which then allows us to see the benefits of the new products that are coming into the market Obviously we talked about the Evolut PRO+ and the low-risk indication. We also are expecting eminently officially indication for the In.Pact Admiral will be introducing our new ICD family on the Galaxy platform, which the cobalt and chrome product lines which are going to add numerous feature set benefits that we'll talk about as we launch the product. We also have link 2 moving into the market here as we get to the end of the year, but probably the most important of those products is the Micro AV which we expect to have in the fourth quarter and that should help us with that fourth-quarter acceleration that Karen was talking about. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Danielle. We\u2019ll take one more question please Regina. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Raj Denhoy : Thank you. Good morning. Maybe a couple of questions. First for Karen, you know I think you described the decline in gross margins was because of currency, but also because of China tariffs. And I'm curious if you could maybe parse out, what is, what each of those is contributing to the decline in gross margins, and is there any view to any improvement in that you know if the tariffs get reduced or any relief there? Karen Parkhill : Yes thanks for the question Raj. We did see the most significant impact from FX. It was about 70 basis points on the gross margin. And then the China tariffs was a smaller impact. And in terms of gross margin going forward, we expect gross margin to be relatively stable to where it is today in the second quarter going forward. And we anticipate continuing to offset that with SG&A improvement as we further drive margin expansion. Raj Denhoy : Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just lastly on diabetes. And I appreciate the confidence in recovery, they're returning to growth as you move into next year. But I guess, you know when one thinks about the competitive landscape and diabetes, there's going to be some developments from your competitors on automated insulin delivery systems as well. And so the question is really how confident you are that 780G can get you where you need to go and whether you still need to have improvements on the CGM side of that business and particularly in order to see improving results? Michael Coyle : Yes, I think the 780G will take us a long way and it actually differentiates us in terms of the algorithm over anything that anyone has or from what we can see projecting. And so the advanced hybrid closed-loop system is really going to separate us from that dimension. I think with the sensor area, we still have work to do. And I think that's going to take a little longer, in reducing the number of fingersticks, where we continue to make progress, but that's going to be an area of pressure even going into next year, but we expect that there are many other benefits for the 780G in terms of not only the algorithm, but in terms of its capabilities that we will benefit from. So that's the way I'd look at it. The sensor area is going to take a little longer to completely resolved. We'll make incremental progress, but that's going to take a little longer. Raj Denhoy : Great. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Raj. Omar, any final words. Omar Ishrak : Well listen. Thank you all for your questions and on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q3 earnings call, which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday February 18th. So thank you all very much.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would like to hand the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fiscal year 2020 third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer and Geoff Martha, Medtronic President will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 24th, 2020. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and the revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. During today's earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. For this call, unless we say otherwise, rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis, which compares to the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 after adjusting for foreign currency. References to organic revenue growth, exclude the impact of our Titan Spine acquisition and currency. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported results for the third fiscal quarter, Revenue growth was light this quarter, reflecting a series of largely transient issues which I'll walk you through in a minute. The good news however is that this was more than offset by 90 basis points of operating margin expansion well ahead of our expectations resulting in strong EPS and free cash flow growth, both ahead of plan. Importantly, despite the top line shortfall this quarter, our Q4 outlook is unchanged, as we expect significant revenue growth acceleration excluding any impact from the coronavirus. Q3 revenue grew 2.9% in constant currency and 2.6% organic. Revenue growth fell short of our expectations, driven in part by customers curbing their purchasing ahead of our new product launches, principally in CVG and RTG. In MITG, we upgraded the group's ERP system in the U.S. and Canada to our company-wide system, resulting in a temporary slowdown in our ability to supply customers, which in some cases resulted in loss procedures and lasted longer in the quarter than we anticipated. That upgrade is now complete. And as of early this quarter we're in the process of returning to full supply. All of these items led to our quarterly revenue underperformance. We weren't able to offset these issues, given that many of them emerged late in the quarter. I'm not happy with this top line performance and we are focused on quickly addressing the dynamics that led to this result. Geoff will provide a little more color on this later on the call. Looking down the P&L, we drove significant operating leverage despite the softer top line. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points as we continue to see the benefits of our enterprise excellence initiatives, particularly on the SG&A line. We also had strong financial leverage, driven in part by the debt refinancing that we completed earlier this fiscal year. This resulted in adjusted EPS of a $1.44 which was $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 11.6% year-over-year. Let's take a look now at the drivers for our group performances, starting with our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 3.6% organic this quarter. RTG\u2019s performance was affected by customer buying patterns in BMP and the continued market slowdown and slide share loss in Pain Stim ahead of our DTM therapy launch. On an organic basis, our overall spine division was flat this quarter, reflecting customer drawdown of infuse inventory. Despite this, our Core Spine business grew 2% both globally and in the U.S. In addition when you include sales of enabling technology sold by our Brain Therapies division, which is how our competitors report, Core Spine grew 5% organically both globally and in the U.S. well above market. Our surgical synergy strategy is resulting in increased sales of our Core Spine implants, driven by surgeon\u2019s use of our capital equipment, in particular our Mazor robot. It is also benefiting our Brain Therapies division, which sells the capital equipment used in spine surgery. Brain Therapies delivered another above market quarter of 9.2% growth. In neurosurgery, which grew low double-digits, we had strong growth in Mazor robotics where we are meaningfully outpacing the competition, as well as in StealthStation navigation, O-arm imaging and our new Midas Rex MR8 systems. In Brain Therapies, our market-leading Neurovascular business had another strong quarter with mid teens growth driven by mid 20s growth in ischemic stroke and strong adoption of our Solitaire X stent retriever, Riptide Aspiration System and React catheters. In pain therapies, the pain Stim market had another sluggish quarter and we had some slight share loss ahead of the launch of the Stimgenics DTM therapy on our Intellis platform. We're excited about the response we received from physicians and the broader SCS community following the acquisition announcement and Stimgenics data presentation last month at NANS as well as on our nine year battery warranty on Intellis. We continue to be optimistic about the outlook for the Pain Stim market and have begun training physicians on the DTM waveform. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 3.2% organic, including flat results in the U.S. MITGs performance this quarter was affected by the upgrade of its ERP system in the U.S. and Canada which caused some temporary slowdown in our ability to supply customers with the full breadth of our products and in some cases resulted in loss procedures. This was however a transient issue. The ERP upgrade is now complete and the related supply slowdown are behind us as of this month. Within MITG, our Surgical Innovations Division grew 3.6% this quarter, driven by our Advanced Surgical business, particularly in Advanced Energy, which grew in the high single digits on strength in our LigaSure franchise and sales of our Valleylab FT10 energy platform. Respiratory, GI and renal division grew 2.2%, driven by low double digit growth in our GI Solutions business and high single digit growth in pulse oximetry sensors and advanced parameter sensors. In our Cardiac and Vascular group we grew 1.8% this quarter, which was below our expectations, due in part to customers holding back their purchasing ahead of new product launches in CRHF. We saw high single digit declines in our High Power business as customer\u2019s awaited approval of our Cobalt and Crome devices which have launched this month in Europe and are expected to launch in the U.S. during Q1. In heart failure, although our LVAD business has anniversaried the headwinds we faced over the past year, the business declined in the low single digits and hasn't returned to the growth levels we were expecting. The other driver of our below expectation CVG performance was our U.S. TAVR business, which grew 13% this quarter below the market growth rate. While the TAVR market has been rapidly expanding, we currently have fully experienced field support coverage in a little more than two thirds of the approximately 700 U.S. centers performing TAVR. We began aggressively hiring and training new field personnel months ago. However, our data shows that its taking longer than expected for our new reps to reach full productivity. We plan to certify an additional 70 field personnel by the end of this fiscal year. We expect our US TAVR performance to improve relative to the market going forward, as our expanded field organization reaches full productivity and we focus the market on the hemodynamic benefits of Evolut PRO+ platform and the launch of our new Confida sheath. Outside the US, our TAVR market share grew modestly in Q3. Our pacing business grew in the high single digits, well above the market, driven by our exclusive Micra leadless pacemaker and AZURE family of conventional pacemakers. We announced the Micra AV approval in the last week of our quarter and are excited about its growth potential, as it expands the Micra target population from 15% to 55% of pacemaker patients. While we did not have revenue from Micra AV in the third quarter, we are already seeing strong interest in early adoption of this new technology in the fourth quarter. In diabetes we grew 0.8%, slightly ahead of expectations. Our U.S. business declined in the low double digits which is anticipated and resulted from competitor challenges, while we await our new products. We're seeing strong enrollment in our Next Tech Pathway program, which allows purchasers of the MiniMed 670G to upgrade for free to our next-generation pump when launched. Keep in mind that as a result of this program we are currently deferring a portion of the revenue of our pump sales, which we will recognize when patients trade in their 670G for the next generation pump. In markets outside the United States, which represents just under half of our diabetes revenue, we had solid mid teens growth, driven by the continued adoption of the MiniMed 670G. This demand is not only driving strong growth in our installed base, it is also resulting in double digit growth in recurring revenue from CGM and other consumables. Now turning to emerging markets, which represented 17% of our revenue. In Q3 we grew emerging markets 14% with contributions from geographies around the globe. China grew 14% as in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe grew 16%, which included 39% growth in Russia. In addition South Asia grew 13% and the Middle East and Africa and Latin America grew 125. We continue to drive strong growth in these markets as we optimize the distribution channel and in certain markets localize R&D and manufacturing. Regarding the coronavirus, our top concern is the health and well-being of our employees in China and across the globe. We have activated response teams in China, the Asia-Pacific region and globally and we remain vigilant in monitoring the virus and taking action as necessary. All of our manufacturing operations are up and running in China. We're committed to helping the Chinese government and Chinese physicians address this crisis. As the Chinese healthcare system is focused on containing the spread of the virus, hospitals in China have experienced a slowing of medical device procedure rates and we are seeing procedure delays. We do expect this to have a negative impact on our fourth quarter financial results. But given the fluidity of this situation the duration and magnitude of the impact are difficult to quantify at this time. Now turning to our product pipeline. As we look forward, we're excited about what lies ahead, as investments we made in our product pipeline begin to pay off by accelerating our revenue growth and creating value for our shareholders. We have recently received approval, launched a number of new products that we expect to contribute to our growth going forward. I mentioned earlier, the U.S. approval of our Micra AV peacemaker and the launch that is now underway. We also received U.S. approval for our IN.PACT Admiral AV fistula indication, which expands the market potential of our drug coated balloons. We received U.S. approval and are launching our Stealth Autoguide cranial robotic system. In Europe, we recently received CE Mark approval for our Cobalt and Crome portfolio of BlueSync-enabled high-power devices, our InterStim Micro rechargeable implantable sacral neuromodulation device and InterStim SureScan MRI leads as well as our Percept PC DBS device with BrainSense technology. And over the next few quarters we expect approval and launch of a number of additional new products. We expect U.S. approval of the Cobalt and Crome high-power devices, Reveal LINQ 2.0 insertable cardiac monitor, InterStim Micro and InterStim SureScan MRI leads and our Percept PC DBS device. We're also expecting European launch of the MiniMed 780G and our DiamondTemp ablation catheter. Regarding our MiniMed 780G in the US, we intend to file our adult clinical data with the FDA in March which will push expected approval beyond the fiscal year end. In Pain Stim, we unveiled DTM spinal cord stim last month at the NANS conference and are now training our field force on this novel waveform, with an expected limited launch in Q4 and full launch in Q1. In MITG we continue to make progress in our soft tissue robotics program. Last week we announced the acquisition of Digital Surgery, a pioneer in artificial intelligence and analytics for surgery. They lead the industry with their unique Touch Surgery ecosystem of products, including AI that identify surgical steps and instrumentation. These products can be leveraged to provide insight into the procedure time, cost and process to improve surgical care. We're excited about utilizing the strength and capability of digital surgery to advance our minimally invasive and robotic surgery platforms. We also have a number of important upcoming data presentations, starting with the use case data under extreme conditions for our advanced hybrid closed-loop algorithm at ATTD later this week. Next month ACC will be a big conference for us. Data from our OFF-MED renal denervation pivotal trial will be presented, as well as data for both low-risk bicuspid and leaflet immobility for our TAVR program. Also we will share risk stratification data for our TYRX anti-infection product. And finally, in June at ADA we expect to present the U.S. pivotal data for our MiniMed 780G advanced hybrid closed-loop system. These are just some of the near-term highlights from our pipeline. Importantly, we're continuing to invest in building out a robust long term pipeline of continuous innovation, invention and disruption. I mentioned earlier that we expect significant acceleration in our fourth quarter revenue growth, driven in part by our pipeline and excluding the impact of the coronavirus. And as we look to our FY \u201921, we expect our top line momentum to continue as we get the increasing benefit of the FY \u201820 product launches, as well as the products slated to launch next fiscal year. With that, let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our third quarter financials and forward outlook. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you. As Omar mentioned, we delivered third quarter organic revenue growth of 2.6% and adjusted EPS with a $1.44 growing 11.6%. We ultimately came in $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance and would attribute $0.02 to better than expected foreign exchange and $0.04 to operational outperformance, including tax. Our adjusted gross margin was 69.7% down year-over-year due in part to increased China tariff. We more than offset that decline with strong operating leverage, as we continue to implement and drive efficiencies and improvements across the company, while at the same time making investments ahead of upcoming product launches. This led to an adjusted operating margin improvement of 90 basis points or 70 basis points excluding the impact of currency. Below the operating profit line, our adjusted interest expense declined 36%, driven by our successful debt issuance and tender transactions that we completed last spring and summer. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 13.6% lower than we expected due to increased deductions from the exercise of employee stock options and benefits from finalizing taxes owed uncertain returns. As you know generating strong free cash flow remains a priority across the company and you are seeing this focus come through in our results. Third quarter free cash flow with $2.1 billion, up 21% from last year, and year-to-date free cash flow was $4.9 billion, representing a conversion ratio of 90% well above our full year target of 80% plus. We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment, balancing investment in R&D and tuck-in acquisitions to drive future growth, while returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders and year-to-date we've returned $2.8 billion or 57% of the cash we generated, resulting in a total shareholder payout of 51% on adjusted net earnings. Now turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we are comfortable with current Street consensus on organic revenue growth and EPS, to any impact from the coronavirus. We expect overall organic top line growth of approximately 4.5%. By group, we expect CVG to grow 4.25% to 4.5%, MITG, 6.25 to 6.5%, RTG approximately 4% percent organic, and diabetes to be flat to down low single digits. And based on recent rates currency would have a negative impact of 80 to 140 basis points. On margins, we continue to expect our full year operating margin to expand by roughly 40 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by our enterprise excellence initiative. For the fourth quarter, we expect our operating margin to be up slightly including the impact of currency or roughly flat on a constant currency basis, as we invest to support current and upcoming product launches. Below the operating line, we expect our fourth quarter interest expense to be approximately $160 million to $165 million and our fourth quarter adjusted nominal tax rate to be around 16%, which would put our annual rate at approximately 15% lower than we originally expected and reflecting the benefits we have had so far this year. We are raising our fiscal year 20 EPS guidance to a range of $5.63 to $5.65, up from $5.57 to $5.63 and reflecting our third quarter bottom line outperformance. For the fourth quarter we expect a $1.62 to a $1.64. As mentioned upfront all of the guidance I just gave excludes the impact of the coronavirus, because the situation is so fluid it is difficult to truly quantify the impact just a few weeks into our quarter and for that reason we plan to provide an update for you later this quarter. Finally, I would like to note that we plan to hold our Biennial Institutional Investor and Analyst Day on Tuesday June 2nd in New York City. Back to you Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Karen. Id now like Geoff to make some remarks in the quarter and the outlook. Geoff? Geoffrey Martha : Thank you, Omar. There are a number of positive things from the quarter that I want to highlight. But first I'd like to address our top line performance. Even though much of it was transient we did not perform at the level we were expecting and the drivers surfaced at the end of the quarter. We just can't have surprises like this, for us nor for you. And we are making changes. At our upcoming Investor Day in June, I'm going to walk you through what innovation driven growth means for Medtronic and a comprehensive set of initiatives to take full advantage of the pipeline. These initiatives are meant to ensure we see the acceleration of our revenue from the pipeline and to improve our predictability. On that note, I want to discuss an aspect of our plan to address the surprise we saw this quarter. One issue is the weighting of our revenue to the final month of the quarter, which leaves us susceptible to surprises late in the game like what happened this quarter. Too often our largest orders come in at the end of the month. This dynamic makes the business challenging to manage, it stresses our operations and it really makes it difficult to mitigate headwinds that pop up within the quarter. So to fix this, we will change our current operating mechanisms, certain internal metrics and some incentives as well. And I want to flag the opportunity coming up with our extra week in Q1. The impact of the changes that I just mentioned likely won't be contained in a given quarter. So I'd like to use a good portion of the benefit that we would get from the extra week in Q1 to launch these initiatives. So when we guide to the first quarter we will give you guidance on an underlying basis, excluding the benefit of the extra week. And we'll give you an estimate of the benefit of the extra week net of these changes. Like I said, we plan to discuss these and other changes during our Investor Day. But I want to assure you one thing that I'm on this and we are taking the appropriate actions to improve consistency and avoid future surprises. Now before I close and we get to Q&A, I've got to highlight a number of good things that occurred this quarter. Accomplishments that I believe can't get lost in this quarter's narrative. First we drove a better operating margin despite the light top line and free cash flow was outstanding. These are two things that we've been working on for a long time. Over the past couple of years, we've taken action on both of these areas and we feel really good about the operating rigor and the culture we've put in place to drive the bottom line and improve cash flow. Also emerging markets growth continues to be strong for us. They represented 17% of our revenue and once again grew strong double digits, 14% this quarter. We think of emerging markets actually as an independent growth factor for the company and we have to acknowledge the progress with our pipeline. We are starting to see approvals and launches come through for important and innovative products and there's more to come. Yes, the slowed purchasing ahead of these launches hurt us in some businesses this quarter, but this is going to turn. Customers are really excited about our new offerings. I like to end by saying that the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong. We have a full pipeline that will accelerate our revenue growth and take share not just next quarter but next year and beyond. We're very excited about the future of the company. The new technology that we're bringing to market, the impact this will have on patients and physicians and the value we're going to bring and generate for our shareholders. All right, back to you Omar. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Geoff. I couldn't agree more with the approach that we are taking, and I'm just as excited about our outlook going forward. Before we start Q&A, I'd like to briefly note that we currently anticipate holding our Q4 earnings call which will be my last earnings call on Thursday May the 21st. Let's now move on to Q&A, in addition to Karen, Geoff and me our four group Presidents, Mike Coyle, Bob White, Brett Wall and Sean Salmon, are also here to answer your questions. As usual we want to try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question and if necessary a related follow up. If you have additional questions please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator first question please? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Thank you and good morning. Just I'll state both questions upfront to make it easy. First, I was wondering, in CVG, if we could drill down a little bit on ICDs given the weakness in the quarter and I ask because you know Boston Scientific also saw weakness in the quarter in their high power ICD business and the timing of your new launch you shouldn't really be a surprise. So I guess my first question is how can you have confidence that this isn't just a slower market? So that's question number one. And then the thing I also love a quick comment on is that, I realize it's too early for formal fiscal 2021 guidance, but you guys have talked a lot about accelerating growth in fiscal 2021, so are you still comfortable accelerating off of that 4.5% that we'll see hopefully in the fourth quarter on the same selling day basis? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Thanks, Bob. Mike Coyle is the right person to address the ICD questions. Go ahead, Mike. Michael Coyle : Yeah, we're not seeing anything that would cause us to have a concern that the overall market for ICD is somehow slowing significantly. Most of the challenges that we have in ICDs remain the issue associated with the replacement cycle and the fact that we were seeing essentially mid teens declines in year-over-year comparisons on replacement. As I've mentioned before that actually gets better as we get through the year and into next year, especially in the CRT-D area. And that is going to help us in terms of acceleration the ICD side. But the other point and you pointed out the surprise to us in terms of weakness in the number for the quarter was really in EMEA, in Europe and Middle East and Africa. That was where essentially we believe customers were holding off given the imminent launch of our Cobalt and Crome product families which now have launched into the market. And those products will be coming to the United States during the first quarter. The other thing that depressed the overall performance relative to where we thought we would be during the quarter is the fact that the TYRX anti-infective envelopes get captured under the ICD numbers when we report externally. And I think you may recall last quarter we had a fairly major you know, quality driven back order situation that we expected would be resolved completely during the course of Q3. We actually lost a number of \u2013 lots of product manufacturing, lots of product early in the quarter which now has stabilized. In fact, through the second half we're completely out of any kind of constraints on supply. So we expect that will flow through into the numbers in Q4 and obviously into next year, especially as we have new data that we'll be presenting at ACC on risk stratification for TYRX. So we think all of those things are going to help us accelerate the ICD market not only in Q4 but into next year. Bob Hopkins : Okay. Thanks, Mike. I think, Karen, you're the best person to take the question. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. Thanks for the question on \u201821 Bob. Yeah, we're excited about our pipeline and what it has to offer for FY \u201821. I'd love to talk a lot about it, but we're close to finalizing our plan, so we'll give the official guidance on our Q4 call as you know. That said, I would think about accelerating growth for next year off of a full year basis as opposed to off of a sequential basis. And we're very confident in our growth acceleration of FY \u201821 over FY \u201820. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Thanks, Bob. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Just \u2013 maybe just one quick question for me here. Karen just to confirm for your last question is the right way to think about fiscal 20, I'm assuming a sort of 3.5% to 4%, but my one question I'll keep it to one is just to give a 4Q guidance I appreciate it's in line with consensus, but I think about Omar and Geoff\u2019s comments about RTG and CVG, it seems like the 3Q dynamics getting better into the fourth. Shouldn't the fourth quarter be stronger as we see some of this catch up revenues? If you just help us quantify the third quarter issues and offer some clarity what fourth quarter implies in terms of recovery and drivers of acceleration. Thanks so much. Karen Parkhill : So let me take the beginning of it and then I'll let my colleague jump in too. So in terms of FY \u201820 that our fourth quarter guidance would imply FY \u201820 growth of 3.6%, 3.7%-ish [ph] And then on fourth quarter clearly because of the transient issues in the third quarter we expect some of that to come back. You know if you look at MITG and the ERP issues that we've talked about, we fully expect that to come back. And that's one of the reasons that we've guided MITG to you know above trend for the quarter. That we have lost some procedures, and those won't come back. Omar Ishrak : I think I don't know if I can add anything to that. You know, really the procedure losses in a business like MITG where the procedures happened that just isn't going to come back, will recover fully. I think in other areas like in the MCS business or LVAD business you know, that was share loss and there's pressure there and our growth is probably going to be lower than we were originally anticipating. So in balance we felt that holding the Q4 sort of previous guidance was the appropriate thing to do at this stage. We're obviously doing everything we can do to maximize that number. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thank you, David. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robby Marcus with JPMorgan. Robby Marcus : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if we could shift to some of the product lines and specifically TAVR here, 13% worldwide growth came in a lot lower than the Street was expecting, you had the first full quarter of the low risk launch in the U.S., you're a competitor it did a lot better than this. Maybe talk to exactly what happened in the quarter, the dynamics in the U.S. and how you expect this to continue throughout fourth quarter and \u201921? Thanks. Omar Ishrak : Mike, you want to take this? Michael Coyle : Yeah, Robby. Obviously we were very disappointed with the performance in the US. If you look outside the US we - the implant growth rates were in the high teens and pretty much in line with the overall market. Actually a little better than the overall market because of the Japan influence. But in the United States obviously well below market with implant rates in the mid teens, whereas we would estimate the market in the quarter probably grew on the order of the low 30s. As we dug into that, we obviously headed into the holidays actually feeling pretty good that we were looking at implant rates in the low 20s. Obviously in retrospect that turns out to be lower than the market. But as we headed into the end of the year and into January, we saw a pretty meaningful decline in overall growth rates for implants and we dug deeply into that to figure out which accounts and where we were having the issues. And basically I think learning from that analysis was that it takes longer than we thought to have our reps become fully competitive in this market. It's probably a 9 to 12 month training exercise which in retrospect we probably should have ramped up in advance of this several quarters earlier than we did. The good news is that as we looked at the hiring that we did do, this quarter we expect to bring on 70 new sales reps and support personnel which is going to help us go from you know, given the 700 accounts that are selling ICD or selling - that are servicing this market, we probably have seasoned sales rep that is those who have a year or more experience in about two thirds of those accounts, by the time we exit with these new certifications that we would expect to be closer to 80% in terms of supporting that and we're also accelerating new hiring based on the driving support for our next fiscal year. So we think those you know, just to catch up in terms of training and deployment, plus you, know we're pushing much more close interval management of the reps that are out there to make sure that we're staying on top of developments in these accounts. We think that that coupled with obviously our new product launch around Evolut PRO+; the launch of the Confida sheath, which really improves the performance of our overall device systems and then new data that will be coming out here at ACC around both bicuspid and leaflet immobility, should basically give us an opportunity to accelerate from where we were in Q4 or in Q3. And that you know, basically looking at just the daily sales rates here as we've headed into the new quarter with this new focus on rep productivity, we are seeing some acceleration from those numbers that you see in terms of the mid teens implant rates. And so I'm confident we're going to see acceleration, whether we'll get all the way back to market, you know, given that we have two competitors who are driving share in those accounts it may take more than a quarter to do that. But on the other hand I do expect to see acceleration during the quarter. Robby Marcus : Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Robby. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had two quick ones. One, Surgical Robotics, I think you mentioned some software updates just on time line there, you know, MITG, you have sequential acceleration. Is there anything baked on the robotic side there? And second, on margins. I appreciate the comments on you know, FX hedge gains you know, when you look at next year I think Geoff made some comments and changing incentives, so maybe just talk about margins for next year, are we still looking at in a constant currency you know, in the 40 to 50 basis points of expansion? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Let me \u2013 Bob, will probably answer this. But you know, I'll just say off the bat that robotics is not in our financial numbers yet, and the overall program is more or less on track. So\u2026 Robert White : That's right, Omar. Thanks, Vijay for the question. To reiterate, first off, no updates from what we talked about at JPMorgan relative to the program, so it's just good news. And then the sequential acceleration of MITGs business is really all about us coming out of the ERP implementation, now that we've got that back on track and the system is running smoothly. So I hope that does it for you Vijay. Vijay Kumar : And then on the margins guys? Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Vijay. On margins for next year, we're going to continue to look at margin expansion, as we drive bottom line growth about top line growth every year. At this stage we haven't changed our long range guidance of 40 basis points constant currency margin expansion. So you can assume that at this stage. Vijay Kumar : Thanks, guys. Omar Ishrak : I can tell you Vijay, there is a focus in the organization around that. We've worked very hard to get a - an accountability around that. And you know, we're going to - you're going to - that's going to stay. We just need to fix our top line growth back to where it deserves to be based on our product pipeline. Vijay Kumar : Appreciate the comments Omar. Omar Ishrak : Okay. Thanks, Vijay. Ryan Weispfenning : Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS. Matt Taylor : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So the first one I want to ask was just on MITG ERP transition. I was wondering if that impacted any of the business lines within MITG more than the others. And are you seeing underlying share loss there. Or share gains. Can you talk about the underlying trends? Omar Ishrak : Go ahead. Robert White : Yes. Let me take that Omar. Matt, thanks for the question. The impact of the ERP transition affected all of the MITG product lines as we migrated into the single SAP system for Medtronic. And you know certainly we lost some procedures where we weren't able to ship products to customers. So while we think we lost procedures given the middle months of the quarter, we don't believe we necessarily lost a significant amounts of share. But certainly now that we're back on track with ERP system we're back to fulfilling those customer requirements. Matt Taylor : Thanks. Just a follow for Mike or the team there. So it sounds like you're seeing a little bit of an improvement in the DCB trends at least in the U.S.. Could you speak to that and whether you think we could see any kind of continued uptick there or a change in the FDA stance at some point during the year? Omar Ishrak : Go ahead Mike. Michael Coyle : Sure. We are seeing some modest improvement obviously as more data sets come in, they are providing more comfort to physicians and FDA for that matter I believe, that the signal that had been observed in those first three randomized trials around SFA seem not consistent with the new data coming in. Obviously one big dataset that we filed and got approval for was the AV fistula indication for DCB, which did not show this mortality signal in the paclitaxel arm. And we expect additional data to be coming out on that topic, including at the ACC where we think there'll be a presentation of a major data set based on claims, analysis. So that is creating a greater sense of confidence in the physician base that the significant morbidity issues that come with not using these drug-coated balloons and just using PTA balloons are beginning to get attention. And I think what we expect to see is continued improvement as data sets provide that - that level of comfort. So in this quarter we did see, on sort of selling day [ph] adjusted basis some sequential growth which is encouraging in the DCB and we expect if the data continue to come in as positive as they have that we'll see that continue. Matt Taylor : Thank you, Mike. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Matt. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Kristen Stewart : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask Sean if you could just provide us his overall thoughts on diabetes since kind of taking over the role. And then if we could just kind of get an update on 780G, it sounds like that is getting pushed a little on the US into next fiscal year or maybe just some thoughts around timeline there? Thanks. Sean Salmon : Sure. Thanks, Kristen. So as you know the diabetes business certainly has no small challenges to overcome, but I can tell you I'm really very encouraged with how we're seeing some derisking of the pipeline that we have going forward, in particular that sensor pipeline. I'm convinced that we've figured that out and it's a bit of time for us to get the pipeline flowing there. The 780G is an important catalyst for us to drive growth and we expect that to begin. We have filed the CE mark for that device, and we are anticipating, as Omar said, putting the clinical data module in the March timeframe. That review is going well. We're very interactive with FDA that we'll be meeting with them later this week and we'll give more update on exactly when the timing is as we get more information on it. So far we're happy what we're seeing both in the algorithms and you'll see some of that later this week as we stress the algorithm into some challenging conditions that will be announced at ATDD and that data flow and you'll see the full data set coming up at the ADA in June. So I'm seeing a lot of encouraging things as there are things to clean up obviously. We've got to get the new product flow going and we're confident that we'll be doing that starting soon. Kristen Stewart : And then just your comments around the derisking, particularly around the sensors. Can you just expand upon that? Do you think there's an opportunity to bring forward some of the sensor timelines? Sean Salmon : Kris, I think the first thing is to meet the criteria for iCGM, and I'm confident that we're going to be able to demonstrate that, we'll have more information on that in the coming meeting. But probably at Analyst Day we'll show you some more of that. Its too early to comment on accelerated timing, but that's certainly the goal to push as fast as we can into the marketplace. Kristen Stewart : Perfect. Thanks, Sean. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Kristen. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum with SunTrust. Kaila Krum : Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. So one quick one to clarify and then a question on the business. So on the coronavirus, I think you may have mentioned this but again just to clarify. Will you give full transparency on your China business performance in the fourth quarter? Karen Parkhill : Yes. We will. And we do disclose our growth rate in China already. So we will we will continue to disclose that. We will be transparent about the impact of the coronavirus. Kaila Krum : Perfect. And then there's - there's obviously a lot of new product launches coming in the next few quarters. But I mean obviously it can be challenging to predict that the timing and the impact of when those new launches contribute. So I'm just curious how you're modeling your product contribution in the fourth quarter and as part of that re acceleration in the business? Thank you. Omar Ishrak : Well there are some that are pretty clear, things like the Micra AV, which launched last quarter is now in full steam and moving ahead well, and that one you know we're projecting a strong - strong success. There are others like the in the spinal cord stimulation market, we just launched the Stimgenics waveform on the Intellis platform. That's picking up. That you know, we were a little more guarded about that because that's newer. But for sure that's going to help us in the spinal cord stimulation market. Things like Cobalt and Crome in Europe, again, we have a history there and we can - we can project historically what such - that kind of improvement has caused and where we're going to put that into a model. So you know there's a mix of the level of you know sort of confidence intervals we have in these projections some very tight and you know Micra being one of the biggest drivers is very tight. The other is a little more unknown but positive nonetheless. I think that's the best I can do - or anyone else here, any products I've missed or any comments, you guys? Brett Wall : We've recently we've recently launched the Micro which is the new public health product in Europe which you know we're excited about that and the possibility for that looking to late spring launch in the United States. And then Percept, which is the new DBS with brain sensor technology has just launched in Europe. Similar timeframes in the U.S. approval and we're getting good uptake on that. So those are two very interesting platforms for us in the neuromodulation space. Michael Coyle : And the other thing I would mention is the DiamondTemp ablation catheter CE mark that we expect during the quarter which would obviously be even more of a benefit in Q1 of next year, as well as we're just in the early stages of the launch of the AV fistula indication for the IN.PACT Admiral balloon, so those will now get full quarter benefit during Q4. Omar Ishrak : I think to your question about how we project these you know, there's a historical sort of comparison that we can make against similar such launches and based on that we make a judgment in our in our planning and from that we derive guidance and our plan going forward. So there's a variety of that, but you know there's some judgment involved with this. Kaila Krum : Thanks, guys. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Kaila. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, could you please put a finer point on the launch timing of that Cobalt and Crome in the U.S. and LINQ 2.0. What quarter are you expecting it. And Brett, on SNM, what are you seeing - for sacral neuromodulation, what are you seeing from the new competitor and what are your expectations for that business before micro is approved in the U.S. in late spring which I heard you say a minute ago. Thanks for taking the questions guys. Michael Coyle : So Larry on Cobalt and Crome, we would expect that in the first quarter of next year probably in the first half of that quarter and then for LINQ 2.0 we would expect that product also in Q1 but in the second half of the quarter. Brett Wall : Yeah, then Larry on public health and on the Micro I think we you know expect some near-term slowing here with that particular product given the competition, the Micro itself in Europe has been received very well, just as a reminder it's about half the size of the competitive device, the recharge experiences significantly better and with the SureScan leads, leads, it is 1.5 and 3 Tesla full body conditional. So we're very, very excited about that product when it comes to the market in United States. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Larry. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Matt Miksic : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I just have one on coronavirus and one on sort of the simplicity spiral timeline and post the data at ACC. So on corona, I understand a little bit early to put a finer point on the impact for Q4, but if you could maybe give us some sense of what the major moving parts are. I think we have about $2 billion dollars in China revenue round numbers, approximately kind of an annual run rate there. Obviously it's a moving target but you know things like what an impact in Q4 likely you know based on what you know now sort of come back in early Q, you know how transitory is that impact? And then on Spyral, just maybe walk through us with forward for us the timeline of what happens after OFF-MED and what that looks like as you continue to develop that that program? Omar Ishrak : Okay. Let me take the coronavirus question first, first of all we're pretty clear about where would our China businesses, it's roughly 7% of our global business. So you know you can - you can do the estimate there. You know the variables right now, one variable is that we've got to get our factories up and running so that we can supply you know different places in the world including China. And that is actually progressing well. But the main factor driving the number there will be the procedure uptake in China. You know China was in a complete shutdown mode for the first half of February and they're just beginning to start and even now even in places like Beijing and others procedures are only just beginning it's too early to tell how that will ramp up to the rest of the quarter. We know that in Hubei Province for example obviously shut down but that's solely a you know 5% of China there. But you know the rest of China in places like Beijing and Shanghai right now there are procedure delays. In addition to that a lot of physicians are being asked to actually go and help with the virus. And so you know there are many dynamics here that really difficult to predict. Now once the things stabilized it could well be a ramp back up. And because you know people need the procedures they've - they will get them at some point. When that happens is very difficult to predict right now. So that's why we're saying that wait till a little later in the quarter when we have some more data and see how things progressive we'll give you a full update. So with that, I am going to ask Mike to take the renal. Michael Coyle : So our renal denervation, obviously, the first big milestone will be the pivotal trial on the OFF-MED, which will be presented here at ACC. But there is the second trial that is ongoing in parallel which is the ON MED trial. Unlike the OFF-MED, it has a six month efficacy endpoint. So if I were to set expectations for when those data were to become available I would expect that about a year from now. So about this time next year. In terms of the FDA interaction the ON MED or the OFF-MED data will be used in a modular submission as we know along with obviously the device supporting materials. So we think we can get the process with FDA to move forward and we do think we need the OFF-Med \u2013 excuse me, the ON MED data set in order to get final approval for the product and certainly it will be very important in terms of reimbursement to have those data. So that would be how I would set expectations. Obviously I think you know this final product is available in Europe currently and it does have CE Mark. So as these data sets become available you know customers can evaluate them and decide how they want to use that product. Matt Miksic : Great. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Matt. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Mike, I just want to circle back on the 4Q CVG growth outlook. It sounds like some of the headwinds there like LVADs and TAVR may take at least another quarter to address. I'd imagine that there's potentially some risk that U.S. ICD growth slows ahead of those launches just like we saw in Europe. So Micra AV should help, there's a couple of things that go your way which is the confidence in driving that acceleration in the fourth quarter? Thanks. Michael Coyle : Sure. I think as you point out you know, we have lowered our expectations for the LVAD numbers just based on you know not seeing the sequential share capture in Q3 that we had seen in Q2. You know, it's some competitive indications approvals. But on the other hand you know obviously we got the Micro AV early in terms of you know we expected that it would be later in the quarter when we were setting guidance last quarter and the customer response has been strong in terms of interest in the technology. And as a reminder this is a product that carries a 3x price uplift relative to a standard dual chamber system and our indications for use cover all AV patients. So we expect that an opportunity to drive this product meaningfully into the market above what we were thinking a quarter ago when we were giving guidance for Q4. In addition although obviously the Cobalt and Crome products won't be in the US they will be in Europe. And so unlike last quarter where we really had no meaningful new products and we saw the customers pausing and while waiting for new products. Now we have a number of new products globally that are obviously going to make a difference for us. And so net, net we're pretty much holding our expectations for growth where we were a quarter ago despite the moving pieces in this quarter. Chris Pasquale : And does the guidance contemplate a pause in U.S. I see the orders ahead of those launches? Michael Coyle : It certainly shows no meaningful acceleration in those - in those numbers, so its something along the lines of what we've had. And as I said we're also seeing some improvement in the replacement cycle generally because of the CRT-D side of things. And the other thing I should mention is obviously we will anniversary in March the paclitaxel issue, which was a big step down in the prior year quarter which gives us just an easier comp to work with as we've seen sequential growth on a selling base basis the last couple of quarters in DCB. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Omar Ishrak : I don\u2019t disagree that TYRX, although we won't get to share capture this quickly. We certainly have sequential growth. Michael Coyle : Absolutely. That we were constrained for more than half of last quarter in terms of supply and now we are essentially unconstrained. And in addition, we are expecting to get labeling expansion to one year dating on that product in the United States which will help us significantly in terms of just the logistics of its growth. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Chris. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. To follow up on Rob's question on U.S. TAVR, I understand if sales rep issues are holding back growth of new accounts. But are the sales reps really holding back growth and establish accounts. Is that where the growth is falling? Is it from the new accounts or from established accounts? Thanks so much. Omar Ishrak : Yeah, it's a great question. Actually what happened was there was a tremendous focus on launching the Evolut PRO+ as well as opening up the NCD accounts. And what we wound up doing because of the relative maturity of a good bit of our field force is pulling reps who were supporting large accounts to help with that expansion into new accounts. And obviously with a new competitor entering the market, and you know some complex messaging having to come in as well as you know low risk patients were approved. It just proved to be too much. We were spreading our field too thin. And so you know obviously we've refocused back into those large accounts to make sure that our messaging around hemodynamics, the benefits of the Evolut PRO+ in terms of profile are now adding the pericardial wrap into the large device segment and then obviously just selling the benefit to the hemodynamic data that was presented at ACC a year ago. Those are things now that we believe are helping to show this acceleration in growth that I referenced as we head into this quarter versus where we were in January. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Pito. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Matthew O'Brien: Morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'll just stick with one. Geoff, I appreciate you don't want to say much about this new program that's going to implement until Investor Day in June. But you know we've seen contract manufacturers do something like this before but never really a manufacturing company do something like this. So can you just talk about the potential economic impacts to Medtronic. I mean, do you have to scale to kind of you know work through some of these things on the top line if you're going to be better pricing there to be a little bit of gross margin pressure or longer term so there's some free cash flow impacts here. So just how do we think about you know some of the puts and takes here of this new program? Geoffrey Martha : Yeah. Well you know, look - and just one clarification on when I spoke about, I think this is the second question around where some of these changes impact are margins and the answer to that is no, right. We've you know we're talking about focus on increasing our revenue and the overall revenue growth, as well as the consistency and predictability of that revenue growth, but we don't want to take a step back on them - on the margin improvement that we've - that we've built up and the cash flow conversion improvements that we had done over the last couple years as a result of our - these are sustainable changes from our enterprise excellence program. So we don't want to take a step back on that. What I mentioned this morning, on this morning's call was a very specific changes that we want to make to improve orders that are coming in late in the quarter. We have a couple of our larger orders, you know, that were coming in late in the quarter which stresses our system and we've got to execute better really to get those in earlier. We're putting too much pressure on the last month and that that's specifically what I spoke of this morning. And what I hinted at for Investor Day was more on what are we doing to realize the full benefits of the pipeline. We look - the fundamentals of the business are strong. What I mean by that specifically you guys know the markets are doing well. We have a good market share positions, but more importantly in terms of momentum the product pipeline is coming to fruition here. So we need to make sure that we put the right programs in place to realize the full benefits of that pipeline you know, around commercial execution. So that's we'll get into more of that on Investor Day. What I talked about this morning was more having a regular cadence - a moving some of our back end loading of our quarter and spreading that more evenly throughout the quarter. But nothing regarding you know, nothing change regarding margin. Matthew O'Brien: Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : All right. Thanks, Matt. I think we've got time for one more question please operator. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two questions for Karen on margins. Just on the gross margin pressure you've experienced so far in fiscal \u201820. Can use to help us understand the drivers of that. And is this and it's sub 70% level the new normal? Or is there a recovery path? And has it been FX, pricing pressure, mix shift? And then just on the other income tailwind that you've experienced in fiscal \u201820 outside of FX hedging can you talk about the drivers of that benefit and then how sustainable and predictable that line item will be going forward? Thanks for taking the questions. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. Thank you, Josh. No problem. So on gross margin one of the larger prices that we\u2019ve had on gross margin is the increase in China tariff. And as long as they stay that will be a continued pressure. Gross margin is obviously impacted by mix and as we introduce some of our key new products that should help gross margins going forward. And as we think about the net other expense or income line item, we had a benefit this quarter that was primarily driven by a swap program that we have in place to hedge the gains and losses that are part of our deferred compensation program and SG&A. And so that was really driven that. Our SG&A line would have been even better if it didn\u2019t have a loss that we effectively offset by a gain in net other. Josh Jennings : Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Josh. Omar, do you want to wrap up? Omar Ishrak : Yeah. Well, thank you all for your questions and behalf of the entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. Look we'll get this thing right. We've got a task to do here, we\u2019ll get acceleration growth profile in Q4 and that will continue into FY \u201921. Our product pipeline is strong and this team is committed behind it, we couldn\u2019t have \u2013 I couldn\u2019t have asked better team and more committed and we\u2019ll get this thing right, I assure you. And then we really look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q4 earnings call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's meeting. Thank you all for joining.

At this time, all participants' lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fiscal year 2020 fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chief Executive Officer; Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer; and Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Executive Chairman, will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020, which ended on April 24, 2020. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and the revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. During today's earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement given risks and uncertainties, including those related to the impact COVID-19 has had and is expected to continue to have on our business. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Finally, unless we say otherwise, revenue rates and ranges mentioned during this call are given on a constant currency basis, which compares to the fourth quarter after adjusting for foreign currency. References to organic revenue growth exclude the impact of our Titan Spine acquisition and currency. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.  With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chief Executive Officer, Geoff Martha. Geoff? Geoff Martha : Thanks, Ryan. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe. And our thoughts are with the many people who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. I'd like to recognize the incredible heroism, resolve and sacrifice of the frontline healthcare workers fighting COVID-19, as well as our employees are supporting them. Many of these frontline healthcare workers are our long time customers and friends, and we are continually inspired by their selfless efforts to care for others. As has been said, this pandemic presented the world with an unprecedented challenge, which requires an unprecedented response, including by our team at Medtronic. I'm extremely proud of the way our employees have risen to the occasion, and jumped in to help healthcare workers, governments and NGOs and for the way they've continued to support their communities and their families. Our top priority during this pandemic has been to ensure the health and well being of our 90,000 employees and their families around the globe. Our employees have been impacted by this virus like everyone else. But I'm grateful for the way our people have continued to do their jobs and persevere through these challenging circumstances. Whether that employee is an engineer working on the next innovation breakthrough, in our factories, making critical life saving products, a field rep assisting a physician on the front line with a medical procedure, or any of our employees working virtually, we're all fulfilling the Medtronic mission. We've taken a number of measures in our facilities around the world to protect our employees. And importantly, we've continued to invest in our employees during this time, including implementing reward and recognition programs for business-critical on-site workers. We're also protecting our sales reps from significant impacts to their incentive compensation during this period. And we've developed an extensive emergency leave policy to provide temporary pay for employees, who can't work remotely and are facing certain situations such as home schooling, childcare issues, or a positive COVID-19 diagnosis.  During the pandemic, we've been at the service of medical professionals and healthcare systems around the world, stepping up for physicians, hospitals, and health facilities that are on the frontlines. We've developed and rapidly deployed new remote procedure support and remote monitoring solutions to reduce patients\u2019 and clinicians\u2019 exposure to the virus causing COVID-19. We've hosted dozens of virtual forums and medical education programs to help physicians navigate the challenges of the pandemic. We've also worked tirelessly to make sure our products and therapies are readily available. The most visible example of these efforts is the work we've done to expand our ventilator capabilities and dramatically increase the ventilator production. Physicians asked us if we could engineer a way to adjust ventilator settings remotely, outside of the ICU and away from the patient. So we partnered with Intel to develop a solution that we brought to the market in a matter of weeks. Furthermore, we're on track to increase our production of ventilators fivefold from pre-pandemic levels by the end of next month. We've enlisted help of others to accomplish this, including SpaceX, who is working to supply a critical valve for our PB980. And we continue to closely partner with key government authorities to allocate our ventilators to the communities that need the most, including the recent focus on emerging markets. But we understood that simply increasing our own production volumes would not be enough. So we did what Medtronic does. Consistent with our mission, we put patients first. We decided to make our PB560 ventilator design specifications available at no cost, so other manufacturers can use these specs in manufacturing ventilators during the pandemic. Through this initiative, we're creating partnerships with large scale manufacturing companies such as Foxconn in the U.S., Baylis Medical in Canada, Vingroup in Vietnam, Walton Group in Bangladesh, and Tata Group in India. During this time of need, we've been supporting our communities. Since the start of the fourth quarter, Medtronic, along with the Medtronic Foundation has pledged more than $36 million monetary and product donations to nearly 50 non-profit organizations to support health systems, patients and vulnerable communities around the world. If you're interested in reading more on our response to our employees, our customers and our communities, I encourage you to visit our website, medtronic.com/covid19. Now, let me turn to our Q4 financial results, which has suffered due to COVID-19. Our revenues declined 25% both constant currency and organic. This resulted in EPS of $0.58, which was down 52%. These results are in-line with the press release we provided last month, where we discussed the expected negative impacts on our fourth quarter revenue resulting from a slowdown in procedures and the associated significant deleveraging that was expected to affect our earnings. They're also consistent with the impacts seen across the industry. It's important to note that our quarterly results include an additional month of impacts in April when compared with the quarterly results of our competitors on a calendar year cycle. When we look at our Q4 revenue, the difference in our individual business results can be explained by four factors : The first was the mix of urgent procedures versus those that are more deferrable. Almost all of our businesses were affected by the decline in procedure volumes this quarter. Healthcare systems diverted their attention and resources to fighting COVID-19. Governments implemented restrictions on elective procedures. And people avoided taking treatment, even for emergency conditions. Our businesses that had a larger mix of products using urgent procedures saw an impact, but they were far less effective than those of therapies where the procedure could be deferred longer. The second factor was a loss of large bulk purchases near the end of the quarter. As you can imagine the normal flow of these orders, which tend to be larger in April given our fiscal year end, did not materialize. As I noted on our last earnings call, prior to COVID-19, we were already planning to reduce large bulk orders and balance them across the quarter, starting with our next fiscal year. With the pandemic, our efforts were clearly accelerated. The third factor was centered around capital equipment. While capital equipment represents a small amount of our overall revenue, there are certain businesses that have a higher mix and felt the impact of hospitals and surgery centers delaying their capital evaluation and purchases. The last factor was the degree to which businesses\u2019 products and services have played a role in fighting COVID-19, or had specific products and customers that were stocking ahead of the pandemic. This led to greater than expected growth in a select few of our businesses. So with these four factors in mind, let's look at our results by business group. Our Cardiac and Vascular Group declined 33%. CVG's therapies tend to overall be less deferrable. But we still saw substantial declines in procedure volumes. Moreover, CVG saw the greater impact than some of our groups from the reduction in bulk purchases with particular impact on CRM implantables, diagnostics and transcatheter valves. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group declined 12%. MITG\u2019s revenue mix is weighted more to the middle of the differability spectrum. So it did experience a significant impact from the decline in surgical volumes, particularly in the surgical innovations and GI, which both declined in the low-20s. This was offset by growth in Respiratory and Patient Monitoring, as well as in renal care solutions. In Respiratory and Patient Monitoring, which was up mid-teens, we saw significant growth in airways and ventilators as we sought to meet the COVID-19 related patient needs around the world. We significantly ramped production, which led to ventilator revenue nearly doubling. We also saw strong correlation in demand for pulse oximetry and capnography. But the increased demand was offset by overall reduced demand for patient monitoring products given fewer non-COVID-19 hospitalizations and procedures. Renal care grew high-single-digits driven by access catheters and acute and chronic dialysis products as dialysis treatment continued throughout the pandemic. Our Restorative Therapies Group declined 32%. RTGs therapies tend to be used in procedures that are more deferrable including those in Core Spine, Pain Stim, ENT and Pelvic Health. RTG also was impacted by the reduction in customer bulk purchases and capital equipment purchases. RTG's neurosurgery business in particular has a high mix of capital sales. Our Diabetes Group declined 7%. The decline was driven by delay in new patient starts on insulin pumps and due to the closing of physician offices as a result of COVID-19 as well as continued competitive pressure. This was offset by increase in demand for diabetes supplies, including continuous glucose sensors and infusion sets, particularly in international markets. Next, let's review our fourth quarter performance by geography, which I think is a particularly helpful way to analyze our results given the progression of the pandemic to different regions throughout our quarter.  First, China declined 38% and experienced the impact of COVID-19 for the entire quarter. Our revenue in China declined 46% in both February and March. We started to see gradual sequential revenue improvements midway through March and our April revenue improved to a decline of 21%. In Asia Pacific, our revenue declined 13%, as we saw the impact of the virus in many markets through the quarter, with the number of COVID-19 related cases peaking in some countries within the quarter. Korea declined 2% as COVID cases peaked in mid-March, and Australia/New Zealand declined 11%, with cases peaking in early April. Japan declined 14%, as cases continued to increase as we exited the quarter. In EMEA, our revenue declined 10%. Western Europe revenue was tracking with expectations through mid-March, when we started to experience significant declines. Revenue in Western Europe declined 32% in April, driven by procedure delays, and to a lesser extent, fewer customer bulk purchases. In the Americas, our revenue declined 32%, with the U.S. declining 33%, Canada down 24%, and Latin America declining 15%. Like Western Europe, our U.S. revenue was tracking with expectations through mid-March before experiencing significant declines, driven by a combination of procedure delays and the reduction of bulk purchases. Turning to our pipeline, we think about the impact of COVID-19 in three categories : products that just received regulatory approvals over the past few months; products under regulatory review; and products that are in clinical trials or preparing to enter clinical trials. Starting with the products that recently received their regulatory approvals, the pandemic has interrupted some of our recent launches, given the delay in procedures. This includes the European launches of our Percept PC deep brain stimulator, InterStim Micro rechargeable sacral nerve stimulator, Cobalt and Crome high power CRM devices, and the DiamondTemp ablation catheter. It also slowed the U.S. launches of our AV fistula indication in our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon, our DTM therapy in Pain Stim, and our Micra AV pacemaker. It's worth noting that prior to the pandemic, Micra grew over 60% in the U.S. in both February and March. The good news is that as procedures come back, we expect these launches to pick up steam. Moreover, we just received approval for Micra AV and our Reveal LINQ 2 cardiac diagnostic monitor in Europe, as well as U.S. approval for our Cobalt and Crome high power CRM devices, which we announced earlier this month. Our Cobalt and Crome offerings should be particularly valuable in the current COVID-19 environment, as they are the first and only Bluetooth-enabled high power devices in the U.S. that allow for distance programming and better remote monitoring. Regarding the second category of products, those in regulatory review, the pandemic doesn't currently appear to be affecting the approval process. As a result, we're expecting a number of approvals this quarter, including U.S. approvals for our InterStim Micro sacral nerve stimulator, our Percept PC deep brain stimulator, and our Reveal LINQ 2. We're also expecting European approval this quarter of the Minimed 780G. In the U.S., we anticipate approval this summer of a new product we're calling Minimed 770G, which is Bluetooth-enabled and allows for wireless, over-the-air software upgrades, before launching our 780G later in the fiscal year. In addition, 770G will be the first hybrid closed loop system available to patients aged 2-6. Patients who purchase the 770G will get the free software upgrade to 780G with our Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop algorithm upon approval. We expect to show the pivotal results of our Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop algorithm in adults at the virtual ADA Conference in June. With the third category of our pipeline, those that are enrolling clinical trials or preparing to enter clinical trials, the pandemic has slowed things down, as clinical trial startups and enrollments have been placed on temporary pause. This includes our soft-tissue robot, products in our Diabetes CGM sensor pipeline, and our RDN ON MED trial. Regarding our soft-tissue robot, our ability to finalize system and pre-clinical testing has been delayed, and given the uncertainty of the pandemic, it's too early to update you on timelines. However, we're exploring ways to expedite this work, with the intent of minimizing the delay. In Diabetes, we continue to be optimistic on our ability to close the competitive gap in continuous glucose monitoring sensors. We intend to submit data to regulatory agencies on our Zeus transmitter at the end of the summer, and we have completed verification of our Synergy sensor that will enable our IDE submission within the next few weeks. And in renal denervation, we will combine our RDN ON MED data with our recently presented OFF MED data to support U.S. approval. Look, we are excited about creating the new renal denervation market with its potential to treat millions of patients with hypertension. With all of these recently approved and near-term pipeline products, customer enthusiasm remains high, and collectively, these represent growth acceleration as we emerge from the pandemic. With that, let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our fourth quarter financials and outlook. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you. As Geoff mentioned, our fourth quarter organic revenue declined 25%, and adjusted EPS was $0.58 cents, a decline of 62%. We did have significant deleveraging down the P&L in the quarter, as we continued to invest for the future despite the lower revenue growth. Gross margin declined by approximately 700 basis points, driven in large part by increased expenses as a result of COVID-19, including manufacturing facility cleaning, increased protective equipment, bonuses for our factory employees, and higher freight and obsolescence charges. In addition, we experienced a negative impact from mix, as products in higher demand carried lower margins. And we continued to experience a year-over-year impact from increased China tariffs. In addition to a lower gross margin, our operating profit was affected by continued R&D investment in our pipeline and continued spending in SG&A, as we purposely protected the variable compensation of our sales reps. Below the operating profit line, our adjusted interest expense declined 30%, driven by our successful debt issuance and tender transactions that we completed last spring and summer. And our adjusted nominal tax rate was 12.6% for the quarter and 14.3% for the year. Both were favorably impacted by lower earnings and the jurisdictional mix of profits. Excluding any non-recurring tax benefits we received in fiscal year \u201820, our adjusted nominal tax rate would have been approximately 15%. Despite the decline in earnings, we did not lose our focus on driving free cash flow. In fact, we generated $6 billion for the fiscal year, converting 97% of non-GAAP earnings, well above our long-term target of 80%. And our financial position remains strong. Over the past several years, we have made important decisions to maintain a healthy and robust balance sheet, which enable us to not only withstand significant disruption, but more importantly, maintain our focus on the long-term. We have ample liquidity, with $10.9 billion of cash and investments as of the end of the quarter, and an undrawn $3.5 billion credit facility. In addition, we have no public debt maturing until March of 2021. As we stay focused on the long-term, we will continue to allocate our capital to drive our growth strategies, including investing in our pipeline to accelerate our long-term organic revenue growth. In addition, we have not slowed our business development activities, as we continue to look to supplement our organic growth drivers with inorganic opportunities, including minority investments and tuck-in acquisitions. We also continue to focus on generating proper returns for you, our shareholders, through both our organic long-term growth and our strong dividend. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, Medtronic has increased our dividend over the past 42 years, and this morning, we will make it 43 by increasing our annual dividend $0.16. Looking ahead, the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it difficult to provide our traditional annual and quarterly guidance. Instead, we are happy to provide our thoughts on the recovery. As you know, there are many factors that will influence its speed and trajectory, and these will vary by geography and therapy. COVID case volumes and potential resurgence will certainly play a role, as will updates to recommendations from government agencies on the resumption of elective procedures and provision of non-COVID related healthcare. Hospital capacity will be another key factor. We recognize that new protocols designed to ensure patient and provider safety can slow the return to full capacity. And some healthcare systems are planning to increase capacity by extending workdays or doing procedures on weekends, though this isn't the case in all regions. Moreover, some hospitals are at this point maintaining surge capacity, in case there is a second wave. We are assuming that any potential second wave will be adequately contained, but we are watching this closely and are prepared for a range of scenarios. While it\u2019s still early, we believe we have seen the worst of procedure declines and are seeing encouraging signs of earlier-than-anticipated recovery in several places around the world. In fact, the recovery has begun in China, although it is gradual. While the ultimate pace there is still uncertain, we've seen a reduction in our weekly decline in revenue over the first few weeks of May, with high-teens decline from the prior year. In other parts of Asia, such as Japan and India, we are still experiencing severe year-over-year procedure declines, and we continue to expect lockdowns to impact our first quarter, while other markets like Australia, New Zealand, and Korea should continue to see recovery. In the U.S. and Western Europe, we've started to see sequential revenue improvement and hope to see that continue. In May, we've seen our weekly revenue across Western Europe declining around 20% from the prior year, and the U.S. has been declining around 30% over the same period. With all of this in mind, we currently expect first quarter revenue growth to be modestly worse than the fourth quarter for both the total company and each of our groups. To be clear, we are seeing encouraging signs in many geographies. But our largest regions are likely to experience a full quarter of impact compared with just 5 or 6 weeks in the fourth quarter. And at this point, we expect second quarter to be better than the first, as the recovery continues, and sequential improvement through the remainder of the fiscal year. By the time we reach the fourth quarter, we would expect to be back to more normal revenue growth on a 2-year stacked basis. Focusing on the first quarter, while there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the recovery, we would expect RTG revenue to be the most challenged, followed by CVG, with both expected to decline more than the total company. MITG and Diabetes are both expected to decline in the first quarter as well, however, they should be better than the company average. And remember, we have an additional selling week in the first quarter, something that happens every 5 or 6 years with our fiscal calendar. Because this extra week already occurred the last week of April, during the time the impact of the pandemic was at its highest, we picked up only a minimal amount of additional revenue. On the bottom-line, we continue to plan for significant deleveraging in the near term. We expect our gross margin to remain under pressure owing to product mix, lower volumes, and the extra cost of safety protocols. Where we have more than enough inventory to meet current demand, manufacturing plants may operate at less than full capacity, which could lead to period expensing of some fixed overhead costs. With this in mind, our first quarter gross margin could be down a few points sequentially. As stated, we are not taking a short-term view when it comes to investment. We believe in the strength of the company and are positioning ourselves to come out of this crisis even stronger as we continue to invest in our employees, our pipeline, and our product launches. Given this, the first quarter SG&A and R&D spend should be a couple hundred million dollars higher than the fourth. Though, similar to revenue, we would expect operating profit to improve as we progress through the fiscal year. Regarding currency, the U.S. dollar has strengthened substantially since the pandemic began, especially against emerging markets currencies. As a result, our FX impact is looking to be about $0.10 more negative to fiscal \u201821 EPS than a few months back and just over $0.20 for the fiscal year. Before I turn the call back over to Geoff, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our employees around the world for their ongoing commitment to our mission. I couldn't be more proud of our teams and the way they have worked together to support our customers and ensure patients have access to our life-saving therapies. Back to you, Geoff. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Karen. Now, looking back at what we've accomplished since the start of the pandemic, we are in many ways already a stronger company as a result of our actions. We've reaffirmed our mission in a profound way. When patients and healthcare workers urgently needed solutions that we couldn't provide alone, we turned to Tenet 2 of our mission for a path forward. Tenet 2 tells us to focus our efforts on biomedical engineering where we display maximum strength, but it also says to gather people and facilities that augment these areas. And we did just that, forming new partnerships that enhance our biomedical expertise with additional technology, supply chain reach, and manufacturing capacity from other companies. We've also gone back to our roots as a company by re-instilling the value of close partnerships with our customers. We're focused on our customers' needs during this pandemic, moving beyond just selling the best medical therapies, to using our expertise to bring broader solutions to the table. Feedback from customers and governments on our support has been incredibly positive, and they are grateful for our efforts. And we're bringing these new solutions to market at record speed. Development timelines have been measured in hours and days, not weeks and months, and the output has been very impressive. This pace and impact has created a strong energy and spirit within Medtronic. Despite the day-to-day challenges of the pandemic, our people are really engaged and excited to assist customers in the recovery. So now, as the world begins to recover, we're focused on emerging from this pandemic even stronger. We're executing strategies and supporting investments that others in our industry, who are in a different financial position, have been unable to make. We're harnessing new partnerships, cutting through the bureaucracy and operating at a high sense of urgency and speed. We're also sharpening our competitive edge to drive an even higher level of performance. As we emerge, we expect these investments will even be more evident in our attraction and retention of top talent, and in the new products and solutions that we're offering physicians, patients, and healthcare systems. Now, for competitive reasons, I'm not going to get into the details of all of the actions we're taking. However, when you combine these new possibilities with our pipeline, I couldn't be more excited about the future. We will come out of this even stronger, and in doing so, create sustainable value for our shareholders and for society. Finally, as many of you know, this is my first earnings call as CEO, which also means that this is Omar's last earnings call. So I want him to say a few words. Omar? Omar Ishrak : Thank you, Geoff. And, this is my 36th Medtronic earnings call, so it was definitely time to turn the job over to someone else. And you're just doing great. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Omar. Omar Ishrak : The past nine years has really gone by fast, and it's been a pleasure getting to know all of you in the investment community, whether that was visiting your offices around the world, hosting you in Minneapolis, or meeting you at the conferences. I sincerely appreciate all of the interest you've had in this company and in this industry, and the support that you've given me and the Medtronic management team over the years. As I look ahead, I have full confidence in Geoff and this leadership team to take the company forward. The team has been incredibly focused on the recovery and has a number of plans in the works. We're operating from a position of strength, given the strong financial position of the company and the full and robust pipeline. While I didn't expect to be turning over the CEO role during a pandemic, it's reassuring to know that the decisions that we've made over the past several years have prepared us for this time. I'm confident that we have the right engaged team in place to ensure that Medtronic emerges even stronger. As you've heard me say many times before, healthcare is a perpetual growth opportunity, as the three universal healthcare needs of improving clinical outcomes, expanding access, and optimizing cost and efficiency will not go away. The Medtronic mission and focus on these growth opportunities is enduring. I'm glad to have played a role in leading this storied company, and I'm sure its best days are ahead. I wish Geoff, the team, and all of our employees all the very best going forward. Geoff, back to you. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Omar. And you didn't just play a role, you played a major role. And as you step away as CEO, you're leaving us well positioned to thrive. The list of your accomplishments is long and meaningful, but to list a few that come to mind when I think of your legacy : well, first you doubled the size of this company, and you inspired our global employees to think differently, to think bigger. And you're the only CEO other than our Co-Founder, Earl Bakken, to be inducted into the company's Bakken Society which is the highest technical honor at Medtronic. You've created value for our shareholders, you got our whole industry to focus on value-based healthcare, and importantly, you operationalized the mission in everything we do, which led to improving the lives of millions of people over the past 9 years. It's been a pleasure and an honor working with you and learning from you.  Finally, I really appreciate all you've done to make this transition a smooth one, and I look forward to continuing to work with you in your Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board roles. Before we start Q&A, I'd like to briefly note that we currently anticipate holding our Q1 earnings call on Tuesday, August 25th. We've also postponed our biennial Institutional Investor and Analyst Day as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was originally scheduled for next month, and we'll let you know the date once it's scheduled. Let's now move on to Q&A. In addition to Karen, Omar, and me, we also have our four group presidents : Mike Coyle, Bob White, Brett Wall, and Sean Salmon, here to answer your questions. As usual, we want to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question, and if necessary, a related follow-up question. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Robbie Marcus : Geoff, maybe we can start with what you were talking about at the end of the call, which is why you're so optimistic that Medtronic will emerge stronger. It's something we've heard a lot of CEOs mention over the past quarter earnings here. But Medtronic is actually doing stuff. You're paying employees, both your sales reps through this, you\u2019re paying bonuses. To me, it seems like you're actually building culture during a really difficult time here. But maybe just give me your thoughts on why that's not just lip service, but something that will actually materialize Medtronic coming out of this pandemic? Geoff Martha : Let me walk, there's several components to the answer. First, I got to start off with our financial position going into the crisis, I mean having a strong balance sheet makes a huge difference and lets us lead into this whole crisis and play offense. And the actions that we took during the crisis, right, specifically, you mentioned some of them, to support our employees and -- through benefits programs and protecting our reps\u2019 incentive compensation, especially they\u2019re highly leveraged representatives, sales reps in United States and providing all of those safety measures et cetera, et cetera, so that they have both -- protecting their health but also reducing anxiety during this time. That makes a big difference. And these employees\u2019 morale right now is really high. And we -- I'm sure we'll get questions on this later. But we do see this strong early signs of the recovery, and our employees are ready to go without distraction, and they've used -- that we've used this time wisely. So I think they're ready to go and it's going to continue for us. Because after all, innovation and commercialization is still a people game. And our customers, okay, so the same with our customers. And we spent a lot of time partly because we were able to reduce employees\u2019 anxieties, they could stay focused on our mission, our patients and our customers. And we spent a lot of time I mentioned in the commentary with our customers, and it was a different dialogue. It wasn't just selling our therapies and their features which are great, but it was really how can we help them through this pandemic? And how can we help them come out the other side.  And the dialogue we're having with customers is what I'm wanting to have since I've been here, I hate it when they call us vendors, suppliers. I hate those words. But now we're sitting down with them and they really are -- they're using the word partner and then they're backing it up and really engaging us in their recovery plans and relying on us in their recovery plans. And so we've put a lot -- we've been developing several programs that I really want to get into some of the details of those, because I do think they're unique, and I think they\u2019re competitive advantage. But things around patient confidence, protecting healthcare workers, hospital productivity, these are things we're putting in place with our larger partners in particular, but we think we've scaled these to even smaller hospitals, and it's really building momentum.  So that's another component of it and then it's our pipeline. So our pipeline going into this was strong. We talked about it on the commentary, a lot of these products -- now as we emerge, a lot of these products are hitting. We got a lot of approvals coming out. We mentioned the Micra and cardiac rhythm, the Cobalt and Crome approval, LINQ 2 just got approved in Europe. Percept PC and DBS which coming from -- and the InterStim Micro and Pelvic Health. Coming from RTG myself, I mean these have been a long time coming and we sacrificed a whole lot to get these things out and really excited.  We also have Stimgenics in pain, the recent acquisition, some ENT products, DiamondTemp and AFS and EU. So there\u2019s wave of products hitting the market at a great time. And then specifically though, how these products are positioned during this pandemic, the whole remote programming, remote monitoring capabilities that before were important but now are like critical, right? And I'm listening hospitals talk about making this standard-of-care. And in fact, if and I'd say when that happens, we are well -- we're in a best position in the marketplace for that. And then secondarily, are hyper focused on complications because they don't want patients coming back. And we're very well positioned there as well with things like Micra and TYRX and I can go on. So those are the big ones. And I started with the financial condition and I'm going to end with that one again. I think it's worth mentioning twice the fact that we have a strong balance sheet. If you add all that up -- and we're feeling good about how we come out of this thing. And so we can debate how big the pie -- when the pie gets back to the normal size, but if we don't have a bigger slice of that pie, I'm going to be disappointed. Robbie Marcus : Maybe as a quick follow-up. Medtronic right now probably has the best balance sheet that it\u2019s had in five plus years. You've been talking increasingly over the past 12 months or so about increased M&A. With asset prices down 20% across the board, is this the right time for Medtronic to be going out to do M&A? And what are you seeing in terms of opportunity set out there right now? Geoff Martha : The short answer is, yes. I think it is a good time to do M&A, as you mentioned, asset prices are down. It doesn't mean that we lower our standards. I just think again we can play offense. And I think our focus remains the same on tuck-ins. That can -- tuck-in acquisitions that can -- but I'm a little more partial to the tuck-ins that are more meaningful and can actually affect our growth rate, our long-term growth rate. Like I said, we don't buy growth, we grow what we buy. And so that's what we're focused on. And like I said, there are some are some opportunities that at least I felt personally were out of our reach, too expenses before this and now we're kind of more in line with what we think are reasonable returns for those investments. So, yes. Ryan Weispfenning : We\u2019ll take the next question please, Carmen Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. David Lewis : Karen, just two for you real quickly here. The furious, I wonder if you could just help us with recovery here into the first quarter. I know you said growth will be modestly worse in the first. Can you just to help us kind of how you're thinking about progression of recovery, maybe across the next couple of months, but more specifically, given the stocking dynamic in the fourth quarter and the extra selling week in the first quarter. It just could be kind of a material swing. I just wonder if you could help us with some of those dynamics you're heading into the first? And then had a quick follow up on margins. Karen Parkhill : Sure, David. Thanks for the question. As Geoff said, we are seeing encouraging and positive signs of recovery right now, particularly in our largest regions of China, the U.S. and Western Europe. That said, as I mentioned, we do expect a full quarter impact in Q1 as opposed to the five to six quarters that we had in -- five to six weeks that we had in Q4. So we are expecting at this stage at least Q1 to be modestly worse in terms of revenue growth than Q4. But we do expect improvement in Q2, and sequential improvement going forward into Q3 and Q4. And by the time we hit Q4, we do expect to be back to more normal revenue growth for us and we'd measure that on a two year stacked basis given a tough year-over-year comparison. In terms of stocking and the extra selling week, I did mention that the extra selling week happened for us the very first week of our quarter, which was the end of April. And obviously, because that was such a depressed time, we're seeing minimal revenue impact from that extra selling week. As we think about stocking, we have said starting last quarter that we intend to focus on driving revenue more evenly throughout our quarter and reducing the amount of full transactions that we have. We'll continue to do that every quarter this year. But we had a good head start obviously in the fourth quarter. David Lewis : And then obviously, from a margin perspective, fourth quarter should maybe not be the trough margin period. So would you see sort of the trough margin period in the business? And more specifically, that revenue recovery is super helpful. How should margin and earnings recover relative to that revenue? I mean if you can get back to that normalcy quarter that you specified, is that the normal quarter for margins? Or should margins or earnings kind of lag that revenue recovery? Karen Parkhill : Thanks for that question, David. In terms of margins, I did mention that we could see sequentially worse gross margins in the first quarter. And that really as we think about the increased expenses due to COVID-19 along with the fact that should we choose to not run some of our manufacturing operations at full capacity, that we will have a potential move to period expensing some of the overhead in those manufacturing plants as opposed to rolling it onto inventory on our balance sheet. And so that may cause margins in the first quarter to be a little bit worse than the fourth quarter. But we would expect to see margin improvement as we move into Q2 and then continued sequential improvement as we move into Q3 and Q4. And by the time we get to Q4, we would expect to be back to more normal margins on a constant currency basis.  As I mentioned, FX has become more of a headwind for us this fiscal year, and really due to the strengthening of the dollar, particularly against emerging market currencies. And at this stage, we're looking at an FX impact of about $0.20 to the bottom-line, which can obviously impact margins too. But we're really seeing good signs of recovery right now. And we're very excited about what the future can hold even beyond FY '21. Geoff Martha : Yes, I think this is obvious, but I can't help myself from stating this that, from a revenue perspective, in particular Q1 is markedly worse than Q4, because of the extra five to six weeks of impact, but we are seeing early signs of recovery. It may be too early to extrapolate that all throughout the year, but we're seeing faster than we anticipated, especially in Europe and U.S. And for sure Q1 is the trough. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, David. Carmen, next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins with BOA. Please go ahead with your question. Bob Hopkins : Just two things I would love to comment on and I'll list them both upfront in the interest of time. So, one is, I apologize is a little short-term. I just want to dig a little deeper on your comments on the upcoming first fiscal quarter. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give a sense for what you're seeing in the month of May? Just trying to get a sense for what kind of improvement you're assuming from May to get to that total Q1 comment that you made?  And then I was also wondering if you just may be offer us a quick comment on the upcoming diabetes data we're going to see at ADA. Because I know in the past, you have commented that you do expect a time in range of around 80%? And just wondering if that is still the case. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Bob. I'll just talk about the month of May quickly. We are seeing encouraging signs, and particularly as we look at our largest regions in China and the U.S. and Western Europe. In China, where we had stronger declines in February and March of around 46%, we said we saw April declines of around 21%. And now we're seeing declines in China in the high-teens. So, continued improvement there. And in Western Europe, where we saw declines in April of around 32%. In May, we're seeing declines of around 20%. So again, continued improvement in Western Europe. And in the U.S., the picture is a bit crowded when we look at April because of our bulk purchases, but we're clearly seeing procedural improvement across the U.S. And in May, declines of around 30%, just in the first few weeks of May, which is better than what we had in April. Geoff Martha : And just to build on that in the U.S., I mean, Karen gave you the numbers. Anecdotally, we're getting texts, calls from hospital -- big health system CEOs, purchasing people, basically, indicating faster than anticipated recovery in many parts of the United States. And basically saying, are you guys ready, buckle up. So that's two things I like about that. One, the encouragement; two, that they're talking us about these things. And so it's -- the Northeast is going to be a little slower. I think the patient fear factor is a little higher there because the virus hit harder in New York and Massachusetts, but other parts of the U.S., very optimistic. So anyway, that's why we're thinking Q1 for us as the trial and we're starting with the trough rather and we're seeing the -- we\u2019re starting to see encouraging signs here.  On the second question, Bob, I think I'm going to ask a Sean -- Sean Salmon to answer that one. Sean? Sean Salmon : Yes, thanks for the question Bob. So we'll have two data sets coming up at the ADA, the virtual ADA. The first of which is going to be a randomized study out of New Zealand, which serves as the CE Mark data. And the second one is the adult portion of the Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop data, which will be featured there. And just one thing to set your expectations for that, really evaluated a number of different things in that study. Most importantly, we looked at targeting the glucose settings for patients with two different levels. One is the usual level that we have with 670 today. And the other one is a more aggressive lower target and we're evaluating the safety of that. So as you look at those results, you'll see that there's a really a lot to unpack there. But we're very confident in the product, and look forward to sharing the results next month. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thanks, Bob. Our next question, please, Carmen. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Kristen Stewart : I guess my question is just as you guys are thinking just kind of longer term and bigger picture, just thinking about kind of your earlier comments, I guess a couple quarters ago just kind of on the M&A landscape and you guys clearly have a very good balance sheet and Karen has done a great job just improving the cash flow for the company. How are you just thinking about deployment of capital? Now you guys have the opportunity, I guess, to be potentially a little bit more aggressive on the M&A front. Do you think this is the opportunity now to go out and do that? Or are you guys going to be a little bit more logical and waiting to see how the landscape shakes out just given COVID and the backdrop? Geoff Martha : And yes, I am -- coming in this new role, I definitely have even more of appreciation for the cash flow and I'm a little forgiving of all the grief that Karen gave you about generating more cash flow in my prior role, I am thanking her now for that. But when it comes to M&A, we're not going to be watchful and waiting to see how COVID plays out or the economy. I mean that -- we believe that the healthcare and medtech, the areas that we're in like we said earlier are going to come back and Karen indicated earlier in the call that we believe by our Q4 that our revenue growth on a two year stacked basis will be back to normal levels in profitability.  So I mean, we feel like this is a hit. Obviously, it\u2019s a very difficult financial impact for everybody. But we do feel bullish on the future here of the market and then us as well. So we won't hold back to those reasons. And like I said earlier in the call we're looking for -- mainly focused on tuck-in deals that are going to create long-term improvements to our weighted average market growth rate and allow us to -- there position us strategically. So tuck-in deals are what we're looking for. I tend to prefer it -- we'll do various sizes, like $1 billion, that range because it has a bigger impact on our growth rate. So that's what we're looking for. And for sure the virus\u2019 impact on the markets and prices, asset prices has, is going to help -- is going to make certain assets more attractive. I hope that helps, hopefully answers your question. Kristen Stewart : Yes. And just in terms of thinking through I would say more from a opportunity in different businesses that you have, has COVID or just kind of thinking through the landscape change, the different areas that you would look opportunistically, whether it would change your view on whether the tuck-in one on the cardio side or whether a tuck-in more you\u2019d be thinking about like telehealth or any of those areas, does it change kind of where you would think you'd lay kind of your tips from more of a product or service oriented or anything like that? Geoff Martha : I wouldn't say it changes by the business areas. I mean the -- you mentioned -- we are going to be making investments, more investments in remote capabilities of our product and of our business model, quite frankly. So whether it'd be remote programming of devices, remote monitoring of devices, remote case support, digital medical education and things like that. So investing, this is an area where I think Medtronic as a company, as an enterprise, this is an area we can add value to our different business units by making investments like these that can scale across a lot of them.  Whether that's -- I don't know that, that needs to be M&A, there are some opportunities there that we're looking at, that are more around that that whole idea of remote, but also just organic investments and partnerships with large and small technology companies. Like I mentioned in the commentary, I mean I was really blown away by how some of these other companies can augment our technologies, like whether it be Intel or there's a lot of smaller companies as well, augmenting our capabilities to be more virtual, to be more remote. And so I think the partners -- some partnership opportunities there. So in the virtual area, it's -- the remote areas, it's organic investment, partnerships, including partnerships with other companies, and potentially some other things as well. That's one area that I would argue has definitely increased in terms of our focus. But nothing I wouldn't -- I can't think of anything that between the different businesses. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Kristen. Let\u2019s go to the next question please, Carmen. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Pito Chickering : As we sit back and look at the impact from COVID, it looks like the healthcare systems globally were unprepared to deal with a large scale respiratory pandemic. And now that appears that the worse is behind us, it might be certain to having discussions with countries about the infrastructure investment needed to deal with the next wave or next pandemic. So for example, widespread respiratory monitoring or ventilators. Thanks so much. Geoff Martha : Thanks for the question, Pito. The answer to that is, yes. And right now -- and maybe I\u2019ll ask Bob to comment as well. But right now, we have a big focus on emerging markets, specifically, regarding COVID and other respiratory, other viruses. And we\u2019re pulling our portfolio together, between our ventilation portfolio, our capnography, SpO2 and our monitoring capabilities to provide, I\u2019ll call them, standing up a lot more hospital capacity for these -- for the patients in these areas, I see -- with all those devices and how they work together, and providing solutions to these countries and -- that they don\u2019t have today and the scale. And I really think it\u2019s not just a one-time event. I do think this will introduce these technologies to the emerging markets and help that become more of a standard-of-care, because they are under-penetrated today, so I do think it will have a long -- a lasting and longer-term impact as well. And also Bob do you want to make any comments to that? Bob White : Yes. Geoff, just to build on what you said, and you said it really well. We think we\u2019re really uniquely positioned with our combination of technologies and capnography, pulse oximetry, ventilation. An example of this is, we were a key player in standing up the Javits Center in New York City. And we think the opportunity as emerging markets, stand up ICUs and care theaters, that Medtronic will be there with them to do that. And as Geoff mentioned, we\u2019re seeing tremendous interest from governments around the world as they look not only to stockpile and build their ventilation capability, but how they think about it because, while we\u2019re seeing great recovery in the markets that Karen and Geoff mentioned, this pandemic is still going to hit emerging markets in a pretty big way unfortunately. And we want to be there to support it. So that\u2019s it, Geoff. I think we\u2019re really well positioned to capitalize on that. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Bob. And the last thing I\u2019d say to that, Pito, is we also have a business that does remote patient monitoring. We do a lot of remote patient monitoring for chronic comorbid patients in the VA in the United States. And that business has really gotten an uptick of interest, and we\u2019re positioning it more strategically to support patients in the pandemic so -- in a number of ways. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Pito. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : I just want to spend a few minutes on the TAVR franchise. That was a bit of a problem child on the fiscal year third quarter. How has that evolved? What did you see early in the cycle? And how did -- how do you see Dr. Popma\u2019s new role, congrats on that hire, too? Thank you. Mike Coyle : Well, Joanne, thanks for the question. Obviously, the issues in Q3, we talked about extensively on the last call, where we were very disappointed with the U.S. performance of TAVR given that we had procedural growth rates in, call it, the 14%, 15% range when the market was growing to double that, a little bit in the 30s. That was strictly a U.S. issue as you recall, we were actually growing with the market, a little ahead of the market outside of the United States. We talked a lot about how well we were refocusing sales forces and repositioning them back into large high-volume accounts where they had been basically being deployed into the start-up of new accounts with the NCD and increasing the sharpness of the messaging around our benefits of the super annular design that we have relative to better gradients and better hemodynamics. We were very encouraged, actually with where things were headed during the course of Q4 and the first half and those first seven weeks. We actually grew in the high teens. And in fact, as we were exiting that seven-week period, so the last three to four weeks there, we were actually well north of 20% in terms of procedural growth rate. Now while that\u2019s still below the market, very good traction that we were seeing. And then obviously, in the last five weeks, six weeks of the quarter, obviously, we saw the impact of the pandemic hit that market pretty dramatically. Of course, the other benefit that we had was the ACC data releases, where we saw very significant positive data coming in the bicuspid area or immobility and lethal thrombosis data and some data that was a little more problematic for one of our competitors. So collectively, yes, we really like where we\u2019re positioned in terms of pushing our messaging for our product and design. Obviously, the recovery is taking place currently now. And as Geoff mentioned, Karen mentioned, we are very encouraged by the trends that we are seeing in terms of now five weeks of continuous improvement in terms of overall procedural growth in that period. So we are encouraged with where things are headed. And we\u2019re thrilled with the addition of Dr. Popma to our team. He is obviously one of the leading physicians in the area of structural heart and has just been instrumental in the support of our program over the years and guiding our program. And we think he will really help us with the messaging of our product for low-risk patients for bicuspid patients and in our clinical design and development. So we are very, very excited about where our TAVR program is headed. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Joanne. Next question please, Carmen. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Pleased to ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Just I\u2019ll ask both of mine upfront here. You talked about some of the improvement you\u2019ve seen in May across geographies, but I\u2019d be curious to hear what segments are coming back faster, any surprises? Is it more of the emergent versus the elective procedures? Is it more inpatient versus outpatient? And are those the trends you expect to continue over the coming quarters here? Just second, Bob, since it\u2019s such an important product, any more color on the delay to the surgical robot? Just curious why pre-clinical testing would be delayed by COVID. And is it -- are there some tweaks you\u2019re making? Is that also a part of it? And should we just think about this, Bob, as maybe a couple of quarter delay? Is that the best way to think about it right now? Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Geoff Martha : Well, Larry, maybe I\u2019ll start on the first question, and I might ask Mike Coyle to comment a little bit, too, and then we\u2019ll turn it over to Bob for the robot question. I\u2019d say on the -- in terms of the recovery and the procedures, the recovery -- in summary, I say this kind of makes sense for us in terms of the rates of the recovery. The therapies and products that are more urgent, if you will, or less deferrable are definitely coming back faster, like neurovascular and RTG, TAVR Mike mentioned, stents, cardiac rhythm, they\u2019re coming back faster. And then the more deferrable procedures are taking longer, like our pelvic health franchise and RTG, for example. But we\u2019re seeing really strong data coming in on cardiac rhythm for a number of reasons. And maybe, Mike, you can talk to that for a second. Mike Coyle : Yes. Obviously, the ones that we listed in our 8-K as being the least elective are the ones that are coming back the quickest. So in a cardiac surgery franchise, obviously, ECMO has seen a lot of significant growth, but pacemakers are coming back very quickly just given the symptomatic nature of the patients and their needing to be treated. And it is playing extremely well for things like Micra, where we showed data of a 60% reduction in implant complications associated with pacemaker implants using Micra, that keeping patients out of the ICU right now is a big priority, and so that -- and TRYX, which is getting a significant increase in utilization in order to keep patients out of the hospital has been significant. But as Geoff mentioned, I think the thing that probably has us the most encouraged is that moderately elective group of technologies, things like the ICDs, CRT, the TAVR and coronary stents. These are areas that we\u2019re seeing a very nice rebound, especially over a very consistent rebound over the last five to six weeks. And we\u2019re even beginning to see in some of the less elective procedures like atrial fibrillation and our diagnostics business a very similar trend, although, obviously, trailing behind the others in terms of the rate of recovery. So as we said, it\u2019s encouraging what we\u2019re just seeing over the last five, six weeks. Geoff Martha : Yes. Some of that is the market, and I think some of that, in the case of implantables or CVG implantables is how they\u2019re positioned, with the remote capabilities, the distance programming, for example, and the lower complications, I think that\u2019s helping as well, Larry. So maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob here for the robot question. Bob White : Yes. Thanks, Geoff. And Larry, thanks for the question. And certainly, as Geoff mentioned during his commentary, COVID has limited the pace at which we can really complete the required software system in pre-clinical testing. And Larry, this shows up in, I think, the impact in three ways. First, our engineers have been forced to work remotely, and thus really limited access to the hardware and the robotic systems itself. Two, surgeons and OR staff have no ability yet to travel and participate in lab testing, and that\u2019s had an impact; and then three, the availability of our external partners and sites to conduct some of the testing. As you know, as I\u2019ve talked to you about previously, we have software development and testing centers around the world, all of which have had impact on productivity. And then as I shared with you previously, we\u2019ve certainly been working through the software development and integration challenges, that took us a bit longer and set us back as well. But the thing I would leave you with, our team is looking at every single creative way to expedite our work related to the program, and we\u2019re seeing some amazing creativity. But true, as Geoff mentioned, given the uncertainty of the pandemic, it\u2019s too early to give you an update on time lines at this point. But thanks, Larry. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Larry. We have time for one more question, Carmen. Take the last question, please Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me and then, Omar, congratulations on your tenure here at Medtronic. Maybe just one quick one for me. Karen, I think you mentioned that, Q4 back to normalized growth, and you guys look at growth from a double-stack perspective? I just want to make -- clarify Q4 of \u201820, it was down 25. Do you mean that Q4 of FY \u201821 will be up 25 plus. So on a double-stack basis, we\u2019re back to growth? Just one clarification on that. And then, Geoff, on the pipeline here, I think you mentioned InterStim Micro, Percept DBS, just maybe in a normalized environment, right, what kind of share gains or what kind of impact could we expect out from these products? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Yes. So on your first question, Vijay, on what\u2019s normal in Q4. Obviously, things are uncertain. And so we\u2019re not giving specific guidance, because of that uncertainty. But just as we look forward right now, when we talk about a return to normal growth on a two-year stacked basis, we\u2019re talking about normal around the mid single-digit levels. And so you can expect that on a two-year stack basis. Hopefully that helps. Brett Wall : Yes. And Vijay, it\u2019s Brett Wall with RTG. And related to these new neuromodulation products, particularly InterStim, pre-COVID in Europe where we had launched this technology, we took back 40% of the accounts that had been with the competitor. So we\u2019re \u2014 that was pre-COVID. So we\u2019re really thrilled with this new technology. The technology itself is extraordinarily competitive. Every patient can get an MRI, whether it\u2019s 1.5 or 3 Tesla. The product itself has a terrific battery recharging capabilities. The recharge experience is great for the patient. It has just significant ease of use for the patient. And the device itself has a programmer that has the ability to have 11 different programs on the patient, which allows that patient and physician to make multiple changes versus the competitors, kind of, a plastic, single program device that doesn\u2019t really allow any flexibility, particularly in a post-COVID world. On the Percept device, this device, which we\u2019ll also launch. Both these devices, we\u2019ll launch this quarter in the United States. And that will put us back into a significant share taking mode. It\u2019s the first device that\u2019s going to have the ability to move forward and close the loop with DBS procedures and sense what\u2019s happening in the brain. And we\u2019re going to be able to move forward and significantly alter the experience for the patient and also for DBS in general. So this is really a significant reboot across this entire franchise. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Vijay. Geoff, do you have any final remarks for us? Geoff Martha : Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So on behalf of our entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. And hey, look, we look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q1\u2019s earning call in August. And so please stay healthy and safe. Operator : Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's fiscal year 2021first quarter conference call and webcast. Geoff Martha's first quarter as Chief Executive Officer. Another first today is that we're presenting our prepared remarks by video. We hope that you'll appreciate this new format, and please let me know if you have any feedback. Today's earnings call should last about an hour. Geoff along with Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on July 31, 2020. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the analysts. Before I turn it over to Geoff, here's a few things to keep in mind. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. During today's prepared remarks and Q&A session, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement, given risks and uncertainties, including those related to the impact COVID-19 has had and is expected to continue to have on our business. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC. And we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue comparisons mentioned during this call are given on an organic basis which adjust for three things. First, the inorganic impact of our Titan Spine acquisition, second, foreign currency. And third the extra week that we had in the first fiscal month this quarter, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.The extra week is a result of our 52-53 week fiscal year calendar, which results in an extra week every five or six years. Finally, reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Medtronic Chief Executive Officer, Geoff Martha. Geoff? Geoff Martha : Okay. Thanks, Ryan. And I appreciate everyone joining us today. But before we dive into our Q1 results, I want to once again thank the frontline healthcare workers who continue to fight COVID-19 every day. We are thankful beyond words for your sacrifice and tireless resolve. I also want to acknowledge all of the Medtronic employees, who have gone that extra mile to support our customers and patients during this difficult time. Thank you for showing that our mission written 60 years ago, still inspires us and really defines who we are as a company. I also want to acknowledge the wildfires burning in Northern California. Medtronic has been a long time member of the Santa Rosa Community, and while our operations aren't currently affected, our thoughts are with those heroes battling these terrible blazes and the people affected, including some of our employees. We hope for a quick containment, and we're standing by ready to assist. Okay, now let's switch gears to Q1. Our results reflect a very strong recovery from the depths of the pandemic that we saw back in April. Procedure volumes began to recover this quarter in multiple markets around the world. And we drove market share gains in a number of our large businesses. Our revenue declined 17% on an organic year-over-year basis. And our adjusted EPS of $0.62, while down 51% was well ahead of expectations. We've seen a faster than expected recovery. Our pipeline is kicking in and we're increasing our cadence of tuck-in M&A. But most importantly, we're finding a new gear at Medtronic, and we're becoming a more nimble and a more competitive organization. And in the coming weeks, you're going to hear more from me on this topic, as we begin to outline the new Medtronic. When the pandemic first hit, we had to postpone our biennial Investor Day, originally scheduled for June. Well, today, we're announcing that we've rescheduled the meeting, and we're now going to host a virtual meeting with you on Wednesday, October 14. We're going to use that opportunity to lay out where we're headed, including a deeper dive on our pipeline now that it's coming to fruition, as well as the actions we're taking to simplify the company. So we look forward to being with you virtually at least on October 14. Now, I'd like to do something a little different than our past earnings calls, and lead with the discussion of market share. Collectively, our results in the month of June were stronger than many of our competitors, and that strength continued into July and now into the first few weeks of August. In some businesses, we're benefiting from the actions we took at the start of the pandemic, to better partner with our customers. In other businesses, we're seeing the benefit of new product launches, as our pipeline kicks in across the company. In fact, we've already had over 130 regulatory approvals this calendar year in the U.S. and Europe, Japan and China. We've included a key approval slide in our earnings presentation that outlines all of this. We're gaining share in our largest businesses like Spine and CRHF, Pacing and High Power. For example, our U.S. Core Spine business declined in the high-single-digits, which was better than the market. We estimate that we gained over a half a point of share in the second calendar quarter. Our differentiated offerings of enabling technologies, which includes robotics, imaging and navigation, combined with our implants is reshaping the spine industry. In CRHF, we estimate that we gained significant implant share in both the High and Low Power markets in the second calendar quarter, with the greatest gains coming in the U.S. Micra, our leadless pacemaker grew in the low-40s globally, and approximately 60% in the U.S. While many have been focused on how Micra is expanding the market and taking share, our new Cobalt and Crome, ICD and CRT-D platforms are also beginning to drive meaningful implant share in High Power. We launched these devices mid-quarter in the U.S. and we're now working with a growing number of providers across the country, who have not implanted with Medtronic in years. Electrophysiologists are choosing Cobalt and Crome for their unique AF and heart failure therapeutic algorithms. The high-40 joule output, extended battery longevity, heart failure management capabilities, as well as their blue sync remote programming and remote device management. These features provide layers of competitive advantage for us. We saw a 35% sequential increase in smart sync accounts globally. And our proprietary remote control programming technology, which was launched in the previous quarter, saw a six fold increase in adoption sequentially. In addition, utilization of our TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelopes increased by 9 points sequentially, to 50% of our U.S. transcatheter pacing and ICD implants, as hospitals are focusing on minimizing patient rehospitalization rates during COVID. We've also begun to return to sequential implants share capture and TAVR, one of our largest growth drivers. In the second calendar quarter, we maintained our share and market leadership in Europe, and gained approximately 1 point of implant share sequentially in the U.S., as we opened new NCD accounts and saw great response from interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons to the bicuspid, leaflet immobility and hemodynamic clinical data that was shared at ACC in the spring. In fact, we've received approval from the FDA just last week to remove bicuspid labeling limitations for low risk TAVR on the strength of these data. This labeling change complements the approval we received earlier this summer, as the only CE Mark TAVR system, with a bicuspid indication for intermediate risk patients. These are important regulatory milestones given the large size of the bicuspid patient population, including 60% of the low risk population. I'll also point out the share gains that we're seeing in our Pain Stim business, within neuromodulation, where we've been rolling out our new DTM therapy. The superiority data that we have for DTM is resonating in the market. We're taking advantage of this by focusing on customers that either don't use Medtronic devices, or split their business across multiple companies. And we're having great success with this strategy. In fact, almost half of our DTM implants in the quarter occurred with these type of customers. And equally important, our SCS trials, which are a predictor of our future implants, were ahead of our expectations and even caught up to prior year levels in June. This bodes really well for our Pain Stim business going forward. So while we're driving share gains in many important businesses, there are also areas that we need to improve. In DBS and Pelvic Health, while we lost share in the quarter, we're very bullish on where we're headed. In DBS, we received FDA approval for our Percept PC deep brain stimulation system with brain sense technology, in late June. Percept is the first DBS to record brain signals while delivering therapy, and we expect this to drive share gains in this high growth market going forward. In fact, we believe this is the beginning of a multi-year run in DBS, with our directional lead launching next year, followed by a Closed-Loop DBS system. We're redefining the standard-of-care and creating a significant technology gap between us and our competitors. In Pelvic Health, we just received FDA approval for Interstim Micro device, which has important features over the competition. Our device is 50% smaller, it recharges far faster. And importantly, the recharger doesn't need to be perfectly aligned for a successful charge. Additionally, Medtronic is the only company to offer physician practices, the choice of recharge and recharge free. And this is very important in the neuromodulation space. The physicians' feedback on our InterStim Micro rechargeable product has been universally positive. And there are several early indications that our share in the U.S. is rebounding quickly, much like we saw in Europe following the Micro launch earlier this year. In just a few weeks, we're winning back accounts and we're seeing cases where our competitors device is being explanted and replaced by Micro. We've been waiting for this. Patients now have the ability to choose a smaller, better rechargeable product. Physician practices to prefer to deal with one company. And our team is enjoying taking back the share. Finally, in diabetes, look, we're missing out on the better growth of this market, and nobody at Medtronic is comfortable with this dynamic. And we're pushing on several fronts to advance our technology. We're actively increasing both our near and our long-term growth opportunities, through increased organic investment, innovative funding with our recently announced Blackstone partnership, and inorganic activity, highlighted by the announcement earlier this month of our pending acquisition of Companion Medical. Companion Smartpen technology expands our ecosystem to include the multi daily injection portion of the diabetes market, with a patient population that is nearly 12 times larger than that that use insulin pumps. But make no mistake, we are still very focused on regaining technology leadership in the pump and the sensor market. However, we're also going to meet patients where they are, and provide them with real time data guided support. We expect to build a system that combines in pen with our Smart CGM technology, including our neutrino and clue artificial intelligence algorithms. All of this designed to deliver better outcomes and reduce the burden of managing the disease for MDI patients. See, Companion is just one more example of how we're going on the offensive as a company through an increased cadence of tuck-in acquisitions. In fact, in addition to Companion, we've done two other major tuck-in acquisitions this calendar year, with Digital Surgery and Medicrea. Combined, these three deals totaled approximately $1 billion in total consideration. Data and analytics are the next big frontier in surgery. That's why we acquired the pioneering technology company, Digital surgery, the leader in surgical artificial intelligence. We're integrating their technology into our soft tissue robotic assisted surgery system, and also intending to use their surgical video management and clinician decision support solutions beyond robotics. In fact, we plan on a limited launch this fall for the Touch Surgery Enterprise, which is an extremely easy-to-use, surgical video capture solution, paired with a computer and connected to the cloud. Medicrea, a pending acquisition we announced last month has differentiated technology that incorporates artificial intelligence into surgical planning for spine cases, and then uses the plan to create personalized spinal implants. With Medicrea, Medtronic will be the first company to offer an integrated spine surgery solution that includes AI-driven surgical planning, personalized implants and robotic assisted surgical delivery. This further extends our competitive advantage in Spine. We will continue to use the strength of our balance sheet to supplement our organic growth, and help drive increased and sustained revenue growth into the future. Next, let's turn to our pipeline, which is not just a share taking pipeline, it expands the total addressable market for Medtronic, as we intend to bring innovative technology to large healthcare opportunities, such as hypertension and cancer screening. So starting with our cardiac and vascular group, I've already mentioned the impact that our recent launches of Micro AV and Cobalt and Chrome are having in our CRHF division. But in addition to that, our next generation cardiac diagnostic LINQ II, received FDA approval in the quarter. And we began the limited U.S. release and expect the full market launch by calendar yearend. In our cardiac ablation solutions business, we started the European limited release of our Diamond Temp Cardiac Ablation system, with its unique closed-loop temperature-controlled RF system. And in June, our Arctic Front Advance Cryo system, became the first ablation system to receive FDA approval to treat patients with persistent AF. And this Saturday, results from our stop AF first trial, which studied our Cryoballoon as a first line treatment for paroxysmal AF, will be presented virtually as a late breaking trial at ESC. And in our coronary business, our Resolute Onyx Drug Eluting Stent became the first and only stent to receive CE Mark for one month DAPT treatment, for high bleeding risk patients. And we expect FDA approval for this differentiated labeling later this calendar year. In CVG, we also resumed a number of important clinical trials that were on hold due to the pandemic, including our pivotal trials for our extra vascular ICD, our Intrepid Transcatheter Mitral Valve, our PulseSelect Pulsed Field Ablation system, and our Symplicity Spyral renal denervation system. In our ON MED renal denervation trial, half of the sites have resumed enrollment, and we're aiming to complete the trial and present the data next calendar year. We're in the lead with Ardian, and this represents a multibillion dollar opportunity to better treat the millions of patients around the world, who suffer from hypertension. As I've already mentioned, we're now launching a number of products across the restorative therapies group, like the DTM spinal cord stimulator, our InterStim Micro sacral nerve stimulator and our Percept PC deep brain stimulator. Look, RTG is on a roll. And we expect these products to drive growth and take share going forward. And we intend to keep the RTG momentum going well into the future. We're making large investments in new products for neurovascular, for ENT and for enhancements to our Mazor X spinal robotic system. In diabetes, we continue to execute on our near-term pipeline. We're on track for the Minimed 770G approval later this summer. We've received CE Mark approval for our Minimed 780G, advanced hybrid closed-loop system and we'll launch this fall. We also continue to make meaningful progress on our sensor pipeline. Our U.S. pivotal trial for synergy is now underway. Enrollment is going well, and we're getting great feedback on this disposable sensor that is 50% smaller than our current product. In our Minimally Invasive Therapies group, we continue to make progress on bringing our soft tissue robotic system to market. Our final validation and verification testing is going very well. And our surgeon feedback continues to be positive. On the last earnings call, we told you that our timeline had been disrupted by COVID-19, but we've been managing through this and mitigating the impact to our timelines. In fact, we expect to be in a position to file for CE Mark and U.S. IDE approval in the first calendar quarter of 2021. Now COVID could change that, but we thought it was important to update you as to where we are today, and let you know that we have a high level of confidence as we move towards commercialization. In MITG, we've also been rapidly developing new solutions to treat COVID-19, including adding remote management capability to our Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator, integrating nalcor pulse oximetry sensors with label therms, closed-loop high flow ventilation system, and enhancing our vital sync remote monitoring solution to allow caregivers to remotely monitor our pulse oximetry and our capnography devices through a mobile application. Many of these features, they were developed in days and weeks, which in the past might have taken us months and quarters. But because we found new ways, we're moving faster. We're partnering with others, whether that's on technology development or in supply chain relationships. We're working with our regulators to ensure they have everything they need to streamline their decision makers, and our own people are stepping up across the company. As one example, we increased our internal ventilator production fivefold in a matter of just a few months, from 200 a week to over 1,000 a week. This is what I mean, when I say Medtronic is finding a new gear. We've been operating with a high sense of urgency, and we're going to carry this forward. I've discussed in the past how our organization needs to simplify and become less bureaucratic. In the coming weeks, you're going to hear more about the actions we're taking to become a more nimble and a more competitive organization, empowering our business units, while also allowing them to take advantage of Medtronic's global scale. I'm really excited about this direction. And I'm convinced that by empowering our general managers, we can become more competitive, we can accelerate our innovation, we can serve our customers better, and we're going to unlock a lot of value for our shareholders. So, with that, let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our first quarter financials and our outlook. Karen, over to you. Karen Parkhill : Thank you. As Geoff mentioned, our first quarter organic revenue decline of approximately 17% was better than initially expected, and an 8 point improvement over last quarter. CVG and RTG, in particular had double digit improvement from their fourth quarter decline. Within CVG, cardiac rhythm and heart failure improved the most declining in the mid-teens, thanks to both rebounding procedures, and share capture from new products. And within RTG, core spine and pain stim had strong sequential improvement, with the bounce back of these more deferrable procedures in the United States. I would note that our organic revenue decline excludes the benefit we received from an extra week of sales in the first fiscal month of the quarter, which we estimate added approximately $360 million to $390 million in revenue, less than our extra week would have been without a pandemic. But it's important to know this benefit was offset by our plan to reduce customer both purchases. Hopefully, you'll recall from prior earnings calls that we intended to use a good portion of the benefit from this extra week to reduce the practice of customers placing large bulk orders, as we're working to better balance these across the quarter. We began this process earlier than planned, due to depressed demand with COVID in the fourth quarter, and we still had some residual reduction in customer inventory levels this quarter. As we look ahead, the vast majority of the bulk reduction is behind us. There are only a small number of areas, such as our TAVR business, where we've been transitioning to a consignment model in select U.S. accounts, and where we should see another quarter or two of modest headwind. On the bottom line, our adjusted EPS was $0.62, a decline of 51% including an estimated benefit from the extra week of approximately $0.06 to $0.10. As our revenue improved throughout the quarter, we saw a strong flow through to our bottom line, resulting in EPS well ahead of expectations. That said, with a decline in revenue, we continue to see deleveraging down our P&L. Several of our plants ran at less than full capacity, resulting in a larger period expense of our fixed overhead costs, and a decline in our gross margin as we expected. We also had increased SG&A and R&D spend, as I signaled last quarter, given both the extra week and the increased investment we are making in our pipeline and product launches. As a result, our operating margin was 16.5%, down 12 points year-over-year, but an improvement of 40 basis points from last quarter. Turning to our balance sheet, our financial position is strong, with ample liquidity to act on opportunities. We remain focused on investing, both organically and in organically through tuck-in acquisitions and minority investments, to drive our long-term growth strategies. We've increased our cadence of M&A, and we're increasing our level of R&D investment, with partners like Blackstone Life Sciences, who will invest more than $300 million over the next several years, to help us accelerate specific pump and CGM programs and diabetes. These creative strategies will enable us to accelerate our planned investment and our growth. I view this as a key win for our company, the patients we serve and you, our shareholders. Turning more to the macro level, we expect both organic and inorganic investments to fuel a longer-term revenue growth acceleration, creating strong returns for our shareholders, supplemented by our growing dividend. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we've increased our dividend for 43 years, and our current yield of 2.3% is in the upper quartile of S&P 500 healthcare companies. Looking ahead, the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to make it difficult to provide our traditional, annual and quarterly guidance. However, as we shared last quarter, we intend to be as transparent as possible, to help you understand how we're thinking about the trajectory of our business. We've experienced a faster than expected recovery. On the topline, May was better than April and June was better than May. And that improvement has continued into July and August. While there's still uncertainty regarding to recovery, if these trends hold, we would expect our second quarter organic growth rate to improve at a rate similar to what we saw between the fourth and the first quarters, where the fourth was down 25% and the first declined 17%. From there, we expect sequential improvement in the third and fourth quarters. And we still expect to be back to normal growth in the fourth quarter on a two-year stacked basis. When we look at our second quarter expectations by group, MITG should be better than the company average, given continued increased demand in our respiratory business and increased volumes in surgical innovation. CVG has the potential to be a little better than company average, given its new product introductions. Diabetes is expected to perform roughly in line. And RTG could be a little below the total company, given its high mix capital equipment sales, but we're still seeing some sequential improvement. Looking at the P&L, we're investing to support numerous product launches. And we're investing in R&D programs to ensure our pipeline remains full. Despite the pandemic, we're not pulling back. Instead, we're focused on making the necessary investments to accelerate our revenue growth and ensure the long-term health of our company. Having said that, we could see a couple of points of sequential improvement in both our gross and operating margins in the second quarter compared to the first. And we expect continued margin improvement through the second-half, until we return to more normal margins sometime toward the end of our fiscal year. Regarding currency, the picture has improved with a weakening dollar. On revenue, assuming recent rate hold constant, our second quarter impact flips to a slight tailwind, after two years of a headwind, and a full year benefit is now over $100 million. On the bottom line at recent rates, the second quarter headwind should be similar to the first, and the full year has improved by about a nickel from the $0.20 impact, I mentioned last quarter. 5As I wrap-up, I would want you to take away that whatever the recovery looks like, we intend to outpace our end market. We're focused on competing and winning, and we have the industry's best and broadest pipeline, the resources and the people to do it. The future is bright. And I'm proud to be part of this team driving our imperatives to fuel our growth and also fulfill our mission, ensuring that millions of people around the world can benefit from our products and services. Back to you, Geoff. Geoff Martha : Okay. Thanks, Karen. I hope you got a sense today for our recovery trajectory, as well as how we're changing at Medtronic. And we'll continue this conversation at our Investor Day on October 14. During the pandemic, our entire leadership team came together to determine how we could better serve our customers and evolve our culture. We worked together to find this new gear, and we're on our way to becoming a more nimble and competitive organization. We're playing offense, and we're energized to use this moment, when our pipeline is kicking-in, to expand our markets and take share. And importantly, we're driving towards faster and broader topline growth, not just as we emerge from the pandemic, but sustainable growth over the long-term. So, with that, let's now move to Q&A. In addition to Karen and me, we also have our four group presidents : Mike Coyle, Bob White, Brett Wall, and Sean Salmon, here to answer your questions. As usual, we want to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question, and if necessary, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. And Geoff, congrats on a solid earning per share. I had one question and a follow-up, I'll ask them and then the same question. I guess, it's interesting you started your comments with a focus on market share, Geoff. One, is the implication here that Medtronic -- Medtronic's focus on market share, the implication is that you guys need to be grown in line to above market in markets? Because I do feel like one of the better thesis is Medtronic is too big to grow. So, is that about to change with this focus on market share? And what is driving this right? Is this -- has something changed here internally to drive this focus on market share to see that, being reflected in numbers? And as a follow-up, I think of robotic timeline in a calendar first quarter '21. I think the original time line was mid of this year, this five to six months, I just want to make sure that there's just purely a function of COVID and software issues, et cetera, they've been resolved. And what does it mean for robotic market share, right? If you're focused on market share process segments, it doesn't mean that Medtronic should gain it's fair share, and perhaps more than fair share of robotic surgery? Thanks, and I'll stop there. Geoff Martha : Okay. Thanks, Vijay. I appreciate the questions. On the first one, regarding market share, you're asking why the focus, what's changed. We spent the last couple of years talking about our pipeline. And this has been a big focus on the company. And like we've talked about our pipeline is the best it's been in a long-time. And as we went through this CEO transition, we spent a lot of time with the team on Zoom calls all the time. And we're determined to make this pipeline count, not just for patients, our customers but for shareholders. And so we feel that sometimes our market share isn't commensurate with our technology, meaning our technology should yield more market share. And, and this is an organizational focus that we want to take on, in terms of -- is really focused on -- really a deeper focus on understanding the end markets and their competitors, what the competitors are doing, and making sure that we understand that and compete effectively. And this isn't -- this is an organizational focus. This is not just -- I\u2019m not talking about our field, it's everybody. And understanding, each one of these competitive battles that we face, first recognizing those, understand what it's going to take to win and tracking them. And all these competitive battles add up, and there's no rounding error when it comes to one of these competitive battles. So it is an enhanced focus on market share. And we felt like now is the time to do this, given all the products that we have coming out. We want to make it -- like I said, we want to make the pipeline count not just for our patients, which is first and foremost, and our customers, but for our shareholders as well. So we felt that was the moment to do this. And we\u2019re really excited about that. And yes, the expectation is overall in aggregate to grow at the market or higher. And we haven't done that in the recent past. And so in some cases, we need to exceed the market growth and make up for a couple areas where we're behind. But the expectation for every single one of our segments is to grow at least at the market share. And we've made that really clear, and as you talk to people in Medtronic, I think that message is out there. Your second question about the robot. Yes, I mean, the delays were driven by COVID. Yes, the software issues we've talked about in the past, we believe are resolved and we're in the final validation and verification. And the testing has gone really well. We've got surgeons working on these robots. And like I said, the feedback is great and we're excited. And we're going to hit our market release date here shortly. And what that means for us is that that triggers to file, the ability for us to file, which we talked about in the commentary, I mentioned in calendar Q1 for both CE Mark and U.S. IDE. So, yes, we feel like this has addressed. We've got a high level of confidence. And now, the excitement is building by the company, and with our surgeons that are working on this. So we're excited. And you asked about a market share forecast. I'm not prepared to give that right now. I mean, we're going up against a strong competitor. We're really excited about this. My time at Medtronic, I feel like we're in a position where you're defending high market shares from new competitors. It's going to be fun to be on the other end of that equation, and coming out a well-established 100% market share competitor, but coming out with some great technology, with the financial resources at Medtronic, a really energized field sales force. So, we're looking forward to this. I'm not going to give our market share forecast, but we're going to be a meaningful player in this market. Go big or go home, Vijay. We're going to be meaningful in this and we're excited. Vijay Kumar : I love that. Go big or go home. Congrats, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins at Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Just one clarification and one question. On the clarification side, you mentioned talking about some disclosure you'll be making over the next couple of weeks about kind of changes at Medtronic. Is that all stuff that's going to come at the at the Analyst Day? Or are there disclosures coming before that? So that's just the clarification. And then the question is, Geoff I was really encouraged to hear your comments about improvements continuing into July and August. And obviously Karen made those as well. That's a huge issue for Medtronic and for all of medtech, because there is a lot of uncertainty out there. So, Geoff, I was wondering if you could just make some comments on just what you're seeing out there in July and August in terms of kind of the rescheduled procedures versus new demand. And what you're hearing from hospitals and patients, just any comments on that kind of the pace of the broader recovery would be much appreciated? Geoff Martha : All right. Thanks, Bob. One on the clarification, on the changes, these are changes we'll talk more about like you mentioned at our Investor Day. And I don't want to go too deep into them today. But the broad brush strokes are some structural changes that empower our businesses to make decisions and to be more -- and this is really getting at speed of decision making and being nimble and faster. And as you know, we're competing against a lot of focused, smaller focused companies, not just here, but in China and other places around the world. And then, but at the same time, allowing these businesses to benefit from very specific and meaningful areas where our scale makes a difference, like technology platforms. Anytime our businesses are pooling from broader technology platforms in Medtronic, they're able to iterate on a much more consistent, meaningful iteration on a much faster and consistent basis and also disrupt. Like we did with what we're doing with Micro right now, in the pacing space. Our manufacturing footprint to ensure a high-quality standard all the time, at the right price, at the right cost levels. So things, technology, manufacturing, our regional scale as we move into some of these regions, these are all areas that we want to make sure businesses can benefit from. But in terms of disclosures, I don't -- there's not going to be like disclosures before that. We'd be rolling this out to within the company over the next couple of weeks, a month of two. But I don't think there's going to be any more disclosures on that until we get to Investor Day to talk about it. And in terms of your question around the market improvement, it is encouraging. A couple comments there. First, there's a big difference depending on the therapy or product area and the business that we're in. We do have a wide range here things that are more urgent like neurovascular things that are more elective. Some of the areas like pelvic health or something like that. We're seeing by country it's different but we're seeing a much -- we've seen much of -- continued to see a much sharper recovery in the United States and Europe. China has been pretty steady. But the whole pile of geographies and all of the therapy areas, all of them are improving. And we're seeing sequential month over month improvement. I think the last time we had earnings call, we were talking about how things ended in April and we had some momentum into May. Well, that every week it's got -- every month it's gotten better into June, July and into the first couple weeks of August. We continue to see improvements here. And in terms of the patient fear, look the surveys that we've seen and conducted, that has been -- it's still out there, but it's been in my opinion mitigated quite a bit. And in the hospitals, and I just talked to another hospital's CEO on Friday. This is in the U.S. context. They seem very committed to staying, to keep open for business and serving patients. And, I think they also need it financially another shutdown, something they want to do. And then, the other thing that I think -- so these are all things that are going on out there. And we're participating in helping with patients fear and where we partnered with, The American Heart Association, American Stroke Association. And we're working with physicians, we're working with -- but the other area I want to highlight is the stuff that we're doing. Like I just mentioned, we're out there working with physicians, and their offices and hospitals. We're out there, staying focused on our customers. We're also helping them implement new technologies that really help in this COVID timeframe. Like our remote capabilities, especially in cardiac rhythm right now. That's making a big difference. We talked about the ventilator space. I mean, these were physician specific requests that came from individual hospitals around product features. And our response to this, and how fast we move, this makes a big difference. And the stories circulate within the hospital and the C-suites have been more engaged with us. And so, between the market coming back from a geography perspective, from a therapy perspective, and the actions that we've taken over the last couple of months, we're in a way better position than we thought we would be just three months ago. And we see the continued momentum. Now, everybody is a little nervous about the fall with the back-to-school. I just dropped off two college students in the last week. But like I said earlier, I do think hospitals are committed to staying open. And we're feeling better about like what maybe potential disruption. We don't feel -- we're not as worried about it as we were a couple months ago. Hope that helps. Bob Hopkins : Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Next question please, Regina? Operator : Next question comes from line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Just two for me. I'll ask them right up front for Geoff and Karen. So Geoff, I know it's early, but what's the profile Medtronic should aspire to relative to 4% and 8% top and bottom you gave back in 2018? And if we can't get specific numbers, I'm just sort of curious should investors expect that both of those numbers should move higher? Or is the focus more on revenue for the intermediate-term? And then Karen, just kind of related question. There's been a series of often on balance sheet transactions, most notably the recent M&A and Blackstone. So that clearly suggests the company's desire to accelerate growth. What does it tell us, if anything, Karen about sort of the flexibility of the P&L in terms of margin opportunities going forward? Thanks so much. Geoff Martha : I'll take a stab, David, first. Thanks for the question. Let me take a stab at it, and then I'll hand it off to Karen. But on the 8% EPS, and we're committed to that, right? So, we talk about market share and we talk about growth. Let me be clear, it's not at the expense of that 8% EPS growth, and our free cash flow conversion, which we've worked so hard to improve over the last couple years. So, we're not going to take a step back there, we're committed to that. And as we grow more, right, as we grow at the market more as an aggregate which would be a meaningful improvement over the last couple years, and take share, the growth will get higher, we'll have some optionality of what to do with that incremental earnings. But we're committed to that 8%. And we'll decide as that growth gets there, what we're going to do with the extra EPS, I'd like to invest some of it. And we'll see what we do with the rest here. But with that, maybe I'll turn it over to Karen to also comment. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Geoff. And thanks, David, for the questions. Yes, we have a strong balance sheet. And we have been using that to help our growth. And we've supplemented that, as you mentioned with partners like Blackstone to help us accelerate that growth. In terms of the flexibility of the P&L for margin going forward, what I would say is that our bias is going to be on driving revenue acceleration higher and keeping it consistent. And so, given that bias, we will be focused on continuing to invest to ensure that our pipeline remains as full as it has been in the recent past. So, could margins improve? Yes, a little bit. But we're more committed to driving that revenue growth acceleration and maintaining a bottom line EPS of 8% plus, then we are on dropping significant amount to the bottom line. We'll be focused more on investing. Hope that helps. David Lewis : Super helpful. Thanks so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, David. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan. Robbie Marcus : Thanks for taking the question. And I'll be the first to tell you I did kind of like the video format. It was good to see you after being virtual for so long. Maybe on the question, and I'll kind of loop two in here. The first is we're seeing you year-over-year increases in R&D, while we're seeing most of your peers down year-over-year. You're clearly leaning in on R&D. I was wondering where are these dollars going. What are the projects that you're seeing and you're investing in? And then maybe along those lines, you're also clearly investing heavily in diabetes. There was speculation a while ago, maybe you'd exit that business. It looks to me less likely given how much you're putting in into resources here. What's the latest thoughts? You have new management, lots of investment there. How should we be thinking about this business? And is this a three to five year turnaround story? Or is it something we could see in the shorter-term? Thanks. Geoff Martha : Okay. Thanks, Robbie, lot into those questions there. First, thanks for the compliment on the video. I'm glad it went well. My wife was skeptical, but I thought it was okay. We'll see how we go going forward here. In terms of the R&D increases, yes, we want to put more into R&D, both and be creative. And when I look at R&D, we're looking at traditional R&D offer income statement, these creative third party partnerships like Blackstone, which have a very good return on them, are also something we want to use, and are inorganic. I mean, because most of what we're buying is technology, technology oriented tuck-ins, which are all somewhere on our path to commercialization or just been commercialized. So, all of this gets back to investing in areas in our business. We just have a lot of great ideas. The old idea that our eyes are bigger than our stomach. We want to get more R&D capability here. We've got just to list some of the products, we are talking about our pipeline today that's coming out, right. But the R&D and there's some R&D that needs to go into sustaining that and iterating that things like, spinal robotics and things like that. I mean, we're not done. We're just getting started. So, there's a lot more to go into there, but some of the things that are on the pipeline like already in that's a multibillion dollar opportunity there. The EV ICD, I'll start with cardiac here, PulseSelect Pulsed Field Ablation, I mean, just those three are, I'd call more medium-term for us and are very exciting, and I think could use more investment to speed up and drive bigger impact. And in RTG, there's always more to invest in neurovascular. Brett Wall and Stacey Pugh to make sure of that, there's lots of products there. And that's a high growth area. Like I mentioned, DBS, we have the directional lead system coming out. We want to invest in closed-loop. I just think, look, neuromodulation is a big growth opportunity for the industry, for the company, and I think it's going to have a huge impact on patients. And then MITG, obviously, the soft tissue robot, we talked about the timeline there. But we still have to commercialize that, that's going to take some investment, may not show up in the R&D line, but we need to invest there. And we mentioned in the commentary, some of the products are starting to come out from our digital surgery acquisition this touch surgery enterprise, very excited about that as we move, we believe we're leading in robotic soft tissue robotics, the AI and side of it. And so there's a lot of opportunity there. And then of course, diabetes, we've got to catch up on the sensor side, and we're -- I don't know everybody picked up, but we're really excited about the sensor pipeline here. I wish it were happening even faster, but it is accelerated from what we -- we're well into the synergy trial enrollment rather and getting great feedback on that. So there's lots of opportunities for R&D investment, and that's probably, I don't know, 70%, 80% of what we're talking about internally, is this pipeline and how do we feed it, how do we speed it up. So, very excited about that. And then, speaking on diabetes, you said three to five years, I'm not even going to ask Sean this question, because I know the answer is not three to five years, it's going to be faster than that. And I think when we get 70%, 80% out there, it's going to be a big step forward or like I mentioned, our sensor pipeline, which is the weak spot here, that is, we feel good about that. And again, I wish it were faster, but it isn't three to five years. And the rumors about diabetes, that they didn't come from us. I mean, we're committed to this and we've never blinked and we're not going to. Robbie Marcus : Thanks a lot. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Robbie. Next question, please, Regina? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning, everybody. As has been communicated with investors this morning, one of the themes coming across is a sense of being reinvigorated or quote a different Medtronic. So what do you see just because you're relatively new in the CEO role and you get to do it in the midst of a pandemic? What do you see that is different that how you're going to make your mark on the company? And on the other side of this pandemic, how do you think Medtronic is going to look different? Because it seems to me that the way Medtronic approached managing its employees during the pandemic may be somewhat different than the way others have. Thank you. Geoff Martha : In terms of a reinvigorated, I think we do feel reinvigorated and it's in large part, because of where we sit right now as a company. I mean, this pipeline is exciting, and it's something that we've been investing in for a long time. And look, the COVID has extracted a huge human toll and an economic toll. So I'm looking for bright spots coming out of COVID. And one of them has been the ability for during this time our leadership team to sit down together. Like I said, a lot of Zoom calls and some face to face, but and really look at where we are as a company and take a step back. And what we're seeing is way more opportunities than challenges. But top of that, I mean, look, we've got our mission, especially during a pandemic like this really shows how valuable that mission is. And it helps us clarify our decisions, and really helps us in our opinion stand out relative to others, and how we react and how we show up. And so we've always had that and that has shown even just -- we're reminded how powerful that is during a crisis like we face now. We've got a very -- we've got great technology, great market positions. We've got a very experienced leadership team, and I come back to this pipeline. And so when we started to look at all this, we feel like there's just a huge opportunity. We want to make this pipeline count. And so, that's why we're excited. And if it feels like we're reinvigorated, that's good. I don't know, if I want to use that word, but I can tell you that we're excited, because of all this and the opportunity. And it's not just like, hey, here's the pipeline, and it's going to work its way through and then there's like peaks and troughs. That's not it. We're refilling this pipeline. I just mentioned all these, I just went through the last question all of these things about the R&D, where we're putting it. There's so much to do, so much opportunity. So, yes we are excited. And that's why we also are focusing on this market share opportunity. We want to make this pipeline count. And how we look different? One, in the near-term, we want to be growing at or above the market. So, whatever the recovery is, it's hard to forecast. We're trying our best as you guys are to forecast the recovery, but we want to be on the leading edge of that, and doing better relative to our competitors. And, and our pipeline is going to lead the way and we're going to have great commercial execution here. And so that should be a meaningful increase to our growth relative to our competition. So, that looks different. And look, our employees have always had a strong loyalty and allegiance to Medtronic. But I think that's increased over the last couple of months, as people realized what a -- how much the mission means, but we still have work to do. And working on things like what is our role here and some of these social justice issues that are out in the communities that spill into our offices. And so you're going to see us more aggressive on those taking stronger stance on some of those issues. But over time, longer-term, we want to put the tech in medtech. And we want to shift, we want to pool in some of these digital technologies to change our offerings. And overtime, we're very device centric. In addition to the devices, we want to pull in data and analytics, and you start to see that in pockets of Medtronic, like with the neutrino acquisition, diabetes, the digital surgery acquisition and MITG for the soft tissue robot. We're working with -- partnering with companies like Viz.ai for stroke detection. And so, having our offerings be smarter and self-learning, and our offerings providing a lot of data and insights in addition to therapy back to our customers, I think this is an area that that this is going to take some time. But this is something we're committed to. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Joanne. Next question, please, Regina? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And mine are for Karen. Just Karen, one clarification, how much of the extra week was offset by reduced bulk purchases in the quarter? And for my question, last quarter, you gave some helpful commentary on the exit rates in the last month. What did you see in July relative to what looks like about a negative 9% organic year-over-year growth rate you're guiding to in fiscal Q2? And can you get to flat or growth in fiscal Q3? Thanks for taking the questions. Karen Parkhill : Thank you. Thank you, Larry. So, in terms of the extra week, basically, all of it was offset by the reduction in customer bulk purchases. So, the net effect was essentially very minimal. In terms of the monthly trends that we're seeing, we're not going to give year-over-year monthly comparisons. And that's really because the reduction in bulk sales and the different number of selling days in the quarter can make that confusing. But I would want you to take away that our -- and Jeff talked about this, our average daily sales rate saw a significant step-up in May, and then again in June, and that continued into July and August. And we believe this trend will continue. We've signaled that we believe our second quarter should see improvement, roughly equal to the improvement that we saw between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And just to remind you, the fourth quarter declined 25%, the first quarter 17%. That's a differential of about 8%. That's the kind of improvement that we would expect to see in the second quarter. And then we would expect to continue that improvement into the back-half. And by the time we reach our fourth quarter, we would expect to be back to more normal growth when you look at it on a two year stack basis. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Larry. I think we have time for maybe two more questions. We can take the next one, Regina. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. And I second Robbie's comments on the visual, too, so thanks for that. If I could just ask a question, Geoff, on the commentary around market share gains. And I'm curious, just more specifically, tied to sort of what you're talking about with the new infrastructure investments and things like that that we'll hear more about on the Analyst Day, how much of this sort of reinvigorated effort around really gaining market share and being more aggressive is tied to things like that versus potentially having to build out further from a product perspective and innovate even more on the pipeline? And that's my only question. Thank you so much. Geoff Martha : Well, on the innovation side, I mean, like I said, we feel like we've got a great pipeline, the best we've had, and it's coming to fruition now and we've got more out there in the medium and long-term. But we're not ever going to be satisfied on our pipeline. I mean, innovation is the lifeblood of the company. So we're always going to want to invest more and really just not -- ultimately the ultimate judge here would be the level of innovation and the outcomes we can produce with these technologies, both for patients and economic outcomes for the health system. So that's the ultimate. But we don't want to be outspent either. So we are investing more, using these creative like the Blackstone partnership, using our balance sheet more, trying to get more efficient. We're always going to try to get more efficient in R&D. So we're never going to be satisfied with innovation. Omar used to talk about it. He talks about health care as being like a by definition, an unlimited demand. As soon as you solve one problem, people want another problem solved and they want to solve faster. So we're going to keep going on the innovation. And the market share, it's really two things that we're going to need to do. Well, three things, really. You need to have the products right? You have the pipeline, which we've talked about. The other two areas that we've talked about is structurally, allowing to help increase that innovation, allowing our business units to have more leverage, the pool to be more nimble and faster to compete with. The marketplace in medtech is pretty competitive. Like I said, we face a lot of smaller and maybe more focused competition. And I don't really like this idea. Well, they're smaller, so they should grow faster. I don't -- I'm not a believer in that. And so neither is our leadership team, for that matter. And we're not accepting that. So, we want to treat our businesses and give them the ability to compete against anybody, whether it's a big, well-funded or competitor with lots of technology or more established competitor or a smaller up and coming competitor, we want to be able to compete with all. So it's making some structural changes to better position them for that. And then the third is just the cultural piece, it's just setting that expectation that we're always going to be a mission driven company. We're always going to be an innovation driven company. We're always going to be that company that's pushing the envelope here and starting new therapy areas like an RDN. We're going to be that company. But we also want to be the company that is able to kind of hold the share in these markets that we established. And in some cases like soft tissue robotics, where we weren't the first to come in as a meaningful second. And I think there's room for improvement and in the mindset of the company on competing like that. So that's a culture. So pipeline, always first, some structural changes that we think we can work through without too much disruption here, and the cultural changes around expectations on competing. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Danielle. We'll take the last question, please, Regina. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Raj Denhoy : Good morning. Wondering if maybe I could ask you about Companion Medical. You talked about the potential for that product in the diabetes market, but maybe you could share a little bit about your internal projections for revenue growth for that? And when it can start to be a meaningful contributor to your growth? Geoff Martha : Well, first on Companion, we haven't finalized the acquisition, so we're limited in what we can say, but Sean is the real champion and architect behind on that deal. And so maybe Sean, Sean Salmon's on the phone here. I'll turn it over to Sean for some comments. Sean Salmon : Yes. Great, thanks. Thanks for the question Raj. Yes, as Geoff said, the deal is not yet finalized, but the opportunity is very attractive. You'd heard Geoff\u2019s commentary, so there's about 12 times the number of patients. We think, by our modeling, it's about 13.5 million patients worldwide, who are using multiple daily injections to treat their diabetes. And it's a very, very underpenetrated opportunity. So for us to go into that market and add value to those who either choose to be there or have to be there, because of other considerations is where we want to meet those patients. And this really dovetails very nicely into our improving sensor pipeline, and adding the capabilities that we've added in the company over time. Those building blocks for the powerful AI and data science capabilities, which we think when deployed against knowing how much insulin you're getting, at what time, you can markedly improve the outcomes for patients who choose to use multiple daily injections. So, it does a few things right? We can capture more of the patients who are upstream and maybe patients who get comfortable with technology into some other solutions that we have in our automated insulin delivery systems. Raj Denhoy : Great. And maybe just Geoff one follow-up for you relative to acquisitions broadly right, so Companion and other kind of tuck-in deals you've talked about. Should one assume that you have no appetite for larger deals? Or we continue to focus really just on the tuck-in side of things, really just any broader thoughts here would be helpful? Geoff Martha : The focus is on the tuck-ins. And the tuck-ins can get up to billion dollars or low billions. But that's the focus. That's the focus. Like where we are right now, and the tuck-ins will help us. But we're not focused beyond that. Raj Denhoy : Great. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Raj. Geoff, would you like to conclude? Geoff Martha : Okay. Well, thanks for the questions. And look, I really appreciate, we all really appreciate your support and interest in Medtronic. And we're looking forward to presenting more details of our longer-term strategy at our October 14, Investor Day. And then updating you on our quarterly progress on our Q2 earnings call, which we anticipate holding on November 24. So thanks for joining us today. Stay healthy and safe, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. And you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's Fiscal Year 2021 Second Quarter Earnings Video Webcast. I am Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. Before we start the prepared remarks, I am going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our second quarter, which ended on October 30, 2020. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the sell side analysts that cover the company. Today's events should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a divisional and geographic revenue summary. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance which can be accessed from our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and are given on an organic basis which adjust for foreign currency. There were no acquisitions made in the last year that had a significant impact on our quarterly revenue growth. All references to share gains or losses are on a calendar quarter basis unless otherwise stated. Finally, reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And with that, let's get started. Geoffrey Martha : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our Q2 results were significantly stronger than Q1 and came in well ahead of our expectations. Our recovery from the depths of the pandemic has been faster than expected and we are now approaching year-over-year growth. Now while we continue to monitor COVID resurgence around the globe, healthcare systems are by and large better prepared and patients are more willing to seek the care they need. Obviously, there's some near-term uncertainty, but I am encouraged by the steps we have taken over the past year to position Medtronic, not only for continued recovery, but to maximize our performance over the medium and long-term. Now building on the strength of our pipeline, we're going on the offensive and winning share in several of our businesses. We're investing in opportunities to create and disrupt big markets and we're seeing the results. We're supplementing our pipeline with an increasing cadence of tuck-in M&A and we're in the process of implementing our new operating model and reenergizing our businesses with a competitive focus on market share and being bold. All of this is aimed at accelerating our growth and creating value for society and for our shareholders. Now like quarter, I'm going to lead off with a discussion on market share, and I'm pleased to note that we're winning share in an increasing number of our businesses. Our pipeline is coming to fruition and we're benefiting from recent product approvals across the company. Since last quarter, we received 50 product approvals, bringing our total to over 180 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China, since the start of the calendar year. We're also benefiting from the actions we took earlier this year to partner with our customers through the pandemic. We've helped our customers in areas such as environmental safety, hospital productivity, patient engagement, and remote monitoring and support and these partnerships are leading to increased market share in a number of accounts. In Cardiac Rhythm, we're notably outperforming competition. We estimate we've gained nearly 2 points of share year-over-year. Our pacemaker product line grew 6% globally, as our Micra leadless pacemaker family continued to perform extremely well, growing 75% globally and 84% in the U.S. Micra is now annualizing at approximately $350 million. We also continue to see the benefit of our recently launched Cobalt and Chrome high-power devices, with BlueSync distance programming and a patient app for remote monitoring. These are both important features in the current environment. Our CareLink remote monitoring adoption is up 10% globally and transmissions on our unique CareLink Express System, which enables unattended in-clinic follow-ups, increased 40% quarter-over-quarter. Our CRT-D product line grew 4%, driven by the Cobalt and Chrome launch and our improving replacement cycle. In addition, we're continuing to see strong adoption of our TYRX antibacterial envelopes, especially important during a pandemic where there's a renewed emphasis on avoiding infections of any kind. TYRX revenue more than doubled and it is utilized in over half of our U.S. CRM implants. In Cardiac Diagnostics, we estimate we gained modest share year-over-year as the launch of our LINQ II is offsetting Boston Scientific's entry into the market. In drug-coated balloons, we grew in the high-single digits and gained share both year-over-year and sequentially. We're seeing strong adoption of our IN.PACT AV DCB, driven in part by its pivotal data that was published earlier this fall in the New England Journal of Medicine. In Surgical Innovations, we held share year-over-year and our share is up nearly a point versus the prior quarter, driven by strong gains in Advanced Energy. We're earning share with superior products like our LigaSure Exact Dissector and our Sonicision Curved Jaw Ultrasonic Dissector. We're also wining back share from reprocessors. In Advanced Stapling, our share was down year-over-year with difficulty comps given J&J's recall in the prior year. However, we did gain share sequentially on the strength of our Tri-Staple technology. In our Restorative Therapies Group, we're beginning to see important share gain from recent product launches. Starting with Pelvic Health, we estimate we regained 8 points of share in the U.S. and 2 points in Europe sequentially from Axonics. This is the result of our very successful launches of our InterStim Micro rechargeable device and our SureScan MRI leads. We're quickly recapturing share in the rechargeable space with Micro as we get on contract in more and more accounts. From our FDA approval in August to the end of October, we believe our share of the U.S. rechargeable market has gone from 0% to over 50% in just three months, and we continue to see high trialing rates at 125% of pre-COVID levels, driven in part by our basic evaluation lead, which is a strong leading indicator of future growth. In Pain Stim, we continue to see strong momentum as the markets adopt our DTM therapy on our Intellis platform. While we're facing headwinds in replacements, given where we are in our cycle, we estimate that we gain new implant share in the U.S. Also our new SCS implants in the U.S. grew in the high single digits in the quarter and we saw strong trialing increases year-over-year, a leading indicator of future growth in this business. Importantly, we're seeing the majority of our new implant and trialing growth coming from competitive accounts, as we win share from competitors. This is all being driven by the strength of our DTM data, which showed superiority over conventional stim at three months, but we strengthened this evidence last month when we showed DTM superiority that is sustained at 12 months. In Brain Modulation, we're building momentum with our Percept PC device, the first and only DBS system that can sense brain signals. Now we launched Percept in the U.S. this past quarter. While our U.S. share was down year-over-year, Percept drove increasing new implant share gains each month as we went through the quarter, returning Brain Modulation to growth. In ENT, we gained share both sequentially and year-over-year. We launched several new products in the quarter, including our NextGen nerve monitoring program, NIM Vital; our PTI system for parathyroid detection; and Stealth Station Flex ENT, our new nav system to support outpatient ENT procedures. And going forward, we expect these launches to continue to drive share gains and market growth. In Neurovascular, we had a good quarter in aspiration, coils and access, resulting in overall growth for our neurovascular business. While we had share loss and flow diversion due to our new entrants in the U.S. market, we estimate that our share of neurovascular increased overall, as we won share from both Penumbra and Terumo. Now turning to the businesses where we are holding share, we estimate that our procedure share was steady in both drug-eluting stents and TAVR on a sequential basis. In DES we were one of the winners in the Chinese National Tender and will receive volume that is being reallocated from our multinational and local competitors, whose tender bids were not accepted. While our volume will increase significantly, this will be more than offset by significant price declines as dictated by the tender. This will impact our business over the coming quarters. That said, we believe participating in the Chinese that market is a long-term strategic opportunity. As our increased access to more Chinese hospitals will provide opportunities to pull through our full product line today, as well as in the future with products like TAVR and renal denervation. Speaking of TAVR we held procedure share in the U.S., Europe and Japan sequentially. We expect to be back to gaining share year-over-year in the U.S. next quarter as we anniversary our share loss from our fiscal third quarter last year. The market is responding to our competitor messaging on our valve hemodynamics which is a key determinant of valve selection in low risk patients. We're also getting favorable customer response to our data in bicuspid patients, which make up a large portion of the low risk population and we're continuing to increase our field personnel and open new accounts in the U.S. which we expect to lead to share gains going forward, both from Edwards as well as winning share in Boston Scientific accounts given their recent decision to remove their Lotus valve from the market. In MITG we estimate we held share in both GI and respiratory. In respiratory we saw strong acceleration in ventilator sales with our revenue increasing nearly fourfold year-over-year and growing nearly 50% over Q1. This is driven by our ability to increase production and shift our mix to our high acuity PB 980 ventilator to fulfill backorders and meet customer demand particularly in the U.S. and Europe. We do expect ventilator revenue to decline sequentially in the back half of our fiscal year, returning to more normal levels in FY '22. In Spine, we estimate that we held share year-over-year with a slight gain in the U.S. We\u2019re seeing strong double-digit growth in our surface enhanced titanium interbodies that came from our acquisition of Titan Spine last year which is now in our organic results. In Spinal Robotics, while large capital equipment purchases continue to be pressured as a result of COVID, we estimate that we sold over one and a half times that number of robots than Globus did. We continue to grow our share in the spine robot market which is a good leading indicator of our future spine implant sales. In addition, we\u2019re expanding the capabilities of our Mazor X robot. We received approval earlier this month for navigated interbodies, as well as our Midas Rex high-speed power drills. While we\u2019re growing and holding share in many important businesses, there are also areas in which we are losing share and we\u2019re working to improve. In diabetes, we discussed with you our plans to return this business to market growth and we\u2019re seeing positive early signs as we lay the groundwork to create a business that can compete and win. We performed better than expected in Q2, but there is much more to do and we're laser focused on doing what it takes to return to market growth. The MiniMed 780G launch is off to a great start in Europe and we just started the limited release of the 770G in the U.S. last week. As a reminder, we plan to enable 770G users to upgrade their pump to a 780G through a software download once we get 780G approval. We\u2019re also pleased by the recent CMS proposal to cover all CGM devices. If finalized, it would ensure patients transitioning into Medicare have continued coverage for their integrated CGM and will open up the U.S. Medicare market to our closed-loop insulin pump systems as early as April. Regarding Companion Medical, the acquisition closed in September and we\u2019re excited to have the team on board. Companion revenue was minimal in Q2, but we expected to become more meaningful going forward. We announced the integration of our CGM data into the companion InPen app two weeks ago. This will allow InPen users to have their Medtronic CGM readings in real-time alongside insulin dose information, all in one view. We were able to deliver this solution ahead of schedule in just two months instead of two quarters, and this speaks to the strong integration work that is happening between our diabetes team and Companion Medical. It's also a great example of how Medtronic is operating with speed and a sense of urgency across the company. Now let's turn to our pipeline which has a number of future opportunities for us to win share as well as create in disrupted markets. We covered this in detail with you last month at our Investor Day, so I\u2019m going to give the abridged version today. Starting with CVG we continue to make good progress on several opportunities highlighted at Investor Day. It appears to have been missed by the Street last week, but last Monday was a huge day for the treatment of AF. Our Arctic Front Cryo balloon was the subject of a simultaneous AHA data presentation and New England Journal of Medicine publication, that promises to redefine the role of our cryoablation technology, making it first-line therapy in the treatment of paroxysmal AF. We currently have CE Mark for this indication and anticipate FDA approval in the first half of next calendar year. Regarding our DiamondTemp cardiac ablation system, it continues to rollout in Europe and we\u2019re targeting a U.S. launch in the first half of the next calendar year. Also, in CVG we\u2019re enrolling pivotal trials for Extra Vascular ICD, our Intrepid Transcatheter Mitral Valve, our PulseSelect Pulsed Field Ablation System and our Symplicity Spyral Renal Denervation system. Now, RDN represents one of our biggest opportunities to become an important therapy to treat the millions of patients around the world who struggle with hypertension. We\u2019re aiming to complete the ON MED trial and present the data next calendar year. In MITG we\u2019re excited about bringing our soft-tissue robotic system to the market. We continue to expect to file for CE Mark and U.S. IDE approval in the first calendar quarter of 2021. Although these filings are likely to occur later in the calendar quarter as COVID is slowing some of our on-site activities. In RTG, we\u2019re making large investments in new products for neurovascular and ENT and in enhancements to our Mazor X spinal robotic system. We\u2019re also focused on expanding indications in spinal cord stimulation and bringing to market our steerable lead and closed-loop system in DBS. In diabetes, we continue to work with the FDA on the most efficient filing strategy for the 780G, while on the sensor front we submitted our Zeus sensor to the FDA in October, and we have completed our SYNERGY pivotal trial and will file it when we complete the manufacturing module. We continue to get great feedback on SYNERGY, which is disposable, it's much easier to use and half the size of our current sensor. These are just a few of the many innovative products in our pipeline. We expect them to be the foundation for material future revenue growth and we\u2019re excited to keep you updated on our progress. I will now have Karen take you through a discussion of our second quarter financials and our outlook and then I\u2019m going to come back with some concluding remarks before we go to Q&A. Karen, over to you. Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Geoff. Our second quarter organic revenue of $7.6 billion declined 1.5% and adjusted EPS of $1.02 declined 22% from last year. However, compared to the prior quarter, our revenue increased 18% and adjusted EPS grew by 65% as our end markets continued to recover. In fact, we continue to see sequential revenue improvement each month and despite the number of COVID cases rising in many of our markets, October was better than September in all of our groups and regions with the exception of China, given the impact of the national tender in drug-eluting stents. MITG led the way with its growth rate increasing by over 20 points in both Surgical Innovations and Respiratory GI and Renal. SI benefitted from increased elective procedure volumes in Europe and the United States driven in part by elective procedures that were delayed from the spring and early summer. Our RGR's improvement came from strong ventilator sales as well as from GI patient monitoring and renal care products. Across MITG we had growth in a number of our businesses in the second quarter including advanced energy, lung health, airways, ventilators and patient monitoring. CVG and RTG also delivered double-digit improvements from the first quarter with increased procedure volumes and share capture and several businesses returned to growth from the prior year. In CVG, we grew in pacing, CRT-Ds, TYRX, aortic and drug-coated balloons. And in RTG, we grew and DBS, neurovascular, pelvic health and China Orthopedics. On the P&L, while we continue to see the expected deleveraging year-over-year, the recovery in our business is evident in the sequential improvement in our adjusted margins, over 300 basis points in our gross margin and nearly 600 basis points in our operating margin. Our better than expected revenue flowed through to the bottom line resulting in EPS well ahead of expectations. Turning to our balance sheet. Our financial position remained strong. In the quarter, we completed another euro debt offering \u20ac6.25 billion and used the proceeds to reduce our U.S. dollar debt and prefund our March euro debt maturities, driving roughly $80 million of additional annualized savings. This was our third euro transaction in the past year and a half. Combined, we have issued over $18 billion and our portfolio now sits with a weighted average maturity of over 12 years and a weighted average coupon of less than 2%, among the lowest of the large cap issuers and the lowest among our competitors in medtech. As I shared with you at our Investor Day last month, we remain focused on investing, both organically and inorganically through tuck-in acquisitions and minority investments to drive our long-term growth strategies. Last month, we announced the acquisition of Ai Biomed to expand our ENT portfolio. In addition, we closed our acquisition of Avenu Medical and Peripheral Vascular earlier this month and we announced the completion of our Medicrea acquisition in spine last week. We expect both our organic and inorganic investments to fuel a longer term revenue growth acceleration, ultimately creating strong returns for our shareholders, supplemented by our strong and growing dividend. We are an S&P Dividend Aristocrat having increased our dividend for 43 years, and our current yield of 2.1% places as in the upper quintile of S&P 500 Healthcare Companies. Now turning to our outlook, particularly with the rising cases of COVID around the world, the impact to our business remains difficult to predict. So we will continue to not provide our typical guidance. That said, I do want to give you a sense of the recovery ahead. While it is still early in our third quarter, we've seen our average weekly sales track ahead of the same weeks in the second quarter. So while there are pockets of more restrictions and delayed procedures around the globe, the impact to us has thus far been limited. As we've said before, hospitals are better equipped now to handle COVID patients and remain open to serve non-COVID patients. And over time and with education, patient fear is not as heightened as it was last spring and early summer. While there is still uncertainty ahead, if the recovery trend continues as it has to-date, our third quarter revenue could be flat to slightly up year-over-year on an organic basis. And we would continue to expect to return to normal organic revenue growth on a two-year stacked basis by our fiscal fourth quarter. By group next quarter, MITG growth could be in the low single digits, a little lower than the second quarter, given the benefit we had from strong ventilator sales. RTG and Diabetes should deliver improvements from the second quarter with a decline in the low single digits and CVG should be roughly flat as we continue to recover and take share. On the P&L, while we are continuing to invest in our product pipeline and launches during the pandemic, we still expect sequential operating leverage as we recover. For both our gross and operating margins, we would expect a couple points of improvement in the third quarter versus the second and we continue to expect to return to more normal operating margins in the fourth quarter. Regarding currency, assuming rates hold constant, the tailwind on revenue in the third quarter should be similar to the second and the full year benefit could be roughly a $150 million. On the bottom-line, we'd expect a $0.04 headwind per quarter for the remainder of the year. As I wrap up, while the pandemic could impact our outlook, our ability to continue to invest in our pipeline, develop our markets and execute on product launches will allow us to outpace our markets. I'm proud of the hard work from our employees this year and I'm excited about the impact we are having on millions of patient\u2019s lives around the world. With our competitive spirit, and focus on being bold, we will be at the forefront of the recovery. Back to you, Geoff. Geoffrey Martha : Okay, thank you, Karen. Now to wrap up, I hope you're seeing the strong execution that our organization is delivering. I want to take a moment to thank our employees across the globe for the great performance they have collectively produced this quarter. To sum up the second quarter, we're improving our growth, advancing our pipeline and winning share and we're doing all of this while operating in the midst of a global pandemic, and while we make bold and comprehensive changes to our operating model. And one last note regarding our operating model, we're making solid progress on decentralizing and de-layering our businesses. We're empowering our 20 operating units, gaining greater visibility into our end markets, upping our competitive game and holding our business leaders more accountable. We're leveraging the strengths of our enterprise by centralizing manufacturing and certain core technology development. We've increased our focus on allocating capital to our best opportunities and we're supplementing this with an increased cadence of tuck-in acquisitions. And we're enhancing the culture of this company by increasing our competitiveness and being bold, adding these on top of all the great attributes of our mission driven culture. We expect this to lead to more innovation, accelerate our growth, and unlock a lot of value for our shareholders. So with that, let's now move to Q&A. Operator : It\u2019s now time for the Medtronic earnings call Q&A session, where Medtronic executives will answer live questions from the sell-side analysts covering the company. [Operator Instructions] Please also be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff Martha and Karen Parkhill are joined by Mike Coyle, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio; Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio; Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience Portfolio; and Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Diabetes Operating Unit. I'll now turn it over to the moderator, Ryan Weispfenning. Please go ahead. Ryan Weispfenning : Great, thank you. Let's first go to the line of Bob Hopkins from BoA Securities. Bob? Bob Hopkins : Great, thank you very much and good morning, everybody. So the first question I'd love you guys to comment on is some of the geographic results you showed in the quarter, because I found the breakdown really interesting. Specifically, I'd love to hear your thoughts on, it looks like Europe was up in the quarter, China was down in the quarter, maybe comment on some of the trends that are driving those results in Europe and China? And specifically on the China tender, was that worse than you thought in terms of the final outcome there? And was that tender contemplated when you gave the long-term guidance that you provided at the Analyst Day? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Yes, thank you, Bob, for that question. We were pleased with the geographic results that we saw. You are right, Europe was up and certain parts of Asia were up. China was down, but that was really due to the national tender. Absent the impact of the national tender, China would have been in strong growth territory. And on the tender, it was really close to what we expected. We \u2013 it was hard to predict, but we were pleased to be one of the five finalists in the tender. So we expect to be gaining share or gaining share and volume as a result of that. Geoffrey Martha : Yes, just Bob on the tender, I say, I think it is in the -- over the next couple of quarters, it's going to be a headwind, because we're going to have a lot of volume increase here matter of fact that, but it's going to be offset by the price decrease. And so, but we view it as strategic over time, because this is going to be one of the tip of the spear, if you will, for more aggressively taking our commercial organization into the lower tier cities, the rural cities in China, tier two, tier three and it will also help us pull through other products around coronary today plus in the future with TAVR and renal denervation. So, not happy about the short-term impact. I think long-term, this is, like I said, a strategic and we'll see the volume, the Chinese Government has been reaching out to us and working with us to make sure we're prepared, because they're expecting us to have a pretty dramatic increase in volume here. So we'll see how this plays out, but we do think that over the next couple of quarters it's more of a headwind than a tailwind. Bob Hopkins : Okay. And then just really quickly for Karen, your comments on current trends, I appreciated those. I just wanted to be clear. So are you saying that what you're seeing so far this quarter is not worse than what you saw in October in terms of year-over-year growth? Karen Parkhill : That's correct, Bob. What we've seen in the first couple of weeks in November is higher than what we saw in the similar weeks in the second quarter. That said, the first few weeks of a quarter don't necessarily make a trend. So we'll be closely watching any impact from the COVID surge. I would say that if these trends continue, and there's only a limited impact from the COVID surge, we do expect or our revenue could be flat to slightly up in the third quarter. Bob Hopkins : Thank you very much. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thank you, Bob. Let's next go to the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David, please go ahead. David Lewis : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones from me. I'll start with Karen. So Karen, the revenue numbers in the quarter and the forward momentum is very impressive. Did the drop through on margins, Karen, in the second quarter was actually weaker than the first quarter? So let me just talk about where are those investments going? How should we think about drop-through into the back half of the year? And where are we on the cost plan? And then I have a quick follow-up. Karen Parkhill : Yes, thanks for that question, David. Clearly, we have been focused on investing for the long-term through this pandemic. And as a result, our margins are a little bit more depressed than normal. We have said that we expect to be back to more normal margins in the fourth quarter all along and we continue to expect that. In terms of the drop-through of the additional revenue, we did have some period expensing on the manufacturing front as well, similar to last quarter. We expect that to not be a headwind next quarter. And we continue to invest below the gross margin line and particularly as we're focused on, driving the right commercial launches of some of our new products. And so, we're focused on investing appropriately, and ultimately getting our margins back to normal by the fiscal fourth quarter. David Lewis : Okay, very helpful. And then, Geoff, maybe for you. I mean, there's been $1.6 billion of balance sheet deployment over the relatively near-term, over the next six to 12 months, should we expect a similar cadence of deals? Should we expect sort of higher or lower? And then if Karen, if there's any sort of quantification across that $1.6 billion in terms of what the revenue impact could be here over the next six months or so that'd be super helpful? Thanks so much. Geoffrey Martha : Yes, David, on the M&A, it's obviously it's hard to predict, right? I mean, but, I would suspect a similar cadence of these tuck-in types of deals. Again, it is hard to predict, but it is, like I said, part of our strategy, it's something that we're looking to do to augment our R&D. Karen Parkhill : Yes. And David, in terms of the revenue contribution, much of what we bought this year are really early stage tuck-ins and it goes along the lines of grow, what we buy don't buy growth. So these acquisitions are really expected to be larger contributors to revenue in the years ahead. The combined expected revenue contribution for the rest of this fiscal year is small. And we'll obviously evaluate whenever revenue from an acquisition becomes meaningful to a business, we will certainly adjust it from our organic results until we anniversary that. So, the one that we may end up adjusting for starting in next quarter is Companion Medical, because it could be impactful to the diabetes business alone, but certainly not to the total company. David Lewis : Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, David. Let's next go to the line of Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Robbie. Robert Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. I was looking at diabetes, which to me is one of the businesses that could have the most upside potential if your turnaround plan works out. I was hoping you could walk us through maybe the next six to 12 months in terms of new product cadence, how that should impact numbers? And also, I know you've been deferring pump sales for a long time waiting for 780G and the upgrade program. How do we expect that to play out into numbers over the next 12 to 18 months when 780G hits the U.S.? Geoffrey Martha : Sure, Robbie, I will turn that one over to Sean with one edit, not if it happens, but when the turnaround happens, so Sean will talk to that. Sean Salmon : Okay, great. Thanks for the question, Robbie. So over the next six to 12 months, really the focus is going to be on rolling out the new pump platforms. We're off to a really, really good start for the European launch of the 780G. So we're in, I think, now 12 countries. We will continue to roll those out. As time goes on here, the 770G as just said just started its initial launch in the U.S. and we've had really strong demand for that, as we've got a number of these upgrade pathways in place. So the pathway upgrade from existing 670G as well as the next tech pathway to get people to come into the new pumps. We've seen an increase in the proportion of patients as new starts in the U.S. as compared to just replacements of in-warranty patients coming out of the warranty and, of course, Companion Medical is going to be a big focus. We've got now the integration with our CGM in real-time, which is a big deal. As we improve the sensor experience, that's going to get to be even more of a big deal. But more importantly, we've now trained up and have the entire sales force with this in their bag now in the U.S., as opposed to just the small sales force that came with Companion acquisition. So I think the near term, those are the priorities, but we will look forward into what's next, obviously, the 780G launch for the U.S. is a big deal. The Zeus sensor globally would be a really important driver for us, and then a smaller product, but an important one. We just started a limited launch in Finland, it's for a seven-day infusion sets, this allows you to wear this infusion set for almost twice as long as what is normally required. And that product we raised in the U.S. we just locked the database on that. So we should expect that to be a part of the mix going forward. Of course, all of this flows. So you have hardware out there, it's upgradable by software to 780 and beyond. You've got the compatibility designed in for the sensor pipeline as well as extended wear infusion sets. So I think we're setting up for a really nice cadence of products that will traverse into growth. Robert Marcus : And maybe just a quick follow-up Karen, there's a lot of nuance as we look at fiscal '22, which is where I think a lot of the Street is focused in terms of valuation. So anything you could sit here today, I know it's impossible to call the recovery trends, one vaccine set, but anything that you see in models that stand out that you want to point people to as they think about modeling into fiscal '22, whether it's on the top line or whether the expense cadence? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Yes, thanks for that question, Robbie. It's early. Obviously, we're still five months away from starting our fiscal '22 and we're really working on our plans right now. Plus, the pandemic makes it a little more difficult to forecast. So I would say, we'll wait to give more color or guidance on FY '22, likely as we normally do on our fourth quarter earnings call, but clearly, you can expect that our growth should be higher than normal next fiscal year off of the depressed space and because we continue to launch our pipeline of products. Robert Marcus : Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Robbie. Let's next go to the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys, can you hear me? Ryan Weispfenning : We can. Vijay Kumar : Okay, excellent. So I guess, I had two quick questions, one financial and one on I guess on diabetes. On I guess the financial part, when we're looking at this year-on-year organic growth, could you perhaps quantify what the impact from the move to consignment sales, the move, the shift away from bulk order was in the quarter because it looks like ex-dose impacts, perhaps organic year-on-year was in the low singles territory, positive territory. I just want to make sure my math is correct. And I think I heard you say Karen, Q-on-Q you expect margins to be up a couple of hundred basis points. I mean, if revenues are almost flat to up in 3Q, perhaps talk about any margin headwinds for 3Q? Karen Parkhill : Sure Vijay. Let me start with the conversation on bulks. We mentioned last quarter that the vast majority of the booking impact was behind us, but there are still pockets in certain businesses where we continue to look at odd year-over-year comparisons because of bulks. I would say biologics and spine is one of those areas, TAVR is another, but if you look at the total company, the impact from bulks is largely behind us. In terms of the quarter-over-quarter margins, we said that we expect both gross and operating margins to be up a couple of points sequentially from the second quarter, and so if you look at the Street models particularly on gross margin, it could be a little higher than what than what the Street currently has. Is that answering your question? Vijay Kumar : Yes, it did. I guess, on -- because I guess I was confused on the TAVR commentary on share, kind of market share being stable sequentially and if I look at your closest peer they were up mid singles new guys from minus air charges, I just want to make sure how you get to the sequential stable share on that? Geoffrey Martha : Yes, I know Vijay, I know and I understand it's a little difficult to track. Well, why don't we have Mike Coyle, walk us through that math there? Michael Coyle : Thanks for the question, Vijay. So we would estimate that the overall TAVR market for the quarter was on a constant currency basis up around 2% and as you just noted, our reported numbers on a revenue basis, year-over-year are down about six. But when you basically consider the U.S. market dynamic of the de-loading activity that we, that's been taking place where essentially we have shifted away from doing bulk purchasing and have actually moved customers on to consignment who essentially want to hold inventories. If you look year-over-year, our hospital held inventories of TAVR product are probably down around $25 million. So that basically, when you correct for that, in terms of just the year-over-year comparisons were essentially flat in terms of our global, sort of TAVR market. So that's the difference between sort of the year-over-year versus the quarterly comparisons. As we look in the quarter, sequentially from last quarter, we essentially held market share in the United States, on a year-over-year basis our case volumes were essentially flat with the prior year, which was a marked improvement over what we saw during Q1. And so, as we look forward, we're very confident about our ability to take share for a number of reasons. Obviously, the most important of those being the recent announcements from Boston Scientific here late in the quarter, their decision to essentially remove Lotus from the marketplace. And in addition from the TCT meeting the Scope2 data that basically had the accurate Neo [ph] product failing its non-inferiority endpoint going to head-to-head trial versus [indiscernible]. So that gives us really, I think, an opportunity to take share that they have had where we have been disproportionately hit year over, over prior quarters. And of course, just going forward, the hemodynamic benefits of the product really are encouraging in terms of how the customers are receiving that. We had another great TCT meeting here in terms of new data flow supporting the benefits of hemodynamics from lower pacemaker rates, the TAVI data was very encouraging in terms of direct comparisons of balloon, expandable self expanding valves. And, we continue to roll out our custom overlap technique for lower pacemaker rates. So all of that we think is going to be very helpful for us to continue to take sequential share. Now, the third quarter a year ago, we saw a pretty big dip in share that we've been sort of clawing back and so you're going to see it in the overall year-over-year numbers once we have anniversary that Q3 event and of course, as we get into Q4 we have normalized prior year comparisons for the hospital inventory adjustments that I just talked about. So by the time we get to Q4, we think it will look very similar whether looking quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year in terms of share dynamics. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful. Mike and Geoff, one quick one for you on diabetes. I think, you spoke about share gains, are you seeing anything on one, you look at the 3Q guidance, download signals and implies some improvement or 2Q what's driving that? And are you seeing anything on the pump market side? We're hearing some chatter about, customers delaying pump upgrades, waiting for the tide pool algorithm to come -- waiting for the tide pool algorithm, so perhaps talk about the diabetes pump market? Thank you. Geoffrey Martha : Sure Vijay, I\u2019ll have Sean, why don\u2019t you jump in on that one? Sean Salmon : Yes, so Vijay, I think that there's a point of smaller proportion of the market that is waiting for the tide pool to become available. So I think the capabilities of that algorithm are really not anything advantaged over what that we have in the pipeline is certainly what's available currently in the market. So I think the idea that this rather is pump, and you can kind of pick your components is appealing to some and to others, quite frankly, having to chase two or three companies around in order to kind of get your questions answered, track down what your challenges may be, is just not the kind of experience a lot of people are looking for. They kind of want a one stop shop where they can get everything they need and all their questions answered in a single place and that's, of course, the advantage that will accrue to us as we get our pipeline of products out there. So I'd say it's really much, it is more of a niche opportunity and really not a big focus. I don't see a lot of people waiting for it. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Vijay. Let\u2019s next go to the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Larry. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me, Ryan? Ryan Weispfenning : We can. Yes, thanks. Larry Biegelsen : Great. All right, great. One for Karen and one for Geoff. So Karen, you talked about operating margins returning to normalized levels in Q4. How do you define that? Is that the 30% we saw in fiscal Q3, 2019 or should we be thinking about 29% for fiscal the full year fiscal 2019 and any comments on consensus EPS for Q3 and Q4 based on the commentary you've given on this call? And I have one follow-up for Geoff. Karen Parkhill : Great, thanks, Larry, for the questions. In terms of normal operating margins in Q4, we're thinking about that pre-COVID for the full year, so roughly around the 29% level. And then in terms of consensus, we clearly talked about revenue in the third quarter if trends continue and there's limited impact to COVID being around the flat to slightly up, which is higher than where consensus currently is and that would flow through down to margins as we've discussed approximately 200 bps sequentially higher from the second quarter and so flow through to the bottom-line. So that's what I would say on the Q3 consensus and Q4 because we've said all along that we expect to be back to more normal growth on a two-year stack basis and more normal margins consensus is roughly right there already. Larry Biegelsen : Perfect, thanks, Karen. And Geoff, on China, I heard your comments on the drug-eluting stent tender and the pricing there. China is an important market for you roughly 5% of revenues I believe. How concerned are you that, what happened with drug-eluting stents could spill over to other areas of your business? How contained do you feel that is? Thanks for taking the questions. Geoffrey Martha : Thanks, Larry, for that one. Yes, China is a strategic market for us and we are watching this tender process closely. Anyway, sorry, here there is a beep on the line here and hopefully that will stop here, hopefully. Anyway, in terms of China, we do think it's more contained for us at least for a couple of reasons. One, the coronary stent business is one of the few businesses at Medtronic that does have less differentiation, I would say in the industry. The industry itself, the products aren't as differentiated as we see in some of our other segments. And the other dynamic that there was unique here is that 80% of the drug-eluting stent market in China was already local, so they had alternatives there. And those two dynamics, the differentiation, the lower differentiation, and a robust local market, that doesn't exist in most of the segments that we compete in, in China. So we do think it is we don't have a lot of exposure to that type of impact from a tender going forward. And matter of fact, this is where our diversification helps us. We've got a lot of growth levers in China and I do believe it is, still remains a bigger, a big growth opportunity despite some of these tender headwinds. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks, Geoff. Geoffrey Martha : Thank you, Larry. Ryan Weispfenning : Let's next go to the line of Matt Taylor at UBS. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Taylor : Thanks, Ryan, can you hear me okay? Ryan Weispfenning : We can. Matthew Taylor : Perfect. Okay, so I just wanted to ask a question about progression of utilization. We've seen some stronger recovery here than a lot of us might have expected with the current conditions. We've had a lot of good news around vaccines lately. And I'm just wondering conceptually, as we go through next year, can you talk about how you expect that to impact recovery and could we see a bolus or elevated demand after the vaccines take hold or do you think that we've kind of lost some of these patients in the shuffle and that you won't see that kind of a resurgence? Geoffrey Martha : Thanks for the question, Matt. On that one, right now, like we do believe to the extent that there is pressure from the second wave or this spike, if you will, it is limited, as Karen said, both in depth and time. Like I mentioned, pre-vaccine hospital CEOs, we talk to them all the time, dozens a week and their narrative has remained the same in that they've learned a lot of lessons and how to safely continuous elective cases despite COVID-19 and they have been able to treat COVID patients more efficiently and they believe that even in this spike, that they'll be able to continue elective cases. We are seeing some pressure in some areas, but like I said before and then Karen mentioned earlier, we do believe that's limited. Now, in terms of your question, once we get through once the vaccine is out there, and it's like pretty much an all clear signal for patients that are considered that may have been holding back, I haven't heard anybody talking about like a bolus of patients. I think we have worked through by and large, there is a little bit of a backlog out there still, but we have worked through a lot and in our more elective areas, if you will, but by and large we've worked through a lot of that, and that backlog is relatively small. And we're starting to get back to more of a kind of steady-state run rate here. And so, given all that, I wouldn't expect a big bolus. But, we could be surprised that this is, I wish there were a little more science around some of the numbers there, but we are trying to quantify as much as the feedback we're getting, but I haven't heard anything about a bolus of patients waiting out there for the next year. Matthew Taylor : Okay, thanks for the thoughts Geoff. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Matt. Let's next go to the line of Rick Wise of Stifel Nicolaus. Rick, please go ahead. Rick Wise : Good morning, Ryan. Good morning, everybody. I'll just ask one question, Geoff, you were very clear at the Analyst Day about your focus on accountability, execution, innovation, the potential for improved growth and margins, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. It is, I guess, just two aspects of that as my question is, should we attribute, how much the excellent quarterly performance we're just looking is tied to your initiatives, your energy that you're bringing, your new vision you're bringing to Medtronic? And second, maybe just at a high level, just talk to us about the progress you've made, where you feel like you are and how we should think about the master plan going forward? Thanks so much. Geoffrey Martha : Thanks for the question, Rick. And it would be nice to say that the master plan had that big of an impact so quickly, but I think in reality, it is the product launches, that's what's really driving the near term results, like I said, the product portfolio, and the pipeline rather, is the best we've ever had. And we've got products launching now, which we listed a lot of those and then we've got products, over the next 18 to 24 months. And the disruptive nature of those products in the next 18 to 24 months, in and of itself has created a lot of energy across the company as people can feel the near term impact of these products and things like, we mentioned in the commentary here our ablation business or cryoablation business being with this new England Journal of Medicine data being now a frontline therapy for AFib and taking that information and that opportunity and making the most of it. That type of approach is getting people excited. So I think right now, it's really about the product launches. Over time, though, I think the changes that we made, the decentralization, the unnesting of these operating units, these 20 operating units, and pushing them to be bold, to think big, be bold, and maximize their opportunity and you know what, don't be afraid to fail or I mean, we don't want to fail, but if we're too conservative, we're not going to take advantage of these massive opportunities in front of us like RD and like renal denervation, like soft tissue robot, like the example I just gave for our ablation business. AFib is a massive under diagnosed problem here and we've got all kinds of therapies for this. So that is creating an energy across the company that I anticipate over time will translate into, I'd say above market growth and really expand the number of patients that we're serving. And I'll end on this, we talk about, we touch or impact the lives of two patients every second and that's a pretty amazing statistic. But when you do the math, it's like 80 million people a year. Well, there's over 7.5 billion people in the world and so I'd like to kind of reframe that question is like, why are we doing so few, given the technology that we have, and really expand that patient base? And that kind of approach is creating a lot of new thinking and energy that I think over time will take hold here, because we've got big plans here. And but what you're seeing now is good, but I think we can do better over time. Rick Wise : Thank you, Geoff. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Rick. Let's next go to the line of Matt Miksic of Credit Suisse. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Miksic : Hi, thanks. Can you hear me all right? Ryan Weispfenning : Yes. Matt Miksic : Terrific. So, it's just a follow up on some of the current trends commentary that you've given, we're all watching hospitalizations, and they have increased and I'd say it sounds like your commentary was perhaps a little bit more optimistic and constructive, despite the surge than some folks were expecting, which is great. And then the numbers were terrific here in the second quarter, but maybe if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about hospitalization trends in these conversations you're having and maybe when, and if, at what level they do become a little bit of a concern? And then I have one follow-up. Geoffrey Martha : I think basically, Matt, what we're hearing is that, two things and it's and most of our feedback, I'd say 75% of it is coming from the U.S. hospitals, and then the rest from Europe, I'd say. But in the United States, in particular, the two things that would have to happen, again given everything we said about the lessons learned and the commitment to hospitals, the commitment to keep elective cases going. The two things that could derail them is literally they run out of space, from so many COVID patients, and it becomes like a real estate issue within the hospital, that would impact obviously elective cases. They would be deprioritized there. And in some cases, we're seeing that we're getting closer to that level of capacity. So that's what we're watching. And the second would be some sort of statewide mandate that could happen, it's in today's political climate, I think it'd be foolish to try to predict anything. But, some sort of statewide mandate could happen as well. So those are the two things and I think the hospital CEOs and executives are more worried about the first thing. And some of the larger systems have the luxury that are more regional of moving patients around, both COVID patients and elective patients, you can move elective procedures from one hospital to the next in some of these larger systems. So that's -- they're really doing their best to manage those two things. But that's why we're, I guess, cautiously optimistic that the impact of this second wave will be limited, that and with the optimism of the vaccine news is another driver here. Matt Miksic : That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then, just to follow up on your comment on the New England Journal, article and presentation at AHA, the first line therapy for paroxysmal, can you talk about maybe how you expect that how investors should expect that to sort of show up in the numbers, is there penetration pathway here that we can expect to hear more about over the next year or so? Geoffrey Martha : I'll maybe have Mike provide a little more details on that data? Michael Coyle : Sure, Matt, currently, because no ablation therapy is approved for first line therapy, a patient has to fail a series of anti-arrhythmic drugs before they become eligible, and we'd estimate that's about a two-year, period of time that physicians will essentially titrate any rhythmic medications and basically, the data that was shown in the New England Journal said less than half the patients who actually go down that path will wind up being symptom free. So essentially, you're taking a large portion of the entire diagnosed portions of the patients with symptomatic atrial tibrillation, and you're delaying them two years from coming in, and losing a lot of them to follow up there. And, of course, 45% of them will just stay on the medications. By basically showing that cryoablation will have 75% of those patients symptom free in a year if we can push that into first line, we not only accelerate the curve, but obviously a lot of patients who wound up on anti-arrhythmic will then essentially not require them because they become symptom free with ablation. So, there's obviously a lot of education that has to take place at the referral channel level. We think these data will be very compelling to be able to have that take place. Obviously, we need FDA approval of the labeling indication which, as Geoff mentioned, we would expect to be in our next fiscal year, but we're very excited about being able to outreach to that referral community with a much better solution for the patients. Matt Miksic : Thanks so much Michael. Geoffrey Martha : Yes, this is like a trend that we're starting to see where our kind of definition of market development is expanding to not just to the specialist physicians around the world that we're used to dealing with, but to more the general practitioners and in this case, even and just general cardiologists, and to the patients themselves. And so this is a muscle that this kind of hybrid b2c b2b, b2c, this kind of go-to-market, this muscle of market development we need to develop, because there's other areas across the company that we're seeing this. Obviously, diabetes is more in this camp. And this is something that Medtronic, even a lot of Medtech historically haven't done, but I do think it's a muscle we need to develop here. Matt Miksic : That\u2019s great, thanks. Geoffrey Martha : Thanks, Matt. Ryan Weispfenning : Let's next go to the line of Chris Pasquale at Guggenheim. Chris, please go ahead. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. One quick one on diabetes and then one on CVG for diabetes, Sean could just clarify the expected timing of the 780G U.S. launch is there may still be some uncertainty about how you go about the filing strategy there? Sean Salmon : Yes, sure. So the situation we have, I think, as you probably already know is that the FDA's division that regulates the diabetes sector is also involved in a lot of the COVID diagnostics work. So it's really been a resource drain on their part for medical reviewers in particular. So at their request, we're pulling together a lot of parts to that submission, including the pediatric data and not separating that out from just the adult data, so one submission for all patients, as well as the integration of the Zeus sensor into that package. So that's the summary of the package, how we can consolidate down to fewer component parts that need to be reviewed, which will add efficiency for them and the time to market for us for the entire package. Chris Pasquale : Okay, but in terms of when we should expect to have 780G available for U.S. patients, any sense for when that will be? Sean Salmon : That's hard to predict the review cycle time that we're intending to submit that in this quarter. Chris Pasquale : Okay, that's helpful, thank you. And then just quickly on the Chinese tender, the impact there in the back half of the year, you characterized the $26 million this quarter as reserve, which to me implies a pulling forward of the headwind, but then you also talked about it continuing to be an issue on a go forward basis. So how much of the sort of annual impact of that was recognized this quarter versus still to come? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Yes, thanks for that question, Chris. The reserve impact from the China tender is really because we've got product in the dealer channel, and we needed to compensate for the price that will be impacted in the dealer channel as soon as the tender is effective, so that's what's going on there. In terms of go forward, obviously, the price go forward is 95% lower and so that will continue to impact us, but it was a bit of a larger impact now, since we had to do the reserve as well as the shorter impact for the quarter. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Chris. Let's take one more question and go to the line of Kaila Krum at Truist. Kaila, please go ahead. Kaila? Kaila Krum : Can you guys hear me okay? Ryan Weispfenning : I can, yes. Please go ahead. Kaila Krum : Yes, perfect. Thanks, Ryan and thanks guys for taking our questions. So you guys had mentioned that you're talking to dozens of hospital CEOs every week. So I'm just curious what you're hearing in terms of their appetite for capital spending, and particularly as they are budgeting for calendar 2021? So any additional color there you can add would be helpful, thank you. Geoffrey Martha : Yes, so capital, it is obviously the capital budgets in hospitals are pressured, but we're finding two things that are helping us out. One is that our capital tends to be, is tied to, for them profitable elective procedures like in spine and so that helps a lot. And the other thing is providing flexible financing options is the second one. So although there is some pressure on just general capital, when that capital is supporting an elective procedure that is profitable and critical to the hospital's financial recovery, that's really helping and so they're continuing to have these conversations with us, and they're continuing to buy capital and I think, talking to our spine division the other day, they anticipate, the Mazor sales to get back to normal levels here, so which is evidence of what I just said. And the second thing that's helping is, we're worked with a number of financing companies to provide various different financial or flexible financial solutions for the hospitals. So those two things have really helped us. And although that it's, there is some pressure, it's not like maybe you might see with general imaging or something like that. Kaila Krum : Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Kaila. I'll ask Geoff to conclude with his remarks, Geoff? Geoffrey Martha : Okay, and thanks everybody for the questions and the great engagement and we really appreciate your support and the continued interest in our company. We will, we hope that you'll join us for our Q3 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on February 23, where we'll update you on our continued quarterly progress. So thanks for tuning in today stay healthy and safe. And for those in the U.S., I'd like to wish you and your families a very Happy Thanksgiving and have a great day, everybody.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fiscal year 2021 third quarter earnings video webcast. I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations.  Before we start the prepared remarks, I'm going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today' s webcast : Joining me today are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 29, 2021. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the sell side analysts that cover the company, and today's event should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summary. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance, as well as changes to our future revenue reporting structure, given our new operating model, which will go into effect next quarter.  This presentation can be accessed from our earnings press release or on our website at InvestorRelations.Medtronic.com.  During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and are given on an organic basis, which adjusts for foreign currency. There were no acquisitions made in the last year that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential improvement compare to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and are made on an as reported basis. All references to share gains or losses are on a revenue and calendar quarter basis, unless otherwise stated.  Finally, reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at InvestorRelations.Medtronic.com. With that, let's get started. Geoffrey Martha : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today. The Q3 results that we reported this morning reflect that our business is well on its way to returning to growth with a sequential improvement in both revenue and earnings. This happened despite the impact of the COVID resurgence on procedure volumes in late December and January.  We're also outperforming our markets, as our new products are driving share gains in an increasing number of our businesses. In fact, we outperformed the market even if you exclude our strong ventilator sales. And when you consider that we're going up against a number of our competitors' year-end pushes, and our results include the month of January when COVID was having an increased impact on procedure volumes, our performance is even more impressive.  We're also seeing signs that our hospital customers are preparing for a robust recovery. For example, purchases of our capital equipment this past quarter have been notably strong. The use of our capital equipment such as energy consoles, robotics, and navigation systems is tied directly to procedures, so it's telling that hospitals are prioritizing spending on this type of equipment. Now as we head into our fourth quarter, we're bullish on the recovery and our ability to return to growth and outpace our competitors. We feel that the momentum we have is going to build over the coming quarters, driven not just by the COVID recovery, but by the strong new product flow that we expect to bring to the market. And we're supplementing this pipeline with an increasing cadence of tuck-in M&A. We've also implemented our new operating model and we're enhancing our culture, with a sharpened competitive focus.  Through the actions we've taken over the past year, we are emerging from this pandemic as a stronger Medtronic, and I'm confident that we're well positioned for both the short- and the long-term. Now as we've done on the past couple of earnings calls, I'm going to lead off with a discussion of market share, which has become an important focus across the company. I acknowledge that the COVID impact on procedures, along with the timing of our quarter, does mask some of the underlying market dynamics. But I hope that you're now seeing a strong trend of share gains for Medtronic.  And there are multiple drivers for our improved market performance. Our prolific pipeline is key, but also the transformation of our operating model and culture is beginning to drive results. And the changes we've made during the pandemic, moving from simply serving as a supplier to our customers to becoming a true partner, has driven stronger customer relationships and improved business performance.  Our consistent and sustained flow of new products is our engine for growth. In the past quarter alone, we've received an additional 46 product approvals, bringing our total to over 220 regulatory approvals in the US, Europe, Japan, and China since January of 2020.  Let's start with the businesses where we are gaining share in our Cardiac and Vascular Group. We continue to outperform our competitors in Cardiac Rhythm. We gained another point of share this past quarter on the strength of our Micra family of leadless pacemakers and our Cobalt and Crome high power devices. Micra continues to perform extremely well, with 64% growth globally, including 76% growth in the US.  In Coronary, while we're dealing with the financial impact of the China drug-eluting stent national tender, we're still winning share globally. We estimate that our DES unit share is up 3 points year-over-year and 2 points sequentially, led by strong share gains in the US on our one-month, dual-antiplatelet therapy labeling, and expanded indication for high bleeding risk patients.  And in China, we believe that being one of the winners of the DES national tender strategically positions us to maintain our leadership in the China cardiovascular market. Not only do we expect to pull through other products, but we expect to leverage our scale and reach to drive the successful future rollouts of our TAVR and RDN products.  In drug-coated balloons, we're growing well above the market despite increased competition. We gained a couple points of share on the strength of our market-leading IN.PACT family. In fact, we're seeing continued strong adoption of our DCB for AV fistula maintenance for dialysis patients, driven by the publication of our data in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Next, turning to our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, our Surgical Innovations business had a good quarter against our primary competitor, J&J. We gained nearly 1 point of share year-over-year, driven by our energy and endostapling product lines.  Our Respiratory Interventions business had a great quarter, growing over 75%, and this was driven by the importance of our airway and ventilator products in treating COVID patients. And as expected, our ventilator sales were down sequentially, but nearly tripled year-over-year, and our PB980 gained share in the high-acuity ventilator market. We also gained share in Airways, driven by our impressive growth of over 60% in video laryngoscopes. Looking ahead, our ventilator revenue should normalize as pandemic-related demand decreases, and we anticipate year-over-year headwinds starting next quarter. Our Patient Monitoring business also had a strong, double-digit growth quarter. Our Nellcor pulse oximetry product lines grew double digits as we won share sequentially from Masimo.  In Gastrointestinal, we had some modest share gains, driven in part by our partnership with the NHS in England. The NHS is using our PillCam Colon to help reduce large patient backlogs for colorectal screenings.  And our Renal Care business grew in the high-single digits, with share gains in Renal Access. In our Restorative Therapies Group, we're seeing share gains across several businesses. In Cranial and Spinal Technologies, while share was stable year-over-year, we do believe we're up sequentially. We had a strong quarter in large capital equipment sales with a record number of Mazor robotic system unit sales and near records for our O-arm imaging and StealthStation navigation systems. And with Mazor, we estimate that we continue to meaningfully outsell our nearest competitor, Globus, in the spine robotics space.  In Neuromodulation, our recent product rollouts are leading to share gains in both brain modulation and pain stim. In brain modulation, our Percept PC launch has led to nearly a point of share gains year-over-year, and several points of share gain sequentially, from Boston Scientific and Abbott. Now given our technology differentiation, we expect DBS share gains to be a multi-year trend.  In pain stim, we're gaining strong momentum from our DTM launch with nearly a point of share gain year-over-year, which is even more impressive when you consider that this business is facing a replacement headwind. Our DTM trials surged this quarter after the release of our 12-month data in late October, and overall, our trials are up 10% year-over- year, which is a really good leading indicator for the health of our pain stim business.  In pelvic health, not only has the market growth accelerated over the past couple of quarters, but we continue to win share back from Axonics based on the differentiation of our InterStim Micro device. Since last quarter, we gained another point of share in Europe and 3 points of share in the US. We've now taken back 9 points of share from Axonics over the past two quarters. And when you look specifically at the US rechargeable market, we gained back 14 points of share sequentially this quarter. So, there are a number of businesses where we are gaining or holding share, but there are still some businesses where we've got some work to do. In our cardiac ablation solutions business, we believe we lost about a point of share year- over-year and sequentially, primarily to J&J's broad EP product portfolio. Now we expect this share performance to turn around in the quarters ahead due in part to our DiamondTemp cardiac ablation system, which just received FDA approval.  In cardiac diagnostics, customer response to our LINQ II system has been outstanding, given our remote programming capabilities, enhanced feature set, and 4.5-year longevity. That said, we estimate we lost a few points of share sequentially to Boston Scientific, as they enter this market. We continue now to ramp our unique wafer scale manufacturing for LINQ II, but expect to be supply constrained for the next few quarters. However, we are confident in the competitive differentiation of our LINQ II device. And we expect to maintain our strong leadership position in this market that we created and have innovated for the last 20 years.  In neurovascular, while we held share year-over-year with strong growth in aspirations and coils, we lost a bit of share sequentially. And this was primarily in flow diverters, as new entrants, specifically Terumo and Stryker pick up some share. We have a series of new product launches coming in neuro later this calendar year, so I'm confident that after the initial impact of competition in flow diverters, that we'll get back to taking share.  In Diabetes, we are making considerable progress in our turnaround efforts, and we actually returned to growth this quarter. While we're still not growing with the market, we're gaining momentum with the successful launches of our 770G system in the US, and the 780G, which is now available in 26 countries across four continents. Now as a result of all this, we estimate we picked up several points of durable insulin pump share sequentially. Next, let's turn to our product pipeline. We're at the front end of a number of a large opportunities to win share and create and disrupt big markets, all aimed squarely at accelerating our growth. A number of these catalysts are on deck this calendar year, and the long-term pipeline also remains full. Starting with CVG, we're expecting to present our ON MED renal denervation pivotal trial results later this calendar year, likely at the TCT conference in October. This could be one of the most important events in med-tech this year, given the multi-billion dollar addressable market in hypertension.  Now depending on the results of our ON MED trial, we're planning to submit for FDA approval later this calendar year, and we've already been granted breakthrough device designation.  In our cardiac ablation solutions business, we are expecting a first line therapy indication for our ArcticFront cryoballoon in the first half of this calendar year. We also continue to make good progress on bringing our disruptive pulsed field ablation system to market. In Structural Heart, we expect to rollout our next-generation Evolut FX TAVR valve later this calendar year, with its enhanced deliverability and ease-of-use. We continue to enroll the pivotal trial for our Intrepid transcatheter mitral valve as well. And we're pleased to see that Half Moon Medical, which is our partnership with The Foundry, completed the first-in-human procedure of its differentiated transcatheter mitral repair technology. This unique device has the potential to be very disruptive to current mitral clip technology.  In MITG, we're really excited as we're nearing some very important milestones for our Hugo soft-tissue robot system. We remain on track to submit for CE Mark and to file for US IDE approval next month.  In RTG, we're investing heavily in growth opportunities. In neurosurgery, we're expanding the capabilities of our Mazor spine robotic system. In pain stim, we're expecting to launch our recharge free device later this calendar year. This is a big opportunity for Medtronic to dramatically increase our share in the recharge free category of pain stim. We also expect to submit our ECAPS device to the FDA later this calendar year. ECAPS could be a very disruptive technology in pain stim and we intend to bring it to market combined with all the advantages of our DTM therapy and our Intellis device platform.  In brain modulation, we expect to launch our SenSight directional lead later this calendar year, which will close a key competitive gap. In fact, when you combine SenSight with our Percept PC device, our deep brain stimulation system will be far ahead of the competition.  And we're not stopping there. We're now enrolling our ADAPT-PD pivotal trial, which is studying our closed loop, adaptive technology that will further extend our leadership position in DBS.  In neurovascular, in addition to the flow diverter launches I mentioned earlier, we have five additional products that we plan to launch this calendar year. Now we haven't disclosed the details of these launches for competitive reasons, but we're excited about the innovation that we're bringing into the stroke market.  In Diabetes, we have now submitted the adult and the pediatric 780G insulin pump and Zeus sensor to the FDA to provide them with an efficient means to simultaneously review our multiple submissions. Approval timing, well that's going to be dependent on the FDA's bandwidth, as the branch of the FDA responsible for Diabetes product reviews has focused their resources on COVID diagnostic submissions. Regarding our Synergy sensor, which is disposable, easier to apply, and half the size of our current sensor, we've completed our pivotal trial and intend to submit it to the FDA once we complete our manufacturing module this summer.  I'll now have Karen take you through a discussion of our third quarter financials and our outlook. And then I'm going to come back with some concluding remarks before we go to Q&A.  Karen, over to you. Karen Parkhill : Thank you. Our third quarter revenue declined 1% organic and adjusted EPS declined 10%. As Geoff mentioned, we're well on our way to returning to growth, as sequentially our revenue increased 2% and adjusted EPS grew by 26% on the strength of our new products and execution.  While the resurgence of COVID did impact our performance across several businesses, we continue to view this impact as temporary. It's worth noting that our average daily sales in the third quarter were tracking higher than the second quarter through the latter part of December. However, we saw a step down, driven by the COVID resurgence, starting in the holiday period and continuing through the end of the quarter. Procedure volumes were light in many geographies and specifically impacted our surgical innovations, spine, and many of our cardiac and vascular businesses.  As Geoff mentioned, despite the slowdown in procedures, sales of our capital equipment were strong and point to a turn soon. While our third quarter revenue was in line with Street expectations, we came in $0.14 ahead of consensus on EPS, with an $0.11 beat on better operating margins and $0.03 on tax. FX, which was a greater-than-expected tailwind to revenues, was a headwind to EPS, $0.02 more than our November expectations.  We continued to see strong sequential improvement in our adjusted margins, 180 basis points on our gross margin and 430 basis points on our operating margin. Our operating margin improvement was faster than expected, driven in part by expense controls in SG&A.  Down the P&L, our tax rate came in lower than we expected, as we finalized taxes owed on certain prior years' returns during the quarter.  Turning to our balance sheet, our cash position is strong and we remain focused on investing both organically and inorganically through tuck-in acquisitions and minority investments to drive our long-term growth.  We recently announced another acquisition of the radial artery access portfolio from privately-held RIST Neurovascular, and now have 8 tuck-ins since the beginning of last calendar year, with a combined total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion.  We expect these investments to fuel revenue growth acceleration and create strong returns for our shareholders. And we continue to supplement these returns with a strong and growing dividend.  We are an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, having increased our dividend for 43 years, and our yield of 2% places us in the top quintile of all S&P 500 healthcare companies.  Now, turning to our outlook. While we expect the impact from the COVID resurgence to diminish, the effect from the ongoing pandemic to our businesses remains challenging to predict. So, we will continue to not provide our typical guidance. That said, I do want to give you our sense of the trends ahead. We continued to see a lag in our average daily sales in the first couple of weeks of February. But we expect that to steadily improve, not only as we exit the month, but throughout the quarter, as COVID hospitalizations decrease, ICU capacity increases, and hospitals return to more normal procedure volumes. Said a different way, we expect March to be stronger than February and April to be stronger than March.  As we look at fourth quarter Street expectations and from where we sit today, we are comfortable with Street consensus on revenues and EPS. Within this, it's reasonable to think about organic revenue growth in a range between 30% and 34%, if the recovery trends follow our expectations.  In that case, by group, RTG organic growth would be around 50%, CVG around 40%, and MITG around 15%, reflecting the continued ramp down in ventilator revenues and a tough year-over-year comparison. And Diabetes organic growth would be in the high-single digits.  On the P&L, while we continue to invest in our product pipeline and launches, we do expect sequential operating leverage as our revenue improves. Therefore, we would expect around 1 point to 1.5 points improvement on gross margin and 1.5 points to 2 points improvement on operating margin, both on a sequential basis. Regarding currency, assuming recent rates hold constant, the tailwind to revenue would be roughly $250 million. On the bottom line, we expect an approximate $0.04 headwind.  I'd like to end by reminding you that our new operating model became effective earlier this month and I am excited by the impact it will have on our culture and our ability to drive growth acceleration.  It will have minimal impact, however, on our external reporting, and you can refer to the slides in our earnings presentation for details on the minor changes going forward.  Back to you, Geoff. Geoffrey Martha : Okay. Thank you, Karen. Now to wrap up, we're continuing to put points on the board with strong execution across the organization. We're winning share in an increasing number of our businesses. We're executing on a record number of product launches. We're accelerating our growth, our end markets are coming back, and we have exciting opportunities ahead of us. And importantly, we're positioning the company for long-term success as we continue to invest in our pipeline, enhance our culture, and execute our new operating model.  We're empowering our 20 operating units. We've delayered and decentralized the organization, giving us greater visibility into our end markets and increasing our speed, decisiveness, and competitiveness, while at the same time leveraging the strengths of our enterprise in areas like manufacturing and core technology development. And we're able to accomplish all of this because of our talented organization. I want to thank all of our employees for another great quarter, and their continued hard work and commitment to the Medtronic Mission.  So, with that, let's now move to Q&A. Operator : Francesca DeMartino : I'm Francesca DeMartino from the Medtronic IR team. [Operator Instructions]. Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Karen, and Ryan are joined by Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular portfolio and the Diabetes operating unit; Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical-Surgical portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience portfolio. We'll take the first question from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Just two for me. I'll start with financials. So, Karen, I appreciate all the detail you gave us. Just want a couple of clarifications here. One, you talked about March better than February. Yet, some of your peers have talked about February beginning to bounce a bit or improve relative to January. Have you seen February begin to turn? And is there anything about fiscal 2022 \u2013 I know we're not going to get full guidance for the full year, but anything about Street models in the forward year that you call out at this time that we should be focused on? And then, I have a quick follow-up for Sean. Karen Parkhill : In February so far, if we look at our average daily sales rate by week, we have not yet seen a turnaround, but we really do believe that it's due to the tough weather in the United States. And so, we do believe that we will see that turnaround very soon. We think we're already seeing it in terms of procedures and hospitals. And again, we're focused on March being much better than February and April much better than March. If we think about FY 2022, it's still early. We are still in our planning period. And while I'd love to give some guidance on FY 2022, it's premature given the fact that the COVID is still uncertain and we're still in our planning period. David Lewis : Just to my follow-up here exclusively for Sean. Sean, the Diabetes business, obviously, was the standout versus most Street models here this quarter. I just wonder if you could talk about what you're seeing in 780G relative to what we had seen historically with 670G. The guidance for next quarter probably doesn't seem as strong as I would expect, given the momentum in Diabetes this quarter. So, is there anything to think about there and just any sense of kind of Zeus versus Synergy in terms of relative timeline? Does it make sense to launch those products independently if they're going to be sort of right on top of each other from a filing strategy? So, just a general Diabetes update would very helpful. Thanks so much. Sean Salmon : I'd say with 780G, what people are really enjoying about that is getting to stay in auto mode a lot longer. So, that leads to better glycemic control. With the early reports, people are in the kind of 90s in the postmarket realm for glycemic control, but more importantly, they're not getting interrupted to take blood sugars. That's cut down in half. They're able to sleep through the night with really good blood sugar control. And we measure things like net promoter score on a product level as well., and it's up about tenfold from what we saw \u2013 experienced over 670G. So, a very, very big improvement. And we're also seeing on the 670G, I think the transmitter which connects the CGM to the pump seems to function better than the way we used to connect that in 670G, so it's more reliable. And that coupled with being able to see your numbers in the phone has led to a better experience as well. And of course, that pipeline is upgradeable to not just the 780G, but also the new sensor pipeline you asked about and the extended wear infusion set. With regard to the Synergy, we've already filed suits that was filed in November. Synergy will be filed upon the completion of the manufacturing validation in summertime. So they will be separated by probably enough to make a difference where we're going to want to have both products in the market. But we'll sort that out. We don't need to launch if we don't need to launch it. But I think we're going to have a period of time where Zeus will precede Synergy for both pump integration as well as standalone use. Francesca DeMartino : The next question comes from Bob Hopkins at BofA Securities. Robert Hopkins : Two quick things. First one, just to follow-up on David's question on 2022. If you assume no third or fourth wave of COVID, and I realize that's an uncertainty, but if you just assume that doesn't happen, Karen, is there anything about the Street consensus that sticks out to you in that scenario? Karen Parkhill : I would say, Bob, it is early to tell from our planning process, but you can expect very strong growth off of a depressed base next year. And the Street is expecting that. So, harder for me to give guidance beyond that when we're still in our planning process. Robert Hopkins : For Sean or for Geoff on CVG, that was the one division in the quarter that was a little bit weaker than you originally thought. And I was wondering if you could just comment on that broadly. How much of that was simply worse than expected on the COVID side versus other things that surprised you during the quarter? And I ask the question because I want to understand what sort of turned around momentum in that division relative to your expectations. Thank you. Sean Salmon : First of all, I'd say that we got affected by a few things in the quarter, mostly coming out of the holidays and into January. We saw the more elective parts of CVG slow down due to COVID. And also, where we had more concentrated kind of hospital clusters where, let's say you're in a tertiary care setting for, like, TAVR or cardiac surgery procedures. When you had cities shutting down because of COVID, we just had more of an impact on volume. It's come back a little bit, but for some weather here in the February timeframe, as Karen described. But I'd say, generally, the things that were moving the quarter were Micra, also TYRX, they were both really good, DCB is coming back. And the CRM portfolio, with the exception of tachy, which still has its replacement headwinds, was moving in the right direction. As I said, TAVI was a little slower than we had hoped quarter-on-quarter, but we think it's going to pick up momentum as we go forward into the next quarter. And of course, in coronary, while we gained share, we did have a $45 million headwind due to the China DES tender, which is going to recur every quarter until it annualizes. Francesca DeMartino : The next question comes from Robbie Marcus at J.P. Morgan. Robert Marcus : Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe two questions. I'll just ask them upfront. Probably both for Karen. One on margins. You did great OpEx control in the quarter. SG&A was down sequentially, which we typically don't see. How are you thinking about coming out of COVID, going into fiscal 2022? How much leverage can we see? How much is spending that's been held back versus needs to be put into place once procedures come back?  And then second, if you could touch on, free cash flow trends continue to look pretty encouraging. How should we think about free cash flow conversion going forward? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : We did see good, continued expense control this quarter, particularly in SG&A. And we would expect that to continue. That has helped drive our sequential margin improvement. It's not the only thing. Obviously, revenue growth helped drive it too. And we talk about the fact that we expect sequential margin improvement both in gross and operating margins for Q4. As we think ahead, I would just keep in mind that our fourth quarter operating margins tend to be our highest margins. So, I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate those on to the full year for next year. But we do, again, expect to have continued good expense control.  And in terms of free cash flow, yes, we have seen very encouraging things with free cash flow both on better-than-expected profit from the beginning of the year, along with better-than-expected collections on accounts receivable despite the pandemic. So, we've got good momentum particularly in both places. And you've seen our free cash flow, at least year-to-date, be above that 80% conversion. I would say that free cash flow is more of an annual metric because cash flows can be lumpy. And while we may be under that 80% conversion rate for the full year just because of COVID and the pandemic, we are clearly committed to that conversion rate being above the 80% going forward. Francesca DeMartino : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Lawrence Biegelsen : One for Bob, one for Karen. Bob, on the surgical robot, the filing seems like it's on track. Can you talk about how you're feeling about the 100 basis points to 150 basis points of contribution to growth in fiscal 2022? It seems like a lot at this point. Any reaction to the J&J system?  And I'll ask my question for Karen. Karen, I apologize on fiscal 2022. I know we're going to get a lot of questions on it. So, by my math, your guidance implies about 3% to 4% underlying growth in Q4. Is there any reason why we shouldn't be thinking about fiscal 2022 underlying growth of about 5%? Or there's ventilator \u2013 you have headwinds like ventilator sales, about the Valiant recall and the extra week in 2021. So, does that make 5% underlying challenging? And then, is there any reason why the margins in 2022 won't be in line with 2019? You're exiting this year at about 29%. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Bob White : I'll go first, Larry. We continue to expect to hit those same revenue contributions, Larry, I gave you in Hartford, right, which was less than 50 bps in 2021 100 bps to 150 bps in 2022, and then in FY 2023 200 bps to 250 bps. Look, the feedback on our system and our approach to building out the digital ecosystem, which you and I've talked about around [indiscernible] has been really positive. We feel confident our portfolio is competitive and will really expand the marketplace that I've talked about a lot going forward. So, I think we're on track, Larry, with what I told you. And of course, as Geoff mentioned in his comments a few minutes ago, we've got some really important milestones coming up. But we're really excited about where we're at. And as you'd anticipate, I'm not going to comment on the J&J system, Larry, other than to just say, we feel really great about our platform, the feedback we've got, the open counsel, the modularity upgrade, ability to leverage of our surgical instrumentation. So, we feel great about the competitiveness of our system and we're excited to hit those milestones we talked about here in March.  So with that, I'll hand it back to Karen. Karen Parkhill : Larry, I appreciate the questions on FY 2022 and recognize that you guys are getting those questions. And so, I would love to be able to give you a lot more color. But I really \u2013 we're really in this planning phase. And so, it's very difficult for me to give you more than I've given. Expect strong growth off of a depressed base. We're very excited about our pipeline and our launches ahead. And we've talked about revenue growth being strong and accelerating into the future. So we'll give you color when we can or official guidance if the pandemic clears on FY 2022. But in the meantime, we're just going to have to wait until our fourth quarter call. Geoffrey Martha : Look, just to emphasize, we are bullish about FY 2022. But it's too early for us to give any specific guidance. Francesca DeMartino : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on [indiscernible]. I have two product questions. Maybe the first one on Diabetes. I guess, you look at the timelines here on 780 plus Zeus that's subject to the FDA, but based on, I guess, how the 780 launch has gone in Europe, do you now feel more confident of getting back to market growth just with Zeus. And I'm curious on Synergy. You said the trial is complete? Have you seen the data? Do you think you have the product [indiscernible]? Geoffrey Martha : 780, yes, the device is very competitive. I think we'll do well with it when we get into the marketplace. Now, the sensor experience has continued to be what we need to improve. And of course, we have the pipeline working for that.  With regard to the Synergy data, we will be filing an abstract with that as well as the Zeus data, hopefully, for an ADA presentation. So, you'll see the data when it becomes available if that abstract gets accepted. Vijay Kumar : One, I guess, on RDN. I'm curious, the device has a breakthrough designation, the new [indiscernible] adoption here. I'm curious on how we should be thinking about the revenue ramp now that you have a pathway for reimbursement. Geoffrey Martha : That would give us four years of reimbursement if it survives the administration change, of course, within the Medicare population. If I look at the trial population that we studied so far, that's about a third of the population that was in study. So, that means that the rest of the work needs to be done for commercial payers, and that's going to be a street fight, state by state, payer by payer. We're already beginning that work. But that would be the bigger work to do within reimbursement. And of course, that has to be repeated at the country level all around the world where we have regulatory approvals. So, the availability of reimbursement is a critical part of that adoption curve.  And just to remind you, we think that we can get that to $3 billion mark with just 1% penetration. So, it's a huge opportunity for us and reimbursement will be important for the speed of that ramp. Francesca DeMartino : The next question is from Pito Chickering at Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Karen, a follow-up question for you on Robbie's question on operating margins. You talked about a very strong SG&A. Can you give us color on how gross margins were able to grow sequentially by 180 basis points despite negative organic revenue growth? And as revenues begin to normalize, why there couldn't be more tailwinds in the fourth quarter versus \u2013 with the guidance that you gave us. Karen Parkhill : On gross margins, those are clearly impacted by price and mix and other things like tariffs that can come into play. So, we've had sequential improvement. We expect continued sequential improvement as we talked about. And where you see it mostly showing up so far is in the operating margin because we are driving greater expense efficiencies on the SG&A line, in particular, and you can expect that to continue. Pito Chickering : Then, in the script, I think you did talk about the strength of capital markets and in your press release you highlighted Mazor and the O-arm. Amid hospital spend whatever capital they have budgeted by the end of the year, utilize it/lose it, can you sort of walk us through what you're seeing on the capital markets in January and through February and what you're seeing or you're hearing from the field for calendar 2021? Geoffrey Martha : The capital equipment obviously that we sell is directly tied to capital equipment that obviously that we sell is directly tied to procedures, right? Elective procedures that tend to be, in the United States, in particular, high profit margin for the hospitals. And we're tying this to, one, the value proposition in this equipment, which we've invested in over the years, and how it enhances the procedure and the outpatient outcomes. But it is, I think, in our mind a signal to a step back in patient volumes coming that we expect over the coming months. And that's consistent with conversations we've had with hospital CEOs over the last two weeks. I don't know, Brett, if you want to add to that. Brett Wall : Yeah, really the same, Geoff. We haven't seen the turn yet in procedures after the January resurgence, but the capital markets remain strong. And the hospital CEOs and others are really preparing for that and then upgrading their existing fleets of navigation and then imaging. And then we've seen the strong robotics quarter. So, we think that portends well for the future here as we get through this time period and research in some cases commences. Francesca DeMartino : The next question is from Matt O'Brien at Piper Jaffray. Matthew O'Brien: I guess, Sean, just for starters, again, on the product side of things, Micra had another great quarter, getting tougher on the comp side of things. I'm just curious between VR and AV, where you're at in terms of penetrating those two indications? And especially on the AV side, what are you seeing in terms of adoption in that indication and how much room do we have to go there? Sean Salmon : Yeah, I'll have to get back to you with the specifics. But just in general, the VR is penetrating within that single chamber market a little bit more. And that's a phenomenon we see deeper in the US, we see outside the US. And the AV is driving growth for the most part, except for China, where we can introduce the VR. And that's starting to take off, it's only there, as well as in Japan. We only have the VR version. So, we have the AV coming in the third quarter of next year for Japan. So, we think that that's going to be a big growth driver for us to continue the Micra penetration. But there's headroom to grow. And of course, while we haven't touched the other market, which is the maybe block market and we have a future product for that atrial version of Micra yet to go. Matthew O'Brien: Sorry to put you on the spot there, just given how short you've been in that seat. I guess, Geoff, question for you. Just on the new product side, there's just been just a long list of new products that you're introducing, which is great to see. I'm just curious how potentially you could be impacted negatively because of COVID, because of hospitals' inability to adopt new technology in this environment, and how that could potentially slow down some of these new products as we get into fiscal 2022 and how you kind of guard against that? Geoffrey Martha : Actually, what we've seen is, despite \u2013 obviously, the COVID overhang has impacted all elective procedures and has been a headwind for us in total. But where we're launching new products, even in the backdrop of these market conditions, we're seeing adoption. Would it be better without COVID? Absolutely. But we are still seeing adoption. Sean was just talking about Micra. It grew again. Another great quarter at 75% in the US and 64% or something like that globally in our neuroscience or in RTG in the neuromodulation space, whether it be our new technology in pelvic health or our deep brain stimulation, our Percept PC, deep neurostimulator, or in pain, our new pain products in the DTM product. All of those are getting disproportionate share versus the competition. And yeah, it would be better in a non-COVID environment, but we are seeing products get adopted. We are seeing some price improvement where we have differentiated technology that warrants it. So, I'm looking forward for COVID to be behind us here, but it really hasn't stopped hospitals from adopting, maybe not at the scale they otherwise would have, but adopting the technology. Francesca DeMartino : The next question is from Joanne Weunsch at Citi. Joanne Weunsch : Two pieces. One, there are a couple of headwinds and reliefs, we'll call it, next year. Is there a way to quantify the ventilator headwind and the Valiant headwind? And then, can you remind us when the China tenders annualize? Karen Parkhill : I think you meant the Naviant headwind. We do expect our Q4 revenue to be impacted by roughly $40 million from that headwind. And then, if we look going forward into next year, we're going to be focused on introducing our prior product, the Captivia product and ramping that up throughout the year. So, we expect that to help offset the headwind from Naviant. So, we expect about $25 million to $30 million per quarter in fiscal 2022, a little bit higher at the beginning of the year as we're rolling out the product and a little bit less toward the end of the year.  And then, you had a second question, and I need to remember what that was. Joanne Weunsch : It was part of quantifying the ventilator headwind. And when the China tenders annualize. Karen Parkhill : On ventilators, obviously, sequentially, we're seeing ventilator growth come down as we expected. And we expect that to continue into next year. But keep in mind, ventilator is a small part of Medtronic. And we recognize we've got certain headwinds, and we're going to be focused on offsetting where we can.  And in terms of the China tender, we expect the China tender along \u2013 the DES national tender along with the balloon multi-provincial tenders to impact us about $45 million a quarter. That will start to anniversary in the second quarter of next year and then fully anniversary in the third quarter of next year. Francesca DeMartino : Next question is from Josh Jennings at Cowen. Joshua Jennings : I wanted to just focus on the Structural Heart franchise and the pipeline. Mike Coyle's departure, we've been surprised that Medtronic hasn't pursued an edge to edge repair solution. I know that Half Moon investment is in place. But post the COAB [ph] data, it's a proven therapy for degenerative and functional mitral regurgitation and the only game in town right now. Are there any internal plans outside of Half Moon to pursue \u2013 Half Moon being a different technology. But are there any internal plans to pursue edge to edge repair internally?  And then also, wanted to ask about the Intrepid enrollment pace and any updates there you can share, any expectations of when enrollment could be completed?  And then lastly, LAAO, any new thoughts or strategy to pursue that market, which is building nicely? Sean Salmon : Josh, I guess I'll start with the edge to edge repair. That's based on a surgical procedure that isn't done as a standalone surgery anymore. And the reason for that is because you kind of leave \u2013 you sort of trade one disease for another, right? You bring those edges together and you fix the leak of the valve, but you leave behind basically a stenotic valve, which continues to partially leak. And the idea of replacing that valve or in the case of like a Half Moon, where you're basically replacing the back leaflet, you can eliminate MR completely, and also leave open future options to fix that valve, which you're cut off from in a clip technology. So, it doesn't really make sense for us to pursue something that has a couple players in it already and has some residual limitations. It makes more sense to go for repair solution that creates more options and does a better job of eliminating MR.  With regards to the Intrepid trial, we did change the endpoint in that trial and picked up a lot. It's Bayesian design. So, the enrollment will be dependent on some interim looks down the road. Enrollment did pick up. We continue to have some challenges where there are COVID hotspots at the individual center level, but it's continuing along.  And then, the last question on left atrial appendage, I guess kind of like the first one. Unless you have a really differentiated technology that brings more to the party, it's not something that we're going to pursue just me-too products in. We have obviously some interest in that space, but it has to be a technology that really matters and brings a difference to the patient and the clinicians. Francesca DeMartino : The next question from Matt Taylor at UBS. Matthew Taylor : I wanted to go back to this commentary that you made about investment in productive capital and hospitals gearing up for the snapback in procedures. Could you offer any thoughts on whether you think there's pent up demand in the system? And do you think that that's going to lead to elevated levels of utilization as we go through calendar 2021? Is that what you think the hospitals are gearing up for? Any more color on those investment trends will be helpful. Geoffrey Martha : Look, I can go back to what we experienced in 2020. After the initial wave of COVID hit back in the spring timeframe, there was a fairly \u2013 especially in the US, but all over the world, a fairly quick recovery. I think much faster than people anticipated. And we feel that prior to this latest wave, this latest spike of COVID, that really hit us in late December, we had worked through the majority of that backlog, right? So, call that, over six, seven month timeframe. And so, we would expect something similar here. So, a new backlog has built up. And we expect to be able to work through that over the next six months or so. Matthew Taylor : As a follow-up, I was hoping \u2013 you gave a nice slide in the presentation on the performance by a number of different geographies and there was pretty good recovery across most of them. Could you offer any thoughts on how you see the trends by developed versus emerging over the next couple of periods here? Is it going to be similar in terms of recovery in your mind? Geoffrey Martha : First of all, I'll start with China. China's pretty much back to normal. For us, if you back out the impact of the China tender, we had a really strong quarter in China and don't expect that to change. So, China's back to normal. Then I'll come over to the United States and we talked about that. And I think the worst is behind us with the second wave. And as Karen indicated earlier, we expect to see the recovery. It was a little delayed, I think, by some of the weather we had here over the last week. But just started to see a procedural recovery. And we do think that's going to go fairly robust recovery fairly, fairly quick, like we saw the first spike. And then Europe, I think will trail the United States by a couple of months. It's just not going to move \u2013 I don't think it's going to move quite as fast in terms of recovery.  And then, if you look at other parts of Asia-Pacific and Latin America, they are back to growth. And I think they'll kind of continue to steadily improve. So, that's the way I'd sum it up. And we're really watching the US recovery and the Europe one. And like I said, we think Europe will trail the US by a couple of months. Francesca DeMartino : The next question is from Matt Miksic at Credit Suisse. Matthew Miksic : I had one follow-up on some of the questions you've had on 2022. And as we think about sort of the major drivers, very strong pipeline, obviously, as you've talked about, but if you could call out maybe some of the key business lines or where you're going to have continued momentum into 2022 and maybe some of the larger launches or product lines where we should expect those to be kind of the big bowls of the tent to get to that whatever it is that you land on, mid-single-digit growth for 2022. And I've got one follow-up. Geoffrey Martha : I know the comps get a little harder with Micra, but a strong continued cardiac rhythm growth into the year. In neuroscience and RTG, all the neuromodulation-related therapies there with DBS, I think we're going to see a multi-year share gain and growth in DBS because we're following up our Percepta DBS launch with our new SenSight leads which enhance the sensing and provide us durability and we're launching a new clinical trial for closed loop adaptive DBS. In pain, we've been got the new DTM product from the Stimgenics acquisition that sits on top of our Intellis platform, and that's got a lot of momentum. And I think the physician community is excited about the idea of us bringing ECAPS to market. So, we've got a little momentum there. And of course, in our overactive or pelvic health business, neuromodulation for overactive bladder, you heard in the commentary, we've got a lot of momentum there as well. And then, of course, you've got the soft tissue robot launching, Bob already articulated the impact there at the MITG level of 100 basis points or so. So, those are some big ones. In cardiology, we've got a lot going on as well. Our atrial fibrillation business with the DiamondTemp launch is another one in our first line indication for our cryo product line, are also exciting, I think, growth drivers for us.  I don't know, Sean, did I leave anything out there? And you've got quite a bit going on in cardiology. Sean Salmon : No, you've got a lot, Geoff. And we also have the [indiscernible] market, venous stenting, so little ones that are there. The replacement headwinds within tachy that I mentioned go away in the coming year, which is good. And of course, PFA is a disruptive ablation technology from what we've got coming. The device linked to it as it expands its availability and moves into heart failure is a growth driver. TAVR will continue to be a great growth driver for us. And then, of course, we've got the [indiscernible] franchises in the longer term horizon. Geoffrey Martha : I think the message here is, whether it's FY 2022 or beyond, we are really focused on not just launching the products in the pipeline, but keeping the pipeline full and really managing this business, balancing the short and the long term here. And I know that the morale within Medtronic is high, despite all the things going on in the world, despite some of the changes we made. And it's because of the investment we're making in our pipeline. And so, that is something we're going to keep going across the company that we're hyper focused on that. Matthew Miksic : And the follow-up I had, just one of the stories around the pandemic, obviously, we've all talked about it over the last year has been digital and sort of the leveraging of digital technology, sales and support and patient interaction, et cetera. So, wondering if you could talk a little bit about both the way that \u2013 if there's any additional initiatives worth noting, like what you've done with Viz.ai and stroke, but also how we should think about the productivity of the P&L, of operations in a world where you'll be leaning more, I suppose, on digital in 2022 and 2023 than you were in 2019 and in early 2020? Geoffrey Martha : There are two categories, how digital is impacting, I'll call it, our offerings to our customers and patients. And you mentioned Viz.ai, which is helping expand the stroke market. Our partnership with them has helped differentiate Medtronic and drive share. That's a good example. But I think another one that's a big one that we've talked about is remote capabilities in our implantable business, and I'll highlight our cardiac rhythm business. Correct me if I'm wrong, Sean, even there's remote programming, there's remote device management, there's remote patient management, and it is really picking up. Some of this technology was there before COVID, but the uptake was slow. And then, during COVID, the timing worked out. With our pipeline, we launched some additional remote capabilities, but we're seeing things like, for example, MRI when patients have to go back to \u2013 go into the hospital and they have an implanted cardiac device, they needed an MRI, that used to be more of a manual intervention. A Medtronic field representative actually going to the hospital to meet with the patient and make some programming changes. That now is up to \u2013 25% or more of those are done now remotely and it was pretty low single digits prior to COVID. So, the uptake on \u2013 that's just one example of how digital is changing workflows and providing, in this case, better patient outcomes, but a lot of efficiencies.  So, we're seeing the digital piece take off and it will provide also productivity for our company. We believe we can provide \u2013 we've learned how to do, like, medical education remotely. Now, you can't do all med ed remotely. There's exchange of scientific data and there's some ability to train remotely. Obviously, at some point, these physicians want to get into the cadaver lab and things like that. And we haven't figured out how to do that remotely. But we're amazed at \u2013 when our backs were against the wall and you couldn't meet with physicians, how digital came to the rescue and provided a high quality experience. And now physicians, they are now on board with this. So, I think that will, one, speed up adoption of new technology, which is a good thing, but, two, provide efficiencies for us. Francesca DeMartino : Our final question comes from Danielle Antalffy at SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : I just have one question. And that's around the capital deployment and how you're thinking about M&A. I appreciate that you've talked about more tuck-in type of deals. You've been pretty successful there, very active. But I guess just digging a little bit deeper, sort of where are the areas that you see whitespaces from a technology perspective and/or where do you feel like you need this scale from a technology or geographic distribution perspective that we should be thinking about Medtronic potentially being most active over the next, call it, one to two years? Thanks so much. Geoffrey Martha : Look, the M&A, I'll call them bite size, but smaller tuck-in deals, where we're getting at these companies at relatively early stage, in most cases before commercialization. It seems to be something that's working for us. So, we can do more of these. We add more value and we're getting them at values that make sense. So, we're getting good returns on these. And we're spreading our risk across a number of these deals. And I would expect that to continue. And I think the most of the work of these tuck-ins, most of the volume rather, will come around our existing therapies and existing markets to augment them. And really, I look at it as an extension of our organic growth strategy because we're not buying growth here. We're buying technology. And then, kind of adding to that, whether it be additional technology or clinical science, and then making these standard of care around the world. So, that's going to be the lion's share of it. In terms of whitespace, this is something that we haven't signaled where we're always looking at new markets to better position the company to optimize our portfolio for growth. We start looking at whitespace, truly outside of the \u2013 when you kind of move outside of the tuck-in and these tend to be a little larger. And this really is something we're always looking at, if we think it's the right move to help our portfolio, but the focus is the tuck-ins. Ryan Weispfenning : Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Geoffrey Martha : Look, thanks, everybody for the great questions and really appreciate your support and the continued interest in in Medtronic. We hope that you'll join us again on our Q4 earnings webcast, which we anticipate holding on May 27 where we'll update you on our quarterly progress and look ahead to fiscal 2022. I know there's a lot of questions on 2022 today, so we'll get at that in our Q4 call.  So, thanks for tuning in today. And please stay healthy and safe. The vaccine is on the way. And have a great day. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's Fiscal Year 2021 Fourth Quarter Earnings Video Webcast. I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. Before we start the prepared remarks, I'm going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today's webcast. Joining me today are Geoff Martha, Medtronic\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021, which ended on April 30, 2021. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company, and today's event should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed from the link in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. As we mentioned last quarter, the fourth quarter marks the first time that we\u2019re using the new nomenclature and reporting structure of our new operating model. For more information on these changes, please see the relevant slides in our earnings presentation. During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis. Fourth quarter organic revenue comparisons are just only for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last four quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. Full fiscal year organic revenue comparisons exclude the impact of foreign currency, the benefits in the first 12 months of our Titian Spine acquisition and the benefit of the extra week in our first quarter. References to sequential improvement compare to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and are made on an as reported basis. All references to share gains or losses are on a revenue and calendar quarter basis, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.  And finally, our EPS guidance does include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. And with that, let\u2019s get started. Geoffrey Martha : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We reported a strong quarter this morning. The expectations that we set for Q4 on the last earnings call were seen by many in the financial community as aggressive. Yet we executed and we delivered, beating Street estimates on revenue, margins, and EPS. Most of our end markets are returning to near-normal pre-COVID growth. While some geographies are lagging due to COVID's persistence, momentum built throughout the quarter and we feel confident about the year ahead. Karen will give you more color on our guidance later in this call, but the key takeaway is that we\u2019re guiding above Street estimates on the top line while simultaneously accelerating our investments at the front end of major product launches in surgical robotics and renal denervation. Now in robotics and renal denervation, we\u2019re investing in our marketing, customer service and support capabilities to maximize these product launches. We\u2019re also investing in R&D broadly with meaningful programs across the company. As we talked about at our Investor Day last year, we have a packed pipeline across our businesses with a number of meaningful opportunities and our top priority is to invest in our business and pipeline to take advantage of those opportunities. As a result, we plan on increasing our R&D spend by more than 10% in FY 2022, the biggest dollar increase in R&D spend in our company\u2019s history, all while delivering strong EPS growth. We\u2019re ultra-focused on accelerating our top line growth and we\u2019re making incremental investments to put us in a place to drive a sustainable, higher level of growth than you have historically come to expect from Medtronic. Before I get into some details on the fourth quarter, I\u2019d like to reflect on the past year, my first as CEO. It\u2019s certainly been a difficult environment with the pandemic, but our organization has risen to the challenge and achieved so much in such a short period of time and under unique circumstances. Now it\u2019s become clich\u00e9 for companies to say that they\u2019re expecting to emerge from the pandemic stronger, as I\u2019ve heard this phrase echoed from many of our competitors, but you\u2019ve been hearing this from us from day one.  And I think you\u2019ll find it hard to name another company in our space that has done more to emerge from this pandemic stronger than Medtronic. Whether it was investing in our employees, helping our customers and patients, sustaining our R&D programs or changing our operating model, and putting in place a new Medtronic mindset culture, this past year was transformational for us. In fiscal 2021, customers eliminated the vast majority of their quarter-end bulk purchases, resulting in a more balanced order flow across the quarter. This has improved our predictability and our pricing, made our business easier to manage, and reduced stress on our operations. This past fiscal year, we also accelerated our tuck-in acquisitions, adding key technologies, like AI-driven spine planning tools from Medicrea and market-leading smart pen technology from Companion Medical among others. We also advanced our organic pipeline with more than 230 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and China in FY 2021. FY 2021 was also the year that we stepped up and helped our customers and communities during the pandemic. As a leading manufacturer of high acuity ventilators, we significantly increased our production and open sourced our IP to allow others to produce our ventilators around the world. We continue to support communities in need. Most recently, as a key member of the Global Task Force on Pandemic Response, which was organized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and supported by the Business Roundtable. With the help of other task force members, we\u2019re working to supply 1,000 ventilators to India. Medtronic and the Medtronic Foundation also just announced an additional 3 million for COVID relief efforts in underserved areas of India, Brazil, and the US, and other regions, which brings our combined support of COVID-19 efforts to $56 million. And in FY 2021, we announced our goal of becoming carbon neutral in our operations by the end of the decade. We\u2019ve set aggressive targets to reduce our environmental footprint as we focus on creating a sustainable future for our business, our communities and our planet. We\u2019ve always had a strong mission to guide this company, which includes integrating a strong corporate purpose into our strategy and maintaining good citizenship. In this year, we\u2019ve enhanced our corporate culture to emphasize our commitment to being bold, more competitive and moving with greater speed and decisiveness, which we believe will help drive the execution of our mission. We\u2019re also focused on becoming a more diverse and inclusive organization and I was very proud that Medtronic was recognized earlier this month as number 11 on Diversity Inc.\u2019s Top 50 U.S. companies for diversity, one of the biggest jumps by any company. We know we have room to improve and we\u2019re striving to be a company that attracts, develops and retains top talent from all gender and ethnic backgrounds. To sum up FY 2021, it was a year marked by progress and accomplishments that will propel us into FY 2022 with a stronger foundation for growth and a greater ability to execute, deliver and exceed our own expectations. We have momentum, energy, and a pipeline that gives our team optimism about what we can accomplish this year. Now let\u2019s turn to the fourth quarter results and start with a look at market share as we\u2019ve been doing the last few earnings calls. We continue to gain share in an increasing number of our businesses driven by our differentiated product offerings, and we\u2019ve put in place offering mechanisms to ensure that we continue to drive this competitive culture across the organization. Market share is one of the key metrics that we will hold our teams accountable to deliver in evaluating performance and in FY 2022, it will be included as a metric in our annual incentive compensation. While the impact of COVID on procedures, along with the timing of our quarter, does mask some of the underlying market dynamics, we are seeing a growing trend of share gains for Medtronic. Leading the list for share gains this quarter is one of our largest businesses, Cardiac Rhythm Management, which has gained share over the past several quarters. We estimate that our CRM business has gained two to three points year-over-year and CRM is now at the highest share level in more than a decade with strong gains from around the globe. Now these gains have been driven by Micra, our leadless pacemaker, which grew 74% in Q4 and is now annualizing at nearly $400 million. Micra is a great example of the innovation and disruption that we\u2019re driving at Medtronic, but it\u2019s not just Micra generating our share gains. Our Cobalt and Crome high-power devices are also contributing, driving our CRT-D product line to 74% growth in Q4. In TAVR, our share was up over a point year-over-year and was stable sequentially. We reached an all-time record of U.S. TAVR implants in the quarter. Late last month, we announced interim results of our OPTIMIZE PRO study, which showed that our new implant technique is resulting in single-digit pacemaker rates. In addition, last week at EuroPCR, we announced very strong low-risk data, which showed that the advantages of our Evolut TAVR system are maintained over surgical valves at two years post-procedure. Importantly, our data showed no conversions of the TAVR and SAVR curves for death or disabling stroke, as well as continued low valve thrombosis rates out to year two. This stands in contrast to our competition\u2019s PARTNER III data. And we\u2019ll leverage this data with implanting physicians as we continue to go on the offensive and win share in this important growth market. In our gastrointestinal business, we estimate that we gained share, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our GI diagnostic product lines grew in the low-50s, driven by high-60s growth of our PillCam. Last month, we received FDA clearance for our GI Genius Module, which uses artificial intelligence to assist physicians in detecting both precancerous and cancerous growths during colonoscopies. GI Genius can highlight lesions real-time and identify polyps that might otherwise go undetected by the human eye, improving the quality of colonoscopies. In our Cranial & Spinal Technologies business, we estimate that we gained share in both spine and neurosurgery, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our strategy of bringing a digital ecosystem of enabling technology to spine procedures is working. We have record sales of our StealthStation navigation systems O-arm imaging systems, Midas Rex capital and advanced energy products. And we estimate that our Mazor robotic system continues to outpace our closest competitor. In ENT we estimate that our share is up over a point year-over-year. The ongoing launches of our NIM Vital nerve monitoring system and StealthStation FlexENT navigation system, coupled with share gains in disposable sinus blades are driving our above market performance. In Pelvic Health, share gain continued with the momentum created by the launch of InterStim Micro and the SureScan leads. Our sales growth outpaced tax audits in the calendar first quarter and we did this despite having a far larger sales base. While the European sacral neuromodulation market remains sluggish due to COVID resurgence, the U.S. market continues to accelerate. Turning to Neuromodulation, we estimate that we have gained about a point of Pain Stim share year-over-year and even more sequentially. Our SCS product line grew 73% in Q4 and we continue to outpace the competition in the calendar first quarter. The market continues to show strong enthusiasm for our DTM SCS therapy which now carries a superiority label from the FDA. And our strategy of going after competitive account conversions is yielding great results. Our DTM trial adoption remained robust and grew sequentially, a good leading indicator for future growth in our Pain Stim business. In Brain Modulation, while we estimate we lost a couple of points of share year-over-year, we continue to gain sequential share on the back of the Percept PC launch. Percept has resulted in 10 points of new implant share gains in the U.S. since its launch last summer. So there are a number of businesses where we\u2019re gaining share, but there are still some businesses where\u2019ve got some work to do. In Cardiac Diagnostics, as we discussed last quarter, we continued to be supply constrained with our new LINQ II system in Q4 as we ramp our unique wafer scale manufacturing. We estimate we lost about a point sequentially in mid-single digit share points year-over-year, primarily with Boston Scientific. We\u2019re working through the supply ramp up and expect to have improved supply in the back half of the fiscal year. In addition, we implemented a product ship hold on the LINQ II last week as we analyze an issue. In the meantime, customers are continuing to use our Reveal LINQ. Once we resolve the issue, we\u2019re confident that the proven market leadership of Reveal LINQ and the competitive differentiation of LINQ II will allow us to continue to win in this space. In our Aortic business we announced the voluntary recall of our Valiant Navion Thoracic Stent Graft System in February. We also announced that we would be working to ramp production of our previous generation product, the Valiant Captivia, but that we would not be at full production until September. The loss of Navion had a $35 million impact to revenue in Q4 and resulted in us losing high teens share in the thoracic stent graft market. That said, our customers have expressed strong interest in using the Valiant Captivia product when inventory is available. And looking ahead, we\u2019re estimating that the quarterly revenue impact will decrease as we go through FY 2022 from $30 million in Q1 to $15 million in Q4. In Neurovascular, we estimate we lost a couple of points of share year-over-year, driven primarily by new competitive flow diverters from Stryker and Trumo [ph]. That said, we saw our share stabilize sequentially as we launched our Solitaire X 3 mm stent retriever in the U.S. and started the limited launch of our Pipeline Vantage flow diverter in certain CE Mark countries. We expect our new products to drive sequential share gains going forward. In Diabetes, we continue to execute on our turnaround strategy, growing 9% this quarter. This is still below market and we estimate we lost about 5 points a share year-over-year. However, our share was stable sequentially. Our new MiniMed 770G and 780G insulin pumps are giving us momentum, resulting in very strong double-digit global insulin pump growth. Next let's turn to our pipeline. We're launching a number of products across the company and even more are coming. We expect our robust pipeline to be the key driver of accelerating our top line growth, as we're at the front of some large opportunities to win share, create new markets, and disrupt existing markets. And as I noted earlier, we're continuing to fuel our R&D investments, such that our pipeline can be a continuous source of sustained revenue growth over the coming years. Starting with Cardiovascular, one of our largest future drivers is nerve denervation. As we develop our solution to go after the multibillion dollar addressable market in hypertension. We're expecting to present our ON MED pivotal trial results later this year, likely at the TCT Conference in November, and these results are likely to be one of the most highly anticipated events in medtech this year. In Cardiac Rhythm Management, we're planning to file for CE Mark for our disruptive extravascular ICD technology this quarter. Let me repeat that. I said, this quarter. And in our Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, we're expecting a first line therapy indication for Arctic Front Cryoballoon in the U.S. this coming quarter. We also continue to make good progress on bringing our disruptive pulsed field ablation system to market with strong enrollment in our PULSED AF pivotal trial. In Structural Heart, we received FDA approval in Q4 for Harmony Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve, the first of its kind and a breakthrough treatment for patients with congenital heart disease. In TAVR, we received low risk shown in [ph] approval in Japan, and are expecting reimbursement approval later this fiscal year. We also expect the U.S. rollout of our next generation TAVR valve, the Evolut Fx, later this calendar year, which will feature enhanced deliverability and ease of use. Turning to our Medical Surgical portfolio, another very important program is our Hugo robotic assisted surgery platform. At the end of March, we reported that we'd submitted Hugo for CE Mark and U.S. IDE approval. Well today, I'm happy to report that the FDA has granted the IDE approval, and we're preparing to commence our EXPAND Uro trial in the U.S. to study Hugo in urologic procedures. We also had our first revenue from Hugo placements at hospitals outside the U.S. in Q4. These systems will collect clinical data to support regulatory approvals in the U.S. and around the world. As you think about modeling the revenue from our Surgical Robotics business, we're expecting $50 to $100 million in FY 2022, and that's likely to roughly double or triple in FY 2023. We expect soft tissue robotics to be a meaningful growth driver going forward, not just for med-surg, but for overall Medtronic. In our Neuroscience portfolio, we have some exciting near-term milestones coming in our neuromodulation business. We're expecting to launch our Vanta recharge-free spinal cord stimulator in the first half of this fiscal year. This is a big opportunity for us to gain additional share in pain stim, given our low share in the recharge-free portion of the market. We're also on track to submit our ECAPs device to the FDA later this calendar year, which has the potential to be a disruptive technology in the spinal cord stim space. And in brain mod, we're expecting FDA approval for our SenSight directional lead later this calendar year. This will close a key competitive gap and further differentiate our Percept PC system, which I mentioned earlier, was already taken a lot of share in DBS. In Pelvic Health, we received IDE approval last month to start our Titan 1 feasibility study. This trial will evaluate our implantable tibial system, a device that we think could substantially increase our ability to serve overactive bladder patients, many of whom do not seek therapy or remain on current therapy. In Neurovascular, in addition to the Solitaire X 3 mm stent retriever, and Pipeline Vantage flow diverter that I mentioned earlier, we're rolling out five additional products this calendar year. This includes meaningful innovation for the stroke market, like our Pipeline Shield flow diverter in the U.S., and Rist Radial Access System. In Diabetes, we recently received CE Mark approval for our Zeus CGM sensor, which we will be marketing as the Guardian 4 sensor. The no calibration data that was used to support the CE Mark approval will be presented next week at the Virtual ATTD Conference, and the abstract is available on the ATTD website. We're pleased with the accuracy of Guardian 4 and that it has now been labeled for dosing without finger sticks. Starting this fall, Europeans will not only have access to the 780G with the highest reported time and range of any insulin pump, but also our Guardian 4 sensor with no finger sticks required in our extended infusion set with an industry leading seven-day wear. We think this is a highly differentiated product offering, and one that we can't wait to bring to other markets. In the U.S., the 780G and Guardian 4 sensor are under active review with the FDA. Finally, we're making progress on our synergy sensor, which is disposable, easier to apply, and half the size of our current sensor. We intend to submit the sensor to the FDA in the first half of the fiscal year, once we complete our manufacturing module. I'll now turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and guidance. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Geoff. Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased 32% and adjusted EPS increased 159%, significant growth, as we anniversary the downturn we experienced at the start of the pandemic last year. Our end markets continue to recover from the impact of COVID, and we continue to execute on our strategy, and launch new products, resulting in a sequential revenue increase of 5% and sequential adjusted EPS growth of 16%. Our adjusted EPS was $0.08 better than consensus with $0.02 on higher operating profit and $0.06 from a lower than estimated tax rate. Our recovery from the COVID resurgence in December and January improved throughout the quarter as expected. March was stronger than February and April was stronger than March. We were particularly pleased with the strength of the last several weeks of the quarter, which we believe sets us up nicely for the start of our new fiscal year. From a geographic standpoint, we had strong 47% growth in the United States. Outside of the U.S., our developed markets grew 11% with continued pockets of COVID resurgence in parts of Western Europe, Japan and Canada. Our emerging markets grew 41% driven by China growth in the low 90's. Our adjusted margins continue to improve sequentially with 120 basis points on our gross margin and 190 basis points on our operating margin. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 9.6%, better than initially estimated given a favorable jurisdictional mix of profits, along with certain one-time benefits. We've said throughout this past year that the actions we're taking during the pandemic to not only support our employees and our customers, but also continue investing would impact our free cash flow. That said, we're pleased that we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow, converting 81% of our non-GAAP earnings into cash. In the quarter, we repaid in full, a 300 billion yen term loan that was issued earlier in the fiscal year and our year-end cash position remains above 10.5 billion. You can be assured that despite the pandemic, Medtronic continues to be in a strong financial position to drive our long-term strategies. Reflecting the confidence that we and our Board have in the future growth of this company, this morning, we announced that we are increasing our dividend by 9%. We are an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, having increased our dividend now for 44 years, and the dividend is an important part of the total return we generate for our shareholders. We also restarted our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter with a focus on covering dilution from our stock-based compensation. Now turning to our guidance. We're confident in the continuing procedure recovery around the globe, and the resilience of our end markets, and as a result, today reinstate giving formal guidance. We expect strong organic revenue growth acceleration in fiscal 2022 to 9%, plus or minus a point above current street consensus. And while the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $400 million to $500 million. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular and Neuroscience to grow 10% to 11%, Medical Surgical to grow 6% to 7%, and Diabetes to grow 3% to 4%, all on an organic basis. You'll remember that last year we had an extra week in our fiscal calendar and these growth rates have not been adjusted for that extra week, given the offset that we have from customer bulk purchases. As a result, we do not intend to adjust our organic growth in fiscal '22 for the extra week in fiscal '21. In the first quarter, we're comfortable with Street consensus on revenue, which implies organic growth of 17% to 18% and a currency tailwind between $200 million and $250 million at recent rates. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 14% to 15%, Medical Surgical to grow 18% to 19%, Neuroscience to grow 25% to 26% and Diabetes to be flat. With so many big opportunities in front of us, we're prioritizing R&D and commercial investments with growth above and beyond what you would see in a normal year. And we're allocating this capital across our businesses to our best opportunities. As you know, two of our largest opportunities are Surgical Robotics and Renal Denervation. We're purposely making significant investments in them to ensure we fully capitalize on the multi-billion dollar opportunities ahead. Just to give you a sense, when you combine the facts that it's early in the revenue cycle of these two programs, with our heavy investment, we are planning for an operating loss of approximately $400 million next fiscal year from these combined programs. Yet it is important to note that even with these kind of investments, we're still expecting operating margin expansion. This is the power of Medtronic's business model that we can simultaneously make large scale investments in some of the most important future technology areas in med tech, cover the dilution and deliver strong profitability and returns for our shareholders. On the bottom line, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.60 to $5.75 in fiscal '22 which includes a benefit of $0.10 to $0.15 from currency at recent rates. For the first quarter, we expect EPS of $1.31 to $1.34 above current Street consensus of $1.29 to $1.31 and first quarter EPS would include a currency tailwind of about $0.3 at recent rates. Before I hand it back over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of the employees across Medtronic who scaled mountains this year, leaning in to deliver a great year under difficult circumstances. I'm proud to be part of such a terrific team and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Back to you, Geoff. Geoffrey Martha : Okay, thank you, Karen. Now I'd like to close by emphasizing that there's a lot of energy here at Medtronic and our momentum is building. You are seeing us perform better than our competition. We've executed in the short term and we're investing for the long-term. We've accomplished a lot in FY '21 and this is a good start, but our expectations are higher. What will truly differentiate us is accelerating and delivering sustained revenue growth at or above our markets, not just over a year or two but over the next decade. We have incredible programs in our development pipeline with robust expected financial returns. We're developing the next generation of medical devices that incorporate technologies like artificial intelligence, big data, and miniaturized electronics. These programs have the potential to truly change the future of medicine. When we look at the opportunities ahead of us and how we expect to translate these into strong returns for our shareholders, the future is bright. And finally, to our 90,000 employees around the world, thank you for everything that you've accomplished this past year. I'm sure they would agree with me when I say if there's one thing you should take away from today's call, it's at Medtronic we're just getting started. With that, let's now move to Q&A. We'll try to get to as many analysts possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. By the way it's worth noting that the IR Magazine recently recognized our Investor Relations as the best of all companies in the United States, an award we're very proud to receive, as it was the result of voting from hundreds of investors and analysts, and we look forward to continuing to provide you with transparent communication and a high level of service. With that, Francesca, can you please give the instructions for asking a question? A - Francesca DeMartino : [Operator Instructions] Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff Martha and Karen Parkhill are joined by Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio and the Diabetes Operating Unit; Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience Portfolio. We will pause for a minute to assemble the queue. We\u2019ll take the first question from Bob Hopkins at BofA Securities. Bob, please go ahead. Bob Hopkins : Oh, great. Thanks and good morning. And just to make sure the technology is working okay, can you hear me this morning? Geoffrey Martha : Yes, we can hear you, Bob. Bob Hopkins : Great. Thanks, Geoff. I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question and congrats on the momentum. I guess for my one question, given that it's such an important topic, Geoff, and you're such a major player around the globe, and I'm sure investors would love to hear a little more detail on just what you're seeing currently with the recovery in Surgical Procedures and what you saw over the course of the quarter? Specifically, are things continuing to improve here early in fiscal Q1? And are you now seeing year-over-year growth above pre-COVID revenue levels currently? Geoffrey Martha : Yes. Thanks for the question, Bob. I mean, the way we look at this is, by geography and then by product line or therapy. But I'll start with the answer, overall, we're nearing a full recovery and we're seeing with each month of the quarter, every month was better than the prior month and that continued to improve and accelerate into May, largely driven by the U.S. market. I mean once we hit that vaccination inflection point. I mean, I know a couple of months ago, people were worried that it wasn't moving fast enough, then we hit an inflection point and things really opened up. And so in the U.S. where depending with therapy you want to look at anywhere from 85% to over 100% of pre-COVID levels. And like I said, every month got better. And then you look around the world, China's pretty much back to normal totally and Europe being our second biggest, Western Europe if you look at that as one market, that is lagging behind the U.S. But look, we're confident that when you have a healthcare system like they have with that kind of infrastructure, once they get the vaccinations going, it will hit that same inflection point in the United States and open up. But as you know, they are a couple of months behind. The harder one to peg down is the emerging markets. I mean places like India where the virus is still raging, southeast -- other parts of Southeast Asia, Latin America, they don't have the same infrastructure even when they get the vaccine and there's a lot of people. So, there's a lot of vaccines that you need to get there. So that's a harder one to pin down, but overall as a company, I guess that we are nearing a full recovery despite the emerging market piece, really driven by the acceleration of the United States and I guess that we expect Europe to come not too far behind. Bob Hopkins : Any thoughts on Japan? Geoffrey Martha : Japan, it was doing pretty well and then it slowed down a bit and it's starting to come back. But like many of the developed market, it slowed down in that December, January timeframe, but it is starting to come back for us as well. Bob Hopkins : Thank you very much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Bob. Let's go to the next question please, Francesca. Francesca DeMartino : We'll take the next question from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Oh, great. I'll add my congrats on the quarter. So, Karen, maybe for you, there's a lot to unpack here in the guide and it's great to see revenues come in above the Street offset, a little on EPS, I was hoping you could give a bit more color to what's assumed in there in terms of any bolus of recovery patients over the balance of the year? Anything you could give us on top and bottom line cadence throughout the recovery through the year? And just how we think about operating margin versus some of the below the line items would be great? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Robbie. So, in terms of revenue, clearly, we're seeing a strong end to our fiscal year and that's continuing into the first quarter and we expect that momentum to continue. So, from a revenue perspective, we expect increasing revenue growth on a two-year stacked basis throughout the year. In terms of bolus of revenues, we just expect it to be steady, steady increase. In terms of operating margin, we expect an operating margin expansion this year even with our significant increase in investment, particularly against the Robot and RDN and that's what's driving our guide in line with Street expectations. Hopefully, that's helpful. Robert Marcus : Yes. Maybe just a quick follow-up there on operating margin because there's a lot of room in improvement, is something like in the 28% to 28.5% range the right place to be? Karen Parkhill : Yes. I would say you can expect a few points, roughly a little bit over 3 points of improvement in the year. And so we're driving that expansion at the same time that we're driving important investments. Robert Marcus : Great. Thanks a lot. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Robbie. Let's go to the next question please, Francesca. Francesca DeMartino : We'll take the next question from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay, go ahead please. Vijay Kumar : Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Geoff, congrats on a solid print here. I did have one question on Surgical Robotics, actually, it's a two-parter. One, the $50 million to $100 million expectation and perhaps doubling or tripling, what's, I guess, can you talk about the assumptions behind the wide range? Is that a timing-related on perhaps when you might get the accruals in major markets? And then related to that, when you, I think, you guys called out $400 million of operating losses, with revenue from $50 million to $100 million, I think that implies perhaps $1 billion of step-up on the OpEx side, where is that spend going and how should we think about profitability on these new initiatives? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Vijay, I might start by saying that the $400 million of operating losses that we shared with you is both the Robot and RDN combined, it's not just the Robot. And in terms of our assumptions behind the $50 million to $100 million, you can expect it to accelerate into the year, particularly in the back half and the fourth quarter. And we're pleased to be launching this Robot, and we're really excited about the prospects beyond this fiscal year into FY 2023 where we said that it should double or perhaps even triple. Vijay Kumar : Sorry. And that spend, perhaps can you clarify how much of that is R&D versus build out of the commercial organization. Karen Parkhill : Yes, I\u2019m going to let Bob White comment, too, but you can expect it's a lot. We're going to continue in R&D spending and we're going to be building out sales force and customer service and support as well. Bob White : Yes, that's right Karen. That spend is really built as we now commercialize the Robot and as I talked about in the past few chats [ph] we\u2019ve got a really exciting product pipeline across those four vectors in innovation, Instrumentation, Data and Analytics, Visualization and of course the Robotic System as well. Vijay Kumar : Thanks guys. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Vijay. Next question please, Francesca. Francesca DeMartino : We will take the next question from Joanne Weunsch from Citi. Joanne, please go ahead. Joanne Weunsch : Can you hear me okay? Geoffrey Martha : Yes, we can, Joanne. Joanne Weunsch : Wonderful. I\u2019d like to spend just a couple of minutes on diabetes. There\u2019s two major medical meetings coming up, ATTD and ADA. And you\u2019re launching Guardian Sensor 4 and the smart insulin pen outside the United States. So it\u2019s sort of a multi-part question, but first of all, what should we be expecting at these two meetings? As it relates to the Sensor could you give us some of the parameters, I know of zero calibrations, but I\u2019m curious on mode? And lastly, how do you look to price these products as you bring them first outside the United States and then into the United States? Thanks. Geoffrey Martha : Okay, Joanne maybe I\u2019ll have Sean answer those questions. Sean Salmon : Thanks, Joanne. Yes, we\u2019ve got a lot coming out next week at ATTD the plan the sensor data which will be released, there\u2019s the abstract available on the website right now, which includes the marked numbers. We also have information coming out in the 780G experience, which I\u2019d point you to look at the first 40,000 patients a real-world experience are being launched there. We\u2019ll have additional smart pin data coming out at the ADA meeting. But in terms of your specific question on mark, that\u2019s really not a great metric to look at. There\u2019s sort of an overall average of how the difference is looking across the full range of the sensor, but what you really want to know is, when your blood sugar is high or when it\u2019s low, is your sensor accurate? And those data are really accurate and you\u2019ll see that in the presentation. And the other thing that\u2019s important is the trending, is the blood sugar reliably being going up or down, and that\u2019s really what matters. So kind of like A1C is a big average over time for glycemic control and time and range replace that metric, really the accuracy at the right places in the ranges, but it\u2019s important, and you\u2019ll see that in the day that\u2019s being presented. In terms of price, and there\u2019s no plan to change the pricing between what we\u2019ve done with Guardian Sensor 3 or Guardian Sensor 4 in any market. Karen Parkhill : Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Joanne. Next question please, Francesca. Francesca DeMartino : We\u2019ll take the next question from Chris Pasquale at Guggenheim Securities. Chris, please go ahead. Chris Pasquale : Sorry, can you me okay? Geoffrey Martha : Yes, we can hear you just fine, Chris. Chris Pasquale : Great. I wanted to follow-up on the diabetes business, 3% to 4% growth coming off of the year in which sales were flat, doesn\u2019t imply a ton of progress on the turnaround at FY 2022. I\u2019m curious whether that guidance really assumes any contribution from 780G and Zeus in the United States? And maybe tied into that, your latest expectations on the timing of potential FDA approvals for those products? Karen Parkhill : Yes, Chris, I\u2019ll take the first part. I\u2019m going to let Sean comment on the second part. One thing to keep in mind with our diabetes guide is that we purposely did not adjust for the extra week across the whole company that we had last year, because the reduction in bulk purchases offset it. But that reduction in bulk purchases did not affect our diabetes business. So really, we need to look at it with the loss of the extra week that is indeed affecting them and that loss of the extra week is about 150 basis points on the year. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. Sean Salmon : Yes, just to build on what Karen said, we also had a bit of a comparable issue within some international markets, where there was some stockpiling of the consumables that use that, that\u2019s a little bit of your comparison, but the bigger effect for us is that the installed base in the last six months, so those coming out of the warranty in the last six months, was just higher than what we\u2019re going to see in the first half of the fiscal year. So just getting a difference of how many patients come in with timing? Certainly, that the new product flows, you mentioned 780 and Zeus for the U.S. will be most important for us to continue to move both patients from the installed base as well as those new patients, those coming out of MDI or competitors. I don\u2019t have an update on the timing, we\u2019re inactive review, as Geoff said, on the filing. And we, the reviewer that\u2019s working with us is the same one that reviewed the 770 device. We think that familiarity is going to be helpful, but there\u2019s no update on timing at this point. Geoffrey Martha : Thanks. Yes, I just you know, it\u2019s good to see though the pipeline starting to show up here. I mean, we\u2019re looking forward to get to the U.S., but the 780G, the new sensor, the extended wear infusion set, it\u2019s a pretty powerful combination. And we\u2019re seeing great clinical results and great patient feedback. And I think you\u2019ll see that in the data that comes out. And it\u2019s a good leading indicator of what we\u2019re goanna see in the United States, when it gets here. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Chris. Let\u2019s go to the next question please, Francesca? Francesca DeMartino : Okay, the next question from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo Securities. Larry, please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One, just one for Sean, on renal denervation. So Sean for the ON MED data, TCT is the pilot data, good proxy. I think with the off Med, we saw little degradation in the efficacy, would you expect the same here? And can you have reimbursement, how should we think about the ramp? Given the uncertainty around reimbursement, I think we all understand it\u2019s a big opportunity, you guys are really excited about it. But how do we think about, if it\u2019s something that could be a slow ramp, because reimbursement may not be in place, upon approval? Thanks for taking the question. Sean Salmon : Yes, thanks Larry. I think there\u2019s a good proxy for that pilot study, it sort of informed our decision, should we continue on? And is this worth studying? So we think, that magnitude of benefit could be there. But you\u2019re right to point out that when you get into, more centers, more patient and physician variables, things can move around a little bit. So we\u2019ll see what that looks like. But we\u2019re confident that the trials designed properly to get us the right answer. The reimbursement is certainly the hurdle we do have CE mark, we have approval, a lot of countries are getting that paid for it\u2019s going to be important. And in the United States, we\u2019re waiting legally be proposed rule on M set, to allow four years of coverage as we develop further evidence upon approval. Now, that\u2019s, that doesn\u2019t cover payment, we still have work to do there, we still have to go pair-by-pair, because a lot of the patients will fall into the non-Medicare bucket of patients. But we\u2019ve been working that for a number of years, frankly, to make sure that we have the right evidence to satisfy their needs, which really, frankly, drove the need for an ON MED trial to begin with. But yes, we got a lot of work ahead of us, but we\u2019re very excited about the opportunity. And it\u2019s getting closer and closer. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks, Sean. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Larry. Next question please, Francesca? Francesca DeMartino : Okay, the next question from Rick Wise from Stifel. Rick, please go ahead. Rick Wise : Good morning, everybody. And I guess I have a question that may be that is for both Geoff and Karen. It\u2019s that cash. Maybe talk about your cash generation potential in the year ahead, your thoughts about some of the key drivers there. But may be Geoff, you could expand on your thoughts about the use of cash in the sense that I mean, you all indicated that you\u2019re buying back stock to offset the dilution, you\u2019ve raised the dividend. So that sort of leaves M&A is the year ahead going to be a year of more intense M&A activity, you have so much going on internally. Is this a priority? And maybe any color about how you\u2019re thinking about your priorities as you look ahead? Thank you. Geoffrey Martha : Sure, thanks. Thanks for the question, Rick. In terms of like our priorities, our priorities are investing in growth and today we announced the largest increase in R&D in our history. And it\u2019s because we\u2019re seeing these large market opportunities with clear patient need, where Medtronic has a right to win. And so we\u2019re looking at those holistically, investing organically in R&D, but also other growth investments, like we talked about, ahead of some certain product launches like Guardian and the Robot, so we\u2019re investing in, sales and marketing and other related growth investments. But organics is still - is a priority. We did a number of deals last year, tuck-in deals, and I\u2019d say tuck-ins are still to focus. And those tuck-in deals could be up to several billion dollars. I mean, the ones we did over the last 18 months have been smaller than that. But, I wouldn\u2019t mistake size for impact some of these ones like Medicrea, which is the AI planning tool and outcomes tracking tool and now comes tracking tool for spine is a real nice piece of the puzzle for our spine strategy. And, a couple questions here on the call today about our smart pen, the Companion Medical, so these are impactful deals and we look to continue those. And so it\u2019s still a priority and over and above, over buybacks, and we\u2019ll see how the year plays out. It\u2019s tough to predict right. We\u2019re going to remain disciplined here. But I think the theme you\u2019d walk away with is that we\u2019re committed to investing in growth, both organically, inorganically and doing what it takes to do that, and still deliver on the EPS growth expectations that we set out. And so that\u2019s what the team is focused on, and you\u2019re seeing the benefits of that. Well, Karen, if you want to\u2026? Karen Parkhill : Yes, I would just add, Rick your first question on cash generation in the years ahead. Clearly, we are focused on driving strong conversion of our non-GAAP EPS into cash. And, we\u2019ve said we\u2019ve targeted greater than 80% conversion rate, that doesn\u2019t change. So we remain focused on delivering that. And we also, are growing cash along with earnings and we\u2019re focused on driving continued working capital productivity, in our day sales outstanding, our days payable, our inventory. So you can expect us to continue to have this keen focus on cash flow and driving, strong results from it. Rick Wise : Thank you very much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Rick. Next question please, Francesca? Francesca DeMartino : We\u2019ll take the next question from that Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Matt, please go ahead. Ryan Weispfenning : Matt, are you there? Matthew Miksic : Hi, can you hear me okay? Ryan Weispfenning : Yes, now we can. How are you doing Matt? Matthew Miksic : I\u2019m well, thanks. Thanks so much for taking the question. So, one on your robotic surgery programs, if I could. Your first part, if you could maybe just talk a little bit about, how some of the pandemic conditions around the world are affecting your progress so far? How you\u2019re thinking about fiscal 2022 and some of the range that you\u2019ve put out there in that $50 million to $100 million? And then secondly, there has been this, what feels like a bit of an inflection point in terms of robotic surgery, momentum and placement throughout the back end of last year and the first part of this year, just wondering how, yes, if you could describe your, how you compare the fourth quarter to the third quarter and how the cadence feels in terms of new placements and pull through in your current programs? Geoffrey Martha : Okay, yes, I was goanna ask you to clarify, because when you said robotics, I wasn\u2019t sure. So on the spine side, look, Matt, I know you\u2019ve followed this for years, the strategy of surrounding the spine procedure and preceding the spine procedure, and following up the spine procedure with enabling technology from surgical planning, to navigation, interoperative imaging, the robot, this is paying off. I mean, we had record sales last quarter of our capital equipment tied to spine procedures and continue to outpace the competition on the robotic sales. But more than anything, okay, more important than all of that is the surgeon feedback that we are getting, has hit an inflection point. They are now talking about the outcomes that they\u2019re getting from this. It\u2019s the planning, the precision of the planning to get the right alignment plan in there. And then the accuracy of executing to that plan with Nav and the robot, and then the ability to follow it up and access images in the PAC System through Medicrea to come back and retrain or continue to evolve our algorithms. And also shows surgeons are you really getting that alignment that you thought, this is coming together, and I think we are separating ourselves from the pack and really getting closer to what our ultimate goal here is, is to transform spine surgery from the art that it is today to a science and then demonstrate it with outcomes. So that is something we\u2019re very excited like you mentioned the momentum. The momentum is the lagging, the momentum from the enabling technology, like I said record sales and it\u2019s because the buzz is out there from surgeons starting to talk about the results they\u2019re getting from using this. And people that were sitting on the sidelines are jumping in and the bus is moving or the train has left the station on this one. And the feedback from our field, again a lagging indicator is palpable the energy. So we\u2019re feeling really good about spine and robotics and in the lessons that we\u2019ve learned from spine. We are spending a lot of time our spine team and Brett Wall working with Bob White and Megan Rosengarten on the soft tissue. I think a lot of those lessons learned. I mean the markets aren\u2019t the same, they are different, but there are some lessons learned and there are some synergies there that we will incorporate into our Hugo soft tissue robot launch. Matthew Miksic : Thanks so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Matt. Next question please, Francesca? Francesca DeMartino : We\u2019ll take the next question from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Jason, please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : Good morning. I just wanted to get back, Karen, to the operating margin commentary; it looks like you did just under 24% in fiscal 2021. I think you mentioned you\u2019re expecting a little over 300 bps in fiscal 2022. So is the anticipation that that margin in 2022 is going to be around 27%? Karen Parkhill : Yes. So 27%, 27.5% in that range for the year, but keep in mind that our op margin should improve as we go through the year and so by the end of the year, we expect it to be, above that 28%. Jayson Bedford : Okay, just any commentary on gross margin? Karen Parkhill : Yes, gross margin we also expect sequential improvement, about half a point a sequential improvement in the gross margin through the year. Jayson Bedford : Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Jason. Next question please, Francesca? Francesca DeMartino : We\u2019ll take the next question from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Danielle, please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Geoff, I just wanted to follow up on a comment you made earlier regarding it depends on the business line as to the recovery? Where are the business lines that are lagging? And sort of when are you expecting those business lines to get back to full recovery relative to some that have already gotten there? Thanks so much. Geoffrey Martha : Well, in the, I\u2019d say in the United States, even the ones that are lagging, I would expect them to get back to a full recovery in our fiscal Q1. And the ones that are lagging are more, the more elective areas like ENT, our GI business, our Endovenous business. And it is, all those businesses that I mentioned, we talked in the commentary about ENT and GI gaining share. So it\u2019s not a competitive thing, it really is a COVID issue and in the United States, we expect those to get back in our fiscal Q1. And then, we talked about before, Europe is lagging by few months and emerging markets hard to predict, but it\u2019s it comes down to the elective nature. There\u2019s a spectrum, maybe stroke and on one end, not very elective, at least from my perspective, and on the other end, you have some of these ones I just mentioned, like ENT, GI, Endovenous. I hope that answered your question, Danielle. Ryan Weispfenning : We might have lost her. Thanks, Danielle. We\u2019ll take one more question please, Francesca? Francesca DeMartino : Okay, we\u2019ll take the last question from Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Steve, please go ahead. Steve Lichtman : Thank you. Good morning. Geoff, I was wondering if you could talk about the benefits you\u2019re seeing from the more decentralized operating structure now, now when you\u2019re in, is it delivering what you had hoped? Any comments on the changes you\u2019re seeing on the ground would be helpful? And just to clarify, FY 2022 will be the first year that market share will be included in compensation? Thanks. Geoffrey Martha : Yes, the answer to your last question is, is yes, FY 2022 to be the first year. We need to work on how to measure this over the course of FY 2021 precisely enough to put it in comp. So in terms of the operating model, I\u2019d say look the dust is still settling a bit, but we have definitely past, I\u2019d say the most difficult part and I\u2019m excited about where we\u2019re headed. We\u2019ve got increased role clarity and accountability across the org and this new decentralized model. And people are now looking forward and focused on their key metrics. So like for operating units, it\u2019s this innovation pipeline, it\u2019s their market growth, it\u2019s their market share, as we just talked about, and this market share one is liberating for us, because instead of comparing ourselves to ourselves, we\u2019re comparing ourselves to the market with the clear expectation to grow at or above the market, that clearly clarifies a lot. Four our regions, things like strategic account growth, over and above, what we\u2019re getting, in the traditional Med-Tech model of selling to the specialist position and focused on those patients. But in addition to that, the strategic account growth, for our Executive Committee, right for the people on this call, measurements around capital allocation to the high growth segments, portfolio management, all are now focused to increase our overall company weighted average market growth rate. Right? So and then finally, I\u2019d say there\u2019s lots of excitement, more than I would have thought maybe even about the culture changes. This thing we\u2019re calling the Medtronic mindset that has these, it really works alongside our mission. Medtronic is known for a mission driven company. We always want to be known for that, that\u2019s kind of our ROI if you will. But adding these things like acting boldly, competing to win, move a speeding decisiveness, delivering results the right way, adding these in to the mix alongside our mission has generated a lot of energy, and it\u2019s kind of taken off organically inside the company. And, so, I\u2019d say overall, really happy with where it\u2019s going, and we\u2019re starting to see the results of this. Ryan Weispfenning : Great, thanks Steve. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Geoffrey Martha : Sure, all right. Well, thanks, everybody for the questions. And, we really appreciate your support and your continued interest in Medtronic. And we hope you\u2019ll join us for our Q1 earnings for our webcast which we anticipate holding on August 24, where we\u2019ll update you on our progress. And so with that, again, thanks for tuning in today and please stay healthy and safe and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's fiscal year 2022, First Quarter earnings video webcast. I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. Before we start the prepared remarks, I'm going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer.  Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on July 30th, 2021, and our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, our portfolio Executive VPs will join us and we will take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the Company. Today's event should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.  Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis. First-quarter organic revenue comparisons adjusted only for foreign currency as renewal acquisitions or divestitures made in the last 4 quarters that had a significant impact on total Company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and are made on an as-reported basis. And all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the second calendar quarter of 2021 unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into the studio and get started. Geoffrey Martha : Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. We started off fiscal 2021 with a strong first quarter, beating street estimates on revenue, margins, and EPS. We drove market share gains across a number of our businesses, including 3 of our largest : Cardiac Rhythm, Surgical Innovations, and Spine. Our results reflected the recovery of elective procedures during the quarter, with most of our businesses finishing at or above pre-COVID levels. Now, while the delta variant is having an impact on procedure volumes in certain geographies, we believe the effects will be manageable. Healthcare systems are really just better prepared and vaccination rates continue to increase. Our new operating model and the Medtronic mindset, culture enhancements are delivering results. As our first-quarter performance demonstrates, our employees are energized by the transformation of our organizational structure and the competitive culture. And our most recent employee engagement survey results were the strongest that we've ever had. We continue to focus on accelerating and sustaining the higher top and bottom-line growth of Medtronic. In fact, we've already made a number of disciplined and targeted capital allocation decisions that drive that acceleration. We've increased our investments at the front-end of major product launches and surgical robots and Renal Denervation, which represent large new markets for Medtronic. We're growing our R&D investments broadly across the Company, complementing a long list of organic opportunities with disciplined tuck-in acquisitions, such as our recently announced intent to acquire Intersect ENT. Now we expect these actions to drive share gains in our markets today, Which we've talked a lot about. And to increase our weighted average market growth rate, producing stronger returns for our shareholders. Now, turning to the details of our first-quarter results, we'll start again with a brief look at our market share performance. It's an important metric that our teams are being evaluated against along with revenue growth, profit, and free cash flow. We continue to see a number of our businesses winning share driven by our innovation and increased competitiveness. And it's worth noting that when we talk about our share dynamics, we're referring to revenue share in the calendar quarter Q2. We gained share in our three largest businesses this quarter. Our Cardiac Rhythm Management business continued to perform well above the market, adding over 3 points of share driven by our differentiated Micro family of pacemakers. Cobalt and Chrome high-power devices, and our TYRX Antibacterial Envelope. In Surgical Innovations, we gained a share as our EndoStapling and advanced energy technology continues to be the preferred and trusted instruments used by surgeons all around the world. And in Spine, the ecosystem that we offer of spine implants, biologics, and enabling technologies like the preoperative planning software, robotics, imaging, and navigation resulted in above-market growth from Medtronic. And it's not just our largest businesses that are winning share, we also had share gains in some of our faster-growing businesses like TAVR, Pelvic Health, and Pain stem. As new evidence, technology and sales execution resulted in Medtronic outpacing our competition. In Pain stem, we did observe a gradual slowdown in permanent implants and trialing procedures in the latter parts of our quarter due to the delta variant, and we do expect that this will affect the market during. Q2. That said, we continue to win share and have a lot of momentum in our Intel with DTM technology. And with the launch of The Vanta Recharge-free system, our portfolio is complete, highly competitive, and well-positioned. Now while we are winning share in a number of our businesses, we still have areas where we have work to do. In cardiovascular, we continued to lose share in our cardiac diagnostics business. However, we do expect these trends will reverse over the course of our fiscal year as we ramp up the supply of our link to the insertable cardiac monitoring system. Now we also lost share year-over-year in neurovascular, but we were pleased with our momentum as we ramped our recent product launches. This included our 2 new flow diverters, the Pipeline Flex was shield technology in the U.S. and the Pipeline Vantage in Europe, as well as our Salter X 3-millimeter Stent Retriever. And finally, in diabetes, we continue to execute our turnaround strategy. But as expected, we continued to lose share in the U.S. as we wait for new product approvals. We understand the current challenges we face in diabetes, and we believe our product pipeline and our differentiated technologies will return us to market growth, as these products move through development approval, and ultimately become available to patients. Now speaking of new products, let's now turn to our product pipeline. Today, you are seeing the strong flow of new products launching across our businesses. We've launched over 190 products in the U.S., Western Europe, Japan, and China in just the last 12 months. We also continue to advance the innovation we have in development. We are increasing our R&D spend by more than 10% this fiscal year. This is the biggest dollar increase in R&D spend in our Company's history. The investments we're making in our pipeline will play a key role in accelerating our topline growth. And we're at the front-end of some large opportunities to win share, create new markets, and disrupt existing markets. Starting with one of our largest future growth drivers, Renal Denervation. We're making good progress on our solution to go after this multibillion-dollar hypertension opportunity. We expect that the results of our unmet pivotal trial will be ready for presentation at the TCT Conference in November, assuming the interim look at this based in design study reached statistical significance. The unmet clinical trial represents the final piece of a large body of evidence that we intend to submit to the FDA for approval. The progress in our surgical robotics business has been impressive in recent months. And we have momentum on a number of important milestones and initiatives. But most notable, and something that has energized our entire Company and the robotics team, the first procedures with Hugo were performed at Clinica Santa Maria in Chile by Dr. Ruben Alvarez in June. And as he said, a picture is worth a thousand words. So let's watch this short clip detailing this important milestone. It's truly amazing to see our robotic technology in use. And I want to thank the hundreds of Medtronic employees that have worked tirelessly over many years as well as the surgeon and hospital leaders whose partnership help make Hugo a reality. We look forward to expanding the surgical robotics market by addressing the per procedure cost and utilization barriers that have limited robotic surgery to date. And shortly after the first geological procedures in Chile, we had the first gynecological procedures performed last month at the Pacifica Salute Hospital in Panama. We are receiving positive feedback from early users for our approach to robotic surgery, including our thoughtful design choices. For example, as you can see by this picture, our open console design allows for natural interaction and participation of the entire surgical team. And it's just one of the many important differentiated features of Hugo. Looking ahead, we remain on track for CE Mark approval of Hugo following our submission in late March, and we continue to make progress towards starting our U.S. expand Euro pivotal trial, where the first procedures in the U.S. will occur. Around the globe, a number of hospital systems have expressed interest in our partners and possibility Program, joining a group of pioneering hospitals that will be among the first to use Hugo. In Cardiac Rhythm. We filed for CE Mark for extravascular ICD this quarter. Enrollment is going well in our U.S. pivotal trial. EV ICD represents a disruptive technology in implantable with feasible space as it can pace and shock without leads inside the heart. And it can do all of this in a single device with the same size and longevity as a traditional ICD. In TAVR, we continue to advance our Evolut platform. And I am pleased to share with you the news today that we just received FDA approval last week for our next-generation Evolut Fx TAVR system. Now, this innovative system is designed to improve the overall procedural experience through enhancements and deliverability, implant visibility, and deployment stability. We're planning to start rolling out this next-gen system in the U.S. market later this fall. In neuromodulation, in addition to receiving FDA approval in the quarter for our recharge-free spinal cord stimulator, we also received FDA approval for our SenSight Directional Deep Brain Stimulation lead. Now SenSight combined with our recently approved Percept PC system is the only DBS system on the market that can sense and record brain activity, in addition to providing normal stimulation to treat diseases like Parkinson's and essential tremors. We also remain on track to submit our ECAP Spinal Cord Stimulator to the FDA later this calendar year, which has the potential to be a disruptive technology and Pain Stim. Now moving to our Pelvic Health business. As you know, we don't reveal all of our development programs underway at Medtronic for competitive reasons, but I'm going to unveil a new one today. We've been working in stealth mode on our next-gen InterStim recharge-free device. And earlier this month, we submitted our PMA supplement to the U.S. FDA seeking approval. This device has some very attractive specs. It's designed with a 10-year battery. It's got a constant current and it's full-body MRI compatible at both 1.5 and 3 Tesla. We're expecting approval in the first half of the next calendar year, and we can't wait to have this best-in-class recharge-free device available for patients. In diabetes, the international launch of our MiniMed 780G insulin pump continues to go well. The 780G has the highest reported time and range of any insulin pump. And starting this fall, people with diabetes in many international markets will not only have access to the 780G, but also our no calibration 7-day, Guardian 4 Sensor, and our 7-day extended infusion set. The longest-lasting set on the market. This complete offering will be highly differentiated and ease patient burden and we're working to bring this technology to other markets. In the U.S., the seven AG and guardians for sensors continued to be under active review with the FDA. And we're expecting to submit our next-gen synergy CGM sensor to the FDA in Q3. Synergy is disposable, easier to apply, and half the size of our current sensor. I'll now turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance in our guidance. Karen. Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Geoff. Our first-quarter organic revenue increased 19%. And adjusted EPS increased 127%, significant growth as we anniversary the downturn from the pandemic impact last year. Our end markets are recovering and we continue to launch new technology and gain market share, which is reflected in our growth and profitability. Our adjusted EPS was $0.09 better than consensus with the entire beat coming from higher revenue growth and operating profit. As I noted on our last earnings call, we did not adjust our first-quarter results for the extra week of sales last year given the concurrent reduction of customer purchases, As these 2 items roughly offset each other at the total Company level. That said, not all areas of the Company had large quarter-end customers both purchasing activity, diabetes, for example. As a result, I would point out that our Diabetes growth rate would be roughly 6 points higher in the first quarter, had we adjusted for the extra week. On our cadence of recovery, the monthly improvement trends continued. Average daily sales in June were stronger than in May and July was stronger than June. That said, we did begin to see a slowdown in certain businesses in the last few weeks of July related to the spread of the delta variant in the U.S.. If not for the COVID impact in July, our first-quarter performance would have been even stronger. Turning to our P&L, we saw significant year-over-year improvement in our margins. 670 basis points on gross margin and over 1,000 basis points on operating margin. Our operating margin was better than expected as investments we initiated in the first quarter took longer to ramp, but are expected to pick up starting in the second quarter. Turning to capital allocation, we continue to balance our investment for future growth while returning cash to our shareholders, primarily through our strong and growing dividend. As we've noted for several quarters, we are increasing our level of tuck-in acquisitions. Having announced seven for a total of $2.3 billion since the start of fiscal '21, Less than three weeks ago, we announced our intent to acquire Intersect ENT. Our ENT business has quietly been a strong performer for us, led by a great team with a track record of consistently outperforming the market. With the addition of intersects complementary products, We can accelerate the growth profile of this business for years to come. The deal is accretive to our weighted average market growth rate. Initially neutral, but quickly accretive to earnings and has expected returns well ahead of our cost of capital. Now, turning to our guidance. As you know, it is still early in our fiscal year. We had a strong first quarter. And despite the current impact from COVID, we are optimistic about the outlook for the year. Given how early it is in the year, we are maintaining our revenue guidance for the full year at 9% plus or minus. If recent exchange rates hold, the foreign currency would have a positive impact on full-year revenue of $100 million to $200 million down from the prior 400 million to 500 million I gave last quarter. By segment, we continue to expect cardiovascular and neuroscience to grow 10% to 11%. Medical-Surgical Portfolio to now grow 8% to 9%, and diabetes to be roughly flat, all on an organic basis. On the bottom line, we are raising the lower end of our guidance by our first quarter bit, offset by a lower expected benefit from FX. We now expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.65 to $5.75. An increase from our prior range of 560 to 575. This includes a currency benefit of $0.05 to $0.10 at recent rates, down from the $0.10 to $0.15 benefit we signaled last quarter. Our Second Quarter is likely to reflect the current impacts from COVID, particularly in a handful of businesses in cardiovascular and neuroscience. So we expect organic growth in the quarter of around 4% with a currency tailwind of 0 to $50 million at recent rates. Keep in mind that we are facing a particularly tough comp in our Ventilator business, which peaked in the Second Quarter last year. Ex ventilator sales, we expect organic growth in the quarter, around 6%. By segment, we expect cardiovascular to grow 5% to 6%, neuroscience, 6% to 7%, and both medical-surgical, and diabetes to be flat to up 1%, all on an organic basis. Excluding ventilator sales, medical-surgical is expected to grow 8% to 9%. We expect EPS between $1.28 and $1.30 with a current tailwind of about $0.04 at recent rates. As previously mentioned, we do believe the near-term COVID impact on our business will be relatively less severe than prior waves, given hospital preparedness and increasing vaccination rates around the globe. That said to be conservative, our guidance does not assume that procedures canceled in the near term will be rescheduled. So to the extent, those procedures are simply delayed, that should be an upside. We are confident as ever in the strength of our underlying business, our execution, and the impact of our new products. We saw that in the first quarter. And as we move past the current impact of COVID, we feel really good about the underlying strength for the rest of the year. Before I send it back to Geoff, I'd like to step back and acknowledge how much our employees have accomplished over the last year since the pandemic started. And our results this past quarter reflect that unwavering focus by our global team to drive our business and fulfill our mission. And for that, I'm incredibly proud. Back to you, Geoff. Geoffrey Martha : Okay. Thanks, Karen. Next, I'd like to cover a few ESG related topics. Inclusion, diversity, and equity, as well as product quality. First, inclusion, diversity, and equity something that is personally important to me and important to our success at Medtronic. Now, we best fulfill our mission when we have a workplace for ID&E for all of our employees is championed. While we know there's much more to be done, we've made a lot of progress here, and this is being recognized by others. I mentioned our Diversity Inc. award last quarter, and we were recently recognized by several other organizations for the innovative and inclusive work environment. We were named as one of Fast Company's best workplaces for innovators in 2021. As the best place to work for disability inclusion by the Disability Equality Index, and we were one of the 15 Companies awarded the secretary of defense Freedom Award, for our efforts to support our military and veteran employees. Next, I wanna emphasize our continued focus on product quality. Striving without reserve for the greatest possible reliability and quality in our products is a key tenant of the Medtronic Mission and core to our commitment to improving the outcomes for patients. In fact, there is nothing more important than patient safety. In Q1, we made the decision to stop HVAD sales. We did this because of a growing body of clinical comparisons indicating that our device had a higher frequency of adverse events than a competitor's product. This decision was consistent with our commitment to patient safety. Importantly, we remain committed to supporting current HVAD patients, their caregivers, and healthcare professionals. At Medtronic, we have a purpose deeply rooted in our mission. And our employees translate this mission into tangible, day-to-day actions, which in turn create an impact in our society. When I reflect on product quality in IDE, we've made progress, but there's always room for improvement. One step is ensuring that we have the right incentives in place to drive the actions that will elevate our impact. Our board and executive leadership have been evaluating our annual incentive plans. And as a result of this, we're planning to further strengthen our existing quality metrics, and we intend to introduce new IDE metrics into our incentive plans. These will help guide our plans and drive our work on a daily basis and ultimately hold us accountable to translate our actions into even greater impact. For those of you that would like to learn more about our ESG efforts underway at Medtronic, I encourage you to save the date to virtually attend our first-ever ESG Investor and Analyst Event, which we're planning to broadcast on Wednesday, October 13. You're going to hear from leaders from across Medtronic covering important topics including inclusion, diversity, and equity, and product quality and safety. And I'll close by noting that we are on track to accelerate our revenue growth. We're executing on our pipeline. And we're winning share in the marketplace with our leading technology. And we have some really big opportunities ahead of us with near-term milestones in both renewed innovation and surgical robotics businesses. And the energy across the organization is palpable as we operate under a new model and instill our new cultural traits, including acting boldly, competing to win, moving with speed and decisiveness in everything that we do, and getting results and getting them the right way. And to our employees, many of whom I'm sure are watching today, thank you. I truly appreciate your efforts to deliver these results. Look, these are exciting times and I'm really looking forward to all that we're going to accomplish over the coming months. Momentum is building and we're creating value and there is a lot more to come. With that now let's move to Q&A. Now we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to just one question. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the investor relations team after the call. With that, Francesca, can you please give the instructions for asking a question? A - Francesca DeMartino : [Operator Instructions]. Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff Martha and Karen Parkhill are joined by Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio and the Diabetes Operating Unit, Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical-Surgical portfolio, and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the neuroscience portfolio. We will pause for a minute to assemble the queue. We'll take the first question from Bob Hopkins from BofA Global Research. Bob, please go ahead. Bob Hopkins : Okay. Thank you and thanks for taking the question. Just as a technology check here, can you hear me okay? Geoffrey Martha : Yeah, sure, we can hear you. We can hear you just fine, Bob. Bob Hopkins : Excellent. Thanks, Geoff, and congrats on a good start to your fiscal year. I guess since we're limiting it to one question, I'll ask something a little bit more short-term-oriented. And that is that you guys mentioned that at the end of July you started to see a little bit of a slowdown, I'm just curious, is that slowdown stabilized at this point, or are things still getting worse? And if you could give us a sense of what you're seeing geographically, especially in China, that would be appreciated too. So just want to get a sense of where the things have stabilized relative to what you saw start to happen at the end of July. Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Hi, Bob. It's Karen and thanks for the question. So the slowdown that we started to see the last couple of weeks in July has continued into August. And we do expect the delta variant to impact us, particularly in the U.S. or this quarter. And particularly in certain of our businesses in cardiovascular and neuroscience, really those businesses that are impacted by deferrable procedures like in cardiac diagnostics, ICDs, pain stems, Spine, and also in those businesses that require ICU bed capacity for the procedure, like in TAVR. That said we expect this delta variant to -- to infection rates to peak probably in late August to early September and hospital and ICU capacity to improve a few weeks after that. And so by the time we exit our Second Quarter, we expect procedures to be back to more normal, but we've reflected all of this in our guidance for the Second Quarter. And we're really bullish about the underlying strength of our business, not just in the Second Quarter, but -- but in the back half and the full year ahead. Bob Hopkins : In China? Geoffrey Martha : You asked about China. Look, Bob, we're seeing alluded impact so far in China, much less so than in the prior waves. I mean, they're pretty aggressive, when they see a COVID case, they can isolate that geographic area and they do reduce mobility via consumer mobility if you will, but they've kept the hospitals open. And I think they handled it pretty well. So we've seen limited impact so far in China. Bob Hopkins : Great. Thank you. Sean Salmon : Thanks, Bob. Next question, please, Francesca. Francesca DeMartino : We'll take the next question from Robbie Marcus, from JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats had a good quarter. Maybe just a follow-up on the last question, a little bit here. Karen, I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but I just want to make sure the [Indiscernible] appropriately factoring in your comments. We're a little shy of 8.2 billion in sales for consensus and $1.35 for fiscal Q2. Maybe just help us gauge if that's an appropriate place to be giving your comments on the COVID impact and any other cadence through the rest of the year, you will be willing to point us to. Thanks a lot. Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Robbie. So for the Second Quarter with The impact of the delta variant, we're expecting growth of around 4%, as we mentioned. That includes what we estimate to be about 150 basis points impact from COVID, so -- so stronger underlying growth outside of COVID. And I would also remind you that we've got ventilators coming down off of our peak in the Second Quarter last year. That's another about 200 basis points headwind. And then with our decision to no longer sell on distributing LVADs in our MCS business. That's another about 50 basis points headwind. So the true underlying strength when you take out COVID or the impact of events And MCS is around 8% for the quarter. In terms of EPS, we're guiding for the quarter $1.28 to $1.30, which includes a currency tailwind of about $0.04. And if we think about the rest of the year, we'll give Q3 guidance on our Q2 earnings call. But I would keep in mind that you can expect our investment to step up over the next coming quarters, really as we progress towards these important new product launches. Hopefully, that's helpful. Robert Marcus : Yeah. Thanks, Karen. Sean Salmon : Thanks, Robbie, next question, please, Francesca. Francesca DeMartino : We'll take the next question from Matt Taylor from UBS Equities. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Taylor : Hi. Good morning and a good start to the year. Can you hear me okay? Geoffrey Martha : Sure. Matt. Yeah, we can. Matt Taylor : Okay. I just wanted to ask you for some more color on the progression through the quarter. And the reason for the question in that way, is I want to understand how things were coming back as a proxy for how they could come back again after the delta variant passes. So can you give us any color on how strong things got in July before you saw the impact or help us understand what the impact was in the second half of July? Geoffrey Martha : We were working through the prior waves of backlog fairly quickly and we continue to see improvement from our last earnings call. we had -- May was better than April. June is better than May. July is better than June. And it wasn't until the last few weeks of the month that we started to see the pullback. And again, it was -- it's isolated to where we're feeling is more in developed countries, the U.S. being a big one, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and -- and just use U.S. example. It's really limited to the areas geographically in the U.S. where you have lower vaccination rates. It's that simple. And where you have higher vaccination rates, we're not seeing it. The other thing that is -- if you look at a Venn diagram of the concentric circle it's those geographies and then the procedures that we're seeing are just like we saw in the first wave. The ones that slowed down first as either the more highly electable ones like pain stim or Spine or ICDs, or in our world cardiac diagnostics, those are more elective, I would say or and I would say is procedures that require an ICU stay like a TAVR procedure. So those are the ones that we're seeing it, the pullback. And it's in the regions of the U.S. to use that example, where vaccination rates are lower. And again, hospitals are better equipped. Karen already went through, we think this is going to be peak here at the end of August that the kind of the hospitals, the infection rates if you will, hospitalization rates will trail that by a couple of weeks. We do think this is shorter-lived and easier managed than the prior waves. So I mean that's been the progression, so it hasn't quite peaked yet. And like I said, we didn't start seeing, I would say, the pullback till the last few weeks in July. And at that point, we were pretty much back to either 100%, in some cases over 100% of pre-COVID levels in our therapies. Matt Taylor : Thanks for the call, I'll leave it there. Thank you. Geoffrey Martha : Thanks, Matt. Ryan Weispfenning : Francesca, next question, please. Francesca DeMartino : We'll take the next question from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo Securities. Larry, please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. For Sean, this quarter, I probably got more questions on Renal Denervation than anything else related to Medtronic. So I guess my question is, Sean when will you know the interim look is positive? What's your confidence that it'll be positive and if it doesn't end on this interim alone, in this interim look, when will the trial end? And any read-through from that trio trial, which was another unmet trial that showed about a 4 -- 4.5-millimeter mercury difference on ambulatory systolic blood pressure. Thanks for taking the question, Sean. Geoffrey Martha : Hey Sean, you're on mute. Sean Salmon : You hear me now? Geoffrey Martha : Yeah, we can. You're going strong, but no one could hear you. Sean Salmon : I understand. We don't really -- we have no information. Geoffrey Martha : We lost Sean again. This is our fifth earnings call, this is our first technical glitch, so I was feeling pretty good. I'll see if we can get back Sean. There you go. Well, while he's trying to get back on it. Look, he was starting to say there, we really haven't gotten new information since the last call we had with you. We do anticipate because of the Bayesian trial design and how it's set up that we'll get it. We know we get another interim look here in the fall. And there's the reason for optimism here because part of the denominator going into the trial was the feasibility work that we did and we know what those numbers look like. And it is part of a -- look is -- we still have existing registries out there. And the body of evidence just continues to build even outside through our registries and other activities going on that leads us to believe that it's positive. But look, this is why we do these trials. And then the next look that's the question, Sean, I don't know if you're back on Sean, but if this interim look doesn't -- doesn't get to where we need to get to what's the next interim look after the fall here? Sean Salmon : Can you hear me now? Am I back? Geoffrey Martha : Yeah. Yeah. Sean Salmon : It really is dependent on the between-group difference and standard deviation. So we don't have fix date, it will be this time, and that time, it gets there when it gets there. If it puts your mind at ease and all, we had the same situation around with the SURTAVI trial, and remember that. That was also based on design. It didn't reach its statistical significance on its first interim look, but it did on the second one. And of course, 2-year results were almost identical to that when they finally hold out. So it will just push down, there's still are 3 looks at this but as just said, we're confident we're gonna get there for everything. But we don't know anything, so until -- until the Events Committee lets us know that we're good to present. So that's our plan, we're going about and we'll go from there. The retro Trio, look, it's good for leverage-positive share and controlled study, and I don't think that patient population for our regiments is so comparable necessarily. So it really isn't a return. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thanks, Sean. Ryan Weispfenning : Hey, thanks, Larry. Let's take the next question, please. Francesca. Francesca DeMartino : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. VJ Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Not based on our solid start to the year. Geoff neither one on the product side, can you remind us of the U.S. timelines for approvals on Hugo, SICD, and diabetes. And I'm curious now that you're placing Hugo, what has been the early learning so far? Has it been in line with expectations, or perhaps surprised you to the positive there? Geoffrey Martha : Sure. I'll let just secure Bob on some of the more specifics of Hugo and Sean on the cardiovascular timing there. But I'll just say look, you saw the video and we were just out. The surgeon's feedback has been great. Very excited and look as I talked to the other health systems around the world, there's definitely an appetite. They want us to win here. So that's a positive sentiment. The demand is high, surgeon feedback initially is strong and we just had our whole leadership team at one of our operational centers here for the robotics business. They have a couple of R&D centers around the world and a large operational center in Connecticut. Our whole XCOM was there and they just made so much progress. And we're feeling pretty good right now, but I'll let Bob give you more of the specifics. Bob White : Thanks, Geoff and VJ, thanks for the question. We are -- with the first case is behind us really energized by the possibility that Hugo is going to bring to us, and let's just say that the surgeon and your staff who've experienced Hugo has been super positive, and what they've loved most VJ is really the quarter, what's to our system design, the modularity, the open council, the 3D visualization, the flexibility of the platform and they are really starting to think about ways that they're going to be able to apply the technology to expand robotic-assisted surgery. And the other thing, VJ I'll share with you touched surgery enterprise. You'll recall our acquisition of digital surgery a couple of years ago, has been used in all the Hugo cases and the surgeons are really impressed by the analytical capabilities, the benefit to the video stores capabilities, case sharing, and the likes so really excited on the feedback. And then, the first part of your question with respect to U.S. commercial problems really going to depend on the time to complete the clinical trial and the FDA review. And as Geoff mentioned, as he kicked off the session today, we're making really good progress on our EXPAND Uro trial. We're gaining ethics committee approval working through the IRB, conducting site training, getting clinical study, site activation, and for competitive reasons, I'm not going to go through all the sites. But we're really excited to treat our first patient in the U.S. So we're feeling good and look, we're on the path to building a multi-billion dollar surgical robotics business, Vijay. So Geoff, back to you. Geoffrey Martha : Thanks. I think Vijay had a question on the ICD, Sean. I think it was the timing of the approval there, I believe Vijay? Sean Salmon : So Vijay, we [Indiscernible] mark this quarter, the [Indiscernible] for the U.S. approval is currently enrolling. We think that we should see the mark sometime in the first half of calendar year '22, and it will be approximately a year later. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Vijay. Let's go to the next question, please, Francesca. Francesca DeMartino : Okay the next question comes from Travis Steed from Barclays. Travis, please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hi. Good morning and congrats on a good start to the year. I did have another question on the Renal Denervation and -- and thinking about the adoption curve if the data -- look something like the pulse study is what's the process to get payors onboard? How do -- how do you build the referral channel and how quickly could -- could revenue ramp and if you think about the MCIT, the -- the delay there, do you actually need that to get to that $1 billion RDN market size in 2026? Geoffrey Martha : Yes, sure I know. Sean, speak up. Sean Salmon : Sure, Thanks, Geoff. Thanks for the question. You're right that reimbursement is the most important thing we have to get right in a few things. We have already set approvals in CE Mark countries right now and we have now the European society of cardiology is of high potential, put out a statement in July, recommending already in this part of the treatment paradigm, that kind of things as guidelines, recommendations, society recommendations important for payer sneaker considerations. In the U.S. your right will be the best way to get the coverage approved. That has been delayed by the change in administration that's under review right now. Or if I'm really would be whether or not [Indiscernible] gives you the coverage that we just go the same way we do it then maybe other therapy we are building it pair by pair [Indiscernible] geography including the U.S.. You having [Indiscernible] the payment and coating and next steps. So there's a good proportion of the patients that are going to be commercial insurance anyway. And we've been doing that work and it was part of the reason why we bought out their clinical trials trial strategy the way we did, showing patients on medications. So, it is going to be in the commercial world, payer by payer and it's going to be for Medicare. Will get [Indiscernible] rolling. We'll have covered, by the way, we work those payment coating there. But it's hard to handicap how fast the ramp goes because we don't have clarity on that last point. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay, thank you, Travis. Let's Go to the next question, please, Francesca. Francesca DeMartino : We'll take the next question from Josh Jennings from Cowen and Company. Josh, please go ahead. Josh Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a question for Sean on the TAVR franchise and just interested to hear, sorry multipart question, but interested to hear about how the marketing efforts and the -- the data that's coming out on patient -- precedent patient mismatch because where we are like technique, bringing the pacemaker rate down, then we launching that book on FX here in the U.S., expectations for -- for shared gains in the U.S. and then maybe any updates on the timing of low-risk reimbursement in Japan and any high level of views on Medtronic's for us in China getting a share on market size and just timelines there for Medtronic's TAVR franchise. Thanks for taking the question. Sean Salmon : Yes. Sure. So we have picked up share in the U.S. as well as in Europe recently. And I think that customer overlap, lowering the pacemaker rate, and increase the predictability of procedures have been barely really helpful. In Europe, we've launched the PRO+ just recently. We got also approval, as you know, in Japan for the low-risk indication. Typically, it's about a quarter before our reimbursement gets in line with that. And then, of course, China is an opportunity for us. We've been working on local clinical strategy there, and we have good progress going. There's a lot of -- more solution. Now for -- China is a little bit of a nascent market yet for converts, it's still under a good growth curve but it's restricted to just a few centers within a very big city at this point in time. I will really be -- -- the penetration into low risk everywhere, typically nine states continue to be the biggest growth driver. And of course, as we expanded to Asia, Matt pace in future analysis going, everything's looking pretty in Southern but for the COVID challenges are -- that happened because of the concentrated nature of our business in a short line, Feeling really good about where we are pipeline, FX is been -- really big improvement in the predictability of we do. That's one of the biggest [Indiscernible] for people to learn, that come up on expandable, that stability implant, and market bounds lines, it's exactly where's it's being placed [Indiscernible] to the new implant, a technique to spend really a home run for us. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Josh. Next, let's go to the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Anthony, please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : Great, thanks. 2 quick points here. Just on the commentary on this procedure volumes, tracking either at 100% or slightly above certain in categories until they get expectedly bring through there at the midpoint in August that were once again at some discount to 100%, if so where is that settling, And then just on diabetes a few quick follow-ups to Vijay. 780G launch in Europe, is that still on track second half? And then the 780G clearance as well as ICGM designation for standalone sensors. Is that still expected in the second half? Thanks. Geoffrey Martha : I'll let Sean answer the diabetes questions, but on the procedure volumes, as we said, we believe the cases, if you will, COVID cases peak sometime at the end of August, early September, and then hospitalizations lag that by a few weeks. So that would peak in mid-September. And then we would make up those cases hopefully over the course of the year, but we would go -- start getting back to those pre-COVID levels. I hope to point out that our guidance does not assume that we make up these cases, but that is a possibility here given -- how quickly we recovered the cases during the other prior waves that were much worse than we anticipate the delta variant being. But that's on the procedure volumes. Diabetes, you mentioned 70 G and Europe, which is already approved so I don't know if you meant to say the U.S. but in Europe, the 780G is on the market and doing really well. And that's -- we're optimistic because we're seeing the performance in Europe in the best time and range of any comp, and the user feedback and the physician feedback have been off the charts positive. So excited about that, but you had a few other questions there about ICGM and maybe I'm assuming maybe your question was 780G in the U.S. though, maybe Sean (ph), you want to take those? Sean Salmon : Thanks, Geoff (ph). The combination of seven 780G with sense as a required confirmation or non - adjunctive has been filed with the U.S., and we're seeing really good interactive back-and-forth reduced sense. That's really good, but that's Europe launch right in the second quarter where you have no fingersticks sensor mix and where infusion set and 780G, that's really a nice combination. Of course, we love to bring that to the U.S. as soon as possible. But things are on track as far as we can tell. As you may know in that division FDA has been very busy with COVID, so it's hard to handicap exactly when timelines happen. But we do think [Indiscernible] making good progress in [Indiscernible] Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Anthony. Let's go next to Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Miksic : Hi, thanks so much. So just a follow-up on some of the comments you made on sort of the COVID pressure in the U.S. and elsewhere if you could maybe give some additional color around what the strengths and weaknesses look like regionally, whether you're seeing so far any indication I know bed availability and capacity is one element, and of course, patient sentiments, willingness to get cases done is another. So wondering if you're seeing anything, so there appreciate the additional color. Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Matt for the question. So in terms of regionally, the impact that we're seeing is mostly in the U.S. and we've talked about that. We do have Japan and certain countries in Asia-Pacific like Australia, New Zealand, and Vietnam being impacted because lockdowns are still in place there. In Europe, we're seeing the impact in the UK. And in Latin America, we're not seeing a big impact on the Delta variant at this point. So hopefully that's helpful. In terms of patient sentiment and the impact around capacity availability, we do expect this impact to be short-lived. And really it's because hospitals are better equipped as Geoff talked about, vaccination rates are increasing around the world. And the patient sentiment is understanding that we need to have life go on with the COVID variant. And so we're seeing that. And so we do expect a recovery here to be faster, certainly than it was in the first wave and even in the second wave. Geoffrey Martha : On patient sentiment, I would say it's much better than it was a year ago. There were a lot of unknowns. There was no vaccination. I think you're seeing a lot of people that have a concern have gotten vaccinated and there are others that have not that have a different viewpoint on the virus. And but all-in-all, patient sentiments are in a much better spot. And as Karen pointed out, hospitals are much better equipped. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thanks, Matt. Francesca, let's take the next question, please. Francesca DeMartino : We'll take the next question from Jayson Bedford, from Raymond James. Jason, please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : Good morning. The question perhaps for -- for Karen on our margin. Are you still expecting a 400 million negative -- $400 million negative impacts to our margin for the year of the investments in Hugo and RDN? How much of that was realized in 1Q and then just on 2Q, up margin looks like it's in that 25.5-- 26.5 to 27% range, is that fair? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Thanks for the question, Jason. We are still expecting strong investment against those already in and the robot. And yes, a $409 million impact to the operating margin for the year from those two very important programs which represent what we believe to be the largest opportunity in Med-Tech. In terms of how much that hit in the first quarter, we expected some ramps and those investments plus others in the first quarter.  And we didn't see all of those ramps in the first quarter, so we're expecting more in the second quarter just because of the fact that we're hiring lots of people and it takes a little bit of time. So we are expecting that ramp in the second quarter and in the third quarter beyond that. What I would say on operating margins for the second quarter is that we'll still expect a few 100 points basis points improvements in operating margin for the second quarter. So despite all of that investment, we still expect very strong year-over-year improvement. Okay. Thanks, Jason (ph). We have time for one more question. Can we take that, please, Francesca? Francesca DeMartino : We'll take that final question from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Danielle, please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you, everyone, so much for squeezing me in, and congrats on the start to the fiscal year. Just a question on M&A strategy. Congrats on the interest FX deal, this makes a tonne of strategic sense. I guess just at a high level of is that how we should be thinking about the approach to M&A going forward. More on this sort of if you could comment on where -- now that intersects are in the fold, where else we should be thinking about Medtronic looking to fill gaps. Thank you so much. Geoffrey Martha : Thanks for the comments and the question Danielle (ph). The tuck-in strategy is definitely the one that we're focused on. And it's been consistent with what we've been doing over the last couple of quarters. I think we've done 7 deals over the last 1.5 years or so for about $2.3 billion. This one is roughly a billion dollars, this is the kind of deal I would expect from us. This one happens to be earnings neutral in the first 12 months and accretive thereafter. It's accretive to our average market growth rate at the segment with any ENTs growing in the mid-teens. And the returns are strong. Well, well above our weighted average cost of capital. These are the kind of deals we -- that we would like to see. They are in areas that we're strong. So the -- ENT is one of our stronger businesses, Karen pointed out in her opening remarks. In terms of where to look beyond, I mean that's tough to forecast, I'd say this we're -- we are looking it at all of our different operating units and the different segments that they serve. We spent a lot of time and resources looking at different opportunities and engaging different companies. Yes, we've got opportunities across the portfolio and it's difficult to predict where the next one, next one will be, but it will -- we're still very focused on this tuck-in strategy. And I'd like to say that we're not buying growth here. We're growing what we buy, we buy these earlier stage companies. And there tends to be a lot of synergies that drive, that drive growth, whether it be technical or clinical, or a big one would be commercial, especially outside the U.S. since a lot of these companies tend to be U.S. based, these startups. That's how I'd answer that, and hopefully, we can continue to keep this going because it does add to our weighted average market growth rate Ryan Weispfenning : Okay, thanks, Danielle. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Geoffrey Martha : Okay. I will. And thanks to everybody for the questions and we definitely appreciate your support and your continued interest in Medtronic. And look, I hope you all join us for our Q2 earnings webcast, which we anticipate holding on November 23rd, where we will update you on our continued progress here. So with that, thanks for watching today. Hope you enjoyed it, the drumline is back. Please stay healthy and safe. And have a great rest of your day. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's Fiscal Year 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Video Webcast. I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations.  Before we start the prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our second quarter, which ended on October 29, 2021, and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, our portfolio executive VPs will join us and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's event should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis. Second quarter organic revenue comparisons adjust only for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last 4 quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the first quarter of fiscal '22, and are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter of 2021 compared to the third calendar quarter of 2020, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.  And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into the studio and get started. Geoffrey Martha : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported Q2 results, which despite a challenging market backdrop, reflects solid execution around new product launches and strong underlying earnings growth. Obviously, our end markets were impacted by the COVID-19 resurgence and the health care system staffing shortages particularly in the U.S., which affected our quarterly revenue growth. Procedure volumes were lighter than expected in markets where our technology is used in more deferrable procedures like our Spine business or those that require ICU bed capacity like TAVR. Yet in markets where procedures are less deferrable, like pacing, we experienced stronger growth. While the U.S. market was a headwind, many of our international markets were much stronger. We delivered 6% revenue growth outside the U.S., including mid-teens growth in emerging markets. And our emerging market growth is up 9% versus pre-pandemic levels in Q2 fiscal '20. In the midst of these market headwinds, we focused on managing what was in our control and executed to advance our pipeline, launch new products and win share. And when you look at our sequential revenue performance, our 2% decline was slightly better than most of our large cap med tech competitors. While the pace of the recovery from pandemic headwinds is hard to predict, our markets will recover. And as that happens, Medtronic is one of the best positioned companies in health care. The underlying health of our business is strong, and it's getting stronger. We have an expansive pipeline of leading technology, a robust balance sheet and an expanding roster of proven top talent. Coupled with our revitalized operating model and new competitive mindset, we remain poised to accelerate and sustain growth. As I've done in prior quarters, let's start with a look at our market share performance. Year-over-year market share is an important metric that our teams are evaluated against in their annual incentive plans, along with revenue growth, profit and free cash flow. And right now, the majority of our businesses are winning share, driven by our innovation and increased competitiveness. And this is exactly the sort of market share performance that gives us confidence in the deep strength of our businesses. And to avoid any confusion about how we're performing, when we talk about our share dynamics, we'll refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter to keep it directly comparable to our competition. Share momentum in our 3 largest businesses continued. In the Cardiac Rhythm Management business, we extended category leadership, adding over 1 point of share year-over-year, driven by our differentiated Micra family of pacemakers, Cobalt and Crome high-power devices and our TYRX antibacterial envelopes. In Surgical Innovations, we outperformed competition with strong performances in endo stapling and sutures. And our Signia powered stapling system and Tri-Staple technology continues to see great market adoption. In Cranial & Spinal Technologies, we're winning share and launching new spine implants that enhance the overall value of our ecosystem of preoperative planning software, imaging, navigation and robotic systems and powered surgical instruments, which is transforming care in spine surgery. Our new implants also go directly at the competition, starting this past quarter with our Catalyft expandable interbodies to specifically attract Globus users. In addition to our 3 largest, a broad array of our other businesses have increased their competitiveness, are launching new products and winning share in their end markets. So for example, in Patient Monitoring, we're winning share with our Nellcor pulse oximetry sensors and our monitors. In Respiratory Interventions, we picked up 4 points of share in premium ventilation due to our ability to respond quickly to spikes in demand from COVID resurgence. And in Neuromodulation, we won share across our product lines, including Pain Stim and DBS as we continue to launch new products. In Pain Stim, despite the sequential slowdown in the market, we're gaining share with our Intellis with DTM technology and our Vanta recharge-free system. In DBS, we had a very strong quarter, winning over 6 points of share. We're executing on the launch of our Percept neurostimulator with BrainSense technology paired with our SenSight directional lead, and we continue to be the only company with sensing capabilities. Since launching SenSight in the U.S. earlier this fiscal year, we surged ahead of the competition in new implant share. Sensing has redefined what it takes to compete in DBS. Our competitors don't have it. And as a result, we're expecting a long runway of share gains as we build upon our category leadership. Now, while the majority of our businesses are winning share, we do have a few businesses that are flat or losing share, and we're focusing our efforts and our investments to grow above the market. In Cardiac Diagnostics, we're focused on improving supply to reverse share declines, and we're investing in new indications and novel AI detection algorithms to expand the market and drive growth. In Cardiac Ablation Solutions, we expect to win share as we expand the rollout of our DiamondTemp RF Ablation System and drive awareness and adoption of our Arctic Front Advance Pro cryoablation as a first-line treatment for paroxysmal AF. In Diabetes, while we lost share again this quarter, we remain pleased with the momentum we're building outside the U.S., not only with the 780G insulin pumps, but also with the positive customer feedback we've heard on our extended infusion set and fingerstick-free Guardian Sensor 4. And we expect our U.S. results to turn around as we launch these new products. Next, let's turn to our product pipeline. I've already talked about the impact our strong flow of new products is having in the market. We've launched over 180 products in the U.S., Western Europe, Japan and China in the last 12 months. At the same time, we continue to advance new technologies that are in development. We're heavily investing in this pipeline with a targeted R&D spend of over $2.7 billion this fiscal year, which is an increase of over 10%, the largest dollar increase in our history. We're expecting these investments to create new markets, disrupt existing ones and accelerate the growth profile of Medtronic.  Let's start with our Simplicity renal denervation procedure for hypertension. While we weren't able to end our ON MED study early, we remain confident in our program and our ability to serve the millions of patients who make up this multibillion-dollar opportunity. As a reminder, our previous 3 sham-controlled Simplicity studies all reached statistical significance, including the pivotal OFF MED study. And the ON MED study remains powered to detect a statistically significant and clinically relevant benefit at the final analysis. We expect that ON MED follow-up will complete in the second half of next calendar year, and then we'll submit the PMA to the U.S. FDA for approval. When we think about renal denervation, let's start with the patients who have indicated that they want options, like the Simplicity blood pressure lowering procedure to treat their hypertension as confirmed by our patient preference study presented earlier this month at TCT. We believe demand will be high, and we continue to expect this to be a massive opportunity that we will lead.  Another opportunity for Medtronic is surgical robotics, where we are entering the soft tissue robotics market as a second meaningful player. We achieved a major milestone when we received CE Mark for Hugo last month. And we also completed our first procedures with Hugo in our Asia Pacific region at Apollo Hospitals in India. The first surgeons to use Hugo in the clinical setting have told us they believe Hugo addresses the cost and utilization barriers that have held back the growth of robotic surgery. Look, demand is high, and we're building a long list of hospitals that want to join our Partners in Possibility Program and be among the first in the world to use Hugo and participate in our global registry, which will collect clinical data to support regulatory submissions around the world. Our robotic program is making progress toward a broader launch, and we remain well positioned in this critical field relative to every other potential new entrant. As we prepare for this broader launch, we're working hard to ensure an outstanding customer experience. We're also focused on optimizing our supply chain, manufacturing and logistics to prepare for scaling this business. We're making steady progress on these activities, but not at the pace that we'd originally planned. And as a result, sales this fiscal year are likely to come in below our $50 million to $100 million target. Now that said, we still expect double-digit millions in sales this fiscal year, and we continue to expect a strong ramp in FY '23. We're off schedule, but we're not off track. And while we're disappointed in the revenue push-out for this important program, we're confident that we have line of sight to the solutions we need to be successful and to optimize the customer experience. Demand remains high. Surgeons continue to do cases. Our order pipeline continues to build, and we're looking forward to starting our U.S. IDE soon. We remain confident in the success of this program, and we believe that we're poised to meaningfully expand the soft tissue robotic market and drive growth for years to come. In Cardiac Rhythm, we just launched our Micra AV leadless pacemaker in Japan earlier this month. We also completed the U.S. pivotal study enrollment for our EV ICD, which follows our CE Mark submission in Q1. Just as we disrupted the pacing market with Micra, we intend to do the same in the implantable defibrillator space with our EV ICD. Our device can both pace and shock without any leads inside the heart and veins, and it does this in a single device that is the same size as a traditional ICD. In structural heart, we're starting the limited U.S. launch of our next-gen TAVR system, the Evolut FX this month, with a full market launch planned for fiscal Q4. Evolut FX enhances ease of use with improvements in deliverability, implant visibility and deployment stability. We're also making progress on our transcatheter mitral program. At TCT earlier this month, we presented very encouraging early data of our transfemoral delivery system for our Intrepid mitral valve, and we will be rolling that system into our APOLLO pivotal trial. In Diabetes, our MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with our Guardian 4 sensor continue to be under active review with the FDA. When approved and launched in the U.S., we expect the 780G system to drive growth as it will be highly differentiated and further address the burden of daily diabetes management, and for the first time ever is helping hard to manage pediatric and adolescent patients achieve outcomes mirroring well-controlled adults. The user experience has also improved markedly, and these outstanding results were achieved with our 780G paired with our Guardian 3 sensor, so we expect the experience will be even stronger with Guardian 4. And the value of our offering will be further enhanced when we bring our synergy sensor, which is now called Simplera to market. Simplera is disposable. It's easier to apply and half the size of Guardian 4, and we expect to submit it to FDA later this fiscal year.  In Pelvic Health, we're awaiting FDA approval for our next-gen InterStim recharge-free device, which we expect in the first half of next calendar year with its best-in-class battery, constant current and full-body MRI compatibility at both 1.5 and 3 Tesla, we expect this device will extend our category leadership in this space. In Neuromodulation, we recently submitted our ECAPs closed-loop spinal cord stimulator to the FDA. We're calling this device Inceptiv SCS, and we expect it to revolutionize SCS with closed-loop therapy to optimize pain relief for patients. We also continue to make progress on expanding indications for SCS into nonsurgical refractory back pain, painful diabetic neuropathy and upper limb and neck chronic pain. Finally, in DBS, we continue to enroll patients in our ADAPT-PD trial studying our closed-loop adaptive DBS therapy in patients with Parkinson's. We're expecting enrollment in the trial to complete later this fiscal year.  Now before I turn it over to Karen, the one thing I most want to emphasize is that despite the ups and downs of the pandemic and its collateral impacts on hospital procedures, nursing and staffing shortages and the supply chain, our underlying business remains strong. Medtronic is advancing a pipeline of meaningful innovation that we believe will not only enhance our competitiveness, but will accelerate our total company growth going forward.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and our guidance. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Geoff. Our second quarter organic revenue increased 2%, reflecting the market impact of COVID and health system staffing shortages on procedure volumes, primarily in the United States. Despite the softer end markets, our team executed to deliver strong margin improvement and earnings growth. In fact, our adjusted EPS increased 29%, significant growth reflecting the pandemic impact last year. And our adjusted EPS was $0.03 better than consensus with $0.02 from stronger operating profit and $0.01 from a lower-than-expected tax rate. Our second quarter revenue growth came in lower than we were expecting back in August. We did see improving trends in our average daily sales each month of the quarter as COVID hospitalizations declined. That said, the bounce back in the U.S. wasn't as fast as we had expected or had seen in prior waves. We recognize many of our customers are dealing with staffing shortages on top of increased COVID patients, and we believe that had an increasing effect on procedure volume. Looking down our P&L, we had strong year-over-year improvement in our margins. 360 basis points on gross margin as we continue to recover from the significant impacts from COVID last year, and 470 basis points on operating margin, given savings from our simplification program tied to our operating model. Converting our earnings into strong free cash flow continues to be a priority. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $2.4 billion, up 58% from last year, and we continue to target a full year conversion of 80% or greater. Turning to capital allocation. We continue to allocate significant capital to organic R&D, and we continue to seek attractive tuck-in acquisitions to enhance our businesses. For example, Intersect ENT, we announced our intent to acquire back in August. Intersect's assets complement our own and are accretive to our WAMGR. Plus, we believe we can accelerate their growth around the globe. We're also returning capital back to our shareholders with a commitment to return greater than 50% of our free cash flow primarily through our dividend. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve paid $1.7 billion in dividends. And as a dividend aristocrat, our attractive and growing dividend is an important component of our total shareholder return. Looking ahead, although the environment remains fluid, we are seeing some improvement in procedures and our average daily sales in the first few weeks of November. So we're encouraged that the negative impact of the pandemic and health care system staffing shortages on our markets could be moderating. And while our operations team has done a terrific job managing our supply chain to date, like other companies, we are dealing with an elevated risk of raw material supply shortages. As a result of these potential headwinds and given we're only midway through our fiscal year, we believe it is prudent to update our fiscal '22 organic revenue growth guidance to 7% to 8% from the prior 9%. If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of zero to $50 million, down from the prior $100 million to $200 million I gave last quarter. By segment, we expect Neurosciences to now grow 9% to 10%, Cardiovascular and Medical Surgical to grow 7.5% to 8.5%, and Diabetes to be down low single-digits, all on an organic basis. Despite the headwinds we face on revenue, we will manage well what we can control, which includes expenses not directly tied to our future growth. We will continue to invest heavily in R&D and market development. And on the bottom line, we reiterate our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range of $5.65 to $5.75. This continues to include a currency benefit of $0.05 to $0.10 at recent rates. For the third quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% year-over-year. This assumes no real pickup in organic comp adjusted growth versus pre-pandemic levels from what we saw in the second quarter despite the improving trends we saw in September and October. While we are encouraged by those trends and by what we're seeing in November, we wanted to err on the side of caution with near-term guidance given the dynamic macro environment. At recent rates, we're expecting a currency headwind on third quarter revenue of $80 million to $120 million. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 5% to 6%; Neuroscience, 4% to 5%; Medical Surgical, 2% to 3%; and Diabetes to be down mid-single-digits, all on an organic basis. We expect EPS between $1.37 and $1.39 with a currency tailwind of $0.02 to $0.04 at recent rates. While we expect our markets will continue to be affected by the pandemic in the back half of our fiscal year, we remain focused on delivering solid revenue growth, strong earnings growth and investing in our pipeline to fuel our future. We also remain confident about the underlying strength and competitiveness of our business and our ability to accelerate revenue growth ahead. Finally, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our incredible employees around the world who have worked tirelessly to overcome the many challenges created by the pandemic. executing our operations and supply chain, helping our customers and through it all, continuing to invent, develop and deliver the health care technology of tomorrow. I also want to recognize a new member of our team, who many of you know. We couldn't be more excited to have Bob Hopkins, the top-rated med tech analysts over the past 3 years join our team as Head of Strategy. And we look forward to a strong contribution and influence in the years ahead. Back to you, Geoff. Geoffrey Martha : Okay. Thank you, Karen. And yes, it is great to have Bob here at Medtronic. For the last few quarters, I've been closing by commenting on the progress the company is making in various areas of ESG, or environmental, social and governance impacts. Part of the S in ESG is our focus on inclusion, diversity and equity and high employee engagement, which I discussed last quarter, and this makes Medtronic an attractive destination for top talent. In the release we issued last week, you read about how Bob Hopkins and other highly sought after world-class leaders chose to join Medtronic and drive our transformation to become the undisputed global leader in healthcare technology. It's very important for our culture that we're bringing in new ideas and diverse perspectives to add to those of our talented leadership and employees across the company. On the E front of ESG, as you know, we set an aggressive goal last year to be carbon-neutral in our operations by the end of the decade. And 2 weeks ago, we upped our game, announcing our ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by FY '45 across our value chain. This ambition outlined in our FY '45 decarbonization roadmap will focus on operational carbon neutrality, supply chain greenhouse gas emissions reductions and ongoing logistics improvements. To support our progress, as well as progress across our entire industry, we joined the International Leadership Committee for a Net Zero NHS in the UK. And we're taking a leadership role with the U.S. National Academy of Medicine action collaborative to decarbonize the U.S. healthcare sector. Our ESG efforts are gaining recognition as last week, Medtronic was elevated from being a constituent of the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index to joining a select group of companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. Look, we are really proud of this achievement. In addition, I hope many of you were able to watch our inaugural ESG investor briefing last month. And if you haven't, I encourage that you watch the replay on our Investor Relations website.  Now, let me close on this note. The lingering effects of the pandemic combined with healthcare system staffing shortages impacted our Q2 revenue more than we originally anticipated. We have both puts and takes on the timing of our pipeline and the supply chain dynamics pose near-term challenges. But our challenges will be manageable. We've got this. Our pipeline is delivering, and we're poised to deliver more innovation over the coming quarters and the next several years. We have to show you that we can deliver, but robotics is coming, R&D is coming. Closed-loop SCS is coming. And our diabetes turnaround is coming. And Evolut FX and Mitra on EV-ICD and the pending acquisition of Intersect ENT, these are all coming. We're ready to execute and capitalize on these opportunities. We're in good markets, and we're focused on innovating, winning share and maintaining and/or achieving true category leadership across our businesses. I know we have more to prove, but I'm confident that our organization, our talented and dedicated 90,000-plus global employees are up for the challenge. We're focused, we're hungry and ultimately, we're going to deliver on these opportunities to accelerate our growth. And as always, we remain deeply committed to creating value for you, our shareholders. And with that, let's now move to Q&A. Now we're going to try to get as many analysts as possible, So we ask that you limit yourself to just 1 question. And if you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call.  With that, Win, can you please give the instructions for asking a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio and the Diabetes Operating Unit; Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience Portfolio. We'll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue.  The first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie Marcus : Great. Good morning, everyone. I think everyone is happy to see the EPS guide reiterated here, but I think the top line guide is a little bit surprising, particularly where you have third quarter organic sales guidance, given I believe you made the comment that November was trending better. So I was hoping you could talk through that and maybe just walk through the Hugo launch delay, what you're seeing there? Is it an adoption issue, a technology issue? Or is it purely difficulty getting into hospitals with COVID-19 going on? Geoffrey Martha : Robbie, thanks for the questions. I'll let Karen answer the guide question and maybe I'll hit the robotics question. Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Robbie. And you know what, I'm going to -- for the guide, I'm going to walk you through the quarters a bit to help give you and set the context. And I'm going to start with Q2 because versus -- if you look at versus pre-pandemic levels or 2 years ago, our growth in Q2 was about 1% organically. It was a little below peers, but you got to keep in mind that our inventory levels were lower back then because that was before we made the change to bulk purchasing. So if you adjust for that inventory issue and a little bit of a tougher comp, our Q2 growth was in the 2% to 3% range versus pre-pandemic levels. And if you look at it sequentially, our revenue from Q1 to Q2 declined less than 2%, and that was while most of our peers saw declines of 3% to 5%. So our performance in Q2, we believe, is in line -- at least in line with what we're seeing from our peers. And then if you look at Q3 in our guidance, we're expecting that same 2% to 3% growth as we saw in Q2 versus the pre-pandemic levels. And yes, that equates to a slight deceleration from what we saw in October. And we're encouraged by what we've seen in October and into November. But given the dynamic environment, we focus on wanting to err on the side of caution with our Q3 guide. And then for Q4, we're assuming normal sequential seasonality just because it's our fiscal year-end. So you'll see sequential improvement in Q4. So hopefully, that's helpful. Geoffrey Martha : Okay. So then maybe on the robotics question. I mean, let me first by saying, no, it's definitely not a demand issue. The demand remains high, higher than we can fill at this point. And we're continuing with our regulatory filings around the world. We're going to begin the U.S. IDE here very soon, and surgeons are continuing to do cases. We're doing so far, uro and gyne cases. And we're close to -- I think we're in any day now, like our first general surgery case. So -- and like I said, demand continues to build. So the issue that we're doing, this is more of a limited release phase. That's where we are right now. And we're focused on optimizing the user experience. And the issues that we're managing through are some supply chain issues and some initial manufacturing issues, and those are the issues that we're working through right now. And we're really focused on making sure that these initial experiences with surgeons are really good. And so that's the reason for the slower revenue this year. But then again, next year, we expect next fiscal year a really strong ramp. Operator : Next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Geoff, I had a two-part product-related question. One on Micra, there was an FDA earlier this month on complications related to perforations. How should we think about Micra? Is that something The Street needs to worry about? And one on Ardian, you expressed a lot of confidence in the outlook. I mean we've had a couple of trials where some of your peers have missed endpoints. Is your trial design different from your peer? Because when I look at your peer, they added a 4 drug, and that's when you saw the control arm improve. So if your trial design is similar to your peers, what is the confidence we have that your control trial will have the primary endpoint a year from now? Geoffrey Martha : Thanks, Vijay. I'm going to turn this one over to Sean. But before I turn it over because both the Micra and the Ardian question fall in his world, I'll give you my short answer on Micra. Don't worry about Micra. Micra is doing really well. I'll let Sean provide a little more commentary on the FDA letter. And then on Ardian, look, we're -- and Sean will give you more details, but we're very confident about this. We've got a lot of data here. We've had a registry going for a long time. We're following a lot of patients, picking up a lot of data here. And I'll remind you that our trial wasn't designed to end early. I know some expectations got ramped up about it ending early. And we're confident on this one. And the patient preference, the FDA has seen the patient preference data, they work with us on this and patients really want this. FDA knows that. And look, I've been out myself in the last couple of months talking with -- and in the last couple of weeks, especially talking to a number of our investigators and this -- look, this works. This works and patients like it. And the FDA knows that, and we're confident in our trial. But I'll let Sean give you some more commentary on that. Sean, do you want to chime in here? You got to unmute. Sean Salmon : And Vijay, thanks for the question. I'd say, first on Micra, this FDA letter is more of just a reiteration about the importance of being mindful of implant safety. But the actual rate of perforation that we've seen in the Continued Access Study, the Continued Evidence Development Study, which we just reported out 2-year results at the ESC is actually below what we showed in the preclinical work, in the pre-approval trial, and the overall complication rates for leadless pacemaking are about 30% lower at 2 years than what we see with transvenous. So there's certainly no concern here. And the customer reception has been really, really excellent and continues to be despite the letter of the FDA just emphasized.  And on the clinical trial front for Ardian. You are right. There are differences in the clinical trials. And we remain, as Geoff said, very confident that our ON MEDs trial is going to make us endpoint. I think what you're referring to is the RADIANCE study that was reported on the RADIANCE TRIO study, which at 6 months, they did a full titration of drugs to get patients to their goal. So that was -- part of their study design was after the primary endpoint of 2 months, they added drugs on it until blood pressure went down. And that's kind of the point of renal denervation in general is that you can get there without as many drugs. And we saw something similar in the pilot study for ON MEDs, where we were able to 4 titrate drugs after the primary endpoint and get people's blood pressure there without having to go to diuretics, which patients really hate taking. So yes, there's nothing to read through on that one.  The trial we did in Japan and Korea was a little different. It was more like InterStim III, where they didn't control for medications. They had none of those types of controls. So that's more of a legacy study design that didn't leverage the learnings we got from InterStim III. Operator : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : So one on diabetes. The quarter was in line, but you took down the guidance. Why is that? What are your expectations for the timing of 780G and Guardian 4? And Geoff, we've seen a wave of spins recently. What's your view of spins in general? And do you see opportunities at Medtronic for spinning off noncore or underperforming segments? Geoffrey Martha : Thanks for the questions, Larry. I'll take the spin one and then I'll let Sean take the diabetes one. Well, look, as we've talked about in the past, looking at our portfolio and capital allocation is a high priority. And this new operating model, the executive committee, so the my leadership, the leadership team here, we spend a lot more time on looking at our portfolio and capital allocation that we have in the last 10 years since I've been here, that's for sure, orders of magnitude more time. And look, there's -- we're always looking at our different businesses, including our high-performance businesses and high-growth businesses to make sure we're the right owner because I do think focus is important. And making sure that you can provide the right amount of capital and are there synergies between businesses that matter. And we're always looking at this and debating this. And we've engaged our Board as well, quite a chunk of our time and each Board meeting is spent on this as well. So I do see opportunities. I'm not signaling anything. But I can tell you that this is something that we're constantly looking at. And I don't see ourselves as like a GE or a J&J that have like dramatically different businesses. But it's -- I do think it's an opportunity for us over time. Sean, do you want to take the diabetes one? Sean Salmon : Yes. Sorry, Geoff. My mute button was broken there. Yes, Larry, so nothing different than what we've been talking about all along. We've got really strong uptake of 780G and Guardian 4 sensor outside the United States. In the U.S., we have just -- we're waiting for that approval to come through, and we've had very good interactive conversations with FDA. I think we're making excellent progress there. But do remember that when we launch a new product in diabetes, and there's a training element to that, that takes some time, so it pushes the revenue outward before it starts to gain traction. And what we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. is while we're growing pump share right now globally, we do have a lot of patients that came out of the installed base. We have to kind of rebuild that installed base to get momentum going, and that's really going to be driven by the 780 with Guardian 4 sensor launch. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Taylor at UBS. Matthew Taylor : I had kind of 2 small follow-ups. One on the overall environment. When you're talking about these COVID impacts and staffing shortages, it sounds like you've seen things get a little bit better in November. And I was just wondering if you had a hypothesis as to why that was? And could you give us more of a flavor for how much the improvement has been sequentially? Geoffrey Martha : Sure. On the environmental, yes, so like we said in the commentary, each month throughout our quarter, throughout our Q2, was better than the next. We didn't quantify that, and it got better into November. But the procedures have bounced back, but not as quickly as prior waves and not as fast as we hoped. There's definitely -- it's definitely a fluid situation, and it's gotten a little bit harder, more difficult to predict, right? Before, it was more of an epidemiology discussion around COVID cases and the severity of them and the impact to ICU beds. Now you've got this this critical staffing shortage in our -- in hospitals around the world. I mean, really particularly more so in the U.S., though, particularly this nursing shortage you hear about. And that's a little -- that's been a little bit more difficult to predict. And I think that's the thing that I'd say, surprised us a bit last quarter. And then finally, you've got some supply chain issues, which for us have been manageable so far. But as time goes on, that gets more difficult. So we took, I think -- Karen, walked through the guidance, I think we took a conservative approach here, particularly for our Q3 guide on that. But it's difficult to quantify all these things working together here. The COVID cases jumping back up like you've heard about in Europe, nursing shortages in the U.S. and then global supply chain issues. I think the hospitals are doing a good job managing the headwinds they have. And I think we've done a pretty good job. Our team has done a really good job on the supply chain issues. During COVID, we were able to build up inventory on some of these critical products. But as these issues drag on, it becomes more challenging, and that's why we've taken, I think, a bit of an appropriate position given the uncertainty for our Q2 guide, or Q3 guide rather, sorry. Matthew Taylor : And maybe I could just ask a follow-up, supply chain. You talked about some of the issues with Hugo and the impact on this year\u2019s revenue. Do you have any thoughts on how quickly that can resolve and what kind of contributions we should expect in the subsequent years versus the prior guidance that you had given? Geoffrey Martha : Right. Well, so look, first of all, I'd say -- I should have mentioned this when I was answering Robbie's question. We did underestimate the supply chain -- some of the supply chain issues and early manufacturer issues in a complex program like that or like this, which was a complex program. And that's on us. We should have probably provided a little bit more cushion there because we really -- like we've said all along, we want to make sure that we're optimizing the customer experience here.  So in terms of how long this goes on, well, in terms of -- like, first of all, like we said, we're still having double-digit revenue this year, double-digit millions. And we didn't -- we're not quantifying the next year. But I'll tell you this, it will be a very healthy ramp-up this year. So like I said before, because we are -- cases are continuing, demand is building, we're continuing to get new regulatory filings that we filed for and expect approvals and starting our U.S. IDE soon. So there's a lot of activity going on here, a lot of good things, a lot of good feedback. And we just appropriately are optimizing, in my opinion, the end user or the customer experience here. And FY '23 will be a strong year for the robot. Operator : The next question comes from Cecilia Furlong at Morgan Stanley. Cecilia Furlong : I wanted to ask just on Hugo as well. Ardian, the expenses you talked about previously, the $400 million this year, just how we should think about realizing that this year versus what gets pushed into next year? And combined with that, just how we should think about expense ramp in \u201823 -- fiscal '23 associated with your other pipeline products. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Cecilia. I'm happy to take that. So the $400 million operating profit drag that we talked about earlier this year was not just Hugo. It was both Hugo and Ardian, and the important investments we're making in those big product launches for us. And so we will continue to have more expense on those products in FY '23. It is too early to give you a signal because we still have 2 quarters to go this fiscal year, and we're just beginning our planning process for next fiscal year. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Miksic at Credit Suisse. Matthew Miksic : So lots of things we could sort of ask after. But if I -- just to take 1 question. I'd maybe come back to the staffing question. And it sounds like, Geoff and Karen, you've taken a stab at the fiscal third quarter, which is obviously important calendar quarter for everyone in med devices given kind of the traditional Q4 push. And I just wanted to maybe ask you to talk a little bit about your confidence that we sort of see a turn after that? Or is this a Q3 impact was sort of an improvement into Q4? And then maybe what -- and I apologize because I know it's a terribly uncertain topic, but just what kinds of things would give you confidence that we do get past the staffing thing say as we get through the spring and into midyear next year? Geoffrey Martha : Well, first on -- thanks for the question, Matt. I mean, obviously, the staffing issue is a hot topic. And I've been spending a lot of time with our team on this as well as our hospital customers. Look, these -- the hospitals are basically investing more in staffing. I mean that is, I think, one of the biggest issues here is then are the biggest opportunities. They're just -- they're paying more money for the staffing to get -- to incent people to come back. And the other thing that I see the hospital is doing, where we're spending a lot of time with them is adoption on more remote capabilities and business models. I mean in our world, things like managing your cardiac rhythm patients using remote technologies, so you don't have to come back into the hospital and get their device checks. We're doing that remotely. And I can go down the list to other of our therapies, like another one would be, and it's not in the U.S. yet, but in the NHS and U.K., they're using our PillCam. They've accelerated the use of the rollout of PillCam to do colonoscopy, diagnostic colonoscopies for their patients because they've built up a long waiting list of people who are getting colonoscopy. So I see hospitals -- one, and it's not a sustainable situation, but short term, providing bonuses and incentives. And two, much more rapidly adopting some of -- in our case, I mean, and they're working with other industry players as well to adopt things that are more remote, and they're prioritizing therapies that have less complications that result in less hospitalizations and return hospitalization. So I mean it's not an overnight solution, but they're aggressively working this. I mean no one likes to cancel a TAVR case because there's nobody to monitor the ICU bed or cover the care. So nobody wants to do that. And so they're moving fast on this. And like I said, we're seeing progress here even in our results into November, But it is fluid, and that's why we've taken the approach we've taken on the guide.  I don't know if you have anything to add, Karen, to that. No. She's saying no. So I don't have more for you, Matt. This one is a tough one. Operator : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Joanne Wuensch : A couple of things I'm curious about. Do you think that there's been a change in the way that consumers are looking at healthcare? Geoffrey Martha : Well, I'm not sure if there's a question underneath the question. But yes, I think consumers have been much more engaged in healthcare. And this is something that's weighing into our strategy. You saw that we rebranded Medtronic here last quarter and gone to a different look in engineering in the extraordinary. That's part of a first step to us more aggressively directly reaching out to consumers and educating them about our therapies. I mean things like PillCam, Genius, which I just talked about, things like cryoablation as a first-line indication for Afib. They don't want to be on these regimen of drugs. And so we historically have relied on our specialist physician partners like in the case of cryoablation on Afib, it's been electrophysiologists to kind of \"build up our referral pathways in our markets.\" Now I think given the changes in technology, the miniaturization, which leads to less invasiveness, the connectivity of our devices, the better efficacy, we're moving up in the line -- in the food chain here closer to first line, like I mentioned in Afib. And some of our businesses are already there, more of a consumer business like diabetes and pelvic health for overactive bladder. So you're going to see us more engaging consumers and directly. And the reason we're bullish on this is, one, like I said, the therapies have changed, less invasive, more efficacious in some cases, just a better solution clinically proven than pharma, which is the typical first-line indication. The other thing that we're seeing getting to your question is, like I said, here's a proof point on consumers more engaging. Like on our Ardian trial, we -- this trial filled up really quickly, enrolled really quickly, all through consumers opting in through our digital marketing efforts in social media efforts in the Ardian trial, consumers self-enrolled. That's a first for us. And so we are seeing much more engagement from consumers and in their care. And through -- they're using the Internet and digital platforms to get that education, and that's changing our strategy. Operator : The next question comes from Matt O'Brien at Piper Sandler. Matthew O'Brien: As I look across the different segments on the surgical side, the one that's down the most from the first guidance that you provided last quarter is the Cardiovascular business. And I get the whole staffing shortage issue. It's just a little surprising, TAVR, you can't delay those too long. So I'm just wondering how long that -- some of these pressures you think will last? I mean, is this something that's going to go deep into calendar '22 that you're going to continue to encounter in that segment? And then what really kind of -- what can you do to help us sway some of these issues on the staffing side? Geoffrey Martha : Well, look, it's -- like I said, it's hard to predict, Matt, the timing. But like I was just with one of our bigger customers in the South of the United States like 1.5 weeks ago, and they had a couple of -- and it was a cardiologist that had a couple of TAVR cases canceled that day. And there's a huge sense of urgency because of the nursing shortage. So they have a huge sense of urgency in correcting that issue. And like I said, they are prioritizing moving nurses. First of all, they're getting more aggressive with their staffing strategies to attract and retain staff. They're reallocating resources around the hospital, the health system, if you will, to get more nurses into these critical care areas. They're pushing certain cases out to ASCs. We're seeing growth in surgical centers, where they need less staff to do these cases. So we're seeing them aggressively make these, I'll call it, reallocation of resources, and we're helping them as much as we can in these areas. So I -- look, the -- like you said, you can't defer these cases. First of all, I don't know how -- I don't like -- I've never liked the term elective, I think it's more deferrable. And you can only defer some of these cases so long as you pointed out. And so people are innovating. Hospital systems are innovating here. And I just don't -- it's really hard to predict. I mean like I said, last quarter, we underestimated the impact of the nursing shortage. Like I said, we're seeing improvement, but -- and we've taken a conservative guide in our fiscal Q3 in particular, but it's really difficult for us to provide much more specifics than that. Karen Parkhill : Matt, I might add. I know you're all trying to figure out how long this will last. And if you just look at -- if we just look at the recent trends in November, we saw some good upticks last month, particularly in cardio. Now we don't know if that's because it's preholiday pre-Thanksgiving, but we are seeing some good encouraging trends. Operator : Next question comes from Chris Pasquale at Guggenheim. Chris Pasquale : Karen and Geoff, most of the focus in terms of macro headwinds has been on the U.S. so far, but some of the recent headlines that in Europe have been a bit concerning. Just curious what you're seeing in your European business over the past few weeks, whether guidance assumes any deceleration in OUS procedure trends during the third quarter? Geoffrey Martha : Well, Chris, thanks for the question. And you're right, the Q2 was a U.S. story for us. I mean the other regions performed well, especially our emerging markets, we're seeing really strong growth in emerging markets. But Europe performed well as well in other developed markets last quarter. Now in the last few days and weeks, you're hearing in Europe about certain countries pulling back on elective cases. I really don't see this to be long lived here, given the vaccination status in these countries, the high vaccination rates in most of these countries and other new therapies like the oral antiviral therapies coming online. So I don't see it taking too long there directly from COVID, and we've reflected that in our guidance. Operator : The final question comes from Rick Wise at Stifel. Frederick Wise : Good morning, everybody. Maybe, Geoff, just since I'm bringing up the rear here, one bigger picture question for you, and then I'll add a question for Karen. I mean you're obviously working hard to -- it's not exactly turnaround Medtronic, but make Medtronic grow faster, be more innovative, execute better. I'm sort of curious your reflections on sort of a big picture sense of, do you feel that the challenges of COVID, staffing and everything you're talking about today have slowed your personal mission to drive that forward? Obviously, you're highlighting innovation and all the new products, et cetera. But at a high level, I'm just wondering your evolving thoughts.  And maybe shorter, Karen, if you could just talk us through a little more gross margin. I mean, gross margins despite the challenges in the quarter, better than expected. Maybe give us a little more color on, do we expect that kind of trend in the second half? And do you feel more optimistic about the longer-term potential to expand gross margins as all these new innovations roll out? Geoffrey Martha : Rick, well, thanks for the question. And maybe last but definitely not least here, and I appreciate the question. And look, I'm -- it's a great question. And I'm very bullish on where we stand, and I'll walk you through why. I mean, yes, COVID and this nursing -- the critical staffing shortage like highlighted by this nursing shores in the U.S. and just spending a lot of time talking about vaccines and vaccine mandates, yes, it is a bit of a distraction, but I am very happy about our bigger picture here. We've -- one, what I really like is to structurally how we've made the company smaller on the front end, if you will, with these 20 operating units and the clarity that we have into the end markets and the dynamics what the customers are really asking for, what the competitors are doing, and we've got a really good handle on our pipeline by each of these operating units. And we have gotten more aggressive in funding these businesses and holding them accountable to making the right choices and prioritizing innovation and innovating faster. So I feel really good about that. And my team, we spend a lot of time looking at these operating units and making these judgment calls, what is the appropriate funding? What does a good pipeline look like, how should we feel about the competition? And it's not just like me sitting around talking to an operating leader, it's my team, different portfolio leaders even if it's -- the business is not in their portfolio, asking tough questions because every incremental dollar funding we put in one business is one less dollar we put in another business. So the rigor around this and the constructive debate and the diversity of thought coming from the different people, it's leading to better decisions and the energy route inside the company and around the company is palpable. I mean we're getting -- our employee scores remain high despite all the burnout and everything and is affecting employees, but still we've got great scores and feedback we're getting -- attracting talent like never before. We've had a 50% spike in our -- and people applying for jobs at Medtronic the market share situation is going well. And so look, we've got a lot to do here. We've got some big drivers that we've got to show. We've got to bring this robot program and ramp this. Already in -- we've got to get that data back and ramp that. We've got the diabetes turnaround. We're seeing -- we can see it. You can just see it off in the horizon. You can see the products doing so well in Europe and other parts of the world. We've got to get that in the United States. But we're making this progress. And that's why I feel good. And culturally, you're seeing a level of competitiveness and accountability. So like this quarter, revenue didn't come in where we want it, we wanted but we still had an operational beat on EPS and we're holding EPS guidance for the rest of the year. That's the kind of company that we want to be. Disappointed about the miss on revenue. There's some environmental factors. But quite honestly, I was hoping that we could overcome all of those we weren't quite able to this quarter, but just to get some color commentary on how we think about it, that's how we're thinking about it.  And we're going to -- I know we're doing the right things. We're going to stay the course. We're going to keep making these investments, keep holding ourselves accountable to being like the undisputed technology leader and growing above the market. That's where we want to go. And so optimistic about where we're going in that direction. So with that... Karen Parkhill : Gross margin, I'm going to take. Geoffrey Martha : Gross margin Karen Parkhill : Yes. So -- and I just want to emphasize something that Geoff said before I go to gross margin, Rick. And that is despite the challenges that we've had from COVID, our R&D investment is not coming down. And we said at the beginning of the year, we were increasing that 10%, and we still fully intend to do that. So we're offsetting our headwinds in a different way when it comes to delivering the bottom line. Also, on gross margin, yes, our gross margin was better than expected. We're really pleased with that. We're -- we've got a very concerted effort to improve our operations and to lead to better gross margin. We're focused on getting our gross margin back to pre-COVID levels. And from there, at least sustaining it and hopefully improving it. And if you look at just the year-over-year, we're still focused on that 2.5 points to 3 points of improvement in gross margin this fiscal year. And when I think about longer term, I would just say to you that nothing has changed from our focus on delivering that 5%-plus revenue growth and that 8% plus bottom line growth. And I would say that includes next fiscal year in FY '23, even given some of these headwinds that we've talked about today. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Rick. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Geoffrey Martha : Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for the questions. We definitely appreciate your support and your ongoing interest in Medtronic. And we hope that you'll join us for our Q3 earnings webcast, which we anticipate will be on -- we'll be holding this on February 22, where we'll update you on our progress. And Ryan will kick off that call standing outside of our world headquarters here in Minneapolis, again, without a coat on. He's promised us that no matter what the weather. So with that, thanks for watching today. Please stay healthy and safe over the holiday. And for those of you in the U.S., I'd like to wish you and your families a very Happy Thanksgiving.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning and welcome to a balmy February morning here in Minnesota. I am Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations, and I am pleased that you are joining us for Medtronic\u2019s Fiscal Year 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Video Webcast. Before we start the prepared remarks, I will share a few details about today\u2019s webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 28, 2022 and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, our portfolio executive VPs will join us and will take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today\u2019s event should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today\u2019s webcast, many of the statements we make maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis. Third quarter organic revenue comparisons adjust only for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last four quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential revenue changes compare to the second quarter of fiscal \u201822 and are made on an as-reported basis. And all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the fourth calendar quarter of 2021 compare to the fourth calendar quarter of 2020 unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. And with that, let\u2019s head into the warm studio and get started. Geoff Martha : Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported Q3 results, delivering solid earnings growth in a challenging market. We felt the short-term impacts of Omicron in January, particularly in the U.S., causing our Q3 revenue to fall short of our expectations. The COVID resurgence affected not only procedure volumes, but also created acute periods of worker absenteeism with our customers, suppliers and in our own operations and field teams. Now that said, COVID infections in the U.S. are declining. Available hospital ICU capacity is increasing and procedure volumes are picking up. While some of the impacts from the pandemic, like inflation, supply chain issues and healthcare worker shortages will linger, we do expect that our markets, our customers and our industry are on the path to recovery. Over the last 18 months, we have made significant changes to our operating model, moving to 20 focused operating units as well as making major enhancements to our culture and incentives. These changes have improved our pace of innovation and our competitiveness, as evidenced by recent product filings and approvals that came faster than expected. And we are not finished driving change. We are accelerating improvements to our global supply chain and operations, leveraging our scale to further improve quality, increase product availability and reduce cost. In addition, we have enhanced our portfolio management and capital allocation processes. Our new operating model is giving us line of sight into what is required to compete and win over the long-term in each of our businesses. As a result, we are looking at our portfolio with a more critical eye, with a focus on growth and creating shareholder value. I\u2019d be surprised if there weren\u2019t changes over the coming fiscal year, but I don\u2019t know yet if they will be smaller or more significant. Now, let\u2019s look at our third quarter results, starting with our market share performance. Now, market share is an important metric and a reflection of the culture and incentive changes that we are making in the company. About 60% of our businesses held or won share in the last calendar quarter. While that\u2019s down slightly from last quarter due to some supply constraints and where certain businesses are in their product cycles, it is a significant improvement from where Medtronic was just 18 months ago. So, starting with our Cardiovascular Portfolio, in Cardiac Rhythm Management, one of our largest businesses, we continue to build on our category leadership, adding over 1.5 points of share. We are winning share in both high and low power devices and we recently launched our Micra AV Leadless Pacemaker in Japan and Micra VR in China, resulting in international Micra growth of over 50% in Q3. In Peripheral Vascular Health, we won about 1 point of share with strong growth in our Abre deep venous stents and venous seal closure system. And in Cardiac Surgery, we gained over 1 point of share on the strength of our extracorporeal life support products. In our Medical Surgical portfolio, we estimate we gained share in GI, driven by momentum from the recently launched Emprint HP Generator and our Beacon endoscopic ultrasound franchise. In Respiratory Interventions, despite the year-over-year headwind as ventilator sales continue to return to pre-pandemic levels, we estimate we gained about 400 basis points of share. We won share in premium ventilation with our Puritan Bennett 980, in video laryngoscopes with our McGrath-Mac and in core airways with our TaperGuard endotracheal tubes. In our Neuroscience portfolio, we increased our market share in Cranial & Spinal Technologies. We are launching new spine implants that enhance the overall value of our ecosystem of preoperative planning software, imaging, navigation and robotic systems as well as powered surgical instruments, all of which are transforming care in spine surgery. In Neuromodulation, we have great momentum from new products in both pain stim and brain modulation. In pain stim, despite the headwinds from Omicron, we estimate we gained over 1 point of share, driven by both our Intellis with DTM technology and Vanta recharge-free systems. And in brain modulation, while we continue to face headwinds from replacement devices, our business grew 15% on strong adoption of our Percept neurostimulator with BrainSense technology, paired with our SenSight directional lead. Medtronic is the only company with sensing capabilities in our deep brain stimulators, which drove about 10 points of new implant share and over 1 point of overall DBS share in Q3 and we expect this momentum to continue. Another business with momentum is our Neurovascular business, where we are back to winning share, picking up about 2 points this quarter. We are seeing strength from our pipeline family of flow diverters for treating intracranial aneurysms. Our flow diversion launches in Japan, CE Mark countries and the United States, coupled with broader portfolio growth in China, propelled Neurovascular to 12% growth this quarter. Now, while the majority of our businesses are winning share, we have some businesses that lost share in Q3, where we are focused on improving our performance. In Cardiac Diagnostics, despite year-over-year share loss, we gained share sequentially for the first time in many quarters. We have made good progress increasing our manufacturing capacity for our LINQ II insertable cardiac monitor and we began our rollout of our AccuRythm artificial intelligence algorithms, which were just enabled for all LINQ II patients in the U.S. We expect ongoing supply improvement and additional AI detection algorithms, along with new indications to expand the market and drive growth. In our Structural Heart & Aortic business, we lost share in aortic due to supply constraints and continued pressure from our Valiant Navion recall and competitive launches. At the same time though, we maintained our TAVR share in Q3, growing in the mid-teens. In our Surgical Innovations business, we lost a little over 0.5 point of share overall due to acute resin shortage that impacted our flagship LigaSure vessel sealing portfolio. This was partially offset by increased share in advanced stapling given strong market adoption of our Tri-Staple Reinforced Reloads as well as share gains in hernia and sutures. The good news here is that our teams have improved our resin supply and we expect to be able to meet demand in Q4. In Patient Monitoring, we estimate we lost a few points of share due to a difficult comparison from the strength we had last year in pulse oximetry and capnography monitor sales. However, our share has been relatively consistent for the past four quarters. In Pelvic Health, procedures slowed this past quarter and we lost some share. We expect this market to recover and we are well-positioned to compete. In ENT, we lost share for the first time in a long time, given some temporary supply chain disruptions that we expect to have resolved going forward. And in Diabetes, we continue to lose share, predominantly in the U.S. Look, we are extremely focused on resolving our warning letter and bringing new products to the U.S. market although timing is difficult to predict. In December, CMS expanded coverage for our CGM sensors, including those integrated with insulin pumps and we are pleased that this will take effect for Medicare patients at the end of this month. In the international markets, we launched the 770G in Japan last month, making it the first hybrid closed loop system available in that country. And in Europe, we continue to see success and strong adoption of our 780G with the Guardian 4 sensor. Next, let\u2019s turn to our product pipeline. We have launched over 200 products in the U.S., Western Europe, Japan and China in the last 12 months and these are having an impact across our businesses. At the same time, we continue to advance new technologies that are in development with increased investments in R&D. We are expecting these investments to create new markets, disrupt existing ones and accelerate the growth profile of Medtronic. Now, starting with our Cardiovascular portfolio, we continue to make progress in Cardiac Rhythm Management on disrupting the ICD market with our Aurora extravascular ICD. Our U.S. pivotal study is fully enrolled. We continue to expect CE Mark approval later this calendar year and U.S. approval next calendar year. Our EV ICD can both pace and shock without any leads inside the heart and veins. And it does this in a single device that is the same size as a traditional ICD. We believe Aurora will accelerate adoption of EV ICDs and make this a $1 billion market by 2030. In Cardiac Ablation Solutions, we are advancing a number of technologies to become a leader in the $8 billion EP ablation market. We are rolling out our DiamondTempt RF ablation system as well as our exclusive first line paroxysmal AF treatment indication using our cryoablation system. We also continue to make progress with our anatomical PulseSelect PFA system, which has breakthrough device designation from the FDA. Our global pivotal trial completed enrollment back in November and we are very excited about how our PFA system could disrupt the EP ablation market. Last month, we announced our intent to acquire Affera. Affera has several development programs underway, including a differentiated mapping and navigation system that closes a competitive gap in our product portfolio and a focal PFA system that is a separate and complementary platform to our anatomical PFA system. We are looking forward to welcoming the Affera team into Medtronic. Moving to our Symplicity renal denervation procedure for hypertension, we continue to enroll our ON MED study and expect to complete the 6-month follow-up in the second half of this calendar year. We will then submit the data to the FDA as ON MED is the final piece of our submission to seek approval for Symplicity. Adding to our body of evidence, 3-year data from our ON MED pilot study will be presented at the ACC scientific sessions in April. In Structural Heart, we now expect to begin the limited U.S. market release of our Evolut FX valve in Q1, followed by full market release later in fiscal \u201823. Evolut FX enhances ease-of-use improvements in deliverability, implant visibility and deployment stability. In China, we expect to launch our Evolut PRO valve this quarter, our first entry into this large and underpenetrated TAVR market. We also continue to advance our transcatheter mitral and tricuspid development programs. In our APOLLO pivotal trial for TMVR, we just had the first implant using our transfemoral delivery system and we expect this new system to meaningfully accelerate patient enrollment. Moving to our Medical Surgical portfolio and our surgical robotics program, we have made progress improving our supply chain and manufacturing and remain focused on scaling production. At the same time, we continue to add regulatory approvals and expand our limited market release, most recently in Canada, Australia and Israel and we intend to start our U.S. urology clinical trial soon. In addition to uro and GYN cases, surgeons in Panama, Chile and India are now performing general surgery procedures, with Hugo, including advanced cases like colorectal and lower anterior resection surgeries. And we announced earlier this month the first Hugo procedures in Europe. In Diabetes, our MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with our Guardian 4 sensor, continue to be under active review with the FDA, with approval subject to our warning letter. When approved and launched in the U.S., we expect this system to be highly differentiated and accelerate growth in our diabetes business. We continue to expect submission of our next generation sensor Simplera to the FDA this quarter. Simplera is fully disposable, easy to apply and half the size of Guardian 4. Finally, we are making progress on multiple next-gen sensor and pump programs, including patch pumps, although we haven\u2019t disclosed details for competitive reasons. While it will take time, we expect the technology pipeline investments we are making will result in our diabetes business being accretive to total company growth and eventually grow with this important market. Now, turning to our Neuroscience portfolio, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for our diabetic peripheral neuropathy indication for our Intellis and Vanta spinal cord stimulators last month. This came following the FDA\u2019s rigorous review of our clinical submission and years earlier than we had previously communicated. The approval represents the beginning of a multiyear market development process, which we are uniquely suited to execute given our presence in both the pain stim and the diabetes markets. We believe that DPN market opportunity will reach $300 million by FY \u201826 and with an annual TAM of up to $1.8 billion, making DPN for SCS one of the biggest market opportunities in med tech. In addition to DPN, we also continue to make progress on expanding indications for SCS and to non-surgical refractory back pain and upper limb and neck chronic pain. If that was not enough for pain stim, we are also excited about our inceptive ECAP\u2019s closed loop spinal cord stimulator, which we submitted to the FDA late last year. We expect inceptive\u2019s closed-loop therapy that optimizes pain relief for patients to revolutionize the SCS market. Finally, in Pelvic Health, we are expecting FDA approval for our next-gen InterStim recharge-free device in the first half of this calendar year. With its designed best-in-class battery, constant current and full-body MRI compatibility at both 1.5 and 3 Tesla, we expect this device will extend our category leadership in sacral neuromodulation. And with that, I will turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and our guidance. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Geoff. Our third quarter organic revenue increased 2%. While we were tracking to our quarterly guidance in early January, the impacts from this latest wave of COVID affected our revenue in the last month of the quarter. Despite the challenging revenue, we controlled expenses and delivered adjusted EPS in line with our guidance and $0.01 ahead of consensus. From a geographic perspective, our U.S. revenue was flat, and non-U.S. developed markets grew 1%, given the impacts of Omicron. Our emerging markets were relatively stronger, growing 7%, with strength in South Asia, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. Converting our earnings into strong free cash flow is a priority. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $4.3 billion, up 23% from last year and we continue to target a full year conversion of 80% or greater. And we remain focused on allocating our capital to generate strong future growth and shareholder returns. We are increasing our organic R&D investments broadly across the company to fuel the pipeline that Geoff walked through earlier and we are supplementing this with attractive tuck-in acquisitions. Since the beginning of last fiscal year, we have announced 8 acquisitions totaling over $3.2 billion in total consideration, including last month\u2019s acquisition of Affera in our Cardiac Ablation business. At the same time, we are increasing our minority investments in companies that could become future acquisitions as was the case with Affera. We have a commitment to return more than 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, primarily through our attractive and growing dividend. We are an S&P dividend aristocrat. And fiscal year-to-date, we paid over $2.5 billion in dividends to our shareholders. And finally, particularly in periods where we see share price dislocation, we look to execute opportunistic share repurchases as was the case this quarter. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased over $1.1 billion of our stock. Turning to guidance, while procedure volumes are still impacted from Omicron in the first few weeks of February, we are beginning to see improvement. Our outlook assumes continued procedure volume recovery through March and April. And we expect to be back to pre-COVID levels in most of our markets before the end of the fourth quarter. Assuming that holds, for the fourth quarter, we are comfortable with current Street consensus for our organic revenue growth of approximately 5.5%. At recent foreign exchange rates, currency would be a headwind on fourth quarter revenue of approximately $185 million. By segment, we would model Cardiovascular at 7% to 8% growth, Neuroscience at 2.5% to 3.5% growth, Medical Surgical at 7.5% to 8.5% growth, and Diabetes down 6% to 7%, all on an organic basis. On the bottom line, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1.56 to $1.58, in line with current consensus. And at recent rates, we expect currency to have a flat to slightly positive impact on the bottom line. Before I send it back to Geoff, I want to acknowledge the additional strain that the recent COVID resurgence has placed on our customers and our employees over the past couple of months. I am truly grateful for the perseverance that both healthcare workers and our employees have demonstrated to ensure patients receive our life-changing therapies around the world. Back to you, Geoff. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Karen. For the last few quarters, I\u2019ve been closing by commenting on the progress the company is making in various areas of ESG, or environmental, social and governance impacts. Today, I want to highlight that we recently released our global inclusion, diversity and equity 2021 annual report entitled Zero Barriers. The report shares how we are accelerating our efforts to remove barriers to opportunities by creating an inclusive work environment, doubling down or removing bias and amplifying our impact in our local communities. Our commitments to ID&E and the UN sustainable development goals compel us to solve health and equities faster. Systemic socioeconomic, racial, geographic and even generational factors all contribute to a person\u2019s ability or inability to achieve good health and reach their full potential as a contributing member of society. We\u2019re committed to urgently addressing barriers to education, diagnosis and treatment, as the global crisis of health and equity can be solved by accelerating access to healthcare technologies. One such inequity is mortality from colorectal cancer. While colorectal is one of the most preventable cancers, low screening rates make it one of the deadliest, with mortality rates 40% higher for the black population in the United States. In addition, Hispanic and Latino adults are more likely to be diagnosed in later stages of the disease when it\u2019s more difficult to treat. Today, I\u2019m pleased to announce that Medtronic is collaborating with Amazon Web Services and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy to place GI Genius modules at facilities that support low-income and underserved populations across the United States. Our GI Genius system improves the quality of colonoscopies using AI to assist physicians in detecting both precancerous and cancerous growth. Increasing access to technology that can improve clinical outcomes through earlier and more accurate detection can provide a significant positive impact for communities most vulnerable to colorectal cancer. We continue to look for creative solutions like this one to address health inequities. Now let me close on this note. While the pandemic and its associated impacts have affected our revenue in the past couple of quarters more than we expected, we haven\u2019t lost sight of the big picture. We\u2019ve made significant changes in the company, and we\u2019re strengthening our operations, supply chain and global quality systems. We\u2019re also laser-focused on capital deployment and portfolio management processes, with a deep commitment to creating shareholder value. And we have several exciting growth catalysts in our pipeline. We expect to benefit as market procedures reaccelerate post Omicron and as we lead in high-growth med-tech markets. While it\u2019s been a bumpier ride than I would have liked, and we still have challenges to work through. I\u2019m confident in our organization\u2019s ability to accelerate and sustain our growth profile over the long-term to grow at or above our markets and, as we do so, create value for our stakeholders. And finally, I want to join Karen in thanking all of our employees around the world who, despite the challenges we faced day in and day out, engineer the extraordinary so that we can serve our customers and patients in all four corners of the globe. As a result of your efforts, we can fulfill the Medtronic mission : alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life for millions of people around the world. Now, let\u2019s move to Q&A. We are going to try to get to as many as analysts as possible. So we ask that you limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Win, can you please give the instructions for asking a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] For today\u2019s session, Geoff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio and the Diabetes operating unit; Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience Portfolio. We will pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue. We will take the first question from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie, go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks a lot and congrats on the quarter. Maybe my first question, I think one of the bigger investor questions, that\u2019s building here, especially with some of the warning letter and the delays in Diabetes and some of the inflation pressure we\u2019re seeing with some of your competitors. Any early thoughts on how we should be thinking about fiscal \u201823? There is a wide range on estimates. So I just wanted to get any early sense you had for us? Thanks. Geoff Martha : Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll \u2013 first of all, thanks for the question. I agree it\u2019s a big question, and maybe I\u2019ll turn this over to Karen to provide some color commentary on FY \u201823. Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Geoff and Robbie. So I would first say it\u2019s early. And obviously, we\u2019re going to give our full year outlook on our Q4 call in May. And we\u2019re working through our planning process as we speak. And we\u2019ve noted before with you that there are more puts and takes than normal for next fiscal year. So let me help by sharing some broad thoughts. On revenue, we continue to drive to our long-term organic revenue growth goal of 5% plus, for sure. Although I would say on the plus side, the plus side of that, LRP may be more difficult in FY \u201823, just given some of the challenges that we\u2019ve talked about. We are, as you know, expecting really great product launches, Geoff talked about several of them on the call. And we do expect a continued rebound in procedure volumes in our markets. And as we think about FX on the top line for next year, think about that as being a few hundred million dollar headwind at recent rates. On the bottom line, you\u2019ve heard from others around the increased pressure from the macro environment. And we\u2019ve got that same increased pressure on things like inflation and wage adjustments. And we\u2019ve noted last month that currency is expected to flip from a tailwind to a headwind next fiscal year. And we\u2019ve also shared that we\u2019ve got some dilution from our Affera acquisition. Those last two combined could impact EPS by a few hundred basis points. While we continue to work to offset these headwinds, we certainly don\u2019t want to shortchange our investments and our meaningful growth drivers for the future. And it\u2019s those investments that are really going to help us deliver on that plus side of the 5% plus over the long-range plan. So I would say FY \u201823 will be a unique and challenging year just given the macro environment and the timing of our major pipeline launches. And on the bottom line, we do expect to grow EPS next year, certainly. But at this stage, we don\u2019t expect it to be above revenue growth. I want to make sure, though, that you take away from this that we are still very committed to our long-range plan. We\u2019ve got investments in quality along with the more-than-modest FX dilution next fiscal year that should subside going forward. And while it\u2019s hard to predict the macro factors like inflation and wage adjustments, I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll continue at the pace that we\u2019re currently experiencing. And obviously, as we look forward, we expect to have meaningful revenue growth to go along with those investments that we\u2019re prioritizing, which will ultimately help drive EPS growth. So I hope that color is helpful, Robbie. Robbie Marcus : Yes, that\u2019s great. And then as my follow-up, Geoff, at the JPMorgan conference, you first mentioned may be doing some bigger changes to the business. You mentioned it again today. I was just hoping you could give us a little flavor for what you\u2019re thinking. Is it divestitures? Is it a bigger breakup of the company? And what\u2019s the time frame we should be thinking about for some of the larger potential actions? Thanks. Geoff Martha : Sure, Robbie. Yes, so we\u2019re definitely looking at the portfolio more intently. I can\u2019t \u2013 however, at this point, I can\u2019t really get into specifics. I will say we\u2019re looking to improve our [indiscernible] where we are looking to improve the consistency of our growth, our North Star \u2013 to summarize it, our North Star is durable growth. And we\u2019re looking at our businesses and we\u2019re evaluating them for, one, how well they fit into the portfolio, how well they fit into our strategy, are we the right owners of these assets? And then how we, Medtronic, add value and grow these businesses? It\u2019s still at this point, like I said at the conference, we don\u2019t know if these changes will be significant or more limited. But I can assure you, we\u2019re deeply, deeply committed to doing the right things for shareholders and on all of the Medtronic stakeholders. So we intend to get through this analysis and I think have more over the next several \u2013 over the course of the next fiscal year is what we said at the JPMorgan. I don\u2019t have any more update from that in terms of timing. Robbie Marcus : Alright. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Robbie. Next question, please, Win. Operator : Next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Go ahead. Geoff Martha : Vijay, are you there? Do you want to go to the next question and then come back to Vijay? Vijay Kumar : Sorry about that. Hi, Geoff, Karen. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. There is I guess maybe one \u2013 my first one is on the guidance comments you made which was helpful. What is the fiscal \u201823 assuming on Diabetes? Did you guys have a second meeting with the FDA? Is the warning letter going to be delinked with the approval? Or how are you treating Diabetes in that comment of 5 plus with plus being difficult. Is that still assuming a 50 to 100 basis points headwind from Diabetes? Geoff Martha : On the very last part of the question, I\u2019ll let Karen and maybe Sean chime in. In terms of \u2013 look, the dialogue with the FDA is ongoing. I mean we\u2019ve got an ongoing dialogue on the 780G approval. We\u2019ve got an ongoing dialogue on the warning letter. Our priority is \u2013 they are both priorities, but our first priority is to work the warning letter issues, and we\u2019ve been working on these, like as we talked about, for 2 years now, even before the warning letter was issued. So the dialogue with \u2013 like I said, with the FDA is ongoing, and it\u2019s very constructive, I would say. Karen, do you want to talk about the last part of the question there? Karen Parkhill : Sure, Vijay. Good morning. It\u2019s still too early to get specific. We\u2019re in our planning process. And as we talked about before, there are a variety of outcomes and ranges that can happen, depending on the approval. We\u2019re obviously focused on getting that approval out as quickly as possible, and we will be working towards that, but too early to get specific on guidance. We will give that guidance, including for our business units, in the fourth quarter call. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And maybe, Geoff, my second question on the robot. Some early feedback seems to be positive. Have \u2013 you did mention supply chain has been resolved or you\u2019re ramping up production. Maybe some sense for where production is or some color on how many surgeons have been trained. What is the order book looking like for the robot would be helpful. Geoff Martha : Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll bring in Bob here in a second to provide some of that \u2013 more color on that. On just overall, we\u2019re making progress on the robot. Demand continues to be strong. We continue to get additional regulatory approvals, a couple more last quarter. We did our first surgery in Europe and are getting good feedback from surgeons there, which I think is a great sign. And the breadth of our procedures continues to grow, get more complex. And so we\u2019re feeling good about the \u2013 kind of where the robot is, like that we\u2019ve got something really powerful in our hands here and we\u2019re going to achieve our long-term objectives here. And as we\u2019ve said before, we anticipate a strong ramp in FY \u201823. But I\u2019ll give Bob. Bob, do you want to add some color here? Bob White : Yes. Thanks, Geoff. And Vijay, thanks for the question. It was nice to read your report after the time you spent with Professor Motree as well. And certainly, what we\u2019ve seen, Vijay, is we\u2019ve seen some nice progress. We\u2019re installing more systems across the world. As you know, now that we have our CE Mark approval. As Geoff mentioned, some of the general surgery procedures taking place. And we certainly expect to continue to expand the regulatory approvals in more countries. We certainly look to expand in the future to thoracic, colorectal, hernia, bariatric procedures. Obviously, Hugo was designed with all those procedures in mind, working with all those regulatory agencies. And the feedback itself has been really positive, Vijay. The open council has been excellent, the visualization, staying connected with the OR staff and we like about that. We really think the council and our whole system design for where healthcare is moving, which is a real kind of cross-functional team-based approach to physician to care delivery. So obviously, as you know, you picked up some of this feedback. The way our system is designed, it\u2019s also allowing to train multiple surgeons in parallel. And sort of your question, we\u2019re training lots of surgeons. We have training centers now opened up in geographies across the world and seeing really good traction there as well. So we\u2019re going to do what we told you consistently throughout, which is expand our limited market release into these markets and continue to make progress. But thanks for the question, and thanks for spending time with Professor Motree. Vijay Kumar : Thanks, guys. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Vijay. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Vijay. Next question, please, Win. Operator : The next question comes from Pito Chickering at Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. On the guidance question, I understand that the macro environment for 2023 is pretty challenging. But as you look at both labor and material inflation, do you think that, that would change your long-term EPS target? Or do you need more revenue growth to offset these margin pressures? Or do you think they can pass some of those costs all into your customers over time? Geoff Martha : Let me take a stab at that. First, there are things that we\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll let Karen talk about some of this in a second here. But we are, in addition to; we are obviously facing these inflationary pressures. And even before the inflation kicked in, as part of our organizational kind of new operating model, one of the areas we\u2019ve talked a lot about, move into the 20 operating units and putting more into R&D and really speeding up the pace of innovation, and I think that is working. We\u2019re getting good evidence around that this is working in terms of the pace of our product launches and some of these product launches coming much faster than we anticipated, like we talked about \u2013 and I talked about in the commentary like in our Pain Stim market with DPN, diabetic peripheral neuropathy approval or \u2013 and I can go off a couple of other lists, our ECAP submission for pain. These are areas that we just spend things up. So I feel good about that. But another area that we had planned to address and now are accelerating is the operations area. And there is an opportunity there to get some more benefits of scale that we have and simplify our global operations. And in simplifying that, that\u2019s going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to also invest in some enhanced capabilities there. That is going to give us a lower cost to serve, if you will, and set us up for cost of goods sold improvements over time. So that is going to help address some of this. You also mentioned price \u2013 and again those plans were put in motion before the inflation, but we\u2019ve been accelerating it since the inflation has hit. And then price. I mean, price, there are \u2013 we are looking more acutely at our new technology. We have a lot of new products coming out, and we are looking at the pricing of that in the wake of some of the \u2013 of this inflation. And there are select markets around the world where I think we have the ability \u2013 we have the opportunity to improve our pricing. So we are looking at pricing as well. So both those levers, reducing our cost to serve and setting ourselves up for cost of goods \u2013 better cost of goods sold over time and then the pricing that I just mentioned. Karen, do you want to add? Karen Parkhill : Yes, I\u2019ll just add a little bit. While it varies by geography, we are seeing wage inflation in our direct labor currently of almost 9%. So that is much higher than typical. And that\u2019s just a near-term headwind that we\u2019re dealing with. That will impact us a bit in FY \u201823. And on materials right now, we\u2019re typically able to drive net material savings through productivity efficiencies and cost down initiatives. And right now, we\u2019re expecting a couple of hundred basis points of inflation on that just in the near-term. But again, over the long-term, we\u2019re focused on driving revenue growth, on driving continued cost down and expense efficiencies, pricing opportunities where we have them. So we\u2019re focused on and remain committed to that long-range plan. Pito Chickering : Thank you so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Pito. Next question, Win. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Miksic at Credit Suisse. Matt Miksic : Hi, thanks so much. Can you hear me okay? Geoff Martha : Yes, we can hear you, Matt. Matt Miksic : Great. So one quick one on sort of your portfolio comments. And then just a clarification on the \u201823 guidance comments, if I could. So Geoff, I think sometimes when folks ask about portfolio changes or puts and takes to your businesses, they are thinking of, just to put it bluntly, commitment to Diabetes, frankly. So I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on your commitment to that business now what it is in the portfolio, where you stand in terms of the process of getting it back at speed. And then I have just one clarification, as I mentioned, for Karen. Geoff Martha : Sure. On the comments we made about the portfolio, let me start by saying it wasn\u2019t intended to be focused on Diabetes. It\u2019s a real, I guess, deep dive, I would say, on the whole portfolio, okay, and more intent than we\u2019ve done in the past. Regarding Diabetes, look, I\u2019d say we are confident in our turnaround story here. I know the warning letter didn\u2019t help. But we are confident in the turnaround story. We believe we have a solid pipeline of new technologies and some near-term growth opportunities. Our clear priority though is resolving the FDA warning letter and getting these new products to market, especially in the U.S., right? In a situation when we see the products working in other markets, we know it\u2019ll have a huge impact on patients here in the U.S. as well. And we have multiple shots on goal to deliver competitive pump and CGM technology, through our organic R&D, through the Blackstone partnership and through some structured investments. And as we mentioned in the JPMorgan conference, we do have some parts of the pipeline that we haven\u2019t provided much detail on for competitive reasons. So we feel we\u2019re further along in Diabetes in terms of not having the warning letter, but it doesn\u2019t change the narrative in our mind. We have the technology, we have the pipeline. It\u2019s a high-growth market, and we feel good about it. Matt Miksic : That\u2019s great. Thank you. And then just on \u2013 Karen, I appreciate the color on \u201823 and I understand it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re a quarter away here from formal \u201823 guidance. But the few hundred basis point impact on EPS, you mentioned from FX and some other items, dilution from Affera, just to put a finer point on it, that\u2019s inclusive of the Diabetes impact And also just to make sure we have the math right, that\u2019s somewhere in the range of $0.15, $0.15 to $0.20 or something like that of a headwind from those items? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Matt, thank you. Those items \u2013 the few hundred basis points that I talked about are just from the foreign exchange flipping from a tailwind this fiscal year to a headwind next year and from the dilution. So, it is \u2013 so you can see the magnitude just from those to temporal items. And that foreign exchange flip, I think at least at current rates, we would say, is much more than modest. And so that\u2019s why we point them out. Matt Miksic : Great. Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Matt. Next question please, Win. Operator : Next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Go ahead Larry. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, just one on the recovery and related one on China. It looks like January was soft given your comments at JPMorgan and the results today. So, what \u2013 a little bit more color on what you have seen in February and the confidence in the Q4 guidance. It does imply a pretty significant increase, I think sequentially. And just lastly, on China, it was flat in Q3 versus growing high teens in the second quarter. Any color on that and how you guys are thinking about VBP there? Thanks for taking the question. Geoff Martha : Sure. Larry, on the first part of the question, yes, omicron impacted cases and it caused a broad-based absenteeism, right. And we use the word absenteeism to separate it from healthcare worker shortage. And the healthcare worker shortage, I think is more \u2013 is going to last longer into FY \u201823 versus the absenteeism, and that\u2019s driven by all the things you have heard about like burn out, people leaving the workforce, versus absenteeism was more short-term and acute caused by just the broad number of Omicron cases. And absenteeism applies not just to healthcare workers, but our own employees working in factories and our distribution centers, our suppliers, it was broad-based. And so that absenteeism, plus the COVID cases suppressing elective cases in hospitals, that peaked the second half of January and into the first half of February. And trends are now favorable, as we highlighted \u2013 indicated with our Q4 guidance. And we think procedure volumes will improve throughout March and April and back to pre-COVID levels by the end of our fiscal Q4. However, you still have these chronic staffing shortages that will be \u2013 from what we are hearing from hospital administrators persist, into FY \u201823, but how \u2013 into 2023, sorry. But they are \u2013 they will be mitigated by these traveling or temporary staff, where the hospitals are just paying more for these employees and technologies like remote monitoring and telehealth. And so we think that those mitigants will allow them to get back to the normal levels. But it will maybe limit them from going 110% or 120% of pre-COVID levels like we saw in prior waves, prior to Delta and Omicron. So, that\u2019s how we are seeing it, and it does imply a big improvement here in Q4. But we don\u2019t see that hospitals have a capacity to kind of handle 110%, 120% kind of levels like we have seen in other waves. So, I hope that answers that question. And then maybe on the China piece, I will turn that over to Karen. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Geoff. On China, it was a bit flat in Q3 and we did see some regional tenders happening or beginning to happen in the trauma space. And as we see those tenders happening, the channel slows down their buying. So, that just happens in advance. But just on VBP in general in China, we do expect the government to focus on the top 10 medical device products by public insurance spending. And as you know, we have been through stents and other industry players have gone through large joints. I mentioned, we are now seeing this regional trauma tender. And we see two more potential national tenders on that list where we have exposure, and that would be in spine and surgical stapling. And obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty around these tenders, including timing. But just so you know, if you look at our spine and stapling business in China, our gross exposure is somewhere between 1% to 1.5% of the total company revenue. And based on what we experienced with stents, there should be offsets to that ultimate \u2013 to the ultimate number, so that the net would be less than the gross that I mentioned, because we have got pull-through of products and we will obviously be working those. We are anticipating at least one of those tenders to happen in FY \u201823. And these are among the things that put pressure on the plus side of our long-term 5% plus goal for next year. So, I hope that\u2019s helpful. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you so much Karen. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Larry. Next question Win. Operator : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Geoff Martha : Yes, sure, Joanne. How are you doing? Joanne Wuensch : I am doing okay. Thank you for taking my question. I want to just build off of Karen\u2019s last comments on the plus side of the 5%, somewhat for next year, but even the year after that, what needs to happen in order for you to get there? And specifically, I do have a number of investors who think or say they can\u2019t get the plus side without a diabetes turnaround. Geoff Martha : Well, I think what I like about our position right now is the breadth of the \u2013 the strength of the current portfolio and the strength and breadth of the pipeline. And we have several drivers. There is a lot of focus on \u2013 obviously, on Hugo, and we talked about that and we are feeling good there. And certainly, by that time, we will work through some of these manufacturing and supply chain issues. And we are feeling really good about the quality of what we have here and the impact that Hugo is going to have. We will get the Ardian data readout as well. And I will come back \u2013 we talked about diabetes. But beyond that, you have got things like \u2013 and I will just highlight a few, and I will start in cardiovascular, you got our EV-ICD coming, we see that market to be $2 billion to $3 billion. And then our Cardiac Ablation Solutions business there for Afib, we have got PFA. Of course, our DiamondTemp rollout is \u2013 will peak, and we have got PFA coming. In MedSurg, beyond Hugo, SI is hitting a nice part of its product cycle here. There is a number of products that will have an impact coming in SI. And then our neuroscience portfolio just across the board is well positioned. You heard in the commentary about neuromodulation with DPN in pain, ECAPs in pain, and that\u2019s strength-on-strength because our DTM is doing well there. You got DBS with the sensing and the closed loop. Pelvic health, that market continues to be a stronger growth market and we have got a great product line up there. ENT will be adding Intersect. And I really believe our spine business is poised with the broad base of enabling technology and just where that market is going. It definitely favors us. And then you heard today that neurovascular is back to gaining share. We have \u2013 over the years, we have relied on that. So, it\u2019s a broad base of technology. And I think with the new operating model, I expect it to keep refilling that pipeline up, that\u2019s the focus. So, that\u2019s what I would say. We feel good about \u2013 as Karen said, there is more puts and takes next year than normal for sure, and she has gone through that, I think in good detail. But the \u2013 we are committed to the long-term plan, and it starts with this top line growth. And based on the broad nature of it, we feel good. And getting back to Diabetes, remember, we do have the 780G with the Guardian 4 sensor. We will have a new sensor beyond that in that timeframe with Simplera. And that Simplera sensor could also be paired with our pen from companion and creating a whole new vector of growth for our diabetes business there with smart pens paired with our sensor. So, there is a number of drivers there. And you take it all, it doesn\u2019t all need to happen to get to that 5% plus once you get past FY \u201823. Karen Parkhill : And Joanne, I just want to emphasize from the \u2013 from my seat, that we are really confident in that 5% plus over the long-term. And it is because it\u2019s not dependent on any one thing, but it\u2019s the strength of the pipeline that Geoff mentioned. Joanne Wuensch : Excellent. Thank you so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Joanne. Next question Win. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Ryan Weispfenning : Hi Danielle. Danielle Antalffy : I am so sorry. Can you guys hear me okay? Ryan Weispfenning : Yes, we can hear you. Just fine. Danielle Antalffy : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. And appreciate all the commentary you guys provided as we look out over the next fiscal year. Just a quick question as you think about the ramp in major new product launches. So, you have talked about Hugo a little bit here, but there is obviously also RBN. And just to follow-up on Joanne\u2019s question, I guess as we think about fiscal \u201824 and beyond, so beyond the next fiscal year, how we should be thinking about that ramp? I know we are waiting for the data. But has anything changed as far as thinking about contribution for some of these major new product launches? Thank you so much. Geoff Martha : Well, on the Ardian question, maybe I will pull in Sean Salmon here to provide an update on Ardian. Sean Salmon : So Geoff, I think the data readout on Ardian, we are expecting now in that kind of late fall, early winter timeframe of this calendar year. But there may be a milestone in between now and then and give you more confidence. We have the 3-year data from the pilot trial ON MED\u2019s being presented at ACC this year. And why that\u2019s important is that will be the first time we have had randomized data with long-term follow-up. So, the question around how long does the effect last? It doesn\u2019t wear out. That\u2019s going to be really important for payers. It\u2019s an important inflection point. But we remain very confident. All the body of evidence that we had for Ardian has continued to be very consistent, and we are making preparations to really go after a blockbuster launch here. Geoff Martha : Good. And another one that we have mentioned a little bit in the commentary, Danielle, that maybe I will have Brett Wall comment on is two things in pain. Our pain business is already well positioned with our DTM. But the diabetic peripheral neuropathy and the ECAPs submission, do you want to comment on those two things, Brett, because I think they are pretty meaningful. Brett Wall : Yes, sure. Danielle, these two things are pretty meaningful. We received the diabetic peripheral neuropathy approval about 2.5 years before we anticipated that. We think that\u2019s a market that, as Geoff said in the commentary, is going to grow to $300 million pretty quickly. We are well positioned with that. And the data there that we submitted is very strong data, and it\u2019s reflective of the other data that has been presented in that same field. So, we have every right to win there, and we will be investing and moving accordingly. In addition, we submitted late last year our ECAPs filing. And ECAPs is a closed-loop algorithm that will be utilized in SCS. And we are back to gaining share, really across the neuromodulation portfolio, but in SCS in particular with DTM and now with the embodiment of our stimulation programs with the sensing capability to close the loop and allow for really more effective therapy there. So, the entirety of this portfolio is set up as the markets recover and as procedures recover, as we wind down Omicron for share gain and growth across the field with more effective therapies in this entire area. Geoff Martha : Yes. And so just last comment on that. I mean look, obviously, they are both great opportunities. But the other piece that I really like about them is just how we did this, right. These \u2013 in both cases, you had smaller and in one case with ECAP start-up, smaller focused companies that signaled the innovation here. Historically, we haven\u2019t moved that fast and now we are moving at a much faster pace. And I just love the way we put these focus teams on there, gave them this challenge in both of these instances to move fast, don\u2019t sacrifice quality but move fast. And this is the type of thing that we want to see \u2013 we are starting to see across the portfolio with the new operating model, with the leaders we have in place, with some of the new leaders we brought in from outside the company. And like I said earlier, also now beyond innovation, moving on to really improving our capabilities in our end-to-end supply chain to make sure that it\u2019s reliable and it sets us up from a cost position as well. So, like where the company is headed, like those two examples in particular. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Danielle. And I apologize, we are not going to be able to get to all the analysts today, but we do have time for one more question. Can we take that Win? Operator : Our final question comes from Rick Wise at Stifel. Go ahead Rick. Rick Wise : Thanks Win. Good morning Geoff. Hi Karen. Maybe just given your commentary about and the appreciation for your stepped-up R&D spending and your comment about using a portion of cash flow for continuing M&A sort of in a sense an extension of R&D, can you talk a little more, just give us your latest thinking on how your reflections on your targets? Are there a lot of opportunities? Are there a lot of opportunities to increase your minority investments? Where are you \u2013 what are you prioritizing for the calendar year and the next several years? What are you targeting? Just any updates would be very welcome. Thank you. Geoff Martha : Sure. Rick, great to hear from you. Thanks for that question. I will answer it a couple of ways. One, this is separate. These tuck-in acquisitions and venture investing, that\u2019s separate from the broader portfolio comments I made earlier. This is what we view part of our everyday business here is doing tuck-ins. And so a couple of things I would say. One, we have stepped up our venture investing. We separated our venture team maybe 2 years ago from our M&A team to have more focus. We have separate operating mechanisms with these \u2013 with this team, that Karen, myself and several others from the Executive Committee participate in. And so we have stepped up those investments. And a lot of those investments, some of them are just debt or equity, but some of them are more structured investments to give us opportunities down the line. So, that is significantly up. And then on the acquisition space, I was hoping, like I said in prior calls, that during COVID, evaluations would go down a bit and present opportunities. That didn\u2019t happen initially, but valuations have come down a bit. And our pipeline is fuller than it has been over the last 2 years. You see the Intersect deal. That Intersect deal for ENT that we announced and the Affera deal for our Ablation Solutions business, those are the type of like acquisitions in that billion \u2013 multibillion dollar range that have \u2013 in the case of Intersect ENT, will have an immediate impact because they have got meaningful revenue. The Affera deal, it will take a little bit longer. It\u2019s still earlier in development, but hugely impactful. What I like about that deal is how it repositions our \u2013 really strengthens our ablation business there by providing the MapNav and complements our PFA offerings. So, we are seeing things across the board, if you will. Particularly, I would say, a lot of interesting things in neuroscience, a lot of interesting things in the cardiology space as well. So, that\u2019s how I would answer that question. Rick Wise : Thank you very much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Rick. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Geoff Martha : Okay. Alright. Thanks, Ryan. Okay. Look, thanks, everybody, for the great questions. And we appreciate \u2013 certainly appreciate your support and your continued interest in Medtronic. And look, we obviously \u2013 Karen outlaid \u2013 outlined some of the puts and takes that we have that we are working through. But we also have like some extraordinary opportunities in the marketplace and you combine that with the changes that we have made in the company and continue to make that I think are having a meaningful impact, I am confident in our ability to work \u2013 move past these \u2013 work through these challenges and move past these challenges and deliver on these opportunities and deliver on that plan, that long range plan that we have outlined. And we are steadfast in our commitment to deliver durable and higher growth. So look, we hope you join us for our Q4 earnings webcast, which we anticipate holding on May 26, where we will update you on how we finish the fiscal year and then even a more detailed look ahead at fiscal \u201823. So with that, thanks for tuning in today. Please stay healthy and safe, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning. I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. And I appreciate that you're joining us today for Medtronic\u2019s Fiscal Year 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Video Webcast.  Before we go inside to hear prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022, which ended on April 29, 2022, and our outlook for fiscal year \u201823. After our prepared remarks, our portfolio executive VPs will join us and we'll take questions from the sell side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour.  Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements, and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.  During today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC. And we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.  Unless we say otherwise all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis. And revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which this quarter includes only adjustments for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last four quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth.  References to sequential revenue changes compared to the third quarter of fiscal \u201822 and are made on an as reported basis. And all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the first calendar quarter of 2022 compared to the first calendar quarter of 2021, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into this studio and get started. Geoff Martha : Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. This morning we reported our Q4 results. Now there were parts of the quarter that played out as anticipated, and there were also some unexpected challenges more than I would have liked, which caused us to come up short of our expectations. As we anticipated procedure volumes in most of our markets reached pre-COVID levels by the end of the quarter. We also executed and delivered on recent product launches. However, we faced challenges related to supply chain in China that impacted some of our businesses, and were the largest contributors to our shortfall.  Now, I\u2019ll get into more detail on these challenges shortly, but you should take away that we understand the root causes, and we are well down the path to addressing them. And to be prudent however, we've assumed that these challenges will persist for the next quarter or two in the guidance that Karen is going to walk you through shortly. So let's focus on what happened this quarter. The shortfall to our revenue guidance was primarily due to two factors. China, where the extended COVID lockdowns affected our results in the quarter, particularly in April, and global supply chain challenges. Over the past few quarters global supply chain challenges have impacted many of our businesses. And as they arise, our teams have worked quickly to resolve them. And prior to this quarter, we had largely mitigated their financial impact. However, this quarter one of our largest businesses, Surgical Innovations, was adversely affected by certain raw material shortages. And this resulted in large back orders and caused our SI revenue to come in well below our expectations.  Several of our other businesses also face supply challenges in the quarter, but to a lesser extent. Now we're down the path of improving our supply chain capabilities. And we're leveraging the expertise that Greg Smith, our new Global Ops and Supply Chain leader brings from the retail consumer product and automotive industries. Greg and his team are making progress addressing the areas where we can improve, including the management and resiliency of our critical suppliers and manufacturing network.  The recent stress of these global supply chain issues has further illuminated the need for the enhancements. We have a new global structure in place that consolidates operations and supply chain functions, which were previously fragmented throughout the organization. Now, this is a big move for us. And there is still a lot of work to be done. But I am confident we will come out of this with a more resilient end-to-end global supply chain that we believe will be a competitive advantage in our industry. While some of our Q4 challenges will persist in the near term, we expect strong improvement in the back half of our fiscal year. And we remain focused on delivering our long-term strategies. We've made significant changes over the past two years to position the company for accelerated and sustained innovation driven growth. Our pipeline is robust and continues to advance with a number of upcoming catalysts and fast growing medtech markets. We're committed to creating strong returns for our shareholders, and we're making progress with our enhanced portfolio management and our capital allocation processes. We're investing in future growth drivers, while at the same time returning capital primarily through our meaningful and growing dividend, which we just increased again today by 8%. Regarding portfolio management, we are continuing to advance the robust process we began talking about earlier this year. And within that, and as a smaller initial step, we're pleased to announce that we've reached an agreement where we will contribute our Renal Care Solutions business into a new company, which we will jointly own with DaVita. In return we\u2019ll receive up to $400 million in value from them and we expect this transaction will close in calendar 2023. The new company is going to develop a broad suite of novel kidney care solutions, including home-based products.  I'm excited about this for a couple of reasons. First, this business is going to have the focus that it needs. Second, DaVita is a global leader in kidney care and will be a great partner to commercialize and scale this innovative technology. And finally, both Medtronic and DaVita will participate in the expected upside.  Now turning to market share, product availability affected our performance in the quarter with our overall company share down about a half a point. On the bright side, even with our challenges, half of our businesses held or gained share. And as you know, market share is an important metric for us at Medtronic as it is a driver of our annual variable compensation, along with revenue growth, profit, and free cash flow. Well, I won't go through market share business by business in the interest of time, we'll be happy to take questions in Q&A. Now, let's cover our product pipeline, where we're advancing several meaningful technologies that can create new markets, disrupt existing ones, and accelerate the growth profile of Medtronic. We made great strides with organic pipeline in fiscal \u201822, conducting over 300 clinical trials and receiving over 200 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. Our recent product launches are starting to make an impact across our businesses. And as we look ahead, we have increasing visibility to upcoming catalysts in the back half of the calendar year that we expect will help accelerate our growth as we go through fiscal \u201823 and beyond.  Starting with our Cardiovascular Portfolio and Cardiac Rhythm Management, recently launched Leadless Pacemakers, including our Micra AV in Japan and Micra VR in China led to above-market growth again this quarter. We just received approval for Micra AV in China earlier this month. And we expect geographic expansion to continue to drive strong Micra growth.  In ICDs, we're preparing to disrupt the single-chamber market with our Aurora extravascular ICD. We continue to drive towards CE Mark approval for Aurora later this calendar year and U.S. approval next year. With Micra and EV-ICD, we expect continued strength in CRM. In Cardiac Ablation Solutions, we've been assembling a number of technologies to increase our impact in the $8 billion EP ablation market, building on our leadership in cryoablation. We're continuing the rollout of our DiamondTempt RF system and exclusive cryoablation first-line indication for paroxysmal AF. We're advancing our Pulsed Field Select anatomical pulsed field ablation system having fully enrolled our global pivotal trial. We're also expecting to fill competitive gaps in cardiac ablation with our recent announcements to add a differentiated mapping and navigation system and left heart access portfolio including a transseptal access system that can perform both mechanical and RF crossings. In renal denervation, data from our SPYRAL HTN-ON MED pilot study were presented last month at ACC and simultaneously published in the Lancet. These data demonstrated durable and clinically significant blood pressure reductions through three years. And last week, additional data were presented at EuroPCR which showed those receiving [RDN] (ph) spent significantly more time in target blood pressure range, adding to our robust body of evidence. In Q4, we also announced that we completed enrollment in the full cohort of patients in the ON MED study, which we expect to complete the six-month follow-up in the second half of this calendar year. We'll then look to present the data and submit for FDA approval as ON MED is the final piece of our submission. In Structural Heart, differentiated durability data for our TAVR valves were presented as a late breaker at ACC last month. The data showed that our TAVR platform is the only one to outperform surgical valves in durability at five years as measured by SVD or Structural Valve Deterioration. And less SVD was associated with better clinical outcomes, including mortality and heart failure hospitalization.  Additionally, durability data were presented from a separate UK registry, the first to look at TAVR data past 10 years. And it showed CoreValve had one-third the rate of structural valve deterioration compared to SAPIEN and SAPIEN XT. And data at EuroPCR last week reinforced our excellent clinical outcomes with our cusp overlap implant technique, including one-day hospital discharge, single-digit pacemaker rates and the absence of moderate or severe PBL. In the quarter, we also continued to launch Evolut PRO+ in Europe and began the launch of Evolut Pro in China, our first entry into this large and underpenetrated market. In the U.S., we're planning to start the limited market release of our next-generation TAVR valve, Evolut FX here in our first fiscal quarter and move into full market release later in the fiscal year. We're also looking to expand our TAVR indications. We had first enrollment earlier this month in our EXPAND TAVR 2 pivotal trial, evaluating our TAVR platform in patients with moderate symptomatic aortic stenosis. Overall, TAVR represents a large growth driver for Medtronic as we expect this roughly $5.5 billion market to exceed $7 billion within the next three years and reach $10 billion in the next five years. Moving to our MedSurg portfolio and Surgical Robotics, we remain focused on the limited market release of our Hugo robot while we scale production. We completed Hugo installations in Denmark, France and Italy. We also continue to increase our installed base of Touch Surgery Enterprise, our AI-powered surgical video and analytics platform. In our Patient Monitoring business, we just received FDA clearance earlier this month for our next-generation Nellcor OxySoft pulse ox sensor. Now this sensor includes a special silicon adhesive designed to protect fragile skin while enhancing adherence. Its low profile and brighter LEDs improve accuracy and responsiveness for the most challenging neonatal and adult critical care patients. Now turning to our Neuroscience portfolio and our Cranial & Spinal Technologies business. We're seeing strong adoption of our unit AI-enabled surgical planning platform with a mid-30 sequential growth in our U.S. user base. The ongoing launch of our Catalyft expandable titanium interbody system and the rollout of our enabling technologies continues to differentiate us in spine. Customer demand for our Catalyft equipment remains strong. And we had record quarters for our Mazor robotics system and StealthStation navigation system. In Neuromodulation, we're building our commercial teams and have started the initial launch of our Intellis and Vanta spinal cord stimulators to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy. We believe DPN is one of the largest opportunities in medtech, and we expect the market to reach $300 million by FY '26, with an annual total addressable market of up to $2 billion. And we're also excited about our Inceptiv ECAP\u2019s closed loop spinal cord stimulator, which we submitted to the FDA late last calendar year. We expect Inceptiv\u2019s closed-loop therapy, which optimizes pain relief for patients to revolutionize the SCS market. In Brain Modulation, our ongoing launch of the Percept PC neurostimulator and SenSight directional leads is driving new implant share in both Europe and the U.S. And this is the only system that can stimulate and sense brain signals. In Pelvic Health, we received FDA approval of our next-gen InterStim recharge-free device, InterStim X, and that was happened in the fourth quarter. InterStim X features our proprietary fifth-generation battery chemistry that provides 10 to 15 years of battery life without the need to recharge. And in ENT, we announced earlier this month that we completed the acquisition of Intersect ENT. And we're excited to add their attractive high-growth complementary products into our existing business. We believe we can grow Intersect's products in the double digits over the next several years as we expand use of both the PROPEL and SINUVA sinus implants globally. In Diabetes, our MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with our Guardian 4 sensor continues to be extremely well received in markets where it's available. Now this system has a very positive user experience with no fingersticks and more time and range. This is due to its near real time basal insulin and auto correction boluses every five minutes to address underestimated carbohydrate counts and occasional mismeal doses. Very strong data on 780G and Guardian 4 were presented at ATTD last month, showing improved time and range with less user interaction. Additional datasets on this differentiated system will be shared at ADA next month. And we also announced that Germany and France began reimbursement of our system in the quarter, which helped drive high-teens sequential international growth in diabetes. And in the U.S., we made substantial progress in meeting our observation and warning letter commitments, and continue to have regular communication with the FDA. In our CGM pipeline, we expect to submit our next generation sensor, Simplera, for CE Mark and FDA approval this summer. In addition, we're advancing multiple next gen sensor and pump programs, including patch pumps. We're making considerable investments in our diabetes pipeline with line of sight to restoring strong growth in this business over the coming years. And with that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our fourth quarter financial performance, and our new guidance for the next fiscal year. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Geoff. Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased 1.4%, below our guidance and consensus. Compared to consensus, about 15% of the difference can be attributed to China, given recent COVID shutdowns and slowing distributor purchases in spine ahead of a potential national volume based tender.  About 10% of the difference is a result of changes in foreign exchange rates over the course of the quarter. And the remaining difference and the largest driver is due to supply chain issues that Geoff discussed. Despite revenue coming in roughly $350 million less than we expected, we reduced the impact that this would have had on our bottom line, resulting in EPS of $1.52, $0.04 below our guidance range. From a geographic perspective, our U.S. revenue declined 2%. Non-U.S. developed markets grew 4% and our emerging markets grew 7%. Within emerging markets, China declined 10%, given the impact of the COVID lockdowns. But we had very strong growth in many other emerging markets, including high-teens growth in Eastern Europe, low-20s growth in Latin America, low-30s growth in the Middle East and Africa, and mid-30s growth in South Asia. In fact, excluding China, emerging markets grew in the low-20s. Turning to our margins, our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin improved by 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by product mix with lower sales of ventilators and higher sales of products like Micra. While we were impacted by inflation with increased freight expense, it's worth noting that the full impact from inflation on raw material and direct labor costs will be realized over the next couple of quarters as our inventory rolls off our balance sheet, negatively affecting our gross margin. Moving down the P&L, we also drove additional and continued improvement in our adjusted operating margin, which increased by 40 basis points, excluding the benefit from currency. We also ended the year with free cash flow at $6 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 22% and meeting our goal of 80% conversion from adjusted net income.  Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to allocate our capital to investments that we expect will generate solid future growth and shareholder returns. We're investing heavily in R&D, with programs especially targeted for faster growing medtech markets or where we have an opportunity to create new markets.  We're also using our balance sheet to complement our innovation-driven growth strategy with tuck-in M&A, utilizing our very active capital committee process that was developed as part of our new operating model. In fiscal '22, we announced four acquisitions totaling over $2.1 billion in total consideration. As Geoff mentioned, we closed our acquisition of Intersect ENT earlier this month, and also announced our intent to acquire a left heart access portfolio last month. At the same time, we're investing in promising early stage ventures to keep our fingers on the pulse of new products and technologies, incubated by companies that one day could become future acquisitions. We're also actively providing strong return to our shareholders, returning $5.5 billion in fiscal '22 through our dividend and net share repurchase. And this morning, we announced that we're increasing our dividend by 8%, reflecting the confidence we and our board have in our financial strength and future earnings power. We are an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, having increased our dividend for 45 years now. And our dividend is an important component of the total return we generate for our shareholders.  This past year, we paid $3.4 billion in dividends and we're supplementing that through opportunistic share repurchase, particularly in periods where we see share price dislocation. In fact, we repurchased over 2.5 billion of our stock in fiscal '22, including 1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Now turning to our guidance and starting with revenue. We continue to expect our recent launches and product pipeline to make a difference in many of our businesses. And Geoff covered many of them earlier.  We expect organic revenue growth in fiscal '23 of 4% to 5%. While the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a negative impact on full year revenue of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 5.5% to 6.5%; Medical Surgical to grow 3.5% to 4.5%; Neuroscience to grow 5% to 6%; and Diabetes to decline 6% to 7%, all on an organic basis. While we are hopeful that we can receive approval for 780G and Guardian 4 Sensor in the United States, we've elected not to include it in our guidance. In the first quarter, we would have you model organic revenue to decline in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%, which conservatively assumes no near term improvement in our supply chain and no major change to underlying fundamentals. Assuming recent exchange rates hold, the first quarter would have a currency headwind between $350 million and $400 million.  By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to decline 1% to 2%; Medical Surgical to decline 7.5% to 8.5%; Neuroscience to be down 5% to 6%; and Diabetes down 8% to 10%, all on an organic basis. Moving down the P&L, I provided early color for fiscal '23 on the last quarterly earnings call, where I talked about the expected impact of inflation, wages, acquisition dilution and foreign exchange headwinds. These still hold, but we've also seen environmental changes since late-February. Inflation and foreign exchange rates have become larger headwinds, and we're now factoring in continued supply chain challenges early in the year. Inflation and FX pressures also create near-term challenges on our margins, although we continue to look for opportunities to offset them. At the same time, we continue to prioritize our long-term investments in organic R&D, with a focus on large opportunities in future growth markets, like renal denervation, robotics, diabetic peripheral neuropathy and transcatheter mitral valves. Taking this all into account on the bottom line, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.53 to $5.65 in fiscal '23, which includes an unfavorable impact of $0.20 to $0.25 from currency at recent rates, for the first quarter, we expect EPS of $1.10 to $1.14, including an FX headwind of about $0.05 at current rates. Before I send it back to Geoff, I want to thank our employees around the globe who are working hard to overcome the macro challenges we face. Thanks for all you do to fulfill our mission every day. Back to you, Geoff. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Karen. While we spent a lot of time covering the fourth quarter, it's worth briefly reflecting on what we've accomplished in fiscal '22. It's certainly been a difficult environment, and our organization has enacted big changes in such a short period of time and under unique circumstances to better position the company.  It was our first full year in the new operating model, and with our enhanced Medtronic mindset of acting boldly, competing to win, moving with speed and decisiveness, fostering, belonging and delivering results the right way.  We've also made strides to becoming a more diverse and inclusive organization. And I was very proud that Medtronic was recognized earlier this month as number 10 on Diversity Inc.'s Top 50 U.S. Companies for Diversity. Even with that, we're committed to improving through innovative programs to attract, develop and retain top talent from all gender and ethnic backgrounds. Along those lines, we've made notable hires in fiscal '22, recruiting great talent from healthcare technology industry and beyond. While we've implemented a number of changes, this past year has been choppier than I would have liked with some of our growth drivers being pushed out and the impact from the pandemic, quality challenges and supply chain affecting our results.  But we have a clear direction, a clear direction where we're headed as we transform the company. Let's start with the top-line. We remain laser-focused on accelerating the growth through robust capital allocation and portfolio management. You're seeing our efforts to enhance our future growth through greater investment in organic R&D, as well as portfolio moves. We've already spoken of the organic growth catalysts in front of us, many coming later this fiscal year. We're also executing a healthy cadence of tuck-in acquisitions in faster-growing markets, and we're focused on reducing our footprint in lower growth and lower-margin businesses. We continue to work on additional portfolio moves with the goal of creating a portfolio where we have distinct expertise, synergies across the company and ultimately, higher growth and higher margins. And to aid this effort, we've assembled a dedicated team that is 100% focused on our integrations and divestitures. At the same time, we have the opportunity to improve our global supply chain and operations by centralizing these activities, allowing us to leverage our scale, invest in new technology and ensure we have world-class supply chain experts responsible for our global operations.  And this isn't something new that we're just starting now. Although recent challenges have given us a greater sense of urgency, we've been on this journey for over a year. And while it will take time, I fully expect our efforts to drive lower cost and lead to consistent and reliable quality along with greater product availability, all on a sustainable basis. Now well beyond healthcare, our world is facing a lot of economic uncertainty with questions around inflation, global supply chain challenges and continued impacts from the pandemic and a potential recession. But our business, the business of health care and the delivery of essential lifesaving technology is something that continues in good times and uncertain times like these. And demand for our products continues to increase with the aging and growing of our global population. When you look at healthcare technology, Medtronic is uniquely situated, particularly in these uncertain times, given our diversified businesses with leading market positions in growth markets, a robust product pipeline, solid free cash flow, strong balance sheet, and a very attractive and growing dividend to add to our return to shareholders. We have near term challenges that we are overcoming. And the opportunities in healthcare technology and at Medtronic are immense. We are fully focused on continuing on our transformation journey and making our opportunities a reality as we alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of people around the world. Finally, I want to thank our exceptional Medtronic employees. I get to see the outcome of their efforts to fulfill our mission every day. It's inspiring. In addition, their willingness to lean into our new operating model and embrace our new culture have been key to the ongoing transformation of the company.  I also want to thank our partners in health care, the frontline workers who are at that final step in ensuring patients get our therapies and are dedicating their lives day in and day out. Their incredible efforts to continue care delivery and get us all through the pandemic will be noted as one of the great accomplishments in history. Now let's move to Q&A. We're going to try to get as many analysts as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question? A - Brad Lerman : [Operator Instructions] Today's Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Jeff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular portfolio and former Head of the Diabetes operating unit; Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the neuroscience portfolio.  [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Geoff and Karen, maybe I had a two part question. I'll ask both right away. When I look at the 4 to 5 organic guide for fiscal '23, perhaps it came in slightly better than expected. Can you talk about some specific assumptions around even -- you noted supply chain, there were some back orders. Is there some contribution from supply chain back orders? Any further disruption from supply chain? What are you assuming for diabetes, robotics?  I think China AVP is something that investors have asked. And Geoff, related to that, I think if I take a step back, the Medtronic pieces of mid-singles up high singles earnings. Consistency has been something that people have questioned. We've had some moving parts over the years. As you look at all the changes that have happened, -- maybe talk about what gives you the confidence that this consistency of mid-singles on the top and high singles on the EPS line should be something that investors should look forward to? Geoff Martha : Sure. Well, let me -- thanks for the question, Vijay. Maybe, I\u2019ll take the second part of that question, and then Karen can take the first part of the details behind the 4% to 5% for FY '23. But on the second part in terms of the confidence of getting to that constant mid-single digit currency top-line and high-single digit EPS growth or double-digit total return to shareholders. I do think we're putting the right things in place. So first of all, just over the next -- Karen can detail this, but over the next year, you'll see the acute back order issues that we faced in Q4. Those abate over the next quarter or so, and we can get into the details of that. In addition, we're definitely anniversarying a lot of things that hurt us in FY '22, like exiting the LVAD business, the Navion recall, some tough comps on our ventilator business during the height of the pandemic. So these things abate over -- these things go away over the course of the fiscal year and you're starting now, actually.  And then finally, we've got a lot of growth catalysts. We've talked a lot about the pipeline and I can go through that. There's a long list. I went through a lot of it in the commentary, but it's much broader than like the Hugo or our soft tissue robot, and already there's some big ones, but there's a whole lot of other ones as well.  And then -- so that -- those things kick in, in the second half of this year and then get even bigger in FY '24. And then finally, we've got some portfolio moves that over the next year or so, I think we'll -- that will add to this. So that's how we get from where we are to back to that, the numbers that you quoted. And then the second part of your question gets to kind of the confidence and the consistency. And I'd say there are two things. One is having this robust pipeline spread across all of our businesses. And we've been working hard over the last couple of years to double down on our innovation, putting more into R&D, the new operating model that we have the 20 operating units, we have a clear visibility into their end markets, their competition. People are getting evaluated on their pipeline, and we're putting more into R&D and as well as some meaningful tuck-in acquisitions, like we just mentioned Intersect ENT closing and in the cardiac ablation solutions space or the AFib space, the AFFERA acquisition. These are meaningful ads.  So that gives us diversity and more growth on the top-line. But the piece that we really have been focusing on over the last year and is important for our future in terms of consistency is the global operations and supply chain changes that we made. These are -- coming into this role, myself and the team identified this as an opportunity for us. Brought in Greg Smith, as we mentioned in the commentary over a year ago and really already centralized our supply chain. Our global ops and supply chain was really set up for a different era -- a pass there. And we had to make those changes.  And unfortunately, they haven't fully taken hold yet, any more time to mature. I would have liked to have this -- those moves done earlier. It definitely would have helped in Q4 because the supply chain issues came out fast and hard and especially in the back half of the quarter more supplier decommits than we've ever seen. But the good news is that we're not just getting started on this transformation of supply chain. I'd hate to be starting it now in the middle of this environment. We're well down the path and to building in that resiliency. We've made these moves and we're confident that these changes will give us that resiliency that we need and that dependability. So the combination of the innovation, plus some portfolio moves and just a more resilient global option supply chain. That's how we're confident that we get to the long range forecast that we talked about of consistent mid-single digits, that 5% plus, including the plus and the high-single digit EPS when you add in the dividend gets you a double-digit return. But in terms of -- I hope I answered that question. Karen can add to it. But in terms of the FY '23 guide and the details below that, I'll turn that over to Karen. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. Thanks, Vijay, for the question, and I'd love to take this in pieces because I want to walk you through Q1 and then also talk about the full year because we expect improvement each quarter as we move through the year.  So just starting with Q1, given our recent challenges, we've elected to take a conservative approach with our Q1 guide. We're assuming underlying fundamentals are pretty similar to last quarter to Q4, and we've built in some conservatism in the supply chain.  If you look at the year-over-year view, it's influenced by COVID. And so to remove that noise, I think it's really good to look at it on a COVID comp-adjusted basis. And when you do that, our guide really just implies a slight deceleration from Q4 to Q1. That's not out of line with what we've seen historically. And again, I would just emphasize that we've included conservatism due to the supply chain. Some puts and takes that we've got in Q1, in addition to the supply chain impact that we factored in, we've also assumed some incremental pressure in spine in China ahead of a potential national volume-based purchasing tender. And Geoff already mentioned on the plus side, we anniversary some of our headwinds like the Navion recall and the LVAD shutdown. If I move beyond Q1 and then into the full year guide of the 4.5%, I mentioned we do expect improvement as we progress through the quarters with our back half much better than our first half. But I'd also talk about the puts and takes that we've got on the full year. We talked about the fact that we continue to actively work with the FDA on the diabetes warning letter. But for conservatism, we've elected not to assume the approval of the 780G in this guidance. And also, it's manageable, but we've got volume-based pricing in China that we believe will have a bigger impact in this fiscal year, primarily in Spine. And at the same time, Geoff talked about it, and we have a number of positives as we think about FY '23. First, we've got headwinds that are going to go away, the LVAD business, the Navion recall, the reduced ventilator sales that Geoff mentioned. And then we also had some volume-based pricing on drug-eluting stents in China that will anniversary. And combined, all of those headwinds had a 200 basis point impact in FY '22. Second, we expect these supply chain challenges to improve as starting in Q2 and obviously continuing to improve from there.  And then thirdly, our year-over-year comps get easier, particularly in the back half. And then lastly, we've got a number of really important product launches throughout the year. And just to name a few of them, we've got Evolut FX, we've got ECAPs, we've got diabetic painful neuropathy. And again, I'm just naming a few. So I hope that's helpful and shows what our guidance implies as we move throughout the year. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful color. Thanks, guys. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Vijay. Next question, Brad? Brad Lerman : The next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'll ask a two part one as well. I guess, first on the elective procedure recovery. Curious how May is shaping up versus April kind of around the world, both in the U.S. and China as well.  And then the second part was going back to kind of some of the supply chain issues. The impact this quarter is a little bit worse than some of your peers. I don't know if things got a lot worse in April, or there was something specific with surgical innovations. I just want to make sure we have the confidence that, that's going to start to improve here in the next quarter or two. Geoff Martha : Sure. I'll take the second one first. The supply chain issues, yeah, they did -- look, they did -- no one's more disappointed about our Q4 miss than I am. And we got -- we believe we understand the root cause of that miss. And it really started hitting us in the second half of Q4. And I'd say that 75% of the miss is due to -- of the $340 million, $350 million miss is due to supply chain. 15 -- and I'll get into that in a second, maybe about 15% is due to the China lockdown and then maybe another 10% is FX getting worse, and Karen can talk about that.  But in the miss, the supply chain miss, it hit us across a number of businesses, but it was definitely the most pronounced in our Surgical Innovations business. And it was three things. It was semiconductors, which is affecting everybody that affected a number of businesses, but particularly in our SI business. It also was resins a particular resin that we use in our energy business and SI has been a major source of problem for us. And then packaging, our trade packaging there was a catastrophic explosion in our supply chain.  And so those last two ones, the packaging and the resins were the biggest issues, the biggest supplier decommits. And I'd say the biggest surprise, and most of that was in SI. We see this getting better over the next -- the SI one is -- overall for the company, we see the supply chain issues getting abating over the next quarter or two. The SI issues probably it will take more than a quarter or so, put it on the first half of the year to get through those issues. We factored all that into our guidance. I mentioned China. We have -- remember, we have April. This really hit us in April. We have April in our Q4, and that represented roughly about $60 million of the shortfall combination of the COVID lockdown. And Karen mentioned some of the volume-based procurement.  So other than China, our emerging markets, as Karen mentioned in the commentary, grew 20%. China was actually down 10% or more and the rest of emerging markets grew 20%. And so these -- like I said, these acute issues, I mentioned in the commentary and one of my answers were well down the path of remaking our global ops and supply chain to provide that resiliency that we just haven't had. And we started that over a year ago, centralizing the function and bringing in some -- building a very strong leadership team under Greg, bringing in new people from different industries, investing in all kinds of whether it be tools and technology and operating mechanisms for this.  And I know I'm confident we're going down the right path there. And I'm glad that we started when we did. I wish we would have started even earlier. So the long-term building those fundamentals will take some time. But the acute issues that hit our numbers will go away or get better over the next quarter or two.  I'll turn it over to Karen to answer the first part of the question. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. Travis, thank you. So just in terms of the month of May, it's still early. And we're obviously focused on managing through some supply issues that we've got in some of our businesses. So the numbers are a little cloudy, but when we look at our operating units that are not impacted by supply issues, just through the first three weeks of May, we're trending largely in-line with where we were first quarter last year. And I would note that elective procedures for the most part were back to pre-COVID levels for us last quarter. Geoff Martha : Okay. Thanks, Travis. Take the next question, Brad? Brad Lerman : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. Larry, please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just Geoff, on The Kidney Company news today, should we expect more like this? Or could they be more significant? Just kind of remind us of what the overarching goals are. And Bob, maybe on Hugo, just help us understand what the expectations are for fiscal '23, the status of the supply constraints and the preop setup error, and when you expect to start the U.S. pivotal trial. Thanks so much, guys. Geoff Martha : Okay. Nice to hear from you, Larry. Thanks for the question. On the Renal Care Solutions joint venture with DaVita, this is what I'd characterize as a smaller initial step in terms of our portfolio management work. That work continues, and we do anticipate that there could be more portfolio moves over the course of FY '22. I'm not going to comment on the size of those. But I'd characterize this is a smaller initial step. It's been under consideration for a while.  And like I said in the commentary, I am excited about this. This technology that we've been working on for years, I think DaVita, this joint venture will bring more focus to that finishing up the development. And then I think, obviously, DaVita as a leader in kidney care and will be a great partner as we commercialize and scale this innovative technology. They bring a lot to the table there. And I think we bring a lot to the table on the technology side and looking forward to it.  But as we move forward, I don't know that I'm not -- the other portfolio moves would be JVs or anything like that. For this one, this one just made the most sense. And we think there's a lot of upside in this technology and the way we structured this deal. Both DaVita and Medtronic will share in that upside. So looking forward to that. In terms of the goals of the portfolio work, they remain unchanged. Our North Star is durable growth, durable growth without taking a step back on margins and free cash flow. We just want a higher level of growth. And so we want to remake the portfolio for a higher [Indiscernible] and more consistency and growth. So that's the goal. And I think the other -- the secondary goal would be just to simplify the company a bit. So that's -- those are the goals. That's where we're headed and more to come. Bob White : Thanks, Geoff. And Larry, good to hear from you. Thanks for the question. Let me provide you a good update on Hugo. So we're still in limited market release. We're making good progress on the supply chain issues. We're currently in eight countries. We've had a number of installs this past quarter in France and Italy and Denmark. We did receive regulatory approval in Brazil in Saudi Arabia, and you'll recall this followed Canada and Australia.  We've begun general surgery cases in Panama, in Chile in India. And now we've done procedures across urology, gynecology and general surgery, including our first bariatric case, which was a nice milestone.  The second part of your question was relating to the IDE. We expect to begin the IDE relatively soon. We're working closely to train the site personnel and gain IRB approval. So we'll certainly keep posted on that. But hopefully that helps done a good thorough take for where we stand on Hugo. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Larry. Next question, please, Brad. Brad Lerman : The next question comes from Shagun Singh at RBC Capital Markets. Shagun, please go ahead. Shagun Singh : Thank you so much for taking the question. I was just wondering if you can give us an update on your portfolio management initiatives. What are you assuming for Hugo sales in your FY '23 guidance? And can you elaborate on the magnitude of China VBP impacted FY '23? And lastly, if you can just comment on the capital environment. We've heard some puts and takes. Q1 has been a little soft. Just what your outlook is for the full year. Thank you for taking the questions. Geoff Martha : Okay, all right. We've got some good music there for a second. But I'll start, maybe there was a couple of -- there's on a list there, so maybe Karen can help me out. But I'll start on the Hugo one. We haven't quoted Hugo numbers for FY '23, but I'll just say we expect a strong ramp. We got the order book is really strong. You heard Bob just give an update about all the countries we've got approvals in and the different type of procedures that we're now doing, various type of procedures, including general surgery procedures. So we're moving up the food chain there. So we really gained a lot of confidence that we have something in Hugo, and we see a nice ramp in FY '23. But we haven't quoted exact numbers.  In terms of the capital environment, capital for us in Q4 was a bright spot. And a lot of our capital that we sell are tied, directly tied to specific revenue-producing procedures, profitable procedures. I think that helps. And we had record numbers in the neuroscience space in our Spine business. We had a record number of sales of our StealthStation navigation, O-arm and Mazor. That capital equipment is at record highs for us. And we're really excited as we place those or we sell those -- that capital equipment, that's just further building out our ecosystem, which is our differentiating strength in the Spine business and portrays optimism for the future of that business. I'll turn it over to Karen for the other parts of the question. Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Geoff. The other two, you had a question on portfolio management, which I know Geoff shared when he answered Larry's question. So I'll cover China VBP. With VBP, we've been dealing with a variety of regional and national tenders already. And just from a national expectation we expect the government to continue to focus on the top 10 medical device products by public insurance spending. So we've been through stents already, and some of our other industry players have gone through large joints. And we see two more potential tenders on that list where we've got exposure, spine and surgical stapling. And I talked about the fact that we expect spine to impact us this fiscal year and to likely happen in the second quarter. But ahead of ahead of tenders, distributors do pull back on their purchases. So we built that into our first quarter guide as well. Just to remind you, though, our gross exposure for both spine and stapling in China somewhere between 1% to 1.5% of our total company revenue. So it is small. And based on what we experienced with the coronary tender, we do believe there could be offsets to the ultimate net impact number because we have pull-through of other product lines, and we'll be working on those. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Shagun. Let\u2019s go to the next question please, Brad. Brad Lerman : Yep. The next question comes from Josh Jennings at Cowen & Company. Josh, please go ahead. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask on the diabetes U.S. pump business. I know there's a lot of moving parts. But just with the further deceleration in fiscal 4Q, I was hoping you could share some insights in terms of why you think that's occurring. Is the warning letter in place kind of painting endocrine prescription patterns work or patient sentiment? Are you seeing incremental renewal pressure?  Just wanted to get a better sense and then how you see that U.S. pump business trending over the course of the year. And then any other incremental details you can share just on interactions with the FDA? And I know you pulled that out of your guidance for fiscal '23 and the 780G regarding for approvals. But what gives you hope that you could still see those approvals occur in this fiscal year? Thanks for taking the questions. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Josh for the questions. I'm going to turn it over to Sean here in a second, although he has officially moved on from that role to focus exclusively on our Cardiology portfolio. We have him on the call answering the diabetes questions this quarter.  And I'll just say a few words about Que Dallara. She joined the company here a couple of weeks ago and has taken over our diabetes business unit, and we couldn't be really excited about having Que. She's already diving right in, she's already at ATTD, and she'll be in some other upcoming diabetes meetings that you'll get to see her. And she'll be on our next earnings call to fuel these questions, and she's getting settled in now and is moving her family out to our Northridge, California site and really excited you'll get a chance to hear from her shortly. In the meantime, I'm going to field this question to Sean. So Sean, can you answer the question that Josh post? Sean Salmon : Yeah, sure. Josh, thanks for the question. So the dynamics on the revenue side of things are really all about the competitiveness in the United States. We grew sequentially quarter-on-quarter in EMEA by 20%, high-20s. And that's really based on the strong demand for that combination of 780 and the Guardian 4 sensor, which is now in 40 different countries. So everywhere we go, it's really picked up a lot of steam this past quarter that was driven by favorable reimbursement. We had no reimbursement in either France or Germany. We picked up that reimbursement and that really helped us drive that continued growth.  So within the U.S., the dynamic is obviously people waiting for the new technology to come before prescribing it for new patients or some patients not wanting to wait for it and moving on to competitive therapies. With regard to the warning letter progression, it's really -- as Karen said, we did conservatively lead that out of the guidance. I think that's prudent. But the most important thing we have to do is to improve and sustainably improve the quality system, which was outlined in those items that were in the 43 and the subsequent warning letter. And we've made excellent progress against those commitments.  We're more than 80% the way through fulfilling all those commitments. And it's also important to note that the 780 and Guardian 4 Sensor are under active review with the FDA right now. And we don't want to get ahead of the FDA on timing or predictions, and that's really the reason for the conservatism, but suffice it to say, there's a huge interest from patients. The technology continues to prove itself in real-world applications.  And you just see the numbers going up for both revenue, as well as the data we shared, the recent ATDD meeting, the coming up ADA. It's really a robust solution, a unique solution, where we're getting kids to time and range that has never been seen before. And that's during the day, overnight. And of course, it's worked for adults too at the highest time in range debt reported. So we're very confident that when we get the solution out, we'll turn the boat around. But I think for conservatism because we can't predict it. That's what's in the guidance. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Josh. Next question, please, Brad? Brad Lerman : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Joanne, please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Hi, how are you this morning. Geoff Martha : Hey, Joanne. Good to hear from you. Joanne Wuensch : So when I take a look at your guidance, you've got what, in your words are or is a pretty conservative first quarter, and then it ramps pretty aggressively throughout the remainder of the year. I know you don't like to give quarterly guidance, but just to sort of level set us so that we're not resetting the quarters as we go along. Talk us through how you ramp and what improves. And if you can just sort of give a classic like X percent in the first quarter, Y in the second quarter, et cetera, that would be really helpful. Just to sort of build out from here. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. Thanks, Joanne, for the question. I'm going to not give specific guidance for the other quarters. But I will let you know that we've got these things that anniversary through the quarter. So ventilator sales was up and down in the quarter. And I know Ryan can take you in the after call about those changes that that happen in ventilator sales.  And then obviously, we expect our biggest supply challenges this quarter and starting to improve in second quarter. So think about a ramp of revenue growth just getting better and better every quarter. And by the time you get to the back half, our year-over-year comps obviously get easier. And particularly in the fourth quarter, particularly in MedSurg, given the fourth quarter that we had. So think of strongest growth, obviously, in the fourth quarter as you ramp.  And that is in line with how we think about our product launches too going through the year. We've got some product launches that are helping us earlier in the year, and then more that will ramp as we go through the year.  So I know that Ryan can easily take you through some more of the detail, too. Joanne Wuensch : Appreciate that. And then for my second question, renal denervation you've completed the enrollment of the last piece of the puzzle. It sounds like data won't be presented in the fall, but we may get data in the spring. Are you thinking FDA approval mid next year, calendar year? Geoff Martha : Sean, you want to take that one? Sean Salmon : Yeah, Joanne, we will fill that last piece of the PMA, which is that last bit of data when we have it. And that would dictate the timing for the review clock starts. It's important to note that we've done a modular PMA. So every other part of this advice characterization, all the manufacturing modules has have already been reviewed and closed. So it's really this last piece of it that would go into the review. Joanne Wuensch : Excellent. Thank you and have a great day. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Joanne. Sean Salmon : Thank you, Joanne. Ryan Weispfenning : We have time for one more question, Brad. Brad Lerman : Sure. Our final question comes from Pito Chickering, Deutsche Bank. Pito, please go ahead. Pito, are you on mute? Pito Chickering : Yeah. There you go. Can you guys hear me now? Geoff Martha : Yes, we can. Pito Chickering : Great. Thank you for taking my questions here. This question is sort of pretty hard to answer, but I'll ask it anyway. We heard that the U.S. hospitals are beginning to defer procedures due to lack of contrast, dye supplies for interventional cardiology. Any chance you can let us know what you're seeing and hearing, what you're assuming is in your first quarter guidance? And what, if any, impact there is from outside the U.S. due to the shortages from GE? Karen Parkhill : Yeah, thanks, Pito, for that question. So contrast dye we believe it's a transient issue. It's mostly contained to the U.S. It is something that we're closely watching because it can impact our cardiovascular and neurosciences portfolios. But we do expect it to resolve within the quarter just based on what we're hearing. Many health systems in the United States have already instituted conservation measures. And we're working with them to see how we can help support them through thoughtful allocation. But at this stage, we've built our view of it into the guidance for the first quarter, and we do believe it's a transient issue getting better after the first quarter. Pito Chickering : A quick follow-up on the transaction with DaVita today. What was the organic growth rate of Renal Care Solutions, and kind of what is the strategic value you guys will DaVita set adding to their portfolio? Thanks so much. Geoff Martha : Well, I'll answer it. Thanks for the question, Pito. I'll answer the second part of it, the strategic value. I mean look, I think we both -- the transaction revolves around a big piece of the value creation will be us bringing some innovative home dialysis technologies to the market that the inherent in that technology is some something that we picked up from other businesses in Medtronic and the IP around it and the know-how. And we're building that into this home dialysis technologies. There will be a couple of different products. It drives up access, it lowers costs and there's a better patient experience. And we bring that to the table.  But just even just in the United States context, the dialysis market is pretty unique. And the go-to-market channel is not something that we have any kind of synergies with. And so DaVita brings one, that channel that access to these customers, and they have a lot of -- obviously, they're a leader in kidney care, so they bring a lot of clinical expertise as well.  So I think it really is regarding the home dialysis technology. It is 1 plus 1 definitely equals more than 2 here. And we're excited about it. We think it's going to have a big impact. And the way like I said before, the way we structured it we get to share in the upside with DaVita.  In terms of the other question the organic -- Karen Parkhill : It's about the growth in renal care, Pito, and it was low-single digits for us last fiscal year. It is a lower growth, lower margin business for us. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Pito. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Geoff Martha : Sure, thanks, Ryan. Okay. Well, thanks for the questions, everyone. And as usual, we appreciate your support and your continued interest in Medtronic. And look, I realize there's a lot to sort through here, including the macro issues of supply chain and China that surprises this quarter. But as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve conservatively factored these into our guidance going forward.  But I think more importantly, I hope you see that there is a clear direction a clear direction travel for the company where we\u2019re headed. It gets back to the some of the questions earlier like Vijay posed, in terms of us getting to that mid-single digit, 5% plus and the double-digit shareholder returns on a consistent basis. The things that we're doing, the new operating model that's driving the more innovation-driven growth the capital allocation and portfolio management to reposition our portfolio for higher growth.  And finally, the global operations and supply chain changes that we\u2019ve working on to provide that resiliency and provide that consistency that we need -- these are the right things to do. I'm confident -- I mean the macro environment has made it choppier to execute on these things, but we're heading in the right direction. We're making the right moves. And just again, this will benefit the company and get us where we need to go.  So we're looking forward to update you on the progress in our Q1 earnings program, which we anticipate owning on August 23. And so with that, thanks again for tuning in today. And please stay healthy and safe. And have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s Fiscal Year 2023 First Quarter Earnings Broadcast. I\u2019m Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. I\u2019m inside one of our Medtronic mobile labs, which is making a stop here at our operational headquarters in Minneapolis. These high-tech mobile classrooms will give about 5,000 U.S. clinicians every year the opportunity to train on some of our most advanced state-of-the-art technology, including our O-arm and StealthStation. As you can see, it\u2019s on 18 wheels. Our fleet of mobile lab trucks allows us to play big literally as they traverse the United States. In fact, with over 200 stops planned this fiscal year, they\u2019re likely coming to a hospital near you. Now before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I\u2019ll share a few details about today\u2019s earnings broadcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on July 29, 2022, and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the Executive VPs for each of our four segments will join us and will take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the Company. Today\u2019s program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today\u2019s program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC. And we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from our recent acquisition of Intersect ENT, references to sequential revenue changes compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822 and are made on an as-reported basis, and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the second calendar quarter of 2022 compared to the second calendar quarter of 2021, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let\u2019s head into the studio and hear about the quarter. Geoff Martha : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We reported our Q1 results this morning, and the quarter played out largely as expected. Our organization executed to deliver revenue ahead of our guidance and EPS that was in line with our guidance. Macro factors that we discussed with you and forecasted over the past few quarters, like supply chain, inflation and foreign exchange, along with difficult comparisons to the prior year, caused our revenue and EPS to decline. At the same time, there were several bright spots in the quarter across our businesses, including strength in pacing, cardiac surgery, U.S. core spine, neurovascular, diabetes in Europe and strong overall growth in many emerging markets. And as we look to the future, we have several near-term pipeline catalysts approaching that will accelerate growth. We\u2019re also making progress on our initiatives around quality and operating improvement. And in an uncertain economy, our business is well-positioned with our robust balance sheet, strong and growing dividend and leadership positions in many secular growth healthcare technology markets. So, taking a closer look at our Q1 results, as expected, acute supply chain disruptions impacted our performance, most notably, our Surgical Innovations business. We saw improvement in areas like packaging and resin supply as we progressed through the quarter. We also continue to manage semiconductor shortages across our businesses to minimize their impact on product availability as well as our financial results, and we\u2019re expecting these chip shortages to linger throughout our fiscal year. Overall, our operations teams have executed and worked closely with our suppliers to minimize impact, improving our order backlogs as we exited the quarter. We expect our overall supply chain issues to continue to improve as we move through the fiscal year. On the demand side, we\u2019re still seeing impacts to procedure volumes due to health professional labor shortages. And COVID is still causing procedure cancellations and deferrals in some pockets around the world. We see our hospital and physician customers are doing all they can to manage these dynamics. So, while procedure volumes in most of our markets remain at pre-COVID levels, we do have certain procedures or geographies where volumes are still lagging. Turning to market share. This is an important metric at Medtronic and is part of our annual incentive plan, along with revenue growth, profitability and free cash flow. And when we look at our quarterly market share performance, acute product availability challenges impacted our share capture opportunities in certain businesses, including surgical innovations and high-power CRM implants. We\u2019re also facing some competitive pressures in pelvic health and in diabetes, predominantly in the U.S. We\u2019re making good progress on the acute product availability issues and have pipeline plans in place to address competitive pressures over time. Now, let me highlight some of our bright spots. In CRM, our pacing business continues to outperform the market as our Micra leadless pacemaker family is driving strong growth around the globe as we enter new geographies and expand penetration in existing markets. Micra grew 15% in the quarter, including high-70s growth in Japan, mid-teens growth in Western Europe and high-30s growth in emerging markets. In CST, we had a good quarter in U.S. Core Spine, which grew 4%. We won market share on the strength of our overall portfolio, including our unit AI-enabled surgical planning platform and patient-specific implants, which had strong double-digit sequential growth in our U.S. user base. In addition, our recently launched Catalyft PL spinal system designed to target the TLIF and PLIF markets, drove meaningful results in Q1. And the breadth of our enabling imaging, navigation and robotic technologies is a key differentiator. In our Neuromodulation business, we are gaining initial implant share in both Pain Stim and DBS. In Pain Stim, the market continues to gravitate toward our Vanta recharge-free and Intellis with DTM rechargeable neurostimulators. And in DBS, customers value the differentiated sensing capabilities of our Percept PC system with our SenSight directional lead. In diabetes, we continue to see significant growth in markets outside the U.S. due to the increasing user base of our MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with our Guardian 4 sensor. The increase in this user base over the past couple of years is now driving significant recurring revenue growth for our CGM sensors and other supplies. In markets outside the U.S. where launched, the 780G and our Guardian 4 sensor has a very positive user experience with no fingersticks and more time and range. Now, this is due to its near real-time basal insulin and auto correction boluses every 5 minutes to address underestimated carb counts and occasional missed mealtime boluses. Now, let\u2019s move to our product pipeline, where we\u2019re advancing several meaningful technologies that can create new markets, disrupt existing ones and accelerate our growth. We continue to execute on our pipeline, having received over 200 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China over the past 12 months. And looking ahead, we have several near-term pipeline catalysts approaching that we expect will enhance the weighted average market growth rate of Medtronic. Now, starting with our cardiovascular portfolio in transcatheter valves. The limited U.S. market release of our Evolut FX valve is receiving an overwhelmingly positive customer reception. And we\u2019re excited about the impact this next-gen valve can have as we move to full market release this fall. Evolut FX enhances ease of use and provides implanters with greater precision and control during the procedure, and it maintains all the industry-leading hemodynamic and durability benefits of the Evolut platform. When you combine the FX launch in U.S., PRO+ launch in Europe and Evolut PRO launch in China, we feel really good about the opportunities in our TAVR franchise around the globe. TAVR is one of the largest growth drivers for Medtronic, and we expect the market, which is roughly $5.5 billion today, to exceed $7 billion within the next three years and reach $10 billion in the next five years. In cardiac rhythm management, we\u2019re really looking forward to disrupting the single-chamber ICD market with our Aurora extravascular ICD. Now, as you may know, one of our competitors has had a subcutaneous ICD in the market for many years, but it\u2019s remained a niche device given its limitations compared to conventional ICDs. With Aurora, we\u2019ve created a true game changer where the electrophysiologist and the patient don\u2019t have to make trade-offs. It will deliver the benefits of a traditional ICD, including having the same size, battery longevity and ability to use proven antitachy pacing in lieu of delivering a painful shock to terminate life-threatening arrhythmias. Aurora does all of this without having to place leads inside the heart. Our EV-ICD global pivotal data will be presented this weekend in a late-breaking session at the ESC Congress in Barcelona. We\u2019re also awaiting CE Mark approval for Aurora, and we expect U.S. approval next calendar year. In renal denervation, our breakthrough procedure to treat hypertension, we\u2019re nearing completion of the six-month follow-up for the full cohort of patients in our SPYRAL HTN-ON MED study. We\u2019ll then analyze the data and plan to present the findings in the next few months. This data will complete the final piece of our clinical module submission to the U.S. FDA as every other module has been submitted, reviewed and closed. The data on our simplicity blood pressure procedure is robust, including strong pivotal trial results and compelling real-world registry data from over 3,000 patients. And more recently, data has been presented that show already in patient spend nearly double the time and target blood pressure range through three years than those who received a sham procedure. This could have a profound effect on public health through the reduction of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure and CV mortality. And we expect to be a leader in this market, which we project to exceed $500 million by calendar year 2026 and $2 billion to $3 billion by 2030. Moving to our Medical Surgical Portfolio, which includes surgical robotics. We continue to execute on the limited market release of our Hugo robot. We\u2019re installing new systems and collecting clinical data in approved geographies, enhancing the system based on surgeon feedback, improving supply chain resiliency and scaling manufacturing production. Feedback and demand continue to be very strong. We\u2019ve made progress over the last quarter, and we\u2019re nearing the start of the U.S. IDE clinical trial for our urology indication. We also continue to increase our user base of Touch Surgery Enterprise, our AI-powered surgical video and analytics platform. With Touch Surgery Enterprise, surgeons can now easily review film from their surgeries to continuously improve and advance patient care. Overall, when it comes to surgical robotics, we\u2019re investing heavily to become a major player in the market for the long term, leveraging our decades of experience and leadership in minimally invasive surgery. Now turning to our neuroscience portfolio. In Neuromodulation, we\u2019ve submitted our inceptive ECAPs closed-loop stimulator. We expect inceptive\u2019s closed-loop therapy, which optimizes pain relief for patients to revolutionize the SCS market. We\u2019re also continuing to ramp our commercial activities to go after the diabetic peripheral neuropathy opportunity with our first cohort of DPN market development reps now trained. We believe DPN is one of the largest opportunities in med-tech, and we expect the market to reach $300 million by FY26 with an annual total addressable market of up to $2 billion. In diabetes, we\u2019re in active dialogue with the FDA on our regulatory submission for the MiniMed 780G with the Guardian 4 sensor and we remain focused on resolving our warning letter. We\u2019re making good progress on our warning letter commitments. We\u2019ve completed more than 90% of the actions we committed to the FDA. This represents substantial progress toward resolving the warning letter and preparing for reinspection. In our CGM pipeline, we submitted our next-generation sensor, Simplera for CE Mark. Simplera is disposable. It\u2019s easier to apply, and it\u2019s half the size of Guardian 4. The Simplera file is ready to submit to the U.S. FDA, and we\u2019re waiting to submit it as we\u2019re prioritizing the 780G Guardian 4 review. And with regards to our overall diabetes pipeline, we\u2019re making considerable investments, well above our corporate R&D average. We have a comprehensive pipeline of multiple next-gen sensor and pump programs, including patch pumps. This pipeline gives us confidence that we can restore strong growth to our diabetes business over the coming years. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Karen to discuss our first quarter financial performance and our guidance. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Geoff. Our first quarter organic revenue exceeded guidance, decreasing 3.6%. Adjusted EPS of $1.13 decreased 17%, in line with our guidance range. As we outlined on our last earnings call, we faced acute supply chain challenges in the quarter, particularly in our Surgical Innovations business. We also faced tougher underlying growth comparisons, including both strong ventilator sales and good procedure recovery following the third wave of COVID last year. Looking at our results from a geographic perspective, our U.S. revenue declined 9% and our non-U.S. developed and emerging markets both grew 2%. Our emerging markets growth was impacted this quarter by China, which declined 9%, given COVID lockdowns and volume-based procurement. However, our teams drove strong growth in many other markets, including high-teens growth in South Asia and Latin America, mid-teens growth in the Middle East and Africa, and low-double-digit growth in Southeast Asia. And when you exclude China, our emerging markets grew 13%. Turning to our margins. Our adjusted gross margin declined 230 basis points. The impact of the strengthening dollar drove 50 basis points of the decline, and the rest was primarily due to inflation on labor and materials as well as freight, given fuel surcharges and increased expedited shipments. As we said at the beginning of the year, we expect the impact from inflation and currency to continue to negatively affect our gross margin in the quarters ahead. I want to remind you, when you look at our R&D line, we had a recast of last year\u2019s IP R&D that we told you about last quarter. Without that recast, adjusted R&D expense would have grown 4% as we continue to prioritize investment into development programs across our businesses. While our operating margin declined 320 basis points on lower revenue and gross margin pressures, we do expect to show sequential improvement as our revenue growth accelerates through the year. And our balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to invest in future growth and return capital to shareholders. We continue to target returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, primarily through our strong and growing dividend. And we supplement these returns through opportunistic share repurchases. This past quarter, we repurchased $336 million, which is on top of the $2.5 billion we repurchased last fiscal year. We also continue to put the cash on our balance sheet to work, investing in tuck-in acquisitions and minority investments that help fuel our near-term and future growth. We closed Intersect ENT in the quarter, and we also began the structured acquisition of the Acutus left-heart access portfolio and expect to begin distribution by the first half of calendar \u201823. Their advanced transseptal access systems will be an important part of our broad offering to electrophysiologists and interventional cardiologists. Last month, we announced a co-promotion agreement and path toward acquisition with CathWorks. We\u2019re excited to partner with CathWorks and promote their innovative FFR angio system, which we believe can disrupt the traditional FFR market. We believe that Medtronic can add a lot of value to the technologies that we acquire, and we expect tuck-ins to supplement our organic R&D investment and long-term growth acceleration. Now, turning to our guidance. With one quarter behind us, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance at 4% to 5% organic, which excludes currency movement and revenue from our Intersect ENT acquisition. If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would now have a negative impact on full year revenue of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, an increase of $400 million over the past quarter. We expect organic revenue growth to improve each quarter, with the second half of our fiscal year much stronger than the first, driven by our expectation that many of the acute supply chain challenges subside and new products drive our growth. It\u2019s worth noting that we also face increasingly easier comparisons as we go through the fiscal year. By segment and on an organic basis, we continue to expect cardiovascular to grow 5.5% to 6.5%, Medical Surgical to now grow 0.75% to 2.75%, given increased volume-based procurement in many of the Chinese provinces, Neuroscience to now grow 4.75% to 5.75%, given a slightly lower outlook for the Neuromodulation market; and diabetes to now decline 3% to 6%, given stronger growth in international markets. On the bottom line, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.53 to $5.65. Inflation and currency are still creating near-term impacts on our margins, and we\u2019ve seen inflation on raw materials and freight become larger headwinds over the past quarter. We also continue to execute on initiatives to partially offset these macro impacts as well as prioritize our R&D investments to drive future growth. Given these dynamics, and the fact that we are still early in our fiscal year, we would suggest you model closer to the lower end of our EPS guidance range. Our EPS guidance includes an unfavorable impact of foreign currency, which is approximately $0.17 to $0.22 at recent rates. In the second quarter, we expect organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 3.5%, implying a strong sequential acceleration, driven by improved product availability and the cadence of our launches. Assuming recent exchange rates hold, the second quarter would have a currency headwind between $365 million and $415 million. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 5% to 5.5%, Medical Surgical to be down 0.25 point to up 0.25 point, Neuroscience to grow 5.5% to 6%, and Diabetes to be down 3% to 6%, all on an organic basis. And we expect EPS of $1.26 to $1.30, including an FX headwind of about $0.02 at current rates. While our markets are facing challenges, we\u2019re focused on identifying ways to offset their impact to our financials, and we are optimistic about our future as we prepare to create markets and realize new opportunities. In addition, I want to take a moment to recognize and thank our employees at Medtronic, who are unwavering in their commitment to deliver life-saving treatment to people around the world. Back to you, Geoff. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Karen. Now, this last quarter, we made a lot of progress on our aggressive agenda of underlying changes that are needed to ultimately accelerate our growth. With supply chain, it\u2019s getting better. And our back orders are coming down, not just because of the external environment, but because of the actions we are taking under Greg Smith\u2019s leadership, and I expect these improvements will continue. We\u2019ve co-located our employees with suppliers and are also working closely with sub-tier suppliers. We\u2019re managing through the acute issues and making progress on improvements that I\u2019m confident can enhance the resiliency of our end-to-end supply chain. On quality, we\u2019ve been conducting a large transformation of our quality system over the past couple of years. We\u2019re advancing quality in innovative ways, working very closely with our regulators, and this is leading to important progress. We\u2019re also making progress on our pipeline and portfolio as these two strategies come together to create meaningful growth drivers. We\u2019re tucking new products into dependable higher growth businesses like we did by adding Intersect ENT to our ENT business. We\u2019re also broadening the product portfolio of some of our businesses so that they can become more meaningful growth drivers for the total company, like our strategy in cardiac ablation solutions. Overall, the path has not been easy, but I\u2019m confident that these fundamental enhancements that we\u2019re making to the company, combined with our op model change, culture changes and incentive changes, are positioning us to deliver a higher level of growth that can be sustained. And as we overcome the near-term issues and start to put points on the board with the pipeline, I believe the underlying transformation of Medtronic. All the work that we\u2019ve been doing over the past couple of years will become increasingly apparent, setting up a durable value creation engine to fully capitalize on the mega trends in the healthcare and technology markets, which will benefit all stakeholders. So, to close, I want to join Karen in thanking our employees. It\u2019s never easy going through change, especially in a challenging macro environment, but our teams have stayed focused and are playing critical roles in helping to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of people around the globe. Now, let\u2019s move to Q&A. We\u2019re going to try to get to as many analysts as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations teams after the call. With that, Brad, could you please give the instructions for asking a question? A - Unidentified Company Representative : [Operator Instructions] Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today\u2019s session, Geoff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio; Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio; Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience Portfolio; and Que Dallara, EVP and President of the Diabetes Operating Unit. We\u2019ll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue. Ryan Weispfenning : We\u2019ll take the first question from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie Marcus : Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe I\u2019ll ask both my questions upfront in one. The quarter came in a little better than expected, but second quarter guide is lower than where the street was thinking by maybe 0.5%, 0.75% on organic sales growth. So, maybe you could walk us through how you\u2019re thinking about the cadence of the year. It includes a pretty material dollar step-up each quarter. What\u2019s driving that? And then also, it looks like you narrowed or lowered a lot of the product segment, organic sales growth guidance with diabetes the big offset. Maybe talk to if you\u2019re seeing any impact to share from some of the supply issues you had? And what\u2019s driving those moderated outlooks on a segment basis? Thanks a lot. Geoff Martha : Robbie, well, thanks for the question. There\u2019s a lot there to unpack. Maybe I\u2019ll start and then hand it over to Karen. I mean, look, I think -- look, the quarter played out largely as expected, managing through these macro headwinds and making progress on supply chain issues, like resins and packaging. And the procedures largely remain at pre-COVID levels. And we are seeing month-over-month improvement and had a pretty good exit coming out of the quarter. Getting to the remaining three quarters of the year, I mean, one, you see coming out of this first quarter, you\u2019ll see some tough comps anniversarying. I think we grew like 19% in Q1 last year, and we have vents and LVADs, certain tough comps anniversarying there. And then I mentioned earlier, some of these acute supply chain issues, we\u2019re starting to put them behind us. I mentioned resins and packaging. We have semiconductors that we\u2019re still dealing with across many businesses that will be with us for a little longer. But a lot of the acute issues we\u2019re starting to put behind us. And then, we\u2019ve got a number, and we\u2019ll get -- I\u2019ll let Karen get into the specifics of the Q2 versus the second half. But we have a number of nice growth drivers in the second half of the year, like the full market release of Evolut FX and EV-ICD coming as well. And it\u2019s -- and there\u2019s a whole -- there\u2019s a number of other launches as well or even existing products that are out there that pick up momentum, and the cadence as they go through the three quarters. Maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Karen to provide a little more details on that. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, and good morning, Robbie. So, I would add on Q2 that we do also expect some modest improvement in underlying procedural fundamentals. For example, we expect China procedures to come back. And we had some cardio procedures that were slightly impacted from contrast supply last quarter that we expect to come back. We also continue to factor in the potential for incremental pressure from volume-based procurement in China, including a potential national VBP tender in spine and continued provincial tenders in SI. But just an important reminder, in Q2, we do have much easier comparisons versus the prior year. We grew only 2% last fiscal year, and that was given the impact of the Delta variant and some labor shortages on procedure volumes. So, then as we move into the back half of the year, Geoff mentioned the exciting product launches that we have and the continued improvement in our acute supply chain challenges. And then, I would also just note that our year over comparisons continue to get easier from where they were in Q2. We had roughly 1.5% growth in Q3 and Q4 last year. And we also have the vent headwind easing in the back half. And in terms of what\u2019s going on with our portfolios and the diabetes offset, yes, we did see greater strength in diabetes in this quarter, particularly in international growth, and we expect that to continue. And then, we\u2019re just being overall prudent with our guidance. We think it\u2019s early in the fiscal year. We\u2019ve still got a lot of macro uncertainties, particularly with inflation and freight. And so, again, we just wanted to be prudent. I hope that helps. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Robbie. Take the next question, Brad. Unidentified Company Representative : We\u2019ll take the next question from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Geoff, I had two product-related questions, maybe one on RDN and one on the robot. RDN, can you just talk to us, and when can we expect this data? I think you said it\u2019s in the upcoming months. Is that going to be a headline press release? Will that be a formal presentation at a conference? Is there any chance that the FDA looks at the data and could hold an adcom, or any sense on what we can expect from RDN? Geoff Martha : Sure. Well, thanks for the question. Well, I\u2019ll start by saying -- I think I\u2019m going to hand it over to Sean here for the answer on this one. But we\u2019re -- as you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of months and a number of conferences, more and more data is coming out. I saw you did an interview or whatever, a session with the KOL in the space, and it was good to hear his feedback. So, there is a lot of -- more and more data emerging, more and more physician excitement and confidence as they -- our sites, our trial sites have been working with these patients for quite a long time, and the data continues to build and be super positive. So, we\u2019re optimistic. And Sean\u2019s pointed this out before, the FDA has done their own kind of patient preference studies, and it\u2019s clear to them that patients prefer this to medical management. So, I know that they\u2019re looking for this to hit the market as well. But the specifics on your questions, I\u2019ll open up to Sean here to answer those on the timing of the data and will we have an adcom or what have you. Sean Salmon : So, Vijay, we finished enrollment and then a six-month endpoint to get to, which will be ramping up very, very shortly, and we target the -- whatever comps we have this fall, which was most likely in the AHA. So, we\u2019ll submit an AHA. And if it gets accepted, that would be the place that we\u2019d see the results. Now, we\u2019d also publish those results and make the top line available in that same period of time. And that is -- just a reminder, that is the last part of what we\u2019ve submitted, right? So, every other module has been reviewed and closed. It\u2019s just the clinical data that\u2019s outstanding. So, we\u2019re as close as we\u2019ve ever been. Vijay Kumar : Got you. And then, Geoff, maybe one on the surgical robot. I thought the prepared remarks, the commentary was pretty bullish. And correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I saw a healthy order book momentum with installations, key supply chain challenges have been addressed, U.S. IDE about historic. This feels like a change in tone versus the last call. So perhaps can you comment on what\u2019s changed in the last three months? Geoff Martha : Sure. And I\u2019ll have Bob chime in as well. But yes, this quarter was a big quarter for us as we made, I think, quite a bit of progress on some of the supply chain concerns that we had, in some cases, some specific issues that we had to resolve and building our manufacturing capacity as well, ahead of the U.S. IDE and more importantly, expanded sales in Europe. We had a number of installs and continue to get good feedback. And the surgeon feedback continues to be really strong. And I actually had a chance to meet with a number of our surgical innovations reps, sales reps. And I was asking them, like what are you hearing from your surgeons? And I was pleased with what I heard. And there\u2019s a lot of -- the word is out. They like the design. They like the approach we\u2019re taking to the market. And they realize that when we launch, we won\u2019t have all the indications yet, and we\u2019re going to be building out our instrument on the number of instruments we have with it, but they want to be part of this journey with us. So, I think the expectations are appropriately set. We built out some manufacturing capacity. And like I said in the commentary, we are real close to this U.S. IDE. And so I don\u2019t know, Bob, what do you want to add to that? Bob White : Yes. No, thanks, Geoff. And Vijay, thanks a lot for the question. And I think you\u2019re right to characterize we\u2019re making solid progress with our surgical robotic ecosystem. And we really do think about it as an ecosystem with really good progress with Touch Surgery as well. But, as Geoff mentioned, our Hugo installations continued in the quarter. We like to be accelerated as we closed the quarter as well. And as I\u2019ve spoken on previous calls, we were really focused on hardening our supply chain and our operations performance, and we\u2019ve seen progress there. And then third, we continue to train surgeons across the globe and across multiple specialties, and so solid progress there. So, we\u2019re near the start of our IDE, and so we believe we continue on track. So thanks, Vijay. And thanks, Geoff. Geoff Martha : Bob mentioned the Touch Surgery. That\u2019s another big piece here with this ecosystem. That\u2019s something we learned in the spine space, how important it is to have not just the robot, but the all enabling technologies around it. We\u2019re starting to -- customers are starting to use Touch Surgery with Hugo now and surgeons are impressed with the kind of analytical capabilities and the benefits of the secure video storage and sharing for case review and training and whatnot. So, the ecosystem for our soft tissue robot is coming along nicely, as Bob mentioned. So, there\u2019s definitely some excitement on our end. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Vijay. Next question, please, Brad. Unidentified Company Representative : The next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America Global Research. Travis Steed : So Geoff, I\u2019ll start with the portfolio management portfolio stuff. It\u2019s been about 8 months since you started highlighting that. I didn\u2019t know if that was something we could see in FY23. And it seems like you\u2019re highlighting solving for your weighted average market growth rate more than other variables at this stage of the process. And then, Karen, a quick follow-up on something you said earlier. I think you said exiting the quarter with better momentum. So, curious if you could comment a little bit on some of the August trends, and there\u2019s been some concern with investors about vacations and stuff like that. So, would love to get any color on August. Geoff Martha : Okay. Yes. Thanks for the question, Travis. Yes, we\u2019re definitely continuing to look at the whole portfolio more intently, and we\u2019ve been doing that for several months now, as you mentioned. And look, I\u2019ll start by saying, look, we\u2019re really deeply committed to doing the right things for shareholders and all Medtronic stakeholders. And when we\u2019re looking at this portfolio and capital allocation, we are talking about both, the buying and the selling side and actively looking at, as you pointed out, portfolio management to really improve our weighted average market growth rate, whether it be through addition or subtraction and to make sure that the growth is more durable. So look, we\u2019re making -- we made a lot -- we\u2019re making a lot of progress on the approach here to look strategically at each business. And last quarter, we -- I\u2019ll remind you, we did announce an initial step on the subtraction side of things with the Renal Care Solutions JV with DaVita, but this process will be a continuous process. I just want to also set that expectation and will play out over time. So the goals are unchanged. The process continues. And like the goal is this durable growth. So, it\u2019s a lot easier to grow and our rated market growth rate is increasing as well. And I\u2019ll leave it at that and turn it over to Karen for the other question. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Travis. We did exit the quarter with better momentum. We saw a reduction in our backlogs. We saw continued improvement each month of the quarter. And as we look at August, it\u2019s still early. And we do have -- we\u2019re still managing through some supply issues in some of our businesses. So, the numbers are a little cloudy. But, when we took that into account in our guidance -- and when we look at the operating units that are not impacted by supply issues through the first three weeks of August, we\u2019re trending largely in line with the second quarter of last year. So seeing continued momentum and improvement. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Travis. Take the next question, please, Brad. Unidentified Company Representative : The next question comes from Cecilia Furlong at Morgan Stanley. Cecilia Furlong : I wanted to ask about the diabetes business, the updated guidance for the year. Obviously, OUS came in stronger. But just what you\u2019re expecting now, both OUS, but then also in the U.S. from competitive pressures? And then, I wanted to follow up. It sounded like your timing for submission of Simplera shifted your strategy there. Just if you could comment on how you\u2019re thinking about the cadence of submission. Thank you. Geoff Martha : Sure. Well, thanks for the question, Cecilia. Yes. I mean, look, diabetes, as mentioned and Karen mentioned it in her comments, I mean, we\u2019re seeing really strong growth in outside the U.S., Europe in particular. And more -- even more importantly than the quarterly growth, it\u2019s the clinical results we\u2019re seeing in patients and the feedback on the patient experience is really positive with the 780G plus Guardian Sensor 4 system. So that, we think, bodes well for the franchise and what we\u2019ll see when we get it into the U.S. because we\u2019re competing with everybody there in Europe. And you had a couple of specific questions. And the other thing I\u2019ll say is, look, we -- this is a business that -- I got a lot of questions when I first became CEO two years ago about what we\u2019re going to do. We doubled down on investment. We believe that the integrated insulin delivery system that we have with the sensors, the insulin delivery device. And right now, for us, it\u2019s a durable pump and down the road with the pen and then, and hopefully patch, we think is -- we\u2019ve got -- in our market-leading algorithms, we think we\u2019ve got a very sustainable position in a high-growth market that has high barriers to entry. And we\u2019ve been powering through, and these results in Europe are very encouraging. On top of that, we recently had a -- the transition from Sean to Que, and Sean did a great job stabilizing this business and really focusing it where we have a competitive advantage and helping really focus our product road map. Que\u2019s picking it up from there. They had a great transition. And with that, maybe I\u2019ll introduce Que Dallara, who\u2019s been with us now 14, 15 weeks and is already having a big impact on not just diabetes, but on the leadership team at Medtronic. And it\u2019s a delight to be working with her. And why don\u2019t I introduce Que and welcome her to her first earnings call. Que? Que Dallara : Thanks, Geoff. Yes, I would say the transition with Sean has gone really well, and I\u2019m really encouraged with the progress we\u2019re making on restoring this business to growth as well as innovation road map. And to address your two specific questions around what we see in the U.S. as well as around Simplera, I would say that, look, our short-term focus is remediating the warning letter and also making progress with the FDA around approval of the 780G and the Guardian 4 sensor system. We continue to be encouraged by that, making good progress. And so, our hope is that we can remediate that and secure approval in the near term. Now -- but we\u2019re not standing still. In the U.S., we do see growth in our 770G system as well as our InPen technology. And not only that, we are very close to launching the extended-wear infusion set, which has been approved by the FDA for up to 7 days where this is a game changer for patients. It\u2019s probably the biggest innovation we\u2019ve seen in the last 20 years in this area and allows patients to be able to synchronize, if you like, their sensor CGM changes with the infusion set changes, leading to better site recovery and comfort for our customers. So, that\u2019s happening. We obviously anticipate 780G, but we\u2019re not standing still with respect to the products that we do have approved in the U.S. And with regards to Simplera, I mean, we\u2019re very excited about this product. It\u2019s half the size of the Guardian 4 sensor. It\u2019s thinner. We\u2019ve submitted a CE Mark in July as we said we would. It is ready to go for submission in the U.S. But we are -- we remain focused on prioritizing the efforts around the warning letter as well as 780G approval. Geoff Martha : Okay. Thank you, Que. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Cecilia. Next question, please, Brad. Unidentified Company Representative : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo Securities. Larry Biegelsen : First, on supply constraints, I think in Q4, you said it was about a $260 million impact. How much was the impact in Q1? What are your expectations for Q2? And are you assuming some catch-up from lost sales? And just lastly, Karen, maybe talk about the FX hedging gain in the guidance now for \u201822. I think it was $410 million to $440 million. And how that rolls off in fiscal 2024, how we should think about that? Thanks so much. Geoff Martha : Well, look, I\u2019ll -- thanks for the question, Larry. I\u2019ll start on the expectations for Q2 and beyond on the supply chain stuff. Like I mentioned, Q4, Q1 were the most acute for us on these supply chain issues, and I\u2019m definitely glad that we\u2019re looking in the rearview mirror on those quarters. We\u2019re not out of the -- totally out of the woods yet, but our back orders are coming down. We\u2019re seeing particular improvement in areas like resins and packaging across the Company. A lot of this is a result of us taking well over 100 of our employees and co-located them with our top suppliers to help them prioritize Medtronic, but more importantly, kind of work through, make sure that communication is tight, the planning is tight. And that\u2019s really making a difference. The macro market is getting a little better. I mean, some of these areas, in particular. I mentioned earlier that semiconductors are still going to be with us for a while, that back order, we\u2019re working directly with the semiconductor companies on this. And just across the board also, one of the things we\u2019ve done in addition to co-locating our employees with our top suppliers is going out to -- directly to the commodity or raw material suppliers versus the supplier that\u2019s between us and them, if you will, the finisher or the distributor, the middleman, and locking in contracts and getting prioritization, especially given that these products go into medical products and life preserving life saving. And in some cases, those raw material suppliers weren\u2019t aware of that. So all of this is definitely helping, and we\u2019ll continue to see this back order go down over time. As I said, I think we\u2019re starting to put the most acute piece of this behind us. In terms of catching up on lost sales, kind of like COVID, we don\u2019t put a bolus of lost sales coming through into our guidance. And right now, in particular, as you\u2019ve seen and heard is there is kind of a little bit of a governor out there on procedures with the healthcare worker shortage, which has gotten better, but it\u2019s still hard for customers to run at 110%, 120% of pre-COVID levels. So because of that, we haven\u2019t really baked a catch-up on sales into the guidance. You had some specific quantification questions on, and I\u2019ll turn those over to Karen. And Karen, anything else you want to add to the qualitative comments that I made. Karen Parkhill : Thank you. I think you covered it well on supply chain. We did say that we expect it to get a little worse before it got better, and that\u2019s what happened in the first quarter, but we expect it to get better from here. We do have the supply chain improving, but again, not necessarily a bolus catch-up built into the guide. In terms of FX, as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve had the strengthening dollar continue to impact our reported revenue, just like it has for many of our peers. We do have foreign currency-based cost of sales and overhead. And now we have foreign currency-based interest expense as well, and those all provided some offset. And as you know, Larry, we also have the benefit of our multiyear currency hedging program, which did produce significant gains, and that resulted in a smaller FX impact to the bottom line in the quarter. As we look ahead for FX, I would say, keep in mind, it\u2019s only Q1 now. We\u2019ve got foreign exchange rates that are continually volatile. So, we know they\u2019re going to move from here. But, if we look at next fiscal year, based on recent rates, we would expect the headwind next fiscal year to be similar to the headwind this fiscal year, again, if rates stay the same. I hope that helps. Ryan Weispfenning : Yes. Thanks, Larry. Next question, please, Brad. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes. The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Joanne Wuensch : Briefly, if revenue is improving quarter-over-quarter throughout the remainder of the year, your operating margins and gross margins also improve. And I\u2019ll just throw my second one quickly. Hugo, what does it take to bring that into the United States? And is there a parameter or a thought process on the timing? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Joanne. On margins, we do expect margins to improve sequentially through the year as revenue improves. So, the answer to that one is yes. And then, Geoff, for... Geoff Martha : Yes, sure. On Hugo, what does it take to get to United States? Obviously, we got to start our U.S. IDE, which is set up here. And our -- Bob\u2019s mentioned in the past getting our customers -- our trial sites ready for that and physicians trained, which we\u2019ve been working on. But Bob, do you want to give some more specifics on that? Bob White : You\u2019re exactly right, Geoff. It begins with our U.S. IDE that will start the U.S. process. And as we mentioned, Joanne, we\u2019re nearing the start event, but that will be the key milestone that we\u2019ll certainly update -- guide investors on it. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thanks, Joanne. Next question, please. Unidentified Company Representative : The next question comes from Jayson Bedford at Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Just a couple of diabetes questions. It was mentioned that you hope to remediate the warning letter and secure approval for 780G in the near term. Do you have clarity on if you can get approval for 780G while the warning letter is still outstanding? Geoff Martha : I think the -- thanks for the question. I think the variance path is an option. But as I said earlier, I think our primary priority is to -- is to work with the FDA and remediate the warning letter, now focus entirely on doing that. Obviously, we\u2019d love to. We\u2019re very eager to launch the product, but we\u2019re focused on patient safety, making sure that our remediation plans are robust. It\u2019s really the first and foremost in our mind that we make those corrective actions. So, that\u2019s our primary focus. In parallel to that, we are engaged with the FDA on getting the 780G and Guardian 4 sensor system approved. Those -- both those things continue to make progress. It\u2019s obviously very hard for us to be completely predictive around when those things will happen, but I\u2019m really pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making on both of those. Jayson Bedford : Okay. And I apologize if I missed this earlier. But when will you submit Simplera to the FDA? Karen Parkhill : We will do that as soon as we feel confident that we\u2019ve made sufficient progress on the warning letter remediation as well as progress on the 780G. So, as you know, we submitted for CE Mark in July, as we said we would. And we just want to make sure that our focus remains on those immediate short-term goals of warning letter remediation and approval for the 780G. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Jayson. Next question, please, Brad. Unidentified Company Representative : The next question comes from Steve Lichtman of Oppenheimer & Co. Steve Lichtman : Geoff, thinking a little longer term, How far along would you say are Greg Smith and his team and making them more durable changes in operations you\u2019ve talked about in prior calls, and when do you think we could start seeing margin benefits from those initiatives? Geoff Martha : That\u2019s a great question. Thanks for that one, Steve. They\u2019re -- they\u2019ve made quite a bit of progress in a relatively short period of time. Greg started in April of 2021. So, it\u2019s been a little over a year. And in that time, we\u2019ve -- working with the executive team, we\u2019ve centralized, if you will, the global operations and supply chain function. This is one of those opportunities in our new model where we\u2019re trying to play small and play big at the same time. Certain things have been decentralized into the businesses and the businesses are more empowered, refer to them as operating units. And then certain things, a limited list where we\u2019ll leverage our scale or drive and/or drive standards. And the supply chain is definitely one of those. So, we\u2019ve made that change, that organizational change, which is probably the biggest organizational change we\u2019ve made,, even more than going to the 20 operating units. And so, it\u2019s significant. In addition, we started to invest in new capabilities, hiring people from outside the company, outside the industry, and in many cases, that are best-in-class in the various sub functions, if you will, or capabilities within global operations and supply chain, things like planning, things like factory automation, et cetera. And we\u2019ve been -- so we\u2019ve hired quite a few, and I think the majority of Greg\u2019s team is new in the last year, and we\u2019ve been making investments in technology, various different systems on planning and supply planning, demand planning, et cetera. And the number one focus has been resiliency and quality. There\u2019s three things we\u2019re looking at from this function : resiliency, quality because they have a big impact on quality; and over time, cost of goods sold productivity that you\u2019re getting to that would be 2x or more of what we\u2019ve seen historically at Medtronic. And so, that will play out over time. We haven\u2019t seen that yet. The other thing -- you\u2019ve got a lot going on in there. You\u2019ve got inflation and things like that that are kind of masking any kind of or overshadowing, if you will, any kind of cost of goods sold productivity that we are seeing, so. But we will see that over time and we\u2019re confident. But we haven\u2019t quantified the exact timing of it. And like I said, it\u2019s been a little kind of hard to decipher here in the short term because of the inflationary impact on our cost of goods sold. I don\u2019t know, Karen, do you want to... Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, and thanks for the question. We are making a lot of progress in the ops front. And our shorter term goal is going to be a focus on driving enough cost offset to offset the impacts that we\u2019ve got, either in pricing or inflation. We\u2019re not ready to give guidance for next fiscal year, but that\u2019s the initial goal just to offset. And then over time, to hopefully more than offset. I would say, Geoff mentioned, too, that this work in operations is not just going to help on the cost of goods sold line, but also on the revenue line, as we can more predictably have products available and get quality issues in better stead. So, I think it will help on both. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thanks, Steve. Next question, please, Brad. Unidentified Company Representative : The next question comes from Rich Newitter at Truist Securities. Rich Newitter : Just on spine, I think you guys called out navigation and robotics may decline. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing there on the funnel and the pipeline and the capital environment more broadly. Any changes that are taking place in the way you\u2019re selling these types of capital items, especially robotics? And then we did see one of your orthopedics robotic competitors talk about changing business models, more rentals meanwhile, but your direct spine robotics competitor actually saw a sequential pickup in capital purchases. So, it would be great to get your color on the capital environment and specifically what\u2019s going on in spine robotics. Thanks. Geoff Martha : Sure. Thanks for the question, Rich. I\u2019m going to have Brett Wall, Mr. Neuroscience, field that question. Brett Wall : Sure, Rich. Yes, looking overall, the capital, we have a very extensive ecosystem and capital system within our CST business. And what we saw was extended purchasing times, particularly as we move through to the end of our quarter. Now specifically, as it relates to the technology and the selling models, we have a variety of different approaches that we use. And so, we\u2019re well positioned. However, the markets seem to work and hospitals are in a mode of preserving cash. We have more opportunities to put forth different models where we actually utilize the implantables and other disposable products as a way of financing this particular capital, and that works very well. We didn\u2019t see a significant uptick in our O-arms or StealthStations during the time -- this time with that model, but we saw a little bit of an uptick with Mazor in that particular model. And we think during these times, we\u2019ll probably see more of that. The competitor you referenced there, if you look at calendar Q2, per our calculations, we continue to outstrip them in our actual placement and sales of robots. And so, we continue to do that and our procedural base there is nearing almost double the amount that they reported in their last earnings call. So, we are very well positioned there. And then the underlying spine business remains pretty attractive. We saw a 4% increase in our core spine business there. So we\u2019re pleased with how that\u2019s recovering. Geoff Martha : Yes. We\u2019re really excited about the positioning of our spine business with the recent product launches in the implant side, but the ecosystem that we\u2019ve built over the last decade and how that\u2019s come to bear and how the market is shifting to that ecosystem approach. So, we\u2019re feeling good about spine as we move forward here. Ryan Weispfenning : Yes. Thanks, Rich. I think we\u2019ve got time for one more question, Brad. Unidentified Company Representative : Our final question comes from Rick Wise at Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Rick Wise : I was hoping, Geoff, just in closing, you\u2019d expand on two of your exciting, I think, pipeline opportunities. You highlighted Aurora, the leadless subcu device. I was hoping you\u2019d share your latest thinking in terms of the opportunity there. And when you talk about U.S. approval next year, you\u2019re saying next calendar year or next fiscal year, and this seems like a major opportunity. I was hoping you could talk about that. And just last, you didn\u2019t talk as much this time about the opportunity in pulsed field ablation. Maybe just update us on your internal Medtronic program and the fair programs and just some timelines on the U.S. trial, follow-up, submission and approval timing. Any of that would be great. Thanks so much. Geoff Martha : Yes, sure. Yes. Thanks for the question, Rick. And those are two topics we like to talk about with -- and I\u2019m going to hand it over to Sean here to give you some details. But on Aurora, like I mentioned in the commentary, I mean, this -- we think we can take this segment and shift it from what up to now has been what we would define as somewhat nichey to a bigger segment. We\u2019re talking about $1 billion by 2030. We just don\u2019t think you\u2019re -- with our Aurora, we don\u2019t think you\u2019re making the physicians or the patients have to make trade-offs here and you get that traditional impact that we had from a traditional ICD with much less invasive approach here. And so, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sean on that. And then on PFA, you mentioned Affera, and Sean will give you the details between our internal program on PFA and Affera. But again, Affera plus Acutus, it\u2019s that whole cardiac ablation solutions business, our AFib business. We think this really rounds out that business. We\u2019re anticipating an approval on -- from FTC on the Affera acquisition here. And we\u2019ll move forward on that aggressively because it really is a high growth market where we\u2019ve been a little bit nichey, I would say. And this would round out that and make this -- that business a real growth driver for the Company. But on your specific question, I don\u2019t know, Sean, do you want to dive into the -- some of Rick\u2019s specifics? Sean Salmon : Yes, sure. So Rick, as Geoff mentioned in the commentary, today\u2019s subcutaneous ICD market is, it\u2019s a niche around $300 million, $350 million, $300 million to $350 million annually. And we think that within 10 years, this could be $1 billion segment. And the reason that it expands is all those limitations of the current device where we can get sort of the benefits of traditional IC, smaller devices, monoliner life, the ability to pace out of the arrhythmia rather than having to shock out arrhythmia. That\u2019s really both can I expand the market like we saw with leaves pacing. When we went to that, we started picking up new patients that weren\u2019t being treated because of the acuity of disease and leads to that strong growth. And with regard to timing, we\u2019re saying next calendar year, to kind of put a finer point on that, it\u2019s the first half of next calendar year is what we\u2019re targeting for approval for the U.S. Pulsed field ablation, we have completed the trial, as you know, last November, and that\u2019s been in its follow-up period. So that would put us for availability of data in the spring time. That\u2019s probably one of the most likely to be presented. And, of course, the filing of our technology would be at that point in time. As Geoff mentioned, we\u2019re waiting the regulatory closure of Affera, and that really expands out the fuller bag. It gives us within both RF and pulsed field, point-by-point ablation. And what we have with our own internal PFAs really for the isolation of pulmonary veins sleeve, right? So, it\u2019s more anatomically based. And then, the other catheters that come with Affera would be for point-by-point ablation or for lines of conduction blocks that you do with a linear catheter. So, really nice complementary sort of technologies for PFA. But more importantly, we\u2019ve been restrained from being able to participate in the full market because we don\u2019t control the mapping navigation systems. There\u2019s a strong monopoly between two players, Biosense Webster and Abbot, particularly really control and dominate that field. So, that Affera acquisition allows us to have all of our catheters now with mapping navigation really expands the opportunity into that and was today an $8 billion market. Should be, by the time all this stuff rolls out, it continues to grow robustly close to $10 billion, and we\u2019ll be able to fully participate in that market. So, two really important growth drivers, we\u2019re excited about them, and we\u2019re making meaningful progress on both of them. Geoff Martha : Yes. So, yes just -- Rick, on this, one in the short term, we\u2019ll see a pretty nice uptick in sequential growth going from our Q1 to our Q2, and then see more sequential improvement from there. But the reason we\u2019re confident is things like these two areas that you mentioned, along with a host of others, right? Micra continues. As Sean mentioned, Micra, we just hit PFA and what\u2019s coming there, and EV-ICD in the cardiac space. But on the call -- and then down the road, RDN, see the data, the economic impact of that will be a little bit out there beyond this year, obviously, but -- out this fiscal year, but there\u2019s another -- and then you -- that\u2019s just in the cardiology area. We hit on Hugo on soft tissue robotics side. I forgot to mention mitral and tricuspid on the cardiac side. There\u2019s a lot in cardiology. You got the soft tissue robot. And that whole surgical ecosystem that we\u2019re surrounding that with that\u2019s way more than the robot. You\u2019ve got a lot going on in neuroscience. We mentioned the spine surgical ecosystem. And we didn\u2019t get any questions on DBS this time with the sensing and the Percept product and the leads that go with it and the closed loop trial that we\u2019re doing there. And we talked a little bit about ECAPs and pain. And then shifting -- you heard Que talk about diabetes and what we\u2019re seeing in Europe with the system now, the 780G and just sending in the Simplera submission into the EU, and she gave you the dynamics on when we would do it in the U.S. But there\u2019s a lot going on here, and we\u2019re excited about it. And the operational issues that we\u2019ve gone through, not all of them are completely in the rearview mirror. Like I mentioned, semiconductor shortages. But it\u2019s made us stronger. And all this, the changes that we made will become more apparent in the quarters. The benefits of those changes will become more apparent in the quarters ahead here, and we\u2019re looking forward to it for sure. Geoff Martha : So with that, I think that is all for Q&A, all the time we have. And I just, again, want to thank you for the questions, the engagement. As always, we appreciate your support and your continued interest in Medtronic. And we look forward to updating you on our continued progress, we talked about here on our next earnings call, our Q2 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on November 22, so just before Thanksgiving, here in the U.S. -- just before Thanksgiving. And so with that, thanks for tuning in today, and please stay healthy and safe, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning. I am Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations and welcome to snowing Minneapolis. I appreciate that you are joining us today for Medtronic\u2019s Fiscal Year 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Video Webcast. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I will share a few details about today\u2019s webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our second quarter, which ended on October 28, 2022 as well as our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the Executive VPs for each of our four segments will join us and we will take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today\u2019s program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today\u2019s program, many of the statements we make maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from our Q1 acquisition of Intersect ENT. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the first quarter of fiscal \u201823 and are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter of 2022 compared to the third calendar quarter of 2021, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let\u2019s head into the studio and hear about the quarter. [Video Presentation] Geoff Martha : Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today as we discuss our Q2 results and outlook. Our Q2 organic constant currency revenue growth of 2.2% came in about 1 point below expectations due to a slower-than-expected recovery in both procedure volumes in certain markets and in our supply chain. In terms of reported revenue, the continued strength of the dollar over the course of the quarter drove over half the difference to expectations. Now despite the top line results, we were able to control expenses and deliver EPS at the high-end of our guidance range. We also issued guidance for the back half of our fiscal year this morning. We expect continued acceleration in organic revenue growth in the second half, although less than previously anticipated and this partially flows through to EPS. Now, this is something that I don\u2019t take lightly, delivering on our expectations is important to building and maintaining trust and credibility with you. Karen will walk you through the details, but some of our markets and some of our supply constraints recovered more slowly than we expected in the quarter, and that, along with incremental China volume-based procurements, led us to reduce our expectations. While the current operating environment remains challenging, we had strong growth in several businesses and geographies, where our strategy, our operating model and execution are yielding solid results. We have near-term product catalysts in our pipeline. We are decisively allocating capital internally and selectively making focused acquisitions. We are making improvements to the operational health of the company and we are streamlining the company\u2019s structure and taking cost out. All of this gives us confidence that we are on the path to creating durable growth and shareholder value. Now, diving deeper into our Q2 results, for reported revenue, as I said earlier, currency drove over half the miss to consensus. Organically, the miss was primarily split evenly between two challenges. One, procedure volumes in some markets have been slower to return to normal levels and two, some of our supply challenges have persisted longer than we anticipated. With regard to procedural volumes, in addition to an incremental China VBP, we are still seeing lower volumes in elective coronary PCI, GI procedures, TAVR, spinal cord stim and some less emergent surgical procedures. The slower-than-anticipated recovery in procedural volumes primarily occurred in developed markets as healthcare systems continue to work through staffing and other challenges. Now with regard to supply, we have made meaningful recovery and many of the most acute issues are now behind us, including the acute packaging issues, which we highlighted last quarter. But some of the improvements did come later than we expected in Q2, and as a result, we missed cases in businesses like surgical innovations and it has delayed our expected momentum. Now focusing beyond challenges impacting our markets and product availability, we have a number of businesses where our strategy and execution are yielding results. Recall that we moved to the new operating model 2 years ago, we created highly focused, accountable and empowered operating units that can move with greater speed and decisiveness. And today, we are clearly seeing the benefit of this model across many of our businesses. Starting with cranial and spinal technologies, CST grew 5% and this is despite a large negative impact from China VBP. In fact, our U.S. core spine business grew 15%. Additionally, this quarter, we launched our spine technology ecosystem, which we call Aible at the NASS conference. From planning to our best-in-class implants to navigation and robotic assistance to interoperative imaging and surgical tools up to and including patient follow-up. Aible brings spinal surgery together in one seamless and connected platform. And another highlight was our structural heart business, where our TAVR business grew 15% globally, including 17% in the United States. The launch of our Evolut FX valve drove 18% sequential revenue growth in our U.S. TAVR business, despite being at full market launch for only the last month of the quarter. So, we expect Evolut FX to drive momentum for us over the coming quarters. Our Cardiac Rhythm Management business continues to execute and win share, with 4% growth in this quarter. Within CRM, our pacing business grew 6%, well above the market, with 18% growth of our micro family of leadless pacemakers. And we are looking forward to the commercial introduction of our AURORA EV-ICD in the back half of this fiscal year. So while we have businesses where the changes we have made over the past couple of years are clearly having a positive impact. We are also focused on ensuring these efforts translate into improved performance in all of our businesses. It\u2019s worth highlighting a few businesses where we are making strong progress to drive future growth over the near to mid-term and some of that already have immediate momentum. Let\u2019s take cardiac ablation solutions, a business that we expect to be a strong future growth driver. Pulsed Field Ablation represents a large market opportunity and we are looking forward to seeing our PULSED AF pivotal trial results in the first half of the next calendar year, putting us on the path to be one of the first companies with the PFA catheter in the U.S. market, which we think is underappreciated. This is a meaningful growth opportunity for Medtronic in the next 18 to 24 months. And as you know, we closed our acquisition of Affera in August and Affera\u2019s differentiated mapping and navigation system gives us the breadth and differentiation that we need to win share in cardiac ablation. And we expect to complete enrollment this quarter in the pivotal. This fully integrated system will be the first of its kind to offer a unique catheter that can perform high-density mapping and deliver both pulsed field and radiofrequency ablation in a single device. Now in diabetes, we remain focused on resolving our warning letter. We have now completed a 100% of our warning later commitments and have informed the FDA that we are ready for reinspection. We also remain in active review with the FDA on our submission of the MiniMed 780G system with the Guardian 4 Sensor. And outside the U.S., we continue to receive positive customer feedback on the performance of the 780G, which is now available in over 60 countries. In Q2, 780G drove mid-teens growth for our diabetes business in international markets. And across diabetes, we are investing heavily in the development of multiple next-generation insulin delivery and sensor technologies. And we remain focused on restoring strong growth to this important franchise over the coming years. Turning to our Hugo surgical robot, now I am sure we are going to get into this in Q&A, but we saw a lot of positive momentum this quarter as we scale manufacturing production, expand regulatory approvals and ramp installations. In addition, we just received FDA IDE approval last week on our product enhancements. Now, this allows us to start our U.S. urology clinical trial by the end of the calendar year and is a catalyst for continued progress with our international sales. Now, before I talk about our capital allocation and portfolio management, let me share my thoughts on the Ardian opportunity. Despite the impact we believe COVID and medication changes had on the ambulatory endpoint in ON MED, the totality of the data is compelling. The large drop in office blood pressure in the Ardian arm was impressive and it was consistent with what we have seen in our other trials. Importantly, the current standard of care for reducing blood pressure, it just isn\u2019t working, which was evident in the long-term SPRINT trial results published just last month in JAMA Cardiology. Patients don\u2019t seem to stay on multi-drug therapy for long periods of time and eventually just stop taking their medications. And that\u2019s the advantage of Ardian, it\u2019s always on. We have demonstrated that our Ardian procedure, it\u2019s safe, it\u2019s effective, and it\u2019s durable. Physicians are excited and Ardian is preferred by patients. Now we have submitted our PMA to the FDA and we are looking forward to working with governments and payers in the U.S. and around the world who are searching for improvements to control high blood pressure and avoid the costly and devastating consequences of this disease. In addition to advancing our pipeline, we are focused on decisively allocating capital and streamlining the company to deliver durable growth. We are freeing up resources to invest more in R&D, feeding our fast growing businesses in areas where we can see the strongest returns. Cardiac ablation solutions and diabetes are two clear examples of this. We are also making moves with our portfolio to focus our company and our capital on opportunities that are better aligned with our long-term growth acceleration strategies. Over the past two quarters, we have announced our intent to separate three businesses that we believe will thrive outside the company. With our Renal Care Solutions business, we are progressing on the separation, forming a new kidney health technology company together with DaVita. We continue to expect this transaction to close in calendar 2023. And last month, we announced our intention to separate our combined patient monitoring and respiratory interventions business. We remain focused on active portfolio management, evaluating both potential additions and subtractions to further accelerate our growth and create value for our shareholders. Now with that, I will turn it over to Karen to discuss our second quarter financial performance and our guidance. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Geoff. Our second quarter organic revenue increased 2.2%, up significantly from Q1, but below our guidance range, given the challenges Geoff mentioned. Yet with a focus on expenses, our adjusted EPS of $1.30 landed at the upper end of our guidance range. Currency had a significantly unfavorable impact of 5.8% on our reported revenue growth. Our FX hedges mitigated that impact on the bottom line with EPS down only $0.01 or 80 basis points from currency. Looking at our results from a geographic perspective, our U.S. revenue grew 1%; our non-U.S. developed increased 3%; and emerging markets grew 4%. Our emerging markets growth continued to be affected by China, which declined 9%, given the impact of a national tender in our spine business and several provincial tenders in certain other businesses. However, we continue to see strong double-digit growth in our other markets, including mid-20s growth in Eastern Europe and mid-teens growth in Latin America. In fact, excluding China, our emerging markets grew 15%. Turning to our margins, our adjusted gross margin of 67.6% declined 120 basis points from inflationary pressures in materials, direct labor, freight and utilities. We expect these inflationary pressures to continue and to impact the back half of this fiscal year, more than what we experienced in the first half. Our adjusted operating margin of 26.6% declined 40 basis points, including a 120 basis point benefit from our currency hedging program. Compared to the first quarter, our operating margin improved 270 basis points, given accelerated revenue growth. We expect sequential improvement throughout the fiscal year. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. I would note that the vast majority of our debt is fixed at low rates as we move into a higher rate environment. Regarding our capital allocation, we continue to balance investing for the future with returning capital to shareholders and we remain committed to our dividend and to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. Now, turning to our guidance, today, we set our second half revenue guidance at 3.5% to 4% organic, which excludes currency movement and revenue from our Intersect ENT acquisition. If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would now have a negative impact on our back half revenue of $930 million to $1.03 billion. Our back half guidance translates into a reduction of our annual guidance, driven by a slower pace of market and supply recovery. On market, we are expecting incremental provincial tenders in China, particularly in stapling and cardiac ablation. And Geoff referenced earlier that some procedure volumes in the second quarter didn\u2019t recover as quickly as we were expecting. So at this point, we are assuming no incremental improvement in the back half. On supply, while we have had a meaningful recovery, it came later than anticipated, particularly in SI and cardiac diagnostics and that simply delays our pace of recovery ahead. By segment in the back half, the majority of the reduction is in our Medical Surgical portfolio, which we now expect to be flat to up 0.5%. We expect cardiovascular to grow 5.25% to 5.75%, neuroscience to grow 6% to 6.5%, and diabetes to decline in the low single-digits, all on an organic basis. Our total company revenue guidance does assume continued revenue growth acceleration, which we saw in each month of the second quarter. We expect the third quarter growth rate to be better than the second and the fourth quarter better than the third. We will have easing comparisons in ventilators, improving supply in certain businesses like cardiac diagnostics and SI and the benefit from product launches like Evolut FX and EV-ICD. In the third quarter, we expect organic revenue growth in the range of 2.5% to 3%, an acceleration from the second quarter. And assuming recent exchange rates hold, the third quarter would have a currency headwind between $460 million and $510 million. By segment and on an organic basis, we expect Medical Surgical to be down 2% to 2.5%, an improvement from the second quarter, given lesser event headwinds and the impact of the flu season. Cardiovascular to grow 4.75% to 5.25% on the continued rollout of Evolut FX and Linq 2, neuroscience to grow 5.75% to 6.25% improving from the prior quarter with less VBP impact in spine and diabetes to decline in the low single-digits. On the bottom line, we are driving significant expense reduction throughout the company to help offset the lower revenue and continued inflation impact and now expect fiscal \u201823 non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.30. That range includes an unfavorable impact of currency of approximately $0.18 at recent rates. For the third quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.27, including an FX headwind of about $0.05 at recent rates. Amidst the macro environmental headwinds we face from inflation, China VBP, softer procedure volumes in certain markets and currency, we are laser-focused on driving operational and expense efficiencies. We are also committed to invest appropriately for the long-term, allocating capital to our most promising growth drivers and executing tuck-in acquisitions designed to reach more patients and create value for our shareholders. As we approach Thanksgiving, I want to share my gratitude to our employees who have been committed, particularly during these challenging times to deliver on our mission to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of people around the world. Back to you, Geoff. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Karen. Now before we open the lines for questions, I want you to know that our growth rate and our consistency are not where we want them to be. That\u2019s why I shared with you our aggressive agenda to transform this company 2 years ago when I became CEO. We embarked on a plan of implementing a new operating model, eliminating the bureaucracy of our groups and forming more nimble operating units, while at the same time, learning to leverage our scale. We set in motion a new performance-driven culture, and we changed our incentive plans to reward new behaviors and performance. We brought in new leaders to inject new ways of thinking in the organization, and we implemented new capital allocation and portfolio management processes. Now these changes take time, and we face setbacks along the way that have slowed us down. Some are environmental like COVID recovery rates, raw material shortfalls and Chinese procurement policy, while other setbacks are of our own doing, like our quality and operational challenges and the pace of improvement we anticipated. Look, I know we have more work to do here, but we understand the root causes that led to the years of underperformance from this company. And our aggressive transformation agenda is designed to fix these issues. I know we will get this right, choosing the right markets, being more efficient and productive with our resources, empowering businesses and increasing accountability, improving our quality, our manufacturing and our supply chain and turning our size and scale into an advantage. And I know we are on the right path. The progress we\u2019ve made so far gives me that confidence. We have experienced leaders, a compelling pipeline and positions of strength in some of the most attractive medtech markets, which address significant unmet needs for patients. We will execute on our plan to deliver durable growth that we began 2 years ago. And as we do, we will create tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. So now let\u2019s move to Q&A. We are going to try to get to as many analysts as possible, so we ask you to limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question? Brad Welnick : [Operator Instructions] For today\u2019s session, Geoff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP & President Diabetes Operating Unit; Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular portfolio; Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience portfolio; and Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical portfolio. [Operator Instructions] A - Ryan Weispfenning : We will take the first question from Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. Robbie, go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe I\u2019ll ask a two-parter upfront. The miss in the top line in the quarter, the guide down was pretty significant for the second half of the year. You point to slowing procedure growth or not a recovery they are hoping for yet it\u2019s different from what we\u2019re hearing from most of your peers in terms of stabilizing volume growth. So I was hoping you could spend more time. Walk us through what Medtronic is seeing and maybe why it\u2019s a little different relative to peers in terms of the recovery and the stabilization in volumes. And then as we think out to next year and fiscal \u201824, can you give some thoughts on the last call about FX and how we should be thinking about growth for next year. Any updates to that growth? And does it change with the updated second half guidance range? Thanks a lot. Geoff Martha : Okay. Thanks, Robbie. Okay. I saw three parts there. I\u2019m going to ask Karen to chime in to help me here on this one, but provide some details. But on the miss, like we said in the commentary, the primary issue is the pace of the recovery and there is the two buckets. There is the pace of our supply recovery, which we did make quite a bit of progress there and they got over the most acute issues that were plaguing us, but happened a little \u2013 it happened late in the quarter and pushed out our momentum, which gets to the second part of your question, which is the effects the guide down. The other bucket is part of your second question as well as on the markets. Many of our businesses are back, the majority of them are back to the pre-COVID level of their markets. But there are some that are not. And I\u2019ll let Karen walk through those and we were \u2013 we just overstated what that market recovery would be, and we will walk you through those and how those impact the second quarter \u2013 the second half. Karen, do you want to... Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, and thanks, Robbie. So let me talk about it more broadly than your question to, Robbie because I know you asked a specific question on procedure growth. So I\u2019ll talk about that and a little bit more broadly. So just on those two buckets. First, on our markets, some of our markets have not returned to normal growth levels and this does account for about \u2013 for over half of the reduction in our second half guide. You talked about competitors. You have heard from some of our competitors about a slow recovery in the neuro market and the TAVR market. And we are also seeing a slow recovery in basic coronary PCIs and some general surgery procedures that we mentioned in the commentary. And because these markets have not accelerated as quickly as we had anticipated, we decided to assume volumes in the back half remain at Q2 levels. If those volumes improve in those markets, that would be upside. We also talked about related to markets that we\u2019re expecting additional provincial tenders in China. And those were ones that we believed would occur next fiscal year and are occurring sooner, particularly in stapling and cardiac ablation. And then on the second bucket of supply that Geoff mentioned, we, obviously, did see meaningful improvement over the second quarter. But some of that happened late in the quarter, as we said, and that pushes out our assumptions for share recapture. For example, and particularly in SI, while we were short on supply, our competitor benefited. They stepped in to fill the shelves with our customers. We\u2019re under long-term contracts with those customers, so we will gain our share back. There is just a lag while the shelf inventory comes down. So hopefully, that gives you some context on our guide this morning. But just to summarize, in addition to our assumptions on market growth, we assume incremental contribution from products that we\u2019ve recently launched and supply that has recently improved. On your question on FY\u201924, it\u2019s still early. We have two quarters to go, and we\u2019re at the beginning of our planning process. So we\u2019re not going to give FY\u201924 guidance on this call. But I will say a few things, including currency because that was your question. First, on the top line, you can see that we expect to exit the year with mid-single-digit growth, and that\u2019s a great place to start the following year. Second, down the P&L, we\u2019re still in a challenging operating environment with inflation, interest rates and currency, as you mentioned. And on currency, we now estimate that to be a $0.36 headwind on the bottom line in FY\u201924. And that\u2019s, obviously, worse than the $0.18 that I mentioned for FY\u201923. And third, we\u2019re purposely driving significant expense reduction given these headwinds and given our focus on continuing to drive long-term investments for the company. So we\u2019ve got several puts and takes for next fiscal year, and we plan on giving you more on FY\u201924 as we move through the back half. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for all the color. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Robbie. We will take the next question please, Ryan. Ryan Weispfenning : The next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hi, good morning, everybody. A little bit more color on FY\u201924 as it relates to China VBP. I don\u2019t know if there is any way to think about how much of the China VBP stuff hit in FY\u201923 versus FY\u201924, given some of the new ones like EP and even neuro? And then I did want a little bit more color on TAVR as well. given the strong U.S. result there. Curious if you could kind of comment a little bit on the TAVR market and also share \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you can say how much share you think you took this quarter in U.S. TAVR? Geoff Martha : Yes. So thanks for the question, Travis. On the \u2013 why don\u2019t we start with the TAVR one because we \u2013 the market didn\u2019t grow quite as much as we had hoped, but it still was a strong growth driver for us, and we did do well from a share perspective. And why don\u2019t I Sean maybe comment on that, and then we will come back and help Karen talk about the VBP part of the question. Sean? Sean Salmon : Yes. Travis, we think we took about a 0.5 point of share for that for the full quarter, and it was really driven by the late \u2013 the last month of the quarter where we picked up some of that momentum in October with the launch of the Evolut FX we\u2019re in about 400 accounts of that so far. So we\u2019ve got some room to run there for the back half of the year, but that is very strong. I think the underlying market is still in the kind of high singles area. And I think that, that\u2019s really, as you know, just conspired against by the resource intensity that\u2019s required. You get this whole chain of events where you have to have a patient go through imaging prior to their eventual procedure, and there is a lot of hand us along the way. So those dynamics are continuing to play out around the world, but probably more in Europe and France and Germany than we see in other countries. And then we had a little bit of slowness on our own through Japan. Japan had a flare of COVID the summer, which was difficult. And we also had a problem where there was a sheet that we use for the procedure that we don\u2019t make that became unavailable because of supply challenges, and that led to some share loss in Japan. But overall, the TAVR is really strong for us with FX launching, and we\u2019re excited about back half to get to a full release of that product into all the accounts. Karen Parkhill : And on your China VBP question, Travis, about 15% to 20% of our back half guide down is due to the incremental China VBP being pulled forward from next year from our perspective from what we had assumed. China declined 9% in the second quarter. And that was because of an impact of VBP and spine. For the rest of this fiscal year, we don\u2019t expect China to be a material growth driver for us. And in fact, for the full year, we\u2019re expecting low single-digit declines in China. That said, as we look forward into FY\u201924, we will continue to have some VBP, but I think the vast majority will be behind us, and China should be a contributor of growth again next fiscal year. Geoff Martha : Just a little bit more color on the VBP. I mean we had visibility to these national tenders, and we factored that in earlier in the year. But what we didn\u2019t have real good visibility to some of these provincial tenders that came out here in the last couple of months. And that\u2019s part of the change in the guidance. And to Karen\u2019s point, look, longer-term, we still think China is a growth market, but it\u2019s not right now, and we factored that into our guidance. Travis Steed : Great. Thank you. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Travis. Next question please, Ryan. Ryan Weispfenning : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Geoff, my first question was on the back half guidance. When you look at 2Q, second quarter organic slightly north of 2% and the back half guidance of 3.5% to 4%. How do you risk is that 3.5% to 4%? Can you give us a bridge of what gets easier? I think you had some easier wind comps, etcetera. And I think related to that, is this \u2013 why is Medtronic confident that this is not a firm share loss in surgical innovations? Geoff Martha : Okay. Thanks for the question, Vijay. Let me take the \u2013 well, I\u2019ll take the share loss question first and then I\u2019ll get to the back half and maybe I have Karen talk to that one as well. But in SI, our surgical innovations, this \u2013 first of all, this is a contracted business with health systems and mainly us and our main competitor in that space. And in the past, there have been circumstances when the shoe is on the other foot when our competitor had a recall and have had recalls. And we did the same thing where we got picked up some incremental revenue and some share because the two big competitors are make-up the majority of what the hospitals are buying in the surgery space, but these hospitals do honor these contracts. There is a lot that goes into them and that revenue went back after the supply situation was resolved. And so that \u2013 we\u2019ve seen that over the years on multiple times. So these are contracted \u2013 like I said, contracted business for us. And based on our dialogue, with the health systems, we\u2019re confident this is going to come back as our supply, which we mentioned. We did get past the most acute part of our supply issues in the Surgical Innovations business, was this packaging issue. It did come later in the quarter and slower momentum, but we do have momentum now, and you should see that business recover. On the back half, I\u2019ll ask Karen to... Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Vijay. When we look at our back half ramp, we have new products. We\u2019ve got TAVR with Evolut FX that Sean has mentioned, was only in the market for a month in Q2. So we expect continued growth from that. We\u2019ve got Hugo starting to ramp. We\u2019ve got our Harmony valve returning to the market. We\u2019ve also got our diabetic painful neuropathy opportunity that will be driving more in the back half. and we\u2019ve got supply returning. We\u2019ve got supply returning for our LINQ II product in our cardiac diagnostics and also better supply in SI and ICDs. And we\u2019ve got reduced headwinds. Our sale events and aortic graphs are normalizing. So, all of those things really lead to the back half ramp. Hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. Geoff Martha : Yes. So I mean, beyond the supply returning, the back half, as Karen walked through a lot of it, is really powered by very tangible things beyond supply, product-related they are tangible and compelling. Vijay Kumar : Yes, that\u2019s helpful, Geoff. And then maybe one related, I think in the past, Medtronic has thought about itself as a mid single-digit top line company in light of these results, is that mid single-digit LRP still intact, I guess Medtronic lead to your supplement is growth with [indiscernible]? Thank you. Geoff Martha : I didn\u2019t hear the very last part of it, does Medtronic \u2013 but the answer to your question is yes. I mean, the mid-single-digit growth, we will exit the year at mid-single digits. You see throughout this year, you\u2019re seeing the acceleration from the first quarter, which was the depth of our supply issues. We\u2019re really in a tough spot. We were down minus 4%. Then this past quarter, on an organic basis, up 2% and then Karen walked you through the back half guide. But we exited the year at mid-single digits, and we believe that\u2019s durable. Like I said, based on these product launches that are here now immediate drivers and then we \u2013 Karen brought up a list of things that are already kind of tangible in the back half, but there is a number of other things that are still coming. The Aurora EV-ICD, PFA and Afib and Inceptiv with ECAPs and our SCS business and then there is the whole diabetes discussion with those products coming on in the U.S. in the next year. And the Hugo ramp will go on for a while. So there is a number of things that keep us going. And so that\u2019s why we feel good about the mid-single digit. Thank you, Vijay. Next question please, Ryan. Ryan Weispfenning : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Larry, please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. Can you, guys hear me, okay? Geoff Martha : Yes. Hi, Larry. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe on diabetes for Que. So Que, just a multipart question here. Did you ask for a variance on 780G? And if so, what was the response or when will you know? And if you don\u2019t get a variance, do you need reinspection for 780G clearance? And how long do you expect that to take? And just lastly on 780G, do you expect it to have the same impact in the U.S. as you\u2019ve seen outside the U.S.? Thanks for taking the question. Que Dallara : Thanks, Larry. So on your first question, no, we did not ask for a variance. We\u2019ve been focused on lifting the warning letter. I\u2019m pleased to say that we are 100% complete on the warning letter commitments, and we have welcomed the FDA back in to assess our current status. So I think that\u2019s forward progress, and that\u2019s the clearest path because, obviously, it\u2019s not just 780, but it is a whole pipeline of innovation that we care about from a growth perspective. So there is progress there. It\u2019s very hard to say, timing on that. I think that\u2019s up to the agency. We know they are working very hard on that. So we anticipate progress there as well. On your question around 780G progress in international markets, we\u2019re very pleased with the double-digit performance there. We do expect to see something similar in the U.S. market once approved. We are actually doing \u2013 we\u2019ve been really happy with how 780G has performed in the U.S. market. It\u2019s helping to stabilize attrition here. And as you know, our customers have a free upgrade option with 780 once approved in the U.S. market. And sorry, Larry, I missed your third \u2013 your second part of the question. Larry Biegelsen : No, Que, that\u2019s helpful. I guess, why didn\u2019t you ask for variant in the U.S., it seems like a kind of no risk option here? So why not ask for it. Thank you. Que Dallara : Primarily because as we\u2019ve stated, we\u2019ve been focused on really the long-term lifting up the warning letters is critically important. It\u2019s not just about 780G, but it\u2019s still about the pipeline. You know we submitted Simplera for CE Mark this year. We just submitted 780G with Simplera IDE last week. So, there is a long line of innovation that that we are interested in. And we were also very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making on correcting the warning letter commitment. So with those things progressing at the pace, we did not feel it was necessary to seek a variance. Larry Biegelsen : Alright. Thanks so much for taking the question. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Larry. Next question please, Ryan. Ryan Weispfenning : The next question comes from Matt O\u2019Brien at Piper Sandler. Matt, please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Brien: [Technical Difficulty] Geoff Martha : Okay. There seems to be a problem, Matt, with your audio. Maybe we will take the next question, Brad, and then we will try to come back to Matt. Brad Welnick : Yes. The next question comes from Josh Jennings of Cowen & Company. Josh, please go ahead. Geoff Martha : Josh, are you there? Josh Jennings : Yes. Can you guys hear me okay? Geoff Martha : Yes, we can hear you, Josh. Josh Jennings : Okay. Great. So, I just want to make sure. Just one maybe for Geoff and maybe Sean as well, just on the renal denervation program and understand, I think it\u2019s well understood that the totality of evidence can get the approval. I believe that your team has had preliminary discussions with payers and it might be helpful just in terms of under better understanding your optimism that not just approval could be in hand in the next 6 months to 12 months, but payer decisions will ultimately be positive. And then the follow-up is just on supply and just want to make sure I am clear on the dynamics here. And just the recovery and regaining momentum is what\u2019s left, but is the supply chain \u2013 are those headwinds gone? And just should we be expecting \u2013 I know you have got your team has executed on the streamlining or consolidation of operations and supply chain functions, and we start to see a benefit from those efforts in fiscal \u201824? Thanks for taking the questions. Geoff Martha : Maybe I will start with the supply situation. Are the supply chain issues gone, not completely, but the biggest pain, or if you will, is behind us, especially in surgical innovations with the packaging, as I mentioned, issue. What lingers a bit would be, like we have talked about before, some semiconductor, I would say, constraints. But the changes that we have made to our supply organization with the new leadership under Greg, the new structure, bringing in new people to help us with capabilities where we thought we weren\u2019t \u2013 where we needed to be, implementing new systems and new processes. And these changes, I believe are durable. I mean they are \u2013 so we are going to get \u2013 we are getting through this. The worst is behind us. We factored in or updated into the guidance, but there are some. I mean like some issues that are outstanding like the semiconductors, but all that\u2019s factored in, and we feel good about going forward, not just FY\u201924, but beyond that. Regarding Ardian, look, I will ask Sean to chime in here. But look, the \u2013 as you look at the data, we believe it\u2019s very compelling. And you see that the sham arm in the trial increased their medication and the Ardian arm reduced. And the difference is 10x. I mean it\u2019s a significant difference. And when you \u2013 when physicians look at it, they understand this and are excited about it and why we are optimistic with payers is because health systems and governments are really focused on \u2013 and payers are focused on hypertension, which \u2013 and like the current standard, as I mentioned in the commentary, just isn\u2019t working and more data came out to substantiate that in September a physician \u2013 to substantiate what people already know. And so now there is a new option. And I think payers are going to be compelled to take it seriously, especially with the public health epidemic that we are facing here. Sean, do you want to chime in and add some more color to this? Sean Salmon : Yes, you said it well, Geoff. And Josh, you are right. The totality of the data is really the strength of this program compared to just about any other new therapy I can think of there is really not a lot of comparisons for just how much good data we have here. It\u2019s over 3,000 patients in the real world data on top of the sham-controlled randomized studies. And importantly, we did a patient preference study, which is getting more and more considered by payers because they know that patients have a say in what they want to go do. And there is a large majority of patients that prefer having a procedure versus adding just even one more drug. And of course, we can get their blood pressure down without the addition of drugs, which is a huge benefit. I will remind you also that Ardian was a breakthrough device had that designation and in the world of MSET [ph] ruling that would have met automatic coverage. We don\u2019t know yet what the TSET pathway is going to look like. We will find out more about that in the fall timeframe, I suppose, or in the spring timeframe. But we do think that the novelty of this therapy, the desire of patients, and of course, the public health benefit that this can provide is going to be compelling to both public and private payers around the world. Geoff Martha : Thanks Josh. Take the next question please Brad. Brad Welnick : Yes. We will try Matt again. The next question will come from Matt O\u2019Brien at Piper Sandler. Matt, are you there? Matt O\u2019Brien: How about now? Geoff Martha : Yes, we can hear you now. Matt O\u2019Brien: Thanks for taking my questions. Sorry about that. I guess just to follow-up a little bit on Josh\u2019s question, and I know how enthusiastic you still are about Ardian. But I think the ambulatory number is one that is a little bit more robust in the office-based number. So, why would clinicians and payers be so interested in doing these cases or we are paying for them given the ambulatory feedback that we have seen? And are you guys still thinking about the market is $500 million by \u201826, $3 billion by the end of the decade? Geoff Martha : Sean, do you want to get into the specifics on the ambulatory versus the office? Sean Salmon : Yes. Matt, I think if you just recall how that study was done the patients were witnessed taking their blood pressure medicine in the morning. And whether they were taking that for the full six months or not, or they just took it that day, you saw the change in blood pressure that was during the daytime not what we have seen before in these prior trials. But at night time, there was still a reduction in ambulatory. So, I think the simple story here is that patients weren\u2019t taking their medications, except on the game day and their blood pressure drops. Now, we don\u2019t know that for sure, we didn\u2019t test blood in urine every day. We just test it on game day. And we know that there were more medications in the patients that were in the control arm than in the treated arm. And as Geoff said, the changes increasing medication, decreasing medication, taking even medications for blood pressure that weren\u2019t even prescribed maybe from their medicine cabinet, maybe from their spouse or partners medicine cabinet. There is a lot of changes in medicine, which we know were present different than the prior studies. We actually have that proof now that we can measure the drug metabolites. So, a cleaner, if you will, measure is that morning blood pressure, we took the office blood pressure. And that blood pressure is the one that\u2019s used for all the epidemiology studies that show what the reduction in blood pressure means for the avoidance of events and reduction of cost. And it\u2019s also the primary endpoint that\u2019s gotten just about every \u2013 I think maybe every pharmaceutical approved for the treatment of high blood pressure. So, it is the robust standard. In fact ambulatory is not even reimbursed in this country. So, it\u2019s not used routinely in clinical practice. So, it is a robust measurement that was consistently performed throughout this trial and across the other trials that we have done. So, I am confident in that part. In terms of the market size, we are very confident in this therapy. There is 1 billion people with blood pressure problems around the world, even if very small amount gets you to the kind of market growth that we think is going to be meaningful for the company. So, we are very confident in this therapy and that is approval and ultimate uptake. Matt O\u2019Brien: Okay. That makes sense. I appreciate that. And then it\u2019s not a related follow-up, but turning over to cardiac rhythm for a second. Just I would love to hear about the competitive dynamics that are going on with Micra because you have got a competitor there now? And then what the expectation is with the EVICD, given the long-standing presence of another one of your competitors in that market. What should we be expecting between those two as we progress over the next 12 months? Thanks. Sean Salmon : Yes. So, for Micra, we continue to grow, and you saw 18% globally, 40% of that was from international sales. And really Japan and China, in particular, really drove that growth and continued success. And we will see continued penetration in international markets and in the U.S. and a shift between single chamber to the AV device, which can pick up a larger proportion of patients. It\u2019s about 30% of the market there. And in the next 12 months, we are going to refresh both the VR and the AV devices in the coming year around the world. So, while we have some competition in the United States, we fared pretty well. I think the ease of use of our micro device in the long-term data that we have as well as just the familiarity with our system has made it pretty durable. On Aurora EVICD, as you know, we have got CE Mark coming up. That\u2019s a little bit of a different technique. You have got to put a lead underneath the breast bone, which takes some training to learn and we will be very meticulous in the way we roll that out. But make no mistake that is a product that really offers a huge benefit, getting leads out of the heart, having half the size in the can and twice the battery life compared to the other device that realm and being able to voice shock by pacing people out of their fatal arrhythmia as opposed to having to have a painful shock. Those are all really, really welcome improvements, and we are excited to roll that technology out first in Europe and then the United States next year. Geoff Martha : Cardiac Rhythm business has done well and we expect it to continue to do well with products like Micra and EVICD, but also pioneering conduction system pacing, and we have got a nice pipeline there and really a strong leadership team and strong position. So, thanks for the question Matt. Sean Salmon : Thank you, Matt. Next question please Brad. Brad Welnick : Yes. The next question comes from Matt Taylor at Jefferies. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Taylor : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay? Sorry guys, can you hear me okay? Geoff Martha : Yes, we can, Matt. Matt Taylor : Okay. Sorry. So, I wanted to just explore you talked about the slower recovery of some of these elective and developed markets. And obviously, there is staffing, and you said other challenges. I guess maybe you could just give us some insight into two things. One is, could you talk a little bit more about procedure trends through the quarter? Did you see any improvement? And then what gives you the confidence or what intelligence do you have to point to whether this is really staffing or I think investors are worried about lack of pent-up demand. Could you just address that? Geoff Martha : Sure. I will ask Karen to comment on the procedure trends through the quarter and then we can talk to the staffing issue. Karen Parkhill : Yes. So, I would say, through the quarter, we did see, particularly in the markets that we had mentioned not as robust recovery, but some recovery. But as we ended the quarter with less robust recovery, we are just assuming that in those areas, those procedures stay where they were in the back half. We will see if that\u2019s a good assumption or not. As we look at the first few weeks of our current quarter \u2013 of the third quarter, we are seeing improvement from the second quarter. So, that\u2019s pointing to some good things, but we will see. Geoff Martha : Yes. So, just to highlight what Karen is saying there, I mean we were disappointed that we missed the call on this one for the Q2. And so now in our guidance, we have assumed a prolonged recovery here, especially for those segments that we called out, not all the segments. Like we said, many of the segments are back to pre-COVID, but there are a handful on those electives and developed markets that we have called out and Karen walked you through the assumption for the back half of the year. In terms of the staffing, I hear that dynamic in some of the cardiology space is more than others. And maybe have Sean comment on that. Sean Salmon : Yes. I would say a couple of things on that. First of all, there is \u2013 you take a therapy like TAVR, where there is multiple handoffs. You have to have pre-imaging. You have to get the patient worked up. They get their procedure done. And then there are sometimes even post imaging that\u2019s done. So, a lot of handoffs and the patients tend to be elderly. So, there is \u2013 you want to sure you schedule that in a way that\u2019s okay, that they can get it all done in an efficient way. We don\u2019t want them exposed to the healthcare environment for a long time. And I think that\u2019s challenging. It\u2019s also true that you can\u2019t wait forever. You have got \u2013 with severe aortic stenosis, there is about an 80% mortality rate for 2 years from your diagnosed that. So, it\u2019s more lethal than cancer, for example, most cancers. So, it\u2019s not something you can put off forever, but it is resource intensive. And I think the other thing we are seeing with staffing just in general is, there is a prioritization for patients that can get in and out relatively quickly so they can make downstream staffing available. So, whether it\u2019s ICU recovery or you have got even transport to kind of move. And I think there is some arbitrage in some countries even on the margin that they make on those procedures. Cardiac surgeries have grown like a 5.5% for us, so very robust. There is a lot of margin that comes out of cardiac surgery patients. They tend not to be as deferrable as, say, like a PCI patient, for example. So, we hear it in pockets. I mentioned before, France and Germany seem to be some places that are really struggling with staffing in Europe, and we see it just in pockets around the United States and other places. So, it is a dynamic situation, and we think it has gotten better, certainly a lot of places, but not everywhere yet. Geoff Martha : Okay. Thank you, Matt. Next question Brad. Brad Welnick : Yes. The next question comes from Pito Chickering at Deutsche Bank. Pito, please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Hey guys. Thanks for taking me in here. I know that you don\u2019t have a ton of exposure here, but there has been a healthy debate around hospital demand for capital equipment this year. Can you give us any color on what you are seeing from behavior changes in hospitals for capital ordering in 2Q and what you guys assume in the back half of the year? Geoff Martha : Our capital, first of all, isn\u2019t a huge piece yet of our revenue. But it is \u2013 it tends to be tied to profitable procedures, and we actually had a strong capital performance in last quarter. And especially in our Cranial & Spinal Technology\u2019s business, CST, our capital there, we had a number of our \u2013 whether it would be navigation, inter-operative imaging, had record capital quarters for us. So, we are \u2013 we definitely see a bit of \u2013 it takes a little longer to close a deal, but the demand as you are working with the hospital and how they are going to pay or finance this, but we are having strong demand in those areas. And then, of course, we mentioned Hugo. Hugo is still new for us, but we are very happy with the placements we have been able to make on Hugo here. Of course, those are outside the U.S., but very pleased with that. Pito Chickering : Alright. Thanks so much. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Pito. We have got time for one more question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick : Yes. Our final question comes from Joanne Wuensch, Citi. Joanne, please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Hi. Can you hear me? Geoff Martha : Yes Joanne. Good morning. Joanne Wuensch : Wonderful. Good morning and early happy Thanksgiving. This led straight into my Hugo question. Could you give us a little bit of an update on how you feel about the market potential for the product, the timing of U.S. approval? And at one stage, several years ago, you were talking about the potential contribution. Is there a way to start thinking about that again? Thank you. Geoff Martha : Sure. Well, thanks for the question, Joanne. Yes, like I said, we have good news on Hugo. We are kicking off the U.S. IDE with our first case is scheduled for December based on getting these instruments enhancements approved. And like I just said to Pito, we are pleased with the system placements. And in terms of the other color or commentary on that, I will ask Bob White to chime in. Bob White : Yes. Thanks Geoff and thanks Joanne. Good morning. Couple of thoughts here. First, on the overall market of 4Q go, we continued to be really excited about it. Remember, there\u2019s \u2013 around the world still 95% cases are not done. That could be done robotically assistedly. So, we believe this is a true market expansion opportunity. So, we are still really excited about the continued long-term health of the market and excited to be the number two player in this space. With respect to the timing of U.S. approval, as Geoff mentioned, we expect to begin our U.S. IDE by the end of this calendar year. So, that\u2019s exciting. Actual approval in the U.S., of course, depends upon the agency and the process there. So, I really can\u2019t comment on that. And overall, with respect to the contribution, as you mentioned, I think it\u2019s early to call that, but given our system is now installed around the world in markets in APAC, EMEA, Lat-Am. We just received regulatory approvals and indication expansions in Japan, which is the third largest robotics market in the world. We have general surgery approval in the EU, Canada and Australia, which opens up the hernia market for us. And we have started to see really strong presence at some really key congresses in Europe where live stream cases, etcetera. So, a little early to call it contribution, Joanne, but we are starting to see the momentum and the acceleration that we talked about. Thank you. Brad Welnick : Thanks Joanne. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Joanne. Ryan Weispfenning : Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Geoff Martha : Okay. Thanks Ryan. Well, first of all, thank you everybody for the questions. And we do really appreciate your support and continued interest in Medtronic. And we look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q3 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on February 21. So with that, thanks again for tuning in today. Please stay healthy and safe. I understand there is a lot of people traveling this holiday. And for those of you in the U.S., I would like to wish you and your families a very happy Thanksgiving.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning. I am Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. Welcome to Minnesota where signs of spring are in the air. I appreciate that you are joining us today for Medtronic\u2019s Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Video Webcast. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I will share a few details about today\u2019s webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 27, 2023 as well as our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the Executive VPs from each of our four segments will join us. And we will take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today\u2019s program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today\u2019s program, many of the statements we make maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors to cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from our Q1 acquisition of Intersect ENT. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the second quarter of fiscal \u201823 and are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth calendar quarter of 2021, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let\u2019s head into the studio and hear about the quarter. Geoff Martha : Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We reported our Q3 results this morning and we executed to deliver a top and a bottom line that were ahead of our guidance and Street expectations. We are urgently forging the path to durable growth and there are many proof points of our progress in these results. Our cardiovascular and our neuroscience portfolios had strong high single-digit organic growth as we launch new products and demonstrated continued strength in our established market leading cardiac rhythm management and spine franchises. And at the same time, some of the recent revenue headwinds that have held back our growth are subsiding, including product availability in businesses like surgical innovations, cardiac diagnostics, aortic and ENT. The aggressive transformation at Medtronic is advancing. We are focused on reducing complexity, enhancing our culture, improving capital allocation and portfolio management and upgrading our global manufacturing operations and supply chain capabilities. At the same time, we are progressing on our plans for significant cost reductions. These are aimed at partially mitigating the continued impacts from macro conditions such as inflation and effects on our profitability and cash flow. These cost reductions also create room on our P&L so that we can increase our growth investments and I am very encouraged by the rebound in our revenue growth despite procedure volumes remaining a little softer in a few markets and volume-based procurement in China. We are confident in delivering durable revenue growth over the coming quarters as recent revenue headwinds continue to dissipate and we execute across our businesses. So, let\u2019s take a closer look at our Q3 results. As I highlighted at an investor conference last month, we are thinking about our portfolio of businesses in three groups : highest growth, synergistic and established market leaders. So I will start with our established market leaders, a group of our largest businesses that make up about half of our revenue. Both our cardiac rhythm and spine businesses had really good quarters, growing 8% and 5% respectively. In CRM, we continue to see strong market adoption of our micro-leadless pacemakers, which grew 14% and our Defibrillation Solutions business grew 7% as replacement headwinds are moderating. And just last week, we received CE Mark for our Aurora Extravascular ICD. In Cranial & Spinal Technologies, we delivered another strong quarter, with 6% growth in Core Spine, including 12% growth in the United States and 8% growth in Neurosurgery. This is driven by our market leading ecosystem of Aible-enabling technology and the associated pull-through of our best-in-class spinal implants. From our AI-enabled surgical planning platform to our patient-specific and differentiated spine implants, to our imaging our navigation and robotic technologies, we are differentiating ourselves with spine surgeons around the world. Turning to our Surgical Innovations business, SI grew sequentially as we made solid progress recapturing the share that we lost due to supply challenges over the last three quarters. Year-over-year, SI declined as a result of expected stapling VBP tenders in China. But excluding China sales, SI grew 5% in Q3. Look, surgeons around the world prefer our advanced surgical products and we expect the momentum we are seeing in SI to continue. In particular, in our leading advanced energy franchise, we are seeing strong adoption of our recently launched cordless Sonicision 7 and we are preparing to launch our recently approved LigaSure XP. So we are on the right path with our established market leader businesses. And at the same time, we are advancing our position in high secular growth med tech markets. These businesses are contributing about 20% of our revenue today and collectively growing above our company average. We are investing disproportionately in these businesses and expect them to become an even bigger part of our growth over time. So starting with Structural Heart, while the TAVR market continued to be impacted by healthcare staffing challenges and COVID in Japan, we drove 11% growth in Q3, including 12% growth in the United States. We are seeing great physician reception for our Evolut FX system, which just completed its full quarter of launch in the U.S. Evolut FX combines industry leading durability with enhanced and predictable valve deployment. And in addition, data was presented during the quarter at PCR London Valves, showing Evolut FX\u2019s Commissure alignment has improved significantly, which is important for coronary access and valve hemodynamics. Now looking ahead, we will continue to bring Evolut FX around the world and we are currently seeking approval in the Japanese and European markets. In cardiac ablation solutions, we grew 3% globally as provincial China VBP tenders weighed on our results. Outside of China, CAS grew in the high single-digits, including low double-digit growth in the United States on the continued strong adoption of our leading Arctic Front cryoablation technology. We are also advancing what we believe will become the leading pulsed field ablation portfolio. And in 2 weeks, highly anticipated data for our PULSED AF pivotal trial will be released in the late-breaker session at ACC. The trial is evaluating our PULSE Select PFA catheter in both paroxysmal and persistent patients and this will be the first results from an IDE trial in the PFA space and we are on track to be one of the first companies with a PFA catheter in the U.S. market. We also continue to make progress on bringing our Affera mapping and navigation platform and Sphere-9 catheter to the market as we completed enrollment in our pivotal trial during the quarter. Sphere-9 can perform high-density mapping and deliver either PFA or RF energy, all from the same catheter. And given Sphere-9 is a focal point PFA catheter, it is highly complementary to our PULSE Select anatomical PFA catheter. Finally, our CAS business just launched the AcQCross transseptal access system with a zero exchange workflow and the only system approved for both mechanical and RF crossings. So when you think about our Arctic Front crysolution, our DiamondTemp RF catheter, our PFA catheters, our left heart access solutions and our Affera map nav system, we are assembling a leading ecosystem of technologies to meaningfully increase our participation in the fast growth 8 billion EP ablation space. In Surgical Robotics, we are making good progress as the second major player in this exciting space. We continue to see positive sales momentum with the rollout of our differentiated Hugo robotic system in many international markets and we started our U.S. IDE trial for our urology indication during the quarter. Given less than 5% of surgical procedures globally are done robotically, we expect our surgical robotics business to become a meaningful growth driver for Medtronic. In Neurovascular, we grew 9% and would have grown a couple of points more, if not for the China VBP. We continue to see very strong growth in several categories, including flow diversion, aspiration and stent retrievers. Given stroke is the number two cause of death globally and there is still very low therapy penetration, we see a long runway for high growth in this market that is approaching $4 billion. And in Diabetes, we continue to see strong international growth offset by declines in the U.S. where we lack our latest products. We remain focused on resolving our FDA warning letter and are ready for reinspection. We also remain in active review with the FDA on our submission of the MiniMed 780G system with the Guardian 4 sensor. Outside the U.S., our Diabetes business grew 18% on continued strong sales momentum of 780G and Guardian 4. The 780G is now launched in over 90 countries, up from 60 last quarter. We are seeing strong CGM attachment rates, which drove CGM growth up 34% outside the U.S. We continue to invest heavily in assembling our ecosystem of durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, sensors, algorithms and customer service with multiple programs under development, all with the intent of restoring strong growth of our important diabetes franchise over the coming years. And in our synergistic businesses, we also had strong performances across several businesses. We grew double-digits in Cardiac Diagnostics as we ramped up production of LINQ II. In Neuromodulation, we grew 12% in pain stim and the market continues to recover. And our GI business grew high single digits on strong adoption of GI Genius, which uses artificial intelligence to help physicians detect polyps during colonoscopies. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Karen to discuss our third quarter financial performance and our guidance. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Geoff. Our third quarter organic revenue increased 4.1%, exceeding our guidance and representing a significant acceleration from our first half results as we begin to put the acute supply chain challenges behind us. Our non-GAAP EPS of $1.30 landed above our guidance by $0.03 on higher revenue growth and increased interest income, and $0.06 if we take into account a larger currency headwind than expected at the beginning of the quarter. Looking at our revenue from a geographic perspective, U.S. grew 2%, and our non-U.S. developed markets increased 6%, even with a 3% decline in Japan as COVID affected procedure volumes. Excluding Japan, non-U.S. developed markets increased 8%. Emerging markets grew 5%, impacted by an 8% decline in China from COVID and VBP provincial tenders in stapling, cardiac ablation and neurovascular. Outside of China, emerging markets actually grew 17%. I would also note that China represented a 110 basis point headwind on our total company growth, which highlights the strength of the recovery in our other markets. VBP has affected us more than many of our competitors, given the size and breadth of our business in China. However, we do expect that we are now through the majority of the impact. Our adjusted gross margin declined in the quarter as we faced impacts from inflation and currency with currency driving about third of the change. These declines were expected and a result of inflationary pressures that occurred two to three quarters ago. Our incurred manufacturing variances have continued to be significant in the past few quarters. And as they roll off our balance sheet on to our P&L, we expect continued gross margin pressure in Q4 and next year. The gross margin impact translated into a decline in our adjusted operating margin as well, although this was partially muted by expense control and the benefit of our currency hedging program. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to execute our enhanced capital allocation and portfolio management work, balancing future growth investments with returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders, primarily in the form of our dividend. We see strong opportunities for organic growth investments internally, leading us to target R&D growth at or above revenue growth. And we continue to focus on supplementing our organic investments with tuck-in acquisitions. We\u2019ve also announced this fiscal year three businesses we intend to separate that account for about 8% of our revenue. And we\u2019re making progress towards completing those transactions. We expect to close our Renal Care joint venture with DaVita here in the fourth quarter, and continue to progress with the separation of our patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses, which we expect to occur sometime in the second half of next fiscal year. We have also closed on acquisitions that will contribute to our growth in the years ahead, including Affera, which expands our presence in cardiac ablation, and Intersect ENT, which adds unique sinus implants to our ENT portfolio. We have driven these moves to not only focus and streamline our portfolio, but also to improve our weighted average market growth rate over time. Now turning to our guidance. Given our top and bottom line beat in the third quarter, we are raising our full year revenue growth and EPS outlook. On the top line, we expect our fourth quarter organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 5%, which is unchanged from what was implied by our second half guidance that I gave last quarter. I would note that our organic growth guidance excludes the impact of currency and revenue from our Intersect ENT acquisition. And it also now excludes revenue from our Renal Care Solutions business as we expect the separation to occur during the fourth quarter. If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a negative impact on our fourth quarter revenue of $165 million to $215 million. Taking into account currency, Intersect ENT revenue and the partial quarter of Renal Care Solutions revenue, our guidance would imply reported revenue in the range of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion. We are also maintaining the fourth quarter revenue growth segment expectations that were implied by the back half guidance I gave last quarter. We continue to expect Cardiovascular to be up 5.5% to 6%, Medical Surgical to grow 2.5% to 3%, neuroscience to increase 6.5% to 7% and Diabetes to decline in the low single digits, all on an organic basis. On the bottom line, we continue to drive significant expense reductions to partially offset the impact of inflation and foreign currency. Given our third quarter $0.03 beat, we raised the lower end of our fiscal \u201823 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance by $0.03 to the new range of $5.28 to $5.30, including an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.21 at recent rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.57. At recent rates, FX is about a $0.09 headwind to fourth quarter EPS. While we won\u2019t give guidance this fiscal year until our fourth quarter call in May, I did give some color on last quarter\u2019s call, and we will remind you of it today. We\u2019re encouraged by our recent progress on revenue growth. At the same time, current macro factors and our imperative to protect R&D investment are expected to create significant EPS headwinds next fiscal year. At recent rates, FX is a few hundred million dollar tailwind to fiscal \u201824 revenue and an approximate $0.27 headwind to EPS, which translates to a 5% headwind to EPS growth. While inflationary pressures are starting to moderate, we still see significant mid-single-digit inflationary impacts on our cost of goods sold as wage and raw material price increases continue to roll off our balance sheet and into our P&L. We are working to partially mitigate these headwinds through significant cost reductions. But both inflation and currency and to a lesser extent, interest and tax, are all looking to be headwinds that reduce our earnings power in fiscal \u201824. I would summarize by saying that as we navigate this period of increased macro headwinds, we will be driving disciplined cost reduction, and we are committed to investing in our future growth drivers and our turnaround as we firmly believe these important investments are necessary to drive durable revenue growth and long-term value creation. Before I hand it back to Geoff, I want to take a moment to thank the thousands of employees across Medtronic who delivered this quarter. You are executing with excellence and accountability, leveraging our scale with differentiating capabilities and managing our resources to accelerate innovation. It is because of your efforts that we will create a durable growth company powered by our people as we continue our mission-driven work of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life. Back to you, Geoff. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Karen. Now before we open the lines for questions, I\u2019ll make a few closing remarks. Last quarter, I noted that our aggressive agenda to transform this company would take time, and that\u2019s still true. But I hope you\u2019ll take away that we are operating with a high sense of urgency, which you can see reflected in our results this quarter. We\u2019re reducing our complexity, enhancing our capabilities and augmenting our management team with new leaders that bring an outside diverse perspective. We\u2019re also exercising decisive capital allocation and portfolio management devoting more capital to high-growth opportunities and divesting non-core assets. There is an intense focus from me, our Board, our management and our employees to create a company with sustainable growth that you can count on. We\u2019re in attractive markets with growing populations globally that can benefit from our therapies. And we fully expect to deliver durable revenue growth and turn our scale into a long-term competitive advantage. And through this process, create tremendous value for our shareholders. Now let\u2019s move to Q&A. We\u2019re going to try to get as many analysts as possible, so we ask you limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] For today\u2019s session, Geoff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of the Diabetes Operating Unit; Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio; Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience Portfolio; and Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Great. Congrats on a nice quarter, and good morning. Maybe I could start, and I appreciate, Karen, you\u2019re not giving formal guidance, but I was hoping you could discuss where the OpEx cuts are coming from? It sounds like you\u2019re going to continue to invest in R&D. So what exactly are you cutting? How aggressively are you cutting? Will this prevent any of your competitiveness on the top line? And then I\u2019ll ask my follow-up as well. The street has you with 3% EPS growth for next year. Do you think that\u2019s the right place for us to be based on your comments today? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks for your question, Robbie. When we look at our higher cost environment that we\u2019re facing, like many companies you\u2019ve seen recently, we really have to evaluate our full cost structure and look for opportunities to reduce both spending and cost. So we\u2019re in the midst of that right now. We expect to drive a significant expense reduction to help partially offset the headwinds that we\u2019re facing and the investment that we believe we need to make. When we look at next fiscal year, I\u2019ll just give you a little bit more comments on it. I know there is a desire to give EPS guidance early, but we\u2019re still working through our plan. And there are more than a typical number of moving pieces. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re sticking to our normal time line of giving guidance in Q4. But when we look at revenue, we grew 4.1% in Q3 and our guidance for Q4 implies sequential improvement. We expect \u2013 we\u2019ve said that we expect to drive greater revenue growth in \u201824 than we have in \u201823, and we\u2019ve said that we\u2019re focused on delivering durable mid-single-digit revenue growth over the longer term. So we like the progress that we\u2019ve made recently, both on our recent revenue growth performance and on important things in our pipeline to drive that revenue growth. And we always have said that we believe our WAMGR is in the mid-single-digit range. But as we move down the P&L, we\u2019ve got this delayed inflationary impact on our gross margin that you\u2019ve seen this quarter, and that will continue in the next quarter in FY \u201824. We\u2019ve seen inflation \u2013 the pressures on inflation beginning to improve. But as you know, that\u2019s got a delayed impact on our P&L. We also have currency, interest and tax that are macro headwinds as well. And obviously, we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we\u2019re going to continue to drive investments to drive the long-term growth and turnaround of this company. We are still in the process of seeing how all that nets out with our significant expense reduction. And obviously, we\u2019re going to give guidance on our fourth quarter call in May. But we have said that this will be a tougher year on the bottom line where our earnings power will be significantly reduced. I hope that helps. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay, thanks, Robbie. Next question, please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Larry, please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And I\u2019ll echo my congratulations on a nice quarter here. I\u2019d like to focus on China, which declined high single digits in Q3. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing there in terms of procedure volumes coming back? And the VBP headwind, you gave a lot of helpful color in the JPMorgan slides on the percent of your \u2013 the headwind in the first half and the percentage products impacted in fiscal \u201823 and fiscal \u201824. I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is what would overall China growth, fiscal \u201823 and fiscal \u201824? How much of a headwind will that continue to be with VBP? And how does it impact your ability to grow mid-single digits in fiscal \u201824? I heard Geoff, you talked about durable growth a lot this morning. Should we be thinking more like 4 to 5 next year because of the VBP headwinds? Thanks for taking the question. Geoff Martha : Yes. Thanks, Larry. Good to hear from you, and thanks for the question. Obviously, China is a big one for us. And yes, I\u2019ll turn it over to Karen to answer some of the kind of the details on the headwinds, what we\u2019re seeing here recently. Karen Parkhill : Yes. So just \u2013 it\u2019s hard for us to parse out this quarter the impact of procedures in VBP. So we\u2019re not doing that. But we have said on VBP that we expect to be 50% done with the impacts of VBP by the end of this fiscal year. And as we move into next fiscal year, we still do have some VBP to come, but we expect to be 80% done by the end of next fiscal year. So this quarter, we had a VBP impact from stapling and cardiac ablation and a little bit in coils from Neurovascular. And as we look ahead into next fiscal year, we still do have some stapling provincial tenders coming. And we\u2019ve got a little bit more Neurovascular and some in some cardio businesses including cardiac rhythm, structural heart, aortic, peripheral vascular. But again, where the majority finished by the end of this fiscal year, and we\u2019ve got a little bit more to go next fiscal year. Geoff Martha : I mean just to clarify one thing. I mean we think that 80% of our portfolio, as we\u2019ve taken a step back, could be impacted by VBP. And that will all \u2013 we\u2019re 50% of the way through. And the remaining 30%, we will get in FY \u201824. We don\u2019t think the remaining 20% will be impacted certain things that are nuanced or under the radar screen. And what we\u2019re doing here is taking out some of our selling and marketing costs in China to offset the lower prices because this business is now more contracted through this VBP. So the government is living up to the volume commitments from those VBPs at these lower prices. The discounts have gotten lower as they have gone on. I think the Chinese government has realized that med tech is not exactly like pharma, and we have more selling expenses than maybe pharma does because I think they modeled a lot of this off of pharma and based on my discussions with Chinese government officials. So that\u2019s good. And we\u2019re \u2013 basically, we will reset our business and grow from there. And so, FY \u201824 will be another year where China is a bit of a headwind. We factor that into our guidance. We were taking out expenses and we will rebase our business and grow from there. So, a lot of thought, a lot of conversations with the Chinese government, a lot of thought here, look, we are comfortable with our strategy. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thank you, Larry. Next question, please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Congrats on the printed. Thanks for taking my question. I had a two-part and I\u2019ll ask them upfront. When you look at Q4, what is changing sequentially here, Karen? Because when I look at 3Q, you did 4% organic despite med sort of declining, continued Diabetes headwinds and China headwinds since Q4. What are these three pieces \u2013 what are you assuming for those three buckets? And I think you mentioned the renal impact in Q4. Could you specify that? And Geoff, for you, I understand you\u2019re not giving fiscal \u201824 guidance, but when you think about the incremental changes, right, what are the positive tailwinds and negative headwinds? Is China still declining in fiscal \u201824? What happens to Diabetes? Is that on the plus side or minus side? And any other plus or minus at a high level would be helpful. Karen Parkhill : Yes, Vijay, let me take the first part of your question. In terms of our Q4 revenue ramp, when we gave our second half guidance last quarter, we expected sequential improvement from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And obviously, we\u2019re still expecting sequential improvement. That\u2019s going to be driven by continued consistency of supply, which we expect, which has already improved across the portfolio and will continue to improve. We also have some recent product launches, like Evolut FX and Hugo, which will continue to ramp. You may recall, we have our harmony Harmony valve, which will return to market as well. And then we\u2019ve also got some launches into new markets, like diabetic neuropathy that will begin to take some hold. And we\u2019ve got reduced headwinds from things like vents and VBP in the quarter. You asked specifically about Renal Care. We do expect to close that joint venture with DaVita in the fourth quarter. So we simply noted that when we guided so that we didn\u2019t force you all to change your models mid-quarter. We just put it in now. I hope that helps. Geoff Martha : Just to finish off \u2013 just to highlight one thing in Karen\u2019s commentary there. A big one will be continued turnaround of our Surgical Innovations business. That was really hit hard, as you guys know, by the supply chain issues. You saw a nice sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3, and you\u2019ll see another improvement from Q3 to Q4. And that \u2013 Karen mentioned supply chain issues subsiding, a big area where you\u2019ll see that manifested is in Surgical Innovations. When you look at FY \u201824, well, let\u2019s start with some of the known risks. You highlighted China VBP, and we \u2013 Karen and I already talked about that a bit. That will still be an issue as we go from the 50% of our portfolio that\u2019s done in FY \u201823 to the \u2013 to another 30% that gives us 80% by the end of FY \u201824. So that will be a headwind. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve said whether China\u2019s growing or shrinking, but it\u2019s definitely not growing at our historic double-digit again next year. The other \u2013 and look, there is still work to be done on supply chain. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 our supplier \u2013 the supply chain out there is still a bit fragile. Although every quarter, it\u2019s getting better for us and \u2013 but as you look at some of the momentum, like you\u2019ve seen from us from Q1 to Q2, from Q2 to Q3 and then implicit in our guidance is a nice acceleration kind of from Q3 to Q4. So we\u2019re excited about that, happy with the momentum. And as we look into FY \u201824, some of the specific businesses, you mentioned Diabetes. We\u2019re optimistic we\u2019re going to get 780G on the market here in the U.S., and that will have a nice impact on Diabetes plus continued performance in Europe. So that should be \u2013 assuming that happens, that should help accelerate some of the growth in Diabetes. Surgical Robotics is doing really well. And as we move into FY \u201824, have a bit more scale and a bit more impact on our numbers. Cardiac Ablation Solutions, I\u2019m sure we will get some questions on our mapping and navigation system as well as our various PFA catheters. You start to \u2013 we will start to feel some impact from them. And continued strong performance across the Neuroscience portfolio, I think, highlighted the CST or cranial spinal technologies business as well as you\u2019ll see continued strength in ENT. We will anniversary the Intersect acquisition at some point and that goes organic. So those are some of the things that we look at as \u2013 in FY \u201824. But it\u2019s \u2013 there is some, I think, broad supply chain recovery, especially in SI and then a couple of highlights, like I mentioned, CAS, Surgical Robotics, Diabetes in the U.S. Ryan Weispfenning : Great. Thank you, Vijay. Next question please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Joanne, please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much and good morning and nice sequential growth there. I have two questions. One is specific to the spine business. It was particularly strong this quarter. And I\u2019m just a little bit curious about what you\u2019re seeing is driving that and how you think about it going forward? And then the other one is a little bit more esoteric. I heard the word urgent or urgently a couple of times throughout the early presentation. What does urgently forging mean and how does that trans to sort of milestones that we can look forward to? Thank you. Geoff Martha : Well, thanks, Joanne, for the question. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the second one. Look, there is \u2013 the word urgent, there is a lot of major change that we\u2019ve got going on across the business. And I think it\u2019s important for people to understand the depth and breadth of those changes. And I know there is the desire to see things move quicker. And yes, we\u2019re in some ways, encouraged and we\u2019re encouraged by the progress, but we\u2019d like to see it go faster as well. But the speed of the \u2013 of our progress of getting the top line growth and adjusting our cost base to reflect the new reality with inflation and FX, on a company our size, the impact of these changes take a bit more time than \u2013 they take some time. But the actions that we\u2019re taking are \u2013 we are moving quickly on these. And I think that\u2019s the idea here. So we\u2019re moving quickly on a number of things, whether be the changes \u2013 all the investments and changes to our supply chain to the divestitures that we\u2019re working on to the integration of these acquisitions, like Affera and are moving our cash business forward. There is just a lot going on and it\u2019s just important to understand that we\u2019re moving very quickly on these things, and the results are starting, and we\u2019re encouraged by \u2013 that you\u2019re starting to see the results. When it comes to spine, look \u2013 was strong. Last quarter was strong too. It was just offset by some of the \u2013 the last couple of quarters offset a little bit by the China VBP. But if you look underneath it, we have been quoting that U.S. implant growth rates that have been in the double digits, I mean that\u2019s very, very strong and something, especially for some of our level of market share by far, again, the number one market share player to be growing like that. What\u2019s driving that is the enabling technology ecosystem. It\u2019s something we have been working on aggressively since 2015. You have got the robot, you have got navigation, you have got interoperative imaging, you have got power instruments. Now, you have got this AI-based surgical planning system that basically \u2013 it\u2019s we are winning over the hearts and minds of physicians as they see where we are going and actually a real commitment to changing spine surgery with this arsenal of technology. And we have integrated it and it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s starting to help the workflow and move faster and more efficient. All of this coming together, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it. And at the same time, we have been able to invest in implants, so that the implants were still the latest and greatest. And I think Brett Wall and Skip Kill and the team have done a really good job. I don\u2019t know, Brett, if you want to make any further comments on that? Brett Wall : Yes. Geoff and Joanne, thanks for the question. This has been something we have been working on for a while, and the strategy is really coming together with this enabling technology that actually allows for better planning, better execution, better follow-up and assuming and assuring that you actually get the result that you want in the procedure. That technology, along with best-in-class implants and biologics is providing this ecosystem, that\u2019s terrific for the physician and actually institutions that want to use it. And actually, the strategy is playing out like we have wanted to do with the significant growth in the largest market, which is the U.S. And as Geoff mentioned, now we are on the second quarter of double-digit growth there in our core spine business in the U.S. And we like our strategy, technology and how this is playing out for us. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thanks Joanne. Next question please Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Miksic : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had two follow-ups, if I could, just quickly on diabetes and TAVR. So Geoff, your comments this morning, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just tone or my own impression, but it seemed like incrementally, perhaps more confident and committed to diabetes and just \u2013 I know where you are at with the warning letter. But maybe if you could talk about whether you are incrementally more confident here than you were a few months ago and maybe talk about what the reentry to that market looks like, assuming that you can get that \u2013 the letter lifted and the product back to the market? And then just briefly on TAVR, as you know, one of your major competitors in that market has talked a lot about staffing and trends in the U.S. Just anything that you would add in terms of sequential improvements or changes in that market, or whether you are continuing to see some of the staffing challenges that they referred to, but don\u2019t seem to be holding back your growth quite so significantly in the U.S.? Thanks. Geoff Martha : Sure. Thanks for the questions, Matt. Yes. I will start with the diabetes one. I am not incrementally more committed because I have been committed since day one. I mean there is no \u2013 have not blinked on diabetes, so committed to the business. Yes. Is there more confidence, yes. And that\u2019s because we are continuing to see the impact of our technology. When we have our full suite of technology outside the U.S., we are seeing strong growth. But it\u2019s not just the growth that\u2019s encouraging, it\u2019s the patient feedback, the clinical results that we are getting, time and range and other important metrics from a clinical standpoint. But it\u2019s also the patient experience in terms of ease of use and things like that. And then on top of that, we have got this pipeline of technology that we have \u2013 that\u2019s coming right behind it, new \u2013 pipeline of sensors. We have submitted our Simplera sensor for approval. And we have got more behind that. And a lot of development programs that I have a view into. And then finally, the business is just executing better, and so all that together is giving me more confidence. So, I will ask Que to make a comment. Que, do you want to add to that? Que Dallara : Yes. I mean as Geoff said, we continue to expand access for the 780G system and Guardian 4 sensor. It\u2019s in over 90 markets. And wherever we see 780G launch, we also see higher CGM attachment rates because physicians and patients recognize the value of automation \u2013 automated insulin delivery in driving outcomes. And we expect to see a similar trajectory when 780G is available in the U.S. market. And just to put a finer point on what Geoff said about our next-generation products, we submitted our next-generation sensor CGM for CE Mark last year, and we have also done that on a standalone basis to the FDA. And we continue to be very optimistic about the progress we are seeing in the market. The U.S. market needs new products. We all know that. But I think we are making forward movement on all aspects of the business. Geoff Martha : Thanks Que. And on the TAVR question, look, this is an area that we have been really focused on. Obviously, it\u2019s a market where the therapy has a huge impact on patient outcomes, and then financially for us, it\u2019s an important driver. And we have been really focused on this team and this new model, how they are really focused on this team, and they have done a great job on a number of fronts in terms of training physicians and adding new reps, training new reps and adding the field training physicians on the new techniques, but more recently here launching our Evolut effects and the results we are getting there. I have Sean, but I think the team has done a great job, and we are starting to make up some ground here with the competition globally, but in particular in the U.S. And Sean, maybe you can add some comments to this. Sean Salmon : Yes. Thanks, Geoff. And we are seeing sort of mid-single digit growth underlying for the U.S. market. And obviously, we are moving faster than that 12% growth because of the launch of FX. And I think also this recognition that our valve hemodynamics is really playing out for better durability of that valve over time, which is becoming more and more important. And FX really levels the playing field on ease of use, which has been important, but also you can line the commerce [ph] up, which is great for coronary access. And as people are thinking about the lifetime of the valve, both durability and making sure that those corners are easy to get back into matters a lot. And that combination has played out well for us. We do still see spotty procedure volume challenges. It\u2019s all around the world. Most acutely this last quarter in Japan, as we said, there was a wave of COVID that impacted us. And also we are dependent on a particular faster access that was impacted by supply chain issues last quarter. That\u2019s been resolved. So, the launch of FX in Japan, returning procedure volumes and no constraint from vascular sheets will help us to grow there. And of course, as Evolut FX rolls out around the world, we will still perform well. The fundamentals of that market are still very, very strong. It\u2019s just all the multiple touch points of the healthcare system that are required to get a patient in for therapy and through that therapy. But we expect that\u2019s going to start to abate and get better with time. Geoff Martha : Whether it would be our structural heart business, TAVR or diabetes, and Joanne asked about spine, and you mentioned in the comment you mean by urgent. What I like about the new \u2013 the operating model we have is these businesses, we have got \u2013 we have segmented them in the right way where we have clarity, transparency into their end markets. We are measuring them on, are you growing above, we have clarity on market growth. We are measuring them on, are you growing above or below the market and comp is tied to that. So, it creates this sense of urgency that we think is having an impact. It was kind of overwhelmed for a while by supply chain challenges. But as those mitigate, you are starting to see the impact of some of the changes we made. Matt Miksic : Thanks again. Geoff Martha : Thanks Matt. Next question please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Jennings at Cowen and Company. Josh, please go ahead. Josh Jennings : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just ask about the JV. We don\u2019t have JV in the patient monitoring and respiratory spin. Just how we should be thinking about the impact to, I guess standalone Medtronic earnings in \u201824, either from execution of those two moves or just any headwinds in terms of the earnings power in \u201824 to just the initial staging of getting to the finish line on both of those two\u2026? Karen Parkhill : Yes. In terms of the impact on total Medtronic earnings power, the separations are going to have minimal impact. So \u2013 and in terms of staging the moves so that we have minimal impact or disruption across the company, we have been very focused on that and have strong teams in place that are managing these separations really well. And we purposely put those teams in place as part of our new operating model. As we make these portfolio moves, we are focused on being best-in-class in how we do it. Josh Jennings : Thanks a lot. Just a follow-up on the patient monitoring and respiratory spin. Is it possible that an unsolicited \u2013 a suitor could come into play? And how should investors think about the kind of potential for a parallel path to open up where you are moving forward a spin, but there could be potential suiters coming into the \u2013 kicking the tires on those two businesses? Thanks for taking the question. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks Josh. We are focused on maximizing shareholder value with the separation. And we have announced the spin. We are moving forward with that. Should something come along that maximizes shareholder value, we will certainly listen to it. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Josh. Next question please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Cecilia Furlong at Morgan Stanley. Cecilia, please go ahead. Cecilia Furlong : Great. Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Just a two-part question for me. First on Hugo and the neuro IDE in the U.S. If you could provide an update on just what dud have seen early days in enrollment? And then separately, we have heard a lot about Italy impact. Just curious if you could frame how you are thinking about the potential impact to your business going forward and thank you? Geoff Martha : Thanks Cecilia. Good to hear from you. On the first one, I will let Bob White answer the question on the Hugo neurourology IDE enrollment and just overall progress, what we are seeing in the U.S. And then turn it over to Karen for the question on Italy, so Bob? Bob White : Great. Thanks Geoff and Cecilia, thanks for the question. As you have noted, the trial enrollment is underway for expand neuro. First patients have been enrolled and proceeding nicely on that. So, we are pleased with our progress on that IDE specifically. And then just more broadly, to Geoff\u2019s point, last quarter, we saw accelerated installations of Hugo entered new markets across EMEA, APAC and LATAM. And again, if you think about where we are at around the world, with the geographic expansion and our CE mark allowing us to expand in the new markets. And then in CE markets, we have also added our general surgery indication on top of urology and gynecology. So, now we covered about 80% of robotic procedures in those markets. And what we have been pleased, and you asked a little bit about feedback, we are getting really good feedback. The systems been used now to successfully perform a range of urology, gynecological, general surgery procedures from kind of simple to complex. And we are seeing that Hugo is the flexible and versatile tool we designed it to be. So, it\u2019s early innings in terms of \u2013 again, this market has got tremendous growth opportunity. Only 5% of procedures are done globally that could be done robotically assisted. We remain very excited about the market, and we are pleased with where we are today. Karen Parkhill : And Cecilia, on the Italy question, there is a law in Italy that requires companies that are \u2013 that sell medical devices to make payments to the Italian government if those device expenditures exceed maximum ceilings. The law was put in place in 2015 and applies to expenditures from that year onward. You have heard from some of our other competitors on this. The law is obviously applicable to the whole industry. And we filed an appeal along with many other companies in our industry on this. In the third quarter, for the first time, actual claims were issued to Medtronic and our peers for the years \u201815 to \u201818. And so, we did revised our existing accrual. We already had an accrual and we did add to it in the third quarter. That accrual is a reduction of revenue. For us, it wasn\u2019t too significant, but we do have a reserve on our books. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Cecilia. Let\u2019s take the next question please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Shagun Singh at RBC. Shagun, please go ahead. Shagun Singh : Great. Thank you for taking the question. Karen, one for you. Could you just elaborate on the components of the impact \u2013 of the components of the EPS impact on growth next year? You called out inflation, FX, interest and taxes. Perhaps you can talk about how large the impact is this year and what the flow-through could be next year? And then I have a follow-up. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks Shagun. So obviously, we have said we have got tons of moving pieces on next fiscal year. So, we are not ready to give real guidance. And so, to quantify, the impact from EPS growth is difficult. But what I would say on currency, we talked about the fact that, that is a headwind. I mentioned that in the commentary. And just at recent rates, currency is about a 5% headwind to next fiscal year, so we did quantify that. We also said that inflation impacts are about a mid-single digit impact for us next fiscal year. So, those are two that we have quantified. In terms of interest and tax, those are more minor headwinds than inflation and currency, but still headwinds that we need to face. And then obviously, we have got investment that we intend to make to drive the long-term growth of this company. And where we see important investments, we are going to make them. And we have said that we think that we are going to drive R&D growth, at least in line with revenue and when we have important investments to make in some areas that may grow even more than revenue. So, hopefully that helps. Shagun Singh : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the PULSED AF data readout at ACC. How meaningful do you think it could be? And just maybe broadly talk about the PFA opportunity and how your platform is differentiated? Thank you so much. Geoff Martha : Sure. Thanks for the question. We are definitely excited about the data that\u2019s coming out at ACC and the PFA opportunity. I think Sean is best positioned to answer your question, Sean? Sean Salmon : Yes. Thanks Shagun. So, we have a trial coming out on the six, which will be the very first IDE trial done on the rigors of an FDA trial for a study in this field. So, it\u2019s really the first dataset. And it is two patient populations in the single trial, both paroxysmal patients as well as persistent patients. And the endpoints are primary safety endpoint, primary efficacy endpoint. And the rigorous trial design here under the hospices offices of an IDE trial mean that you have very frequent monitoring the patients, and you get a true kind of look at the way this anatomical solution performs. I would say anatomical solution because we have really two things in this bag of AF treatments. One is one where you isolate the pulmonary veins and then the Affera system allows you to astute point-by-point ablation with a highly differentiated catheter. That system is an automatic mapping system that allows you to kind of map, ablate and then valuate what you have done, and we will put all of our catheters on to that ecosystem over time, including this anatomical catheter, the [indiscernible] as well as cryocatheters. So, we will have a full array of all energies cryo, radio frequency as well as postural ablation to treat a myriad of arrhythmias that occur across the entire space. So, it really does put us on \u2013 with the newest technology early in the phase of that highly differentiated on both the mapping system as well as the therapeutic catheter side. And there is a lot of excitement among physicians for what we are bringing to the field. Geoff Martha : Thanks Shagun. Brad, we have got time for two more questions, please. Operator : The next question comes from Travis Steed at BofA. Travis, please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Karen, I do want to ask on the Q4 margin step-up. Q3 was a little bit light on margins from FX and currency. Just curious if there is anything other than improving revenue to drive the Q4 margin step-up? And then I know you are not going to get much on FY \u201824, but curious if you could kind of frame the opportunity on the cost side. I don\u2019t know if there is enough to offset the mid-single digit inflation or partly offset that or more than offset. Just a little bit of color on the cost savings side would be helpful. Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Travis. So, on Q4 margins, that will be \u2013 revenue growth obviously helps. So, we will start there. But we also will be driving cost reduction starting last quarter and even more into the fourth quarter, that will help as well. And then Q4 typically is our highest margin quarter. So, we are focused on that step-up and it\u2019s typical for us. On the cost opportunity for FY \u201824, again, we are not going to size it right now. But we have said that we are focused on driving a significant cost reduction to help partially offset the impacts that we have got from the various headwinds and the investment that we need to make. Travis Steed : Great. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks Travis. And we will take our final question please, Brad. Operator : The final question comes from Rick Wise at Stifel Nicolaus. Rick, please go ahead. Rick Wise : Hi. Good morning. Thanks Ryan. Maybe, I will just \u2013 interest of time here, just focus on \u2013 back on one topic, Hugo. Geoff, it seems like you are seeing a good ramp in Europe. But maybe you could quickly update us on supply chain? Is that resolved, resolving, almost resolved? What\u2019s your thought about that process and your ability to meet the demand? Last quarter, you talked about backlog. Maybe you could give us some more color there. And specifically, just a little more detailed color about once Hugo is in place, the kind of adoption and maybe pull-through of instrumentation you are seeing just to \u2013 so we have a real \u2013 a better sense of exactly where you are with Hugo. Thank you so much. Geoff Martha : Yes. Great to hear from you, Rick. Thanks for the question. I will turn it over to Bob for some of the details there. But I would say just on Hugo, what \u2013 the evolution of the \u2013 is the feedback that we are getting, right. I mean we felt confident in the design. And as we get closer to launch, I was spending more time with physicians that were involved with the design that they don\u2019t work for Medtronic, but they were involved, and they were very bullish on it and happy with the way the product turned out. But now we are getting feedback from physicians that are converting from the competition or have both and they are high-volume users and they have a high bar for robotic surgery and that feedback has been really, really strong. And that is, I think is very encouraging. And that word is spreading, as I talk to U.S. physicians that don\u2019t have access to it yet because they are not part of the trial and they have a pretty detailed understanding of the robot and its features and its capabilities. And so, we are getting \u2013 and so that\u2019s just driving really strong adoption. Yes. I will let Bob talk about any kind of constraints or supply chain and any other details on adoption now. Bob White : Yes. Thanks Geoff and Rick, thanks for the question. A couple of other points I think Rick, that would be helpful for you is we are now starting to fulfill repeat orders by customers, which is nice. So, customers have not just bought one, they are coming back to buy additional ones. And the other thing is we are seeing a mix really of both early robotic adapters and experienced accounts, which is nice because we built Hugo with the differentiator that what physicians\u2019 needs in mind. So, we are excited what we see there. And with respect to the supply chain, as it relates to Hugo, a good \u2013 that is behind us. So, we had \u2013 I talked in previous quarters about hardening our supply chain and working through those manufacturing processes. That\u2019s all in the rearview mirror for us. And then as Geoff and Karen mentioned more broadly, for our surgical business, we have seen our supply chains improve dramatically through the year, and you see that in the sequential quarter-on-quarter growth in that business. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Rick Wise : Thank you. Geoff Martha : And I think the \u2013 Rick, I think on the pull-through \u2013 for that pull-through to have an impact, it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. And it\u2019s a big surgical innovations business we have, $6 billion or so. But I will point to the spine business, and Joanne asked the question earlier, two quarters in a row of double-digit implant growth in the U.S., which is 80% of the market. That is largely driven by pull-through of an ecosystem of technology that\u2019s hard to match, that takes a lot of expertise, a lot of balance sheet and a lot of time. And we spent a lot of time on this robot, and we have invested a lot into it, and it\u2019s not just the robot. It is visualization, it is the digital platform. And we are confident that, that ecosystem will be a differentiator for Medtronic and pull through instrumentation and be a durable growth driver for the company. And that\u2019s why we stuck with it for the last too many years to admit to, to get it to this point. And we feel like we have something to build from. Rick Wise : Appreciate it. Thanks Geoff. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Rick. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Geoff Martha : Alright. Well, thanks for the questions, some great questions this morning. I really appreciate your support and continued interest in the company, and we hope you will join us for our Q4 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Thursday, May 25th, where we will update you on our progress and how we finished our fiscal year. And of course, I look ahead at fiscal \u201824. So with that, thanks again for spending time with us today. Please stay healthy and safe, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning, I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. Welcome to Minnesota, land of 10,000 lakes. I appreciate that you're joining us today for Medtronic's Fiscal Year 2023 Fourth Quarter Earnings Video Webcast. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer; Jeff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023, which ended on April 28, 2023 and our outlook for fiscal year '24. After our prepared remarks, the executive VPs from each of our four segments will join us, and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes four things : one, the impact of foreign currency; two, revenues from our Q1 acquisition of intersect ENT; three, fourth quarter revenue in the current and prior year from our divestiture of our Renal Care Solutions business; and four, a one-time contribution from an intellectual property agreement, references to sequential revenue changes compared to the third quarter of fiscal '23, and are made on an as-reported basis. And all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the first calendar quarter of 2023 compared to the first calendar quarter of 2022, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter. Geoffrey Martha : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong finish to our fiscal year with our fourth quarter top and bottom line results coming in ahead of expectations. Our accelerating organic revenue growth was broad-based with mid-single digit organic growth in cardiovascular, neuroscience and Medical Surgical and double-digit growth in our Diabetes business in Western Europe, where we're selling our latest generation of products. Now across the company, our growth was driven by procedure volume recovery, supply improvements and innovative product introductions. And despite continued margin pressures from macroeconomic factors like inflation and foreign exchange, we delivered adjusted earnings growth this quarter. And we reduced costs while also continuing to invest heavily in R&D to drive future growth. We're confident in delivering durable revenue growth in the year ahead as our recent revenue headwinds dissipate and we drive execution across our businesses. So let's turn to the details of our Q4 results. Our growth in the quarter started with a strong foundation from our largest businesses, Cardiac Rhythm, Surgical and Spine plus ENT. These businesses have durable established leadership positions. And combined, they made up half of our revenue and grew 5% organic. CRM grew 5% and one share in the quarter as we continue to see robust double-digit growth in our micro-leadless pacemakers franchise. Earlier this month, we received FDA approval for our next-generation leadless pacemakers, Micra AV 2 and VR 2, which extend the battery life by 40% to a projected 16 and 17 years, respectively. And in high power, we released data on our enhanced EVICD algorithm last weekend at HRS, and we're preparing to launch our Aurora Extravascular ICD later this year. In Surgical Innovations, we grew 4% or 8% when you exclude China given the provincial stapling VBP impacts in the quarter. Surgical procedures continue to recover and we regained share on supply improvements. Our advanced energy products, in particular, benefited from improving supply, growing high-teens, and we also launched our LigaSure XP and continued our rollout of the cordless Sonicision 7. Now Cranial and Spinal Technologies continue to deliver solid growth as well, growing 5%, including 6% growth in U.S. Core Spine. Look, we're seeing success from our market leading ecosystem of able, enabling technology and the associated pull-through of our best-in-class spinal implants. From our AI enabled surgical planning platform to our patient specific spine implants to our imaging, navigation and robotic technologies. Spine surgeons around the world are increasingly attracted to our differentiated and innovative solutions. So it was a solid quarter for our largest businesses. We also had a strong Q4 in our businesses that compete in high secular growth med tech markets. All combined, these businesses made up about 20% of our revenue and grew high-single digits organically, and we're feeding these businesses with the investments that they need. And as they grow, we expect them to become a larger part of our revenue mix and drive our durable growth going forward. So starting with Neurovascular, which is now annualizing at over $1.3 billion, we grew 13%. We saw broad strength across the business in both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke with double-digit growth in several categories, including aspiration and flow diversion. Stroke is the number two cause of death globally and combined with low therapy penetration, we see a large opportunity for neurovascular to make a difference in the treatment of stroke, driving meaningful growth with strong margins for years to come. In Structural Heart, we grew 9% organic. We're seeing improvements in the TAVR space, especially in the latter part of our quarter post-spring holidays. We won TAVR share in the U.S. on the strength of Evolut FX, which combines industry leading durability with enhanced and predictable valve deployment. In Japan, our Structural Heart business grew low double-digits driven by the mid-quarter launch of Evolut FX. Next, in cardiac ablation solutions, we grew 5% and made significant advances in our pipeline during the quarter. In March, the impressive results of our landmark PULSE AF pivotal trial, studying our single-shot PulseSelect PFA catheter were presented as a late breaker at ACC and published in the journal circulation. The trial had strong efficacy and safety results in both persistent and paroxysmal patients. We filed our PMA with the FDA, and we expect to be one of the first companies with a PFA catheter in the U.S. market. We also received CE Mark in March for our Affera mapping and ablation system, including our Sphere-9 catheter, and we began our limited market release. Sphere-9 can perform both PFA and RF ablation as well as high density mapping, all from the same catheter. So with our Sphere-9 focal catheter and our Pulse Select single shot catheter, we have the full breadth of PFA catheter technology, from PFA to our Affera MAP NAV system to our leading Arctic Front Cryosolution and AcQCross Transseptal Access system we're assembling a leading ecosystem of technologies and we're poised to become a much more meaningful player in the fast growing $8 billion EP ablation space. In Surgical Robotics, we continue to have positive momentum with the rollout of our differentiated Hugo robotics system in international markets. And we're making progress bringing Hugo to the U.S. as we execute our Expand URO pivotal trial. We also saw a meaningful acceleration in sales of our Touch Surgery Enterprise solution, which is the first AI powered surgical video, analytics platform for the operating room. With Hugo and touch surgery, we're bringing innovative solutions to surgeons around the world. And given the low penetration of robotic surgery and our strong position as a global leader in the surgical space, we expect to deliver meaningful growth over the coming years. And in diabetes, it was a big quarter for us, as our warning letter was lifted and we received FDA approval of our MiniMed 780G system with the Guardian 4 sensor. These products drove double-digit growth in Western Europe and we're very excited to begin shipping them to U.S. consumers next week. We expect our U.S. Diabetes growth to ramp over time as our existing customers come up for renewal and as consumers switch to Medtronic. Health care professionals and people living with diabetes are really going to appreciate the innovation we're delivering, particularly the advanced meal detection technology. And just this morning, we announced our intent to acquire EOFlow, the manufacture of the EOPatch, a tubeless, wearable and fully disposable insulin delivery device. The EOPatch is already available in Europe, South Korea and the UAE. And this will accelerate our speed to market in the fast growing patch pump space with a product that has demonstrated manufacturability. In addition, upon close, we'll work quickly to integrate our clinically proven meal detection technology algorithm, which is in the MiniMed 780G system into the EOPatch and seek marketing authorization. Look, we have not blinked when it comes to diabetes, and we're shifting to offense as we continue to invest heavily in assembling our ecosystem of durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, sensors, algorithms and customer service with multiple programs under development. Having this ecosystem is really important because we believe the market will move from CGM first to automated insulin delivery, and we are well positioned for that trend. We look forward to updating all of you on these growth opportunities at our diabetes, analyst and investor briefing next month at ADA. Now turning to our synergistic businesses. There were several strong performances in the quarter. Our aortic business grew in the mid-20s as product availability and AAA share improved. Cardiac surgery had a great quarter, growing 8% with strength in perfusion and cannula sales. Cardiac Diagnostics had a high-single digit growth on the continued adoption of our differentiated AI-enabled LINQ II insertable cardiac monitor. And earlier this month, our LINQ II AI technology, which we call AccuRhythm AI was awarded the 2023 MedTech Breakthrough Award for the best new technology solution in monitoring. Our GI business grew 16% on procedure volume recovery and continued strong adoption of GI Genius, another one of our AI-enabled products. GI Genius uses AI during colonoscopies to help physicians detect polyps. We also announced a strategic collaboration in the quarter with NVIDIA and Cosmo Pharmaceuticals to allow third-party developers to train and validate AI models that can eventually run as apps on the GI Genius platform. We're excited about the potentially game-changing solutions this could offer for GI physicians and their patients. Now before I go to Karen, I want to note that we continue to focus on the transformation of Medtronic. As we reduce complexity, enhance our capabilities, drive efficiency and improve portfolio management and capital allocation, all with the goal of positioning the company for delivering durable growth. And the progress we're making is beginning to show up in our financial results. I shared with you last quarter that we were planning for significant cost reductions. We began to execute those plans last month, which included reductions in our global workforce. Well, these are never easy decisions, and I am mindful of the personal impact across our teams. These actions were necessary and are allowing us to increase our investments in innovation. They also help us to mitigate the inflationary and foreign exchange impacts on our profitability. Look, we're making progress enhancing our global operations, supply chain and quality systems, which is all yielding results and we continue to advance our active portfolio management processes. We closed on the divestiture of our Renal Care Solutions business during the quarter and we continue to work on the separation path for our patient monitoring, and respiratory interventions businesses. Now there's still work to be done, but we're making progress setting up the company to deliver durable growth and strong returns. With that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and give guidance for fiscal '24. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Geoff. Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased 5.6%, ahead of expectations, and our non-GAAP EPS of $1.57 grew 3% was at the upper end of our guidance range and exceeded consensus. Looking at our revenue by geography, our international markets remain strong, non-U.S. developed markets in Western Europe grew 8%, and Japan returned to growth following the COVID impact last quarter, growing 5%. Emerging markets, which make up 17% of our revenue, returned to double-digit growth in the quarter, growing 11%. China also delivered growth of 3% as procedures recovered from prior lockdowns and the impact to our growth from volume-based procurement improved. We had strong growth in many other markets, including low 30s growth in Southeast Asia, low 20s growth in the Middle East and Africa, mid-teens growth in Eastern Europe, and low double-digit growth in Latin America. Turning to margins. Our adjusted gross margin was relatively stable sequentially, but declined year-over-year due to inflation and a 1 percentage point impact from currency. As I've noted in prior quarters, the impact to our gross margin from inflationary pressures is delayed by two to three quarters, because our incurred manufacturing variances, first go onto our balance sheet and then move into our P&L as inventory is sold. While the magnitude of these variances has begun to ease slightly, they do remain high. And as a result, we continue to expect pressure on our gross margins over the coming quarters. Despite that pressure, we drove a 350 basis point sequential improvement in our adjusted operating margin. And on a constant currency basis, our operating margin improved 50 basis points year-over-year, as we drove expense reduction, including reduced incentive compensation. Below the operating profit line, our adjusted nominal tax rate was 15.8%, that was above our expectations, from incremental taxes owed on the IP agreement that Ryan mentioned upfront, along with our jurisdictional mix of profits in the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong. We continue to direct capital toward investment in future growth opportunities, along with returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders. We're identifying high return organic R&D opportunities, and driving efficiencies across our business to free up capital to invest in them. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to supplement our organic investments with tuck-in acquisitions, to accelerate our long-term weighted average market growth rate. At the same time, you should expect us to be disciplined with a focus on maintaining our growing our returns on invested capital over the long term. We know our shareholders place strong value in our ability to return capital. In fiscal '23, we returned $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and just this morning, we announced that we are increasing our dividend for the 46 consecutive year, reflecting the Board's confidence in our balance sheet and our future earnings power. Now turning to guidance. We've delivered a couple of back-to-back quarters of mid-single digit growth, growing 5% in the back half of the fiscal year, with 5.6% in the fourth quarter. We're encouraged with the procedure recovery in many of our markets. Our product availability is improving. We like our competitive position across our businesses and we have many new innovative products coming to market. At this point, we're setting our fiscal '24 organic revenue guidance at 4% to 4.5% and given it's the start of the year, we think it's prudent for you to model at the lower end of that range. This guidance excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from our new other segment. And I direct you to the guidance slide in our earnings presentation for additional details. In the first quarter, we're guiding to the high end of our annual range with organic revenue growth of 4.5%, which suggests a sequential performance in line with what we have seen historically from our fourth quarter to our first quarter. By segment, there are puts and takes on each one, but they are all roughly aligned to the corporate average for both the first quarter and the year, with the exception of diabetes, which we expect will start the year growing below the corporate average, and ramp through the year with the U.S. launch of 780G. While the impact of currency is fluid, based on rates at the beginning of May, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $110 million to $210 million, including an unfavorable impact of $50 million to $100 million in the first quarter. Moving down the P&L, I've been sharing for several quarters now that macroeconomic factors like inflation, foreign currency and to a lesser extent, interest and tax rates would impact our earnings power in fiscal '24. And we're continuing to prioritize investments in R&D. In fact, when we exclude the separation of our Renal Care business, we expect R&D to grow above revenue as we've signaled for a while now. At the same time, and as Jeff mentioned, we've been executing our cost reduction plans across the company, to lessen the impact of these macro factors on our earnings. Taking all this into account, we expect continued pressure on our margins and our guiding fiscal '24 non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.10. The range includes an unfavorable impact of roughly 6% from foreign currency based on rates at the beginning of May and driven by the large benefit last year from our hedging program that we don't expect will repeat this year. On a constant currency basis, our EPS guidance implies low-single digit growth this year. For the first quarter, we expect EPS of $1.10 to $1.12. Excluding the approximate 8% impact from foreign currency, based on rates at the beginning of May, this would imply constant currency growth of 5% to 7%. To close, I want to recognize our outstanding employees around the world, who have been helping to drive significant change to transform our company, and they have done this while keeping the Medtronic mission front and center. Thank you for everything you do to make our company stronger and to always put patients first. Back to you, Jeff. Geoffrey Martha : Okay. Thank you, Karen. Now before we go to analyst questions, I'll close with a few thoughts. It was a good quarter with our broad-based growth, our Surgical Innovations business is back to mid-single digit growth tied to the improvement in our supply. And importantly, surgeon commitment to our differentiated products remained strong. We continue to see growth in Neurovascular and Structural Heart, and we're nearing an inflection point in both Diabetes and Cardiac Ablation Solutions, and both businesses have an arsenal of technologies in their pipeline. At the same time, we're seeing durable growth across our other businesses and importantly, no business is losing momentum. Behind the scenes, as I've shared with you since becoming CEO, we've really been pushing a comprehensive transformation to set up Medtronic to deliver durable growth and create value for our shareholders. Now it hasn't been a straight line. Some of that's market factors and some of that's been on us. But we've made progress, and you're starting to see this in our results. We've been making the necessary improvements to ensure long-term durability of our growth. We're investing in our key capabilities like global operations, IT, quality, and supply chain to turn our scale into an advantage. We're picking the markets where we're doubling down and redirecting investments to our most important R&D programs. And we're shaping the portfolio, adding tuck-ins and divesting non-core assets. All of these actions are establishing the strong foundation that will allow us to drive sustainable and consistent growth. Now there's still work to be done, but we are on the right path and we're confident in the choices that we've made and continue to make. We're executing. And you're starting to see this all come together with our study improvement. Finally, I'd like to join Karen expressing my sincere gratitude for our employees around the world. You've played a huge role in creating some of the world's most meaningful health care innovations and improving the lives of millions of people every year. Thank you. Thank you for all that you do to serve our Medtronic mission every day. And I'm confident that our best days are ahead of us. Now let's move to Q&A, where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible, so we ask you to limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question? Robert Marcus : Great. Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking the questions. And maybe first question, Jeff and Karen. You can give us a little more color on the guidance here. You're starting off at 4% to 4.5% organic, but want us at the low end of the range. It's a little bit below your long range goal of 5% organic sales growth and then a declining EPS for the year. So maybe just walk us through how you ended up at that range? Why are we starting at the bottom and how do you plan to return to EPS growth? Karen Parkhill : Thanks so much for the question, Robbie. When we were thinking through our guidance for the fiscal year, we thought it was prudent to start the year with guidance that sets us up for success. Geoff talked about it. We have a lot going on at Medtronic and we're intensely focused on delivering on our commitments that we -- and while doing so while we continue to transform the company. We got -- we have puts and takes, as we always do on the year, but there are no new issues from a growth perspective in FY '24. When we look at our geographies, China remains a drag from lingering VBP, but that's improving over last year. And we're really encouraged by our second half '23 performance of 5% and as we look early in May, we see good momentum. Our supply chain continues to improve. Our markets continue to recover. We've got a pipeline that we're really excited about and it's weighted towards the latter half of the fiscal year, then we've got 780G in the U.S. We've got the full suite of cardiac ablation with Affera. We've got our robot continuing to ramp. And we've got Guardian that's hopefully coming to market, too. So we don't have any new material risk to call out. We feel really good about the coming year. On EPS, we've highlighted for the past few quarters that we've got significant headwinds to EPS growth. That includes mid-single digit inflation that's impacting our gross margins. I talked about currency of approximately 6% as a headwind and interest and tax is around 1%. So when you combine all of these factors, they are a double-digit headwind to EPS growth. But our guidance is just a mid-single digit decline. So we've driven significant savings that allow us to protect and fund important R&D and help offset those savings just like we've talked about. As we think about our long range plan, we've got work to do to improve the bottom line. And that's going to be impacted by gross margin, which is obviously impacted by inflation and currency. But over time, we expect our gross margin to stabilize and then improve. And that's going to be one of the key things that will help drive our bottom line into the future. But longer term, our goals have not changed. We're just going to take it one year at a time. Robert Marcus : Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Karen, you have a pretty big divergence between first half comps and second half comps, how do you want us to think about the growth rates? And more importantly, the exit rate for next year at the low end of the guidance to start. Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. So Robbie, the comps are easier in the first half, but our pipelines weighted towards the back half. And so when we take all that together, you can think about Q2 through Q4 growth rates all being on about the lower end of our full year guidance. That's how we're thinking about it right now. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Robbie, we will take the next question Brad. Brad Welnick : We'll take the next question from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Congrats on the nice execution there, and thanks for taking my question. Karen, maybe first one for you or perhaps, Jeff. Can you talk about the cadence of procedures here, how the Q-shaped down? I think some of your peers noted a strong start to the year and perhaps, the slowdown exiting the Q. I'm just curious on, what kind of trends to our 4Q? Geoffrey Martha : Sure, Vijay. Thanks for the question. Good to talk to you. Well, yes, procedure volume was a tailwind for us relative to prior quarters. I mean, Europe, in particular, recovered well and was out in front. U.S. lagged a little bit, but it began to accelerate in April and May. So like I said, Western Europe, high-single digit growth and staffing issues improving, and beyond that better product availability resulted in a strong back half of the Q4 for us in Western Europe. But clearly, staffing issues getting better. Emerging markets grew 11%, mid-teens if you exclude China and then Japan was mid-single digits. So we're seeing around the world a strong pickup. Like I said, U.S. lagged, but we saw a strong April and into May, a pickup there. So that's how I'd characterize the procedures. If you kind of look at it -- beyond geography, if you look at it maybe by therapy or product area for us, surgical and GI procedures and MedSurg as well as TAVR procedures and some more electric procedures like Pain Stim picked up, I think, due to improved staffing. CRM was notable with good initial implant growth and for Medtronic specifically coming out of a replacement headwind. Maybe one outlier might be coronary still behind in procedure volume recovery, but that's how I look at it by geography and by therapy area. Overall, we're pleased with all this, like I said, overall, pleased with the acceleration and all this is kind of confirmed with what we are seeing in April and even into May. Vijay Kumar : Understood. No, that's helpful comment. And maybe one related on the fiscal '24 guidance. I think on EPS, Karen has been pretty clear on some of the headwinds in Medtronic space. But my question is more on top line, you have utilization improving to your point, surgical innovation. I think supply chain is getting better, comps are easy, diabetes, I think the approvals in upside surprise versus our prior assumptions, pulse they\u2019ve, I think that's going to be incremental. So when you look at these, the tailwinds rate, why is 4% to 4.5%, perhaps the right range, Geoff. Are there any headwinds? I think China is 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Anything else that we're not bear-off or is just more perhaps being conservative and proven perhaps. Geoffrey Martha : Yeah. I'm going to let Karen answer that one. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. So I think, Vijay, just as we talked about it, we just think that 4% to 4.5% for the full year is a good starting point. We have no new risk to call out, you named a lot of the great things that are happening in tailwinds. But for us, it's only Q1 and we just think it's a good place to start. Vijay Kumar : That was good. Thanks, guys. Geoffrey Martha : Thanks for the questions, Vijay. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Vijay. Thanks. Brad, we are taking next question, please. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Larry, please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong finish to the fiscal year here. Yeah. I'd like to ask about the EOFlow acquisition, specifically the time lines for Q, the time lines for an AID system in the U.S. and Europe and I thought we saw that a competitor wanted injunction in Germany recently. So what made you comfortable with the IP, and I'd love to hear at a high level, any thoughts on how this product is differentiated? And just, maybe for Karen, maybe any update on the patient monitoring spend. I think people are interested to know how you're going to use the proceeds to offset dilution, we've seen media reports to be potentially selling the business and depending on the tax basis and the use of proceeds, that could be dilutive as well. So how should we be thinking about this? Thank you. Geoffrey Martha : Thanks, Larry, for the questions. I think, I'll turn it over to Que to answer the EOFlow questions. Que Dallara : Good morning. We're very excited about the EOFlow acquisition. As you know, we're very familiar with the technologies in the tech space, as well as the manufacturing challenges there. From a strategic perspective, we are the only integrated player in a diabetes technological space with both CGM, our algorithms as well as dosing systems and very well positioned for AIG. So our portfolio is very holistic. We want to meet patients where they are, and this acquisition accelerates the introduction of an AID patch into the market, and we expect to be the next to market with a differentiated product. So our intention is to combine EFOs device with the meal detection algorithm that you see today in the 780G system along with our next-generation sensor and expect that to be a very differentiated offering that's next to market. In terms of the -- so I think that addresses the product differentiation in time. In terms of the IP, as you know, I think it's been disclosed previously that we have a covenant not to sue with Insulet. And so we're very confident about our IP position. And this is a very differentiated device with Medtronic algorithms and sensor technology. So we're very confident in the product differentiation in the market. Geoffrey Martha : Yes. I'll just build on Que's comments in terms of beyond just the product, just the trend here of going from CGM first to AID, automated instant delivery. And with our differentiated algorithms there with the meal detection technology, we believe this is big. We're seeing it in outside the U.S. with 780G, and we want to have that same technology across a host of insulin delivery devices, whether it be a pen, smart pen, pump system, and a patch. So this adds to that armamentarium and we're excited about it. And Que's brought a lot of just better execution of the business as well. So that also helps our confidence in doing a deal like this. So looking forward to the future for our diabetes business. I'll have Karen answer the question around the patient monitoring and respiratory interventions separation. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. Thanks for that question, Vijay. We continue to work on the separation of patient monitoring and respiratory interventions. And when we announced the separation last year, we said that a spin sets a high bar because it minimizes the tax leakage and it allows our shareholders to participate in what we believe is going to be a significant value creation opportunity. We also said we would consider alternatives and a sale as possible because we do believe that this NewCo could be an attractive asset to many parties. But we also said that the spin bar is really high because it's got attractive attributes for it. And any divergence from this spin path would really need to provide a greater value creation opportunity. But whatever course we take will be in the best interest of our shareholders, how we manage dilution on this will ultimately be determined by the potential transaction, and we'll provide details as we have them at a later date. Geoffrey Martha : Thank you. Thanks, Larry. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Larry. Appreciate the questions. Just a reminder to the analysts to please stick to one question and one follow-up if needed. Brad, we will go to the next question please. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead. Matthew Miksic : Hi. Can you hear me, okay? Geoffrey Martha : Yes, we can, Matt. Matt Miksic : Great. Thank you. So \u2013 thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on a nice finish to the year and kind of navigating through the resetting of the bar here for fiscal '24. Just wanted to -- given that we came out of HRS last weekend, and there was a fair amount of news flow and presentations for Medtronic. Obviously, the big -- the main topic of the meeting was PFA, as I think everyone knows. I know you expect to be one of the first to the U.S. market. If you could talk maybe a little bit more about how you expect to -- the time line for that is big as you can? And then how you expect to sort of navigate this perceived pressure on the single shop market? And I have just one follow-up, if I might. Geoffrey Martha : Sure. Yeah. Well, thanks for that, Matt. It's exciting for the industry, and we believe we're well positioned in those tailwinds you just mentioned. So it is good to see, and I'm going to ask Sean to answer the specific questions around PFA and how we're positioned there. Sean Salmon : Yeah, Matt. We really like our position. As you know, we've maintained a CE Mark for our point-by-point solution in Europe, and we just filed the PMA for our single-shot product in the United States and we'll have a data readout sometime next year. We completed enrollment for ferrous persistent (ph) trial in December. So we expect that, that one-year endpoint will be reached mid of this fiscal year. In terms of how we see the shift, obviously, we've got 85% of the market to play in, in point by point. And we have the other segment that we've been really strong in with Cryo at 15%. And I think as we initially launched into Europe, that's a much bigger opportunity for us as we go to point-by-point solutions. And when we come to the United States being among the first in PFA solutions and all of those are going to be anatomical or single shot. I think we'll garner interest from that 85% of the market that really wants to get to PFA, and they don't need to do that. So I think while you have the potential for some erosion of your base in anatomical, you also have the attraction of having the very first PFA offering coming in for anatomical solutions that will pull interest from 85% pool. And of course, when we launch  globally, we'll have the opportunity to play in a bigger swing pool. So I think the concerns about cannibalization, I think are overblowing frankly. There's far more greenfield for us than I think people are appreciating. Matt Miksic : That's super helpful. And then just one quick follow-up to Larry's question on diabetes. The congrats again on the warning letter and the plump approval (ph) and Guardian Sensor approval, but Sinclair (ph) is intriguing. I think a lot of folks are wondering what are your thoughts on timing and you would see potentially some data from that platform given that, that could move you kind of more to the forefront of sort of sensor technology. Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Yes. Thanks, Matt, definitely . Geoffrey Martha : Go ahead, as I say, simpler is definitely a jump forward, and I'll have Que jump in and answer that. Que Dallara : Thanks, Geoff. We're very excited about Sinclair. It's an all-in-one disposable sense. It's half the size of the Guardian for sensor, no  process, compared to our current sensor technology. As you know, we've submitted to CE Mark last year by summer and also to the FDA earlier this year. We hope that, actually, we've got to go through the regulatory process, but we're anticipating that this fiscal year, we should be able to get approval. So that's the best we have in terms of timing. Matt Miksic : Thank you. Geoffrey Martha : Thanks, Matt for the question. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Travis Steed at BofA Global Research. Travis, please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey. Can you hear me okay? Geoffrey Martha : Yeah. We can Travis. Good to hear from you. Travis Steed : Maybe, Karen, if you can talk about some of the cost savings stuff that you built into this 5% to 5.10% EPS growth, and we've estimated like $0.50 offset from the cost savings side and then some of the R&D investments. Just a little bit more color on some of the puts and takes and what you have built in on the EPS guide? And then on FY '25 EPS, should we think about that as more of a transition back to the 8% plus or just kind of early comments on how to think about the out-year EPS. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. Thanks for those questions, Travis. On our cost savings, we said that we are driving significant cost savings. We're not disclosing the exact amount. But just to give you a sense, I mentioned we have mid-single digit inflation on our gross margins. We have currency impact of approximately 6%, and we have interest and tax of around 1%. And all those combined are double-digit headwind to EPS. But our guidance is just a mid-single digit decline. So the savings are significant. And obviously, they allow us to protect and fund important R&D innovation. When we talk -- when we think about R&D, we've said all along that our goal is to protect and to grow, align with revenue or above revenue when we can. And if we look at this coming fiscal year and we strip away the investment that we had in R&D and RCS in our renal care business that we're separating, our revenue is growing, our R&D expense, we expect it to grow higher than revenue. So we did protect it. It is important to us. And then on FY '25, we're just starting FY '24. So we're not ready to really talk about FY '25. But I mentioned that these last 18 months have been really busy for us. We've been strengthening our core with new people and new structures. We've been understanding our investment needs. We've been driving portfolio moves. We've been cutting expenses. We've been managing through our own setbacks. And the transformation that we've been driving amidst all of this is starting to have an impact on our results. You've seen us already move back to mid-single-digit growth on the top line, and we're intensely focused on delivering on our FY '24 commitments and driving a lasting turnaround at Medtronic. That's our priority right now. Longer term, our goals have not changed. We're focused on that durable mid-single digit revenue growth. We have continued work to do to stabilize and then improve our gross margins. But we have both the plans and the work in place to do that. And ultimately, we're committed to driving a strong and leveraged P&L. But we're going to take this one year at a time because that's just where we are right now. So I hope that gives you some context. Geoffrey Martha :  Getting back to Karen's earlier the answer, earlier part of the answer on the cost actions. I think we're focused on striking the right balance, as you mentioned, between kind of offsetting or mitigating some of the headwinds out there that affected EPS with the durability of our revenue growth and think about reinvestment in some of the top areas in med tech, right, diabetes, robotics,  EP, PFA. So these are exciting opportunities. We've got to balance mitigating some of these headwinds with making sure that we're making the right investments and she walked through the R&D growth and to make sure that our revenue is durable. Travis Steed : That's super helpful. A quick follow-up on the EOFlow. I know they had a pipeline for a seven-day patch and they had a CGM in their pipeline, too. Is that something you're going to keep just a quick update on that. And then I did want to ask about TAVR mid-single digit growth in the quarter, just taking share. Maybe just an update on the overall TAVR market and the trends that you're seeing there would be helpful as well. Thank you. Geoffrey Martha : Que, you want to take the EOFlow question? Que Dallara : Yes. And look, our plans right now to integrate our new detection technology algorithm as well as our next-generation Simpler sensor to bring an AID patch into the market. We think it's important for patient choice. And we want to do that as soon as possible. And we can't really comment any further on additional pipeline details at this point. Geoffrey Martha : Thanks, Que. Sean, quick response on the TAVR question. Sean Salmon : Sure, Travis. So the market is getting better and better, I'd say. We saw a really nice recovery within Europe procedures coming back, particularly in France and Germany, really strong and recovery in the United States started out a little sluggish in the quarter, had a little bumpy ride from spring breaks. As you know, there's a lot of consolidated volumes, so a little bit of that matter. But we exited the quarter really strong, we track some they called implant rates just or in the note case we supported, and we're seeing really good recovery trends, which we think will continue through the year. But right now, low -- I'd say low double to high-single digits is about what the fundamentals are for the underlying market. Ryan Weispfenning : I appreciate the questions, Travis. Just a reminder to the analysts one question and one related follow-up if needed. Brad, next question please. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Matt O'Brien at Piper Sandler Companies. Matt, please go ahead. Ryan Weispfenning : Hey, Matt. Yeah. I think we've got a problem with your audio, Matt. We'll check that and come back to you. Can you please take the next question, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Peter Chickering at Deutsche Bank. Peter, please go ahead. Peter Chickering : Good morning, guys. Can you talk about PFA adoption trends in Europe, specifically, the interplay between PFA growth, PFA pricing versus losses from quite a market share, so when you put it all together, I guess, how was the European depletion growing for you guys? Geoffrey Martha : Sean, do you want to take that one? Sean Salmon : Yeah. We've done well. I mean it's early, early innings for our PFA offering. As you know, we're just really trying to scale up both training and operations for that. So a little too early to comment on that. I'd say there's been really continued underlying growth just ablation in general continues to grow of all flavors, but of course, PFA will grow the fastest. We'll keep you appraised as to how that's going. We're seeing really good strong trends, though within Europe and overall, is a very robust market. Peter Chickering : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up here on the last TAVR question. You're talking about a low double, high-single digit marketplace. What do you guys assume within your market share for 2024? Sean Salmon : I don't think we're giving share ends, but we think we're in good shape with the momentum we have with FX, and we look to launch the FX into Europe in the back half of the year. So that's a -- and we've done well in the United States. We done in Japan., products is excellent and being well received. Peter Chickering : Great. Thanks a lot. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Peter. Next question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Matt Taylor at Jefferies. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Taylor : Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay? Geoffrey Martha : Yeah, we can now. Matt Taylor : Okay. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about just reading that release. And it talks about 1% dilution to earnings for the first few years and neutral to accretive thereafter. So I guess I was hoping maybe you could touch on the run rate of the business today and how you assume that ramps revenue wise over the next couple of years. What are some of the assumptions that go into that dilution assumption for the first couple of years. And what are some of the key guideposts that we should be looking for out of that business as you acquire it. Geoffrey Martha : Well, the business, I could say, Matt is, it's new and the revenue is pretty small right now and it's just in Europe. But I'll let Karen talk about the dilution assumption. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. So the key here is to integrate this patch pump with our algorithm. And so we'll be spending on that and that's what drives the dilution. That's the key for the first few years. And Que, you want to talk about run rate from there? Geoffrey Martha : Yes. And any milestones that you might want to look for? Que Dallara : I think the critical milestone to watch out for is really some development work to integrate our algorithm. We have that ready as part of the 780G system. We're obviously going through our sensor approvals today, so that will be variable. So there's a bit of development work, not a lot, the outflow has proven manufacturability at scale. The manufacturing exists. And so it is a relatively straightforward integration and approval process to get that to market. Once that AID patch system is available in market with our next-generation CGM, we think, obviously, we go through the commercialization and launch process, but we believe it's a very strong offering and second to market with this wearable disposable patch solution. Matt Taylor : Great. Thanks for the feedback. I appreciate that. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Matt. Next question, please Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Rich Newitter at Truist. Rich, please go ahead. Rich Newitter : Can you hear me? Geoffrey Martha : Yes, we can. Can you hear us? Rich? Can you hear me? Yes, I don't know, maybe we might have some connection issues with Rich. We'll go to the next question and come back. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Shagun Singh of RBC Capital Markets. Shagun, please go ahead. Shagun Singh : Great. Can you hear me, okay? Geoffrey Martha : Yes. Shagun Singh : A quick one on China. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about your outlook for that business. There seems to be some initial talk of COVID cases, how concerned are you at this point? And if it does become something larger than anticipated, what areas of impact are you worried about? And then secondly, I just wanted to get your thoughts on M&A. It's encouraging to see you call out something on the M&A front this quarter. And I think you previously indicated that you would hold off for about 12 months to 18 months until the separation has been announced to be more active on that front. Has anything changed? And perhaps you can just talk about your appetite for M&A deal size and areas you may be interested in? Thank you for taking the questions. Geoffrey Martha : Well, thanks for those questions. I'll start with the China one and then get to the M&A. On China, yeah, we've heard about the -- some of the COVID -- I wouldn't call it an outbreak, but signs of COVID in China, we haven't felt any impact of that at this point in talking to some of our health care -- some of our customers, they're not at this point too worried about it, but we're going to watch that closely. In terms of our overall view on China, I was just there -- and look, the economy is back and the health care procedures are back. Obviously, we're still working through volume-based procurement. But it's going to be the largest healthcare market in the world. And it's an area that we're investing in. And as we talked about before, this volume based procurement, we believe, by the end, as we exit this next fiscal year, as we exit this FY '24, we believe we'll have been through that reset from volume based purchases and procurement rather, and then grow from there and get back to that double-digit growth and we've adjusted by taking out some costs in China, now that the business is more contracted, it's allowed us to take out some sales and marketing costs. And so it's still a profitable business for us that we'll get back to that double-digit growth. Obviously, we're going to have to watch the geopolitics here between the two countries, but it's encouraging some of the more recent conversations the two countries are having. And we spend a lot of time on this in China with the U.S. government and are optimistic that this will continue to be a good market for us. In terms of M&A, yeah, obviously, the EOFlow acquisition looks like one of our -- is one of our traditional tuck-in type of deals in a high-growth area that we have a strong position in. You asked about -- and that we still have a lot of appetite for those type of deals, I would say we are focusing on those deals that we believe are going to have a bigger impact on Medtronic, and deals like the Intersect ENT deal, deals like for ENT, deals like up the Affera deal in our API business for PFA that had mapping and navigation and some PFA technology. And this EOFlow fits right into that, that kind of mold, bringing a patch technology to our diabetes business. In terms of divestitures, I would say nothing has changed. I mean we just completed the dialysis joint venture with DaVita. So we're excited about that and closed out officially, and that's off and running called,  is the new company's name, and we're working through, as Karen walked you through the patient monitoring and respiratory interventions separation, which is a large body of work. And in terms of those type of large-scale divestitures, the analysis and the thought process continues to look at our portfolio and see where opportunities are. But we're pretty focused right now executing on that one from an execution standpoint. And as you look forward, our appetite, our focus is still these tuck-in deals along -- and think of the three examples I gave, and that kind of size could be a little bigger than that, a little smaller. Those are the focus areas. If something bigger comes along, we'd look at it, but it's not what we're hunting for, if you will. So I hope that answers your question on M&A. I don't know, Karen if you have anything to add or I covered it. Karen Parkhill : You covered it well. Shagun Singh : Thank you so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Well, Thanks for the questions, Shagun. Brad, why don't we try to go back to Rich, if we can, and then we'll take our final two questions. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Rich Newitter at Truist Securities. Rich, please go ahead. Rich Newitter : Hi. Thanks for calling back to me. I apologize for the issues there. So maybe I just wanted to start off with Spine. I know that you guys are -- you really have seen a nice turnaround there in the last year or so. Can you talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing there? Any potential disruption that may be emerging leading up to a potential competitor, M&A between Globus and NuVasive? And then what's going on tzzhe capital front with Mazor? I'd love to hear kind of any updates on that and the -- some of the capital in that business likes. Geoffrey Martha : Sure. Thanks for the question, Rich. I'm going to turn it over to Brett in a second and talk about the details of capital and some of the other Spine trends. But I'll just start with one is, we've seen this trend, and I don't know if I call it disruptive, it's been moving for a number of years now, this trend of the value proposition being in the industry, centering around enabling technology, navigation, imaging, robotics, powered instruments, AI-based surgical planning and bringing that all together, we brought that together in our ecosystem called Able. You are now seeing the impact of that in the marketplace. And you're seeing what it's doing to the marketplace around consolidation. I mean this is where the business is heading, the industry is heading, and it takes a lot of technology prowess and it takes a lot of balance sheet to do this, and it's having a big impact on consolidation that you're seeing. And as we move forward, we're really excited about our position. But Brett's been overseeing this business for a number of years now and has a -- and I'll let him talk about more detail on the value proposition and also get into the capital dynamic. Brett Wall : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. And Rich, thanks for the question. When we look at overall core spine, some really good trends there. We're seeing the procedures getting back to normal, which is extremely helpful. We've had now multiple quarters of expansion in core Spine, which reflects the development, as Jeff mentioned, of a broad-based ecosystem in the capital environment. And that ecosystem that we've put together is taking the procedure and changing the procedure with robotics, navigation, imaging, power surgical tools, AI surgical planning. It is the broadest, most expensive, most complete, most comprehensive system in the world of spine today. And what you'll see with competitors, I think you mentioned one transaction that is the two organizations are in the middle of, are trying to actually put these teams together and we're seeing that transformation in spine and more consolidation. If we look at capital in and of itself, we have an exceptionally strong capital footprint across the entire world. What we've seen with capital is continued good growth with capital, but we've also seen now in the United States, a bit of a, transition that transition is into earn-out or lease agreements. We've seen a higher preponderance of that, as we've been in the last few quarters, given some of the current situations across the current economic situations. The good news about that is we're getting those sockets. We're converting that into an earn-out type of situations where we get implants on top of the socket. And then we've also seen globally a very strong performance in our hardware. So this capital component is critical to the business. It's also critical to the growth. And I think we're just seeing that with some of the other consolidations. But the Medtronic footprint here is extensive strong and very capable Ryan Weispfenning : All right. Thanks, Rich. Thank you, Rich. Next question please. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch, Citi. Joanne, please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and nice way to end the year and start the next. Briefly, my memory is, as you had two patch pump products in development. Are those going to be shut down or are those also continuing along? And I'll ask my second question. Hugo, could you sort of give us an update on where the launch is outside the United States? And should we be thinking about this as number of robots in the field or amount of revenue that it generates for the total Medtronic family? Thank you. Geoffrey Martha : Okay. Thanks, Joanne. Two great questions. Que, do you want to take the patch question? Que Dallara : Yes. We have a complementary organic program. If anything, we're stepping on the gas, on that program that continues. It's complementary with next-generation features that we're not prepared to go to at this point for competitive reasons, but that program will help expand our market access, including type two market. Geoffrey Martha : Yeah. Just real quick before I turn it over to Bob to talk about Hugo. I just think, just to reemphasize what Que just said there, is that we've never -- although our business hasn't performed well over the years, the last couple of years, we've never lost faith on our technology. And now with the better execution of Que and her new leadership team we're bringing, we are putting our foot on the gas and doubling down this business and the patch segment is an important segment. So we feel good about having multiple shots on goal there. So that's what I'll say on diabetes. And Bob, why do you want to talk about Hugo? Bob White : Yes. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, Joanne, for the question. So we really liked our momentum, remembering, Joanna, as you know, that less than 5% of procedures that could be done robotically assisted or actually done that way. So a tremendous market development opportunity. And importantly, every quarter, we sell and install more Hugo systems than we did the prior quarter. And the modularity and the interoperability, the Hugo system with our leading surgical franchise is really being recognized by our customers. And it's really about the ecosystem. So to respond to your question, I would look at both, right? We look at the number of robots where we don't disclose that. And as Jeff pointed to, we look at this as a meaningful growth driver for Medtronic overall. So we like our position. We like our feedback, and we're excited about our opportunity ahead of us. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thanks, Bob. Thanks, Jon, for the questions. And Brad, we'll go to the final question. Brad Welnick : Our final question comes from Anthony Petrone at Mizuho Securities. Anthony, please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : Thank you. Can you hear me okay?. Geoffrey Martha : Yeah, Anthony. Happy belated birthday by the way. Anthony Petrone : Thank you very much. Thank you. A couple of questions here. One, just on the volume picture, underlying volumes. Is there anything you could share on April and May, in particular. You have about a 5.5% organic growth, 4% to 4.5% is the bridge guidance, so maybe just a little bit of color on underlying volumes. Certainly in 1Q, it did seem like we had favorable comps, but an underlying improvement in many markets. So just your comments on underlying volumes? And then, in the 4% to 4.5%, is anything of note just on 780G, how much of that is baked into the guidance? Thanks again. Geoffrey Martha : Well, I might ask Sean to comment on the underlying volumes in a second because we see it across Cardiology a lot. But I would just say, Anthony, that the underlying volume is definitely getting stronger and accelerated for us to our Q1 into April and May. And as I mentioned earlier, we've been seeing strong growth out of Western Europe for quite some time. And then Japan came in. And all throughout this, the last quarter, we saw strong growth in emerging markets. U.S. has lagged but has picked up. And I think some of it, we're seeing some of that pickup in particular, in surgical procedures in our surgical business, but also across a couple of different cardiovascular procedure lines. I don't know, Sean, if you have any comments on that? Sean Salmon : Yes, Jeff, you said it well. We saw a really nice recovery in Europe, in particular, as I mentioned before, across the board in our procedures. In the U.S., we saw record surgery as kind of a leading indicator that really grew well in the United States for procedure volume. And throughout the quarter, we saw improving -- improvement including coronary stents, which has been curiously below the pre-COVID levels for a long time now. So we saw that come up to about 95% of pre-COVID levels for the back half of the year or the back half of the quarter. So look, I'm encouraged, may looks strong. We're moving into a better procedure space for sure, globally. And it was also impressive to see how fast China step back after both the shutdown and the COVID stuff and it happened in the new year, it happens. So I think all the trends are looking up globally, and I think the U.S. is a place we're most encouraged by as we see the recovery of procedure volumes and in cardiology. We saw that with large joints, of course. And I think we're starting to see in cardiology too now, which is encouraging. Karen Parkhill : And Anthony, on your question on the annual guidance and anything of note on 780G, we expect diabetes to return to good growth in this fiscal year. And we noted that we expect it to begin the year below the corporate average, but obviously ramp throughout the year as we bring the 780G to more and more patients in the United States and the consumable revenue off of that comes with it. Anthony Petrone : Very helpful. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Geoffrey Martha : Okay. Thanks, Ryan. All right. Well, okay, everyone. Thanks for the questions. As usual, we really appreciate your support and continued interest in Medtronic. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll be coming to you from ADA on June 25 with an update on our diabetes business and we hope you'll join us for our Q1 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Tuesday, August 22, where we'll update you on our progress across the company. With that, thanks for spending time with us today and have a great rest of your day.",

I appreciate that you're joining us today for our Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Video Earnings Webcast. We're broadcasting to you today from our operational headquarters here in Minnesota where summer is in full force. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on July 28, 2023, and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the executive VPs from each of our four segments will join us, and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC. And we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and first quarter revenue in the current and prior year reported as other, which stems from prior business operations. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 and are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the second calendar quarter of 2023 compared to the second calendar quarter of 2022 unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter. Geoff Martha : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with the strong start of our fiscal year. We executed and delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Our solid results were broad-based with each of our four segments delivering 6% growth driven by execution, innovation, and much improved underlying fundamentals in our markets and supply chain. We also continue to make great strides on our comprehensive transformation which is designed to get at the root of what has held back our growth. We're executing large-scale functional improvements to global operations, supply chain and quality. And we're also decisively allocating capital, particularly to our programs and fast secular growth markets as well as focusing our R&D investments on technology megatrends like robotics and artificial intelligence that will drive growth in our industry over the next decade. And at the same time, we remain focused on our ongoing portfolio management efforts. And taken together, we expect this continued focus on executing our transformation will ensure durable top and bottom-line growth and create value for our shareholders. So let's turn now to the details of our Q1 results. We had another strong quarter of growth from our largest businesses. Cranial and Spinal, Surgical and Cardiac Rhythm, these businesses have durable established leadership positions. And combined, they made up just under half of our revenue and grew 6% organic. Starting with Cranial and Spinal technologies, we had another great quarter, growing 6% globally and 8% in the US, driven by our market-leading Aible ecosystem. We're seeing growth in both neurosurgery capital equipment and the associated pull-through of our best-in-class spinal implants and biologics as surgeons continue to adopt Aible. Neurosurgery grew 5%, including double-digit growth in Mazor robotics and high-single-digit growth in StealthStation navigation. And Spine and Biologics grew 7% globally and 9% in the US. These results demonstrate our successful strategy of offering surgeons a differentiated and innovative ecosystem including our AI-enabled surgical planning platform and patient-specific customized implants, along with imaging, navigation and robotic technologies. Now moving to Surgical, we grew 7%. Supply continued to improve and this drove high-single-digit growth in Advanced Surgical Technologies. And we had particular strength in Advanced Energy as we continue the rollout of our LigaSure XP and cordless Sonicision 7. Cardiac rhythm grew 5% with Mid-single-digit growth in defibrillation solutions diagnostics and Cardiac Pacing. And now within Pacing, we had strong mid-teens growth in our Micra leadless pacemaker franchise and we launched our next-generation Microdevices AV2 and VR2 in the US. These tiny 0.8 CC devices have a battery life of 16 and 17 years, respectively, 40% longer than our previous generation and well beyond average battery life of competing products. We're also seeing EPs rapidly adopt conduction system pacing as an alternative to traditional single or dual-chamber pacing. Our 3830 lead is the only one approved for conduction system pacing in the US and it grew 45% in the quarter. Looking ahead, we're preparing to launch the Aurora EV-ICD later this year. Aurora is a game changer for the ICD space. It delivers the benefits of a traditional ICD including the same size, longevity and pacing features, but without leads in the heart or veins. Turning to our synergistic businesses. There were several notable performances this quarter. Cardiac Surgery grew 8% again this quarter, with strength in perfusion and cannula. Our Aortic and ENT businesses both grew double digits, driven in part by improved product availability. Peripheral Vascular grew mid-single digits with low double-digit growth in drug-coated balloons and high single-digit growth in superficial vein therapy. Neuromodulation grew mid-single digits in both Pain Stim and Brain Modulation, driven by new implants of Intellis with DTM and Percept PC with BrainSense. And just last week, we received CE Mark approval for our next-generation spinal cord stimulator, Inceptiv, which will be available in Europe in the coming months. Inceptiv incorporates closed-loop therapy with ECAPs, the result of decades of Medtronic R&D, to unlock the ability to listen and respond to signals along the spinal cord. Both our largest and synergistic businesses had really strong quarters. And our businesses that compete in high secular growth med-tech markets, they did as well. All combined, these businesses made up 20% of our revenue and grew in the high single digits in Q1. We continue to disproportionately invest in these businesses, and we expect them to become a larger part of our revenue mix and be large contributors to our durable growth in the future. Starting with Structural Heart, transcatheter valves grew 11% globally, including 12% growth in the US and 21% growth in Japan. We continue to see improvements in the TAVR space and adoption of our differentiated Evolut FX valve. Evolut FX combines enhanced and predictable valve deployment with industry-leading durability. And next Monday, we're looking forward to the presentation of the NOTION 10-year data at ESC, which will look at the durability of the CoreValve and Evolut valves compared to surgery over a decade. In Neurovascular, we grew mid-single digits when you exclude China where the market is subject to volume-based procurement. Global growth was fueled by continued strength in flow diversion. We're seeing strong adoption of our Shield technology for treating aneurysms, which is available on our Pipeline Flex and Pipeline Vantage flow diverters. And Cardiac Ablation Solutions grew 5%. And as you know, Pulse Field Ablation has become one of the most anticipated technologies in medtech. And we will be leading the way in bringing PFA catheters to market for both focal and single-shot segments. We're continuing the limited market release in Europe for Affera mapping and ablation system, including our Sphere-9 focal catheter. Sphere-9 can perform both PFA and RF ablation and delivers high-density mapping, all from the same catheter. Turning to our single-shot PFA catheter, PulseSelect, we filed for approval with US FDA and expect to be one of the first companies with a PFA catheter in the US market. With our PFA catheters and the Affera map nav system, combined with our leading Arctic Front crowd solution and differentiated AcQCross Transseptal Access System, we're poised to become a more meaningful player in the fast-growing $8 billion EP ablation space. In Robotic Surgical Technologies, we increased our installed base as we continue the international rollout of our differentiated Hugo robotic system. And we've activated new sites in our EXPAND URO US pivotal trial which continues to progress to plan. We expect Hugo to be a meaningful growth driver for us in the years ahead, given its differentiated value proposition, our leading position in minimally invasive surgery and the low penetration of robotic surgery around the world. And in Diabetes, we had a good quarter as we continued to see very strong demand for the MiniMed 780G AID system in markets around the world. 780G is a true second-generation AID system and is the only one with five-minute adjustments in auto corrections and Meal Detection technology. We're getting great feedback that users are feeling a difference within one to two days. And our real-world evidence indicates that 90% of users are achieving or exceeding their glycemic targets when using our recommended settings as well as getting burden reduction in their diabetes management. And this differentiated value proposition is showing up in our results. Non-US developed markets grew 18%, our highest growth in four years, driven by both 780G adoption and increased CGM attachment rates. And in the US, we're seeing great results and momentum from the 780G launch. First, the launch drove low 30s growth in our US durable pump sales. Second, we're seeing our prescriber base rapidly expand. Since we last talked to you at ADA in late June, we've had a 30% increase in unique prescribers with now over 13,000 since launch. Third, we've had over half of our 770G installed base upgrade or place an order for the 780G since launch. And not only is demand coming from our existing installed base, but we're also getting competitive conversions. And finally, we're seeing very high CGM attachment rates in the 780G installed base, which will drive our economics and gives us confidence in accelerating growth. So the turnaround in Diabetes is real and underway, and I am pleased with the progress the team is making. And we're just at the beginning of this inflection point for the business. As we shared with you at our ADA investor briefing in June, we see the intensive insulin space moving from primarily standalone CGM today to one that is smart dosing through either AID systems or smart MDI, and we are well positioned for this trend. We continue to invest heavily in next-generation durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, sensors and algorithms with multiple programs under development. And importantly, we're the only company assembling this complete ecosystem of differentiated technology for people living with diabetes. With that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and our fiscal '24 guidance raise. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Geoff. As Geoff mentioned, we had a strong start to our fiscal year with 6% revenue growth coming in ahead of expectations. We also had good growth on the bottom line with non-GAAP EPS of $1.20, up 6%. This was $0.09 above the midpoint of our guidance range, with $0.07 coming from better-than-expected operational performance and $0.02 from FX. We're focused on positioning Medtronic to drive durable growth. You've seen that over the last several quarters on the top line, and as we talked about on our last call, stabilizing and then ultimately improving gross margins remains a priority for us. The breadth of our revenue growth this quarter is notable. As Geoff mentioned, each of our four business segments grew 6%. And by geography, non-US developed and emerging markets, both grew in the high single digits with the US growing mid-single digits. Western Europe grew 8% again this quarter with high single-digit growth in Cardiovascular and Medical Surgical and high teens growth in Diabetes. Emerging markets grew 8% and were affected by new sanctions in Russia and ongoing VBP impact in China. That said, China growth at 4% was better than expected given some provincial VBP delays to later in the year and strong procedure recovery. Excluding China and Russia, emerging markets grew in the high teens with mid-teens growth in Southeast Asia and the Middle East and Africa and high-teens growth in Latin America and South Asia. Turning to margins. Our adjusted gross margin was relatively stable year-over-year and ahead of expectations with better-than-expected pricing and less-than-expected impact from currency, offsetting inflationary pressures. Our operating margin increased 90 basis points, driven by revenue outperformance and our focus on expense management, particularly in our G&A line. Below the operating profit line, our adjusted nominal tax rate was 15.8%, above expectations, driven by a change in Puerto Rico tax law. The change drove an approximate 120 basis point increase in our tax line, offset by a corresponding decrease in other operating expense. So the change was net neutral to earnings. Turning to capital allocation. We're prioritizing investments in innovation as we disproportionately invest in high-growth, high-return opportunities. We do this through multiple channels, including organic R&D, minority investments, strategic partnerships and disciplined acquisitions. At the same time, we prioritize returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, primarily through our strong and growing dividend. We also continue to advance our active portfolio management. Last quarter, we moved our Renal Care Solutions business into a joint venture with DaVita. We've been focused on the separation of Patient Monitoring and Respiratory Interventions. And as we noted in our 10-K, we now expect to complete the separation in the first half of next fiscal year, if not sooner, as we've been evaluating different types of transactions to maximize shareholder value. We've always said a spin sets a high bar, and it remains the likely way we'll separate these businesses. Now turning to guidance. With our outperformance in the first quarter and improved underlying fundamentals, we're raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect fiscal '24 organic revenue growth of 4.5%, an increase from the prior range of 4% to 4.5%. This guidance excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from our new Other segment, and I direct you to the guidance slide in our earnings presentation for additional details. In the second quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 4.5%. On a comp-adjusted basis, this represents an acceleration over the first quarter. And we expect a steady acceleration in underlying growth in the back half of the year as well. While the impact of currency is fluid, based on recent rates, foreign currency would have a neutral impact on full year revenue, including a favorable impact of $85 million to $135 million in the second quarter. Moving down the P&L. As we have said before, we expect inflation and currency pressures this fiscal year. And we do expect some of the delayed impact from the provincial VBPs that benefited us in the first quarter to come later in the year. However, you are beginning to see the results from the actions we are taking to drive structural changes in our global operations and supply chain. To give a few examples, we're moving to fewer, more strategic suppliers that are giving us better terms. And we're implementing improvements to run our factories more efficiently and reliably. There is more to come, and we expect this will drive stabilization in our gross margin over time and then improve it from there. On the bottom line, we're raising our fiscal '24 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to the new range of $5.08 to $5.16, an increase from the prior range of $5.00 to $5.10. This is a $0.07 increase at the midpoint, in line with the first quarter operational beat. The guidance range continues to include an unfavorable 6% impact from foreign currency based on recent rates. The projected 6% annual FX impact is unchanged from May as the $0.02 of FX upside in the first quarter is now offset later in the year. For the second quarter, we expect EPS of $1.16 to $1.20, including a 6% unfavorable impact from foreign currency based on recent rates. Before sending it back to Geoff, I'd like to acknowledge our employees who are watching today. I truly appreciate your focus on driving change to execute well and deliver on our priorities. It is that focus that contributes to these results and fulfills our enduring mission to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of patients around the globe. Thank you. Back to you, Geoff. Geoff Martha : Okay. Thank you, Karen. Now before we go to the analyst questions, I'll close with a few thoughts. First, Q1 was a strong start to our year and we're establishing a track record of delivering dependable mid-single digit growth. We're executing and bringing innovation in the market. We're making progress in countering the impacts that inflation and currency are having on our margins. And we expect this to lead to stabilization and then improvement over time. We're also seeing improved underlying fundamentals in our supply chain and in our markets, across our businesses and geographies. And like I said earlier, we're at the beginning of an inflection point in our Diabetes business and we're seeing strength in our established market-leading businesses like CRM and Spine. And with our pipeline, we have several important growth catalysts that we expect to come to market over the coming quarters. So we're on the right path and building momentum. And underneath all of this, what may be less visible to you are the steps we've taken to transform the company, tackling the root causes of what have made our growth less dependable in the past. We're ensuring a performance-driven culture, partially driven by a number of new leaders in the company. We're advancing our capital allocation and portfolio management priorities to take advantage of high-growth opportunities. And we're executing on the programs that we believe will lead to scale advantages, whether that's in our now centralized global operations and supply chain organization or in how we go to market with large enterprise customers around the world or in how we're leveraging core technologies and implementing new innovations across our businesses. Now to accelerate this last area, we created a new position of Chief Technology and Innovation Officer and hired Ken Washington this past quarter to fill that role. Ken was recently at Amazon, where he led consumer robotics, and before that, was Chief Technology Officer at Ford Motor Company and VP of the Advanced Technology Center at Lockheed Martin Space Systems. I look forward to sharing more details in the quarters ahead on how Ken is leading our efforts to leverage technologies like robotics and AI across the enterprise, which we believe will lead to new, differentiated therapies for patients and better experiences for our customers. So this is an extensive transformation. Yes, there's still work to be done, but you're seeing some of the benefits in our results. And you should expect to see more of this over time as we continue to work toward delivering durable revenue and earnings growth, which, combined with a growing dividend, is a winning formula for creating value for our shareholders. Now let's move to Q&A where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible. So we ask you to limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. I also want to note that today is the first time we have Mike Marinaro, who runs our Surgical and our Endoscopy businesses joining us for the Q&A. Now Bob White's focus is on the PMRI businesses as we separate, which is a heavy lift. And we have Mike focused on the other two MedSurg businesses. So today, if you have questions on Surgical or Endoscopy, direct them to Mike. And PMRI questions can go to Bob. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question? A - Brad Welnick : [Operator Instructions] Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of Diabetes; Mike Marinaro, EVP and President of the Surgical and Endoscopy businesses; Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular portfolio; Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience portfolio; and Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical portfolio. We\u2019ll pause for a few second to assemble the queue. We'll take the first question from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. And, Geoff, congrats on good print here, good execution. Maybe my first one on Diabetes here. The 30% US growth numbers here, I think that's a revenue number. Do you know what the comp growth number was in US and how much of this was existing customers? How much of this growth is grown by existing customers upgrading the 770G users update versus new customer adds? Geoff Martha : Thanks, Vijay, for the question. Yeah. Well, first of all, let me just say we're really pleased with the momentum we have in Diabetes. I mean and I think we're on the kind of early stages of a growth acceleration there. We're seeing great outcomes in patients. Like I mentioned in the commentary, a significant increase in unique prescribers, a much higher attachment rate of CGM, which will really impact our economics. That's where a lot of the profit comes from. And we think this is durable and in line with the market trends of time and range and moving to automated insulin delivery. So -- and we've got a nice pipeline coming down the path as well. But to answer those specific questions, I'm going to turn to Que, as you know, who runs that business. Que, do you want to touch on Vijay's specific questions? Que Dallara : Yes. Thanks, Geoff. Thanks, Vijay. We're really pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the US so far. In terms of what's driving the low 30s AID growth in the US, it's both our existing installed base of 770G users that have upgraded. We've had more than 50% of that cohort upgrade or in the process of upgrading. But we're also seeing growth coming from new patients. We've had the highest new patient growth in three years and that's coming from MDI as well as competitive switches. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful, Que. Maybe, Geoff, I have 1 quick follow up. A lot of questions here on China. The new anticorruption campaign, we're seeing some headlines, a lot of questions on how this would impact device companies. Maybe just talk about at a high level what you're seeing in China? What was the VBP impact in the quarter? And any signs of perhaps the channel pausing here because of this new antifriction campaign? Thank you. Geoff Martha : Yeah, you asked about the anticorruption and VBP so -- in China. So look, on the anticorruption, I recognize that there are concerns out there. And we're actively monitoring the situation, which is fluid in nature. But I'll say thus far, we're not seeing any material headwind for our business. And it is kind of pivoting to -- there's a linkage to VBP. It's worth noting that we -- you can argue that we're somewhat a bit insulated from some of this anticorruption with the coverage under VBPs, I mean, volume, in this case, is contracted. And with the hospital pricing is determined with VBP and we're less reliant on the field team and distribution, which has also allowed us to take cost out to mitigate the price impact. So no impact at this point from the anticorruption campaign that you read about. And then regarding VBP, I mean this -- it's -- we feel it's been -- it's a 2.5-year kind of impact here and we're -- for us, that fully -- that impact kind of fully takes effect in this fiscal year, FY '24. It's all in our guidance. As Karen pointed out in the commentary, the China growth this past quarter was at 4%, which is slightly higher than we expected, still well below what it used to be, but -- and where we think it's going to get back. As we kind of lap this -- these last couple of VBP areas in FY '24, we expect this revenue to get back to historical high single-digit, low double-digit growth for us. So hope that answers the question. This is something, as you look forward, it's a multibillion dollar of revenue for the company that over the last couple of years has been negative, more recently flat, now starting to get positive. And as we -- as we get out of FY '24, again, we expect a tick up in this growth. So that's coming. Vijay Kumar : Got you. Thanks. Ryan Weispfenning : Yeah. Thanks for the questions, Vijay. We\u2019ll take the next question please, Brad? Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Great, good morning. Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe to start for Geoff or Karen, as we think about guidance for the rest of the year, you raised the organic sales growth from the low end of 4% to 4.5% up to 4.5%. You did 6% in the first quarter. So maybe just walk us through why growth is going to decelerate for the rest of the year? And what are some of the factors affecting what could drive you above that? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. Thanks for that question, Robbie. Appreciate it. Q1 was a really great start to our year, and we're really pleased with the breadth of our performance. As Geoff mentioned, it's the third consecutive quarter that we've had of solid mid-single digit growth. And we're carrying the beat that we had in Q1 and raising our Q2 guide to 4% to 4.5%. And all of that puts our FY '24 guidance at 4.5%. It's still early in the year, and we're focused on providing guidance that sets us up for success. I've talked about some of the puts and takes that we've got. We're a little more optimistic on China, Geoff talked about it. We've had procedure volume recovery. We also had some of the VBP impacts that we expected in the first quarter delayed into the -- later in the fiscal year. And we're expecting Russia to be a bigger drag given the new sanctions that were put in place in late May. But we're focused on offsetting that just as we did in Q1, and we feel good about the improved underlying fundamentals. And we're intensely focused on hitting our commitments. Just on the acceleration for the rest of the year, on a comp-adjusted basis, Q2 represents an acceleration from Q1. And then we expect continued acceleration into the back half each quarter of the fiscal year into the back half. So hopefully, that answers your question. Robbie Marcus : Yeah. Great. Thank you. Maybe just one more on margins. Margin expansion or the upside in the quarter came from gross margin. SG&A, I know you had some reductions in the head count. So as we just try and think about operating margins for this year and going forward, how should we think about how much more there is to come out of SG&A and how much more upside there is in gross margin moving back towards where we were pre-COVID? Thanks a lot. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Clearly, we're focused on driving margin expansion and ultimately on the gross margin getting back to pre-COVID levels over time. We saw improved margins this quarter, and we're increasing our full year guidance on gross margin expectations given some of that outperformance. But in Q1, we did have some better-than-expected currency and pricing. And some of that was due to timing with some provincial tenders in China being delayed a bit and some of the FX improvement that we saw this quarter, we expect to -- FX to impact us a little bit more in the back half of the year. So as we think about margins, we are making investments in our global operations and supply chain to drive cost out of the organization. And I mentioned a couple of examples where we're consolidating our suppliers and focused on improvements in our manufacturing operations to drive continued improvement. And over time, we're focused on stabilizing and improving our margins. And so that will continue to impact us on the operating margin line. And on SG&A, as you mentioned, we're focused on continuing to drive leverage in our SG&A line, as you've seen us do for a long period of time. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thank you, Robbie. We\u2019ll take the next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo Securities. Larry, please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two for Sean, given the upcoming events here with the Symplicity adcom and then the Affera pulse data this weekend. Sean, how are you feeling about the Simplicity panel tomorrow? And if we see a positive recommendation, help us think about timelines for approval and the ramp in the US for renal denervation. And second, we're going to see the Affera pulse data this weekend as well. You guys are growing mid-single digits, looks like a little bit below the market right now. What should we be looking for in the Affera pulse data? And how are you feeling about being able to grow your AFib business at or above the market going forward? Thank you. Sean Salmon : Thanks for the question, Larry. So I guess starting with the adcom panel. Obviously, we've been very confident about the prospects of US approval, and we're exclusively well prepared for that panel. I'm not going to handicap the timing, but typically, it's three to four months post panel recommendation, you tend to see things. Let's say, an approval in the second half of fiscal year '24 is certainly in order with that kind of timing. And the ramp itself, of course, is going to be dictated by the pace of reimbursement and we're well prepared on that front as well. As far as our pulse field ablation, we're looking forward to seeing the results like everyone else's. This is a randomized trial, as you know. So that comparative efficacy compared to both cryo and RF ablation for the populations being studied and will be of interest to us. And I think our distinction really in pulse field is that we are the only player that has both a focal solution as well as an anatomic solution in the bag. The anatomic solution or single-shot market is about 15% of the market. And the other 85% is what the point-by-point ablation will bring to us. So certainly very confident in both technologies, both the PulseSelect and Affera mapping and Sphere-9 catheter system, which is very different than everything else that's out there, and we look forward to bringing those to customers all around the world. Larry Biegelsen : All right. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Larry. Next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy at UBS. Danielle, please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. And congrats, this was quite a good quarter. Just a quick question on GLP-1s, Geoff. I know this is probably an annoying question for you, but this is something that's been impacting the market broadly. And just curious, you guys touched on many, many areas within medical devices. How are you guys thinking about the impact of GLP-1s over the next -- I would say even a few years, but maybe let's focus on more the next year as these drugs get more readily adopted. Geoff Martha : Sure. Thanks, Danielle, for the comments and the question. And yeah, it is interesting. First of all, I'd say it's an important class of drugs and like you were monitoring to see how the GLP-1 therapy is being adopted. That said, our initial work indicates minimal impact to our business. When you -- bariatric -- the one area we've seen some modest impact is bariatric, but this is really a small impact and this is a relatively small part of our Surgery business. And we are hearing from -- the work we do is our internal analysis plus dialogue that we're having with physicians around the world. We actually operate obesity clinics in Europe as well. And they're talking about, longer term, this could actually bring in the bariatric space more patients into the funnel. Short term, we've seen some impact, again, modest and bariatric is a relatively small part of our surgery business. Longer term, we'll see how it plays out. There's a bit of optimism there though. No impact in Type 1 diabetes, which is the vast majority of our Diabetes business. And this is overall, I just don't see GLP-1s having a material impact on our business and medical device therapies at large. That's what our work is showing us at this point. Danielle Antalffy : And then I guess just one quick follow-up to that, thinking about, again, the diabetes business. Type 2 is a big growth area. You guys have an AID pen. So what are your thoughts specifically on the Type 2 diabetes side of things? Thanks so much. Geoff Martha : Thanks. Look, I think this is AID for insulin-dependent patients, whether they're Type 2 or Type 1 is pretty under-penetrated. And we see way more upside there than headwinds. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Danielle. We\u2019ll take the next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, congrats on a good quarter. I guess I'll ask about TAVR, double-digit growth this quarter. And curious how much success you've had with the new valve versus the five-year data. I know your competitor is going to have five-year data pretty soon. And then the 21% Japan growth really stood out. Just curious if that's sustainable or that was more of a one-off in the quarter? Geoff Martha : Well, first, before I turn it over -- before I turn it over to Sean, we are -- if you go back the last couple of quarters, we are pleased with how our TAVR business is performing relative to competition and how the new valve is performing and also the pipeline for the future. But Sean, why don't you give the specifics on that question? Sean Salmon : Sure. Hey, Travis, the new valve is certainly being well received where we've launched it. It's been launched in the United States and a number of other geographies and Japan notably. The other thing that drove Japan growth was that we got a new indication for end-stage renal disease, which is something we've been lacking in Japan. So it's a large consideration for that population that really helps drive the performance. But yes, our long-term data have been really the signature of that device, and we'll see more of that this coming weekend as well as the 10-year NOTION data. This is the first 10-year data being reported out for TAVR will be on display. And then of course, we have four-year data coming up on our low-risk study as well to look forward to this fall. So we stand behind the valve performance all the way around. And whether it's the acute ease of use or the long-term durability of the valve, it's really shining and we're getting a lot of traction from all of that. Travis Steed : That's helpful. And then the PMRI spend, I assume the time change is more because spends take longer than sells. But maybe some other comments on when we could see the Form 10, can you confirm the operating margin profile of that business is still kind of slightly higher than overall Medtronic? And then do we need to wait for this to get through to see more on the portfolio management side of things? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. Thanks, Travis. I think there's nothing to read into this other than we're focused on maximizing shareholder value, and we've been taking our time to evaluate the alternatives. And we've said all along that the spin sets a high bar and that remains a likely way that we'll separate. And so we'll -- we're expecting to close it first half of next fiscal year, if not sooner. In terms of Form 10, we'll -- you'll see it when you see it. And in terms of the margins of the business, yes, they are good margins and slightly higher than the company. Hopefully, that helps. Geoff Martha : And the business continues to perform well. Like Karen said, the margin profile has remained strong. And actually, the competitive dynamics, particularly in the patient monitoring side of it, have probably improved a bit in our favor. So it's a good business, and I think with more focus, I think these numbers can even improve. Travis Steed : Great. Thanks a lot. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Travis. Next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Miksic : Hi, thanks so much [Technical Difficulty] question and congrats on a really strong quarter across the board. There's a lot to talk about, but maybe one question on diabetes for Que and then one follow-up. So just would love to hear how things are progressing with some of the programs that you talked about at ADA, the next-gen sensor and integrated testing and the patch pump that you're in the process of acquiring here? And then if I could on that, Geoff mentioned something about the next-gen AID pump and I know it's way early to even ask the question, but just curious if you are ready to share any hints about that? And then one quick follow-up, if I could. Que Dallara : Yeah. Thanks for your questions. As you know, [indiscernible] CGM, our next generation CGM is under review with the marketing FDA. We're in the process of doing that, and it's very difficult to put a precise time line on when we expect to have approval, but that is progressing. In terms of the integration with 780G, we have completed adult enrollment for the clinical trial in Q1. We expect to complete the peds enrollment in. But that's at the clinical trial stage. We're also -- in terms of the patch, we're making progress there as well in terms of completing that transaction, and we expect that we would close out the EOFlow acquisition at the end of at the end of this calendar year. And again, very sorry to disappoint you, but difficult to comment on our further programs. They're progressing as we expect in our internal time lines. But at this stage, it's a bit too early to put details on specific timing. Matt Miksic : That's helpful and understandable. Just one -- the follow-up is on sort of seasonality. You've seen July year and I know there's been a number of questions across the sector, given what we've seen over the last [Technical Difficulty] year-to-date in surgeries and procedure volumes and so on. Just any sense of what kind of summer quarter we should expect, which for you [Technical Difficulty] August, but softer than usual, seasonally normal. How would you describe what you've seen in July and what your expectations are built into your fiscal Q2 here? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : So I would just say, Travis, that the first few weeks of the quarter and what we've seen in July are tracking well. We continue to have strength in the underlying performance and it's tracking of the expectations we set in our guidance. Matt Miksic : That\u2019s fair. All right, thanks so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Matt. We\u2019ll take the next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Chris Pasquale at Nephron. Chris, please go ahead. Chris Pasquale : Hey. Geoff, one for you and then a quick follow-up for Karen. You mentioned artificial intelligence as one of the areas Medtronic is investing in. It's obviously a hot topic in the market more broadly. Could you provide any examples of the work you guys are doing there? Maybe talk about which businesses you see AI as being most relevant for in the near future? Geoff Martha : Sure. Well, first of all, I think for the medical device industry, the kind of the intersection of traditional biomedical engineering with these digital technologies, whether it be connectivity or data analytics techniques like AI and deep learning, robotics, these are all just a huge opportunity for the industry. This is -- and these are areas that we intend to lead in. AI specifically, we've got a number of businesses that have first-of-their-kind, AI-powered solutions that have received regulatory approval by the FDA and other regulatory bodies around the world. And what we're seeing here is just improved -- from the AI is just improved outcomes and access. And it's the -- when you combine the AI with good data, not just quantity, but the quality of data and that data is labeled properly, we're seeing the ability to even personal -- like evolve and improve the efficacy over time through the AI and even personalize it. The FDA has approved a couple of products for us in the Cardiac Rhythm space, in Spine, in GI, where you have like what they call a predetermined change control plan where you're allowed to kind of improve that efficacy over time. And some of the businesses that are impacted, like I mentioned, our GI are now calling Endoscopy space, where we have AI in the colonoscopy, you're kind of redefining traditional colonoscopies where the AI is finding polyps that physicians were missing. And this is a significant amount of polyps and it's obviously good for patient outcomes because there's a high correlation to cancer -- colon cancer from these polyps and it's also economically aligned with the hospital's interest as you find more polyps and remove them. Another area is in our Spine business. This is an industry that's being completely redefined by enabling technology -- transformed and redefined by enabling technology. And we talk about robotics and imaging and navigation and powered instruments, but AI is a key piece of this and we have thousands of surgeries in our AI -- that\u2019s powering our AI algorithm. And with each -- and Spine is a complicated surgery, especially whether it be degen, or [for sure] (ph), deformity complex cases. Highly reliant on surgeon training. And the AI is really just improving outcomes here, especially when it's combined with enabling technology. I could go on, cardiac rhythm in our monitoring, our LINQ monitoring business there, we are cutting down false positives for -- in detecting AFib by 50% using AI, and that's creating multiple hours of productivity for these clinics around the country and given -- so and this really driving the deployment of that technology. So I'd say it's a huge opportunity. It's a differentiator. I mentioned we hired a new head of technology, Ken Washington, to really help us scale this across all our businesses and better partner with some big tech companies. We've talked about our partnership with NVIDIA. And in the end, I'd say what we're going to see over the next couple of years is you may not be replacing -- AI is not going to be replacing surgeons, but I'll tell you what, surgeons who use AI will be replacing surgeons that don't and we are going to be right in the middle of that mix. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Those are great examples. Karen, you mentioned price as a contributor to the gross margin strength in the quarter. Could you just give us a sense for what price looks like across the company today? Maybe how it compares to where you were a couple of years ago? And if you think that it's sustainable as we move into a less inflationary environment going forward? Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks for the question. As you've heard us talk about, we have been building a pretty strong muscle around pricing. And we're focused on ensuring that we price for the value that we deliver. Typically, historically, pre-COVID, we would experience up to 200 basis points of pricing pressure every year. And we've been able to neutralize that these last couple of years, including this quarter. We obviously have had VBP pressure this year, and last year, we were able to neutralize that as well at the total company level. By quarter, it may not be fully neutralized depending on how VBP hits us. But we do believe that this pricing muscle that we've built is going to be lasting. And we fully intend to continue to track, monitor, talk about pricing, so that even as we move into a lower inflationary environment, we're focused on continuing this pricing muscle that we've built. Geoff Martha : I just want to reemphasize that last point there on kind of -- we'll start on margins. On gross margins, and there was a question earlier, Karen went into detail, I'm not going to repeat that. But on gross margins, the pricing muscle that we've been building. I think we intend that to be enduring. And then Karen mentioned the cost of goods sold improvements that we're making, productivity around our cost of goods sold line, really driven by our new structure, strategy and capabilities in our global operations and supply chain. That will all help gross margin. And as you get down the P&L, we're really focused on getting leverage from SG&A and excited about stabilizing and then improving the margins over time. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thanks Chris. We\u2019ll take the next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Jayson Bedford at Raymond James. Jayson, please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Geoff Martha : Yeah, Jayson. We can hear you. Jayson Bedford : All right. Thanks. So not to make this a call all around gross margin, but I did have a question. You mentioned stabilization. I just wanted to put a little context around that. What is the expected gross margin for fiscal '24? Karen Parkhill : At this point -- when we gave our guidance back in May, we said we expected it to be around 65.25%. And at this point, we're expecting it to be about 65.50%. We've seen some improvement in the first quarter, and we're carrying some of that through. Jayson Bedford : Okay. And just, Karen, the drop down for the rest of the year versus first quarter levels, revenue is higher. Is this just strictly a function of the VBP impact hitting more in the back half? Karen Parkhill : Yes, it's both VBP and currency. And you're right, higher revenue growth clearly helps on the margin front. But we have seen some timing on VBP that we talked about. We also have some timing on FX. It was a little bit better than we expected down the P&L in the first quarter, and we expect to give some of that back as we look at the currency impact going forward. Jayson Bedford : Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Jayson. Brad, I think we have time for two more questions. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Joanne Weunsch at Citi. Joanne, please go ahead. Joanne Weunsch : Good morning. And thank you very much for taking the question and nice quarter or nice way to start the fiscal year. Two quick questions. Volumes, we've seen throughout medtech this season have been quite strong, which leads me to wonder as to sort of a new normalized base or whether or not we're just catching up on some pent-up demand. I'd love your opinion on that. And then for Hugo, you talked about activating new sites in the United States. Can you give us maybe an update on the thoughts on timing of a launch in the US? And then anything else you can add for OUS robotic placements would be appreciated. Thank you. Geoff Martha : Sure, Joanne. Yeah, good to hear from you. Thanks for the questions. I'll take the first one, and then I'll turn it over to Mike Marinaro to handle the Hugo questions. I think on procedure trends, we're -- as Karen mentioned, I mentioned in the commentary, they're definitely improved, and I'll start in the US where we're up about 5% or so. But across the board, we're seeing very good procedural trends, and we're largely back to pre-COVID or better. pre-COVID levels are better. As you know, over the last, I don't know, 18 months or so, the rebound has been, I'd say, held back a bit by staffing issues and those have seem to have abated. And like I said, we're getting pretty broad-based procedural pickups and are back to pre-COVID or even better levels. And outside of the US, I'd say it's even stronger. In Western Europe, high single digits. The recovery in Europe is definitely in full swing. Latin America, high teens. And just our -- like our emerging market base when you got to pull out -- if you pull out China, which is VBP, like I said before, this is -- we see the kind of the stabilizing year here for VBP FY '24. And then as you get into FY '25, you get back to some higher growth in China like we've seen before. But if you take out China and Russia with the sanctions, we're in the teens -- the mid-teens and -- high teens actually in emerging markets. So emerging markets trends are strong. I mentioned Latin America as a standout, Western Europe. So pretty good trends. We're not seeing like this -- at least in the areas we're in, I've heard some area like orthopedics, there's been a pent-up demand. But we're not seeing it in the areas we're in. It's been a steady flow versus like a pent-up demand. So I think that's good news for the industry. On the Hugo questions, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Marinaro, who runs our Surgical business, which includes Hugo and also our endoscopy or formerly called GI business reports up to him as well. Mike Marinaro : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Joanne. And specifically on the US, we did comment that we added sites in the quarter, and that's true we had sites and enrollment and continue to progress according to plan in our EXPAND URO study. We're pleased with the progress we're making there and seeing that progress continue here as we've moved into this quarter. More broadly, we've seen good progress really and continue to be encouraged about the progress we're making across the program. We're now selling in five regions around the globe. Greater China, Asia, Western Europe, LatAm, North America and Canada. And increased our installations again here in this quarter. I think importantly, we've also seen an increasing flow or a steady flow of increasing indication approvals. So we received the general surgery indication in Japan. And so now we have a full suite of approvals across general surgery, gynecology and urology in both Japan and Western Europe, which are two of the largest markets around the globe. Of course, US is the largest and that's one we remain incredibly focused on. Overall, we're seeing that the growth here in Hugo is contributing to the growth we've seen now in the Surgical business across the last couple of quarters, and it will become a more and more important part of our business as we move forward. Geoff Martha : Yeah, really look -- excited about the setup we have for our business. It's a very large business for us that where the supply capacity has been an issue, that's in a much better spot. The robots out there might just walk through kind of indication expansion and geographic expansion and update on the US trial. And I like the set up and the competitive dynamics going forward over the next couple of years. We got two major competitors, one with robot, one without. And we're feeling pretty good about where we are with Surgery. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Joanne. I still see a number of people in the queue, and I apologize that we won't be able to get to all of you today, given timing. We've got time for one more question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick : Our final question comes from Patrick Wood at Morgan Stanley. Patrick, please go ahead. Patrick Wood : Fabulous. Thank you so much. I'll keep it to one given the timing. S&OP and supply chain is obviously not a very sexy topic, but you guys are doing a lot of work on that side. I'm just curious, typically, when we put processes and rationalization in place, there's kind of upfront cost and like your dual running systems and it's kind of difficult for people to transition. Are you seeing any slight -- let's say, short-term challenges or costs associated with that, where the payback is obviously going to come in the next, I don't know, year or two? Just help us understand how that's looking in the business. Thanks. Geoff Martha : Well, let me just start off by saying, I appreciate your question on supply chain. It's been a big focus area for us. And I know a couple of thousand people at Medtronic that do think it's a pretty sexy place to be and are pretty proud of the work that we're doing. To answer the question, I'll turn it over to Karen on the cost question. Karen Parkhill : Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Yes, when we're working on improving processes and driving better cost down, it does take investment. That investment is included in the guidance that we've given and is -- it's part of the reason that our gross margins are not yet stable. But we fully expect those investments to pay off over time and to help drive costs down more than inflation as we work to bring our gross margins up. Hopefully, that's helpful. Patrick Wood : Amazing. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thanks, Patrick. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Geoff Martha : Well, first of all, thanks, everyone, for the questions. And as always, we appreciate your support and your continued interest in Medtronic. And we look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our Q2 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Tuesday, November 21. With that, thanks again for joining us today, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning. Welcome to a crisp fall morning here in Minnesota. I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. And I appreciate that you're joining us this morning for Medtronic's Fiscal \u201824 Second Quarter Video Earnings Webcast. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Jeff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our second quarter, which ended on October 27, 2023, and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the Executive VPs covering our segments will join us and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and second quarter revenue in the current and prior year reported as other, which stems from prior business separations. There were no acquisitions made in the last four quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential revenue changes, compared to the first quarter of fiscal \u201824 and are made on an as-reported basis, and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter of 2023, compared to the third calendar quarter of 2022, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter. Geoff Martha : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Q2 was another good quarter for us as we executed and delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth. The underlying fundamentals of our business are strong, and our growth was broad-based across multiple businesses and geographies, with cardiovascular, neuroscience, and medical-surgical all growing mid-single-digits, and diabetes accelerating to high-single-digit growth. Our new product launches are performing well and driving growth across many businesses. And we look ahead to the back half of our fiscal year, those launches, combined with several recent regulatory approvals, give us confidence in our ability to continue delivering dependable growth. And at the same time, we're executing on our comprehensive transformation, including enhancing our global operations, quality, and supply chain. And we're decisively allocating capital into fast growth medtech markets and fueling innovative technologies in areas like robotics, AI, and closed-loop systems that will drive our growth over the next decade. We're forging the path to durable growth as we execute on the actions needed to create long-term value for our shareholders. So now let's get into the details behind our Q2 results. We continue to look at our portfolio of businesses in three categories : Established market leader businesses; synergistic businesses; and highest growth businesses. Looking first at the established market leaders, we had very strong performances across Cranial & Spinal Technologies, Surgical, and Cardiac Rhythm Management. Combined, they made up just under half of our revenue and grew 6% organic again this quarter. Starting with Cranial & Spinal Technologies, continued adoption of our AiBLE ecosystem is driving consistent above-market growth. In Q2, we grew 7%. Digitization is transforming the competitive landscape in spine, and we're leading the way with AiBLE. With our global footprint of over 10,000 systems, over 10,000 systems, we're over 4 times greater than the nearest competitor. We are the first and only solution with integrated AI-based surgical planning with unit adaptive spine intelligence. Our Mazor robotic system is the first and only to offer bone cutting, a feature that was well received when we unveiled it at the North American Spine Society Conference in Los Angeles just last month. And we remain the clear leader in the intraoperative imaging and navigation space with our Oarm and StealthStation Technologies, both of which grew double-digits in the quarter. As surgeons adopt AiBLE and we continue to expand our sales teams and invest in future innovation, we expect to maintain our leadership and extend our share gains in spine. Now moving to surgical, we grew 6% here. There was broad-based strength across our surgical franchise. Hernia and electrosurgery both grew in the double-digits on strong sales of our ProGrip and Dextile mesh and ValleyLab smoke evacuation systems. Advanced stapling and wound management both grew mid-single-digits. Cardiac Rhythm grew 4% with high-single-digit growth in cardiovascular diagnostics and cardiac pacing. In pacing, our micro-leadless pacemaker franchise grew 13%, driven by our U.S. launch of our next generation micro AV2 and VR2 devices. We're also seeing strong growth in conduction system pacing, an alternative to traditional single or dual chamber pacing. Our 3830 lead, the only approved lead for this novel form of pacing, grew strong double-digits again this quarter. And late in the quarter, we received FDA approval for our Aurora EV-ICD system, a game changer for the single chamber ICD space. Now we're ramping up our training of implanting cardiologists on the Aurora technology. So Aurora delivers the benefits of a traditional ICD, including similar size, longevity, and pacing features, but without the leads in the heart or veins. And these benefits can be realized with one device and only one implant procedure. And just to drive this point home on size, there's a big difference here versus the competitor's device, and I mean big. Here's an x-ray of an Aurora EV-ICD patient with the competitors right next to it just for comparison. So in addition to all the clinical benefits of our EVI-CD, you can see that it's meaningfully smaller and of course lighter than the competitors. And here's the model that we're giving our reps to explain the difference to customers. Now this is the size of the competitor's device. And we can actually pop out the Aurora to show how much smaller it actually is. So it's like those nesting dolls, except here we just pop out. We start with the big guy and then we go right to the small guy. So let me pop this out. So you see inside the model, here's Aurora. Much smaller, much lighter. And speaking of weight, we actually had to put a series of weights inside of here to get the bigger device to exactly replicate the weight of our competitors. So we're really excited about this as we've got a meaningfully better option for patients. Our advantages will not only displace the competitor's device, but will expand the population far beyond the existing segment. We think this can grow to become a billion-dollar plus segment. Turning to our Synergistic businesses, combined, they grew mid-single-digits in Q2. And we had several standout performances. Aortic grew 9% on strong momentum in our Endurant AAA franchise following the 10-year real-world durability data presented at the Charing Cross Symposium earlier this year. Our coronary business grew 6% as we gained share in international markets on the continued rollout of our Onyx Frontier drug-eluting stent. Cardiac surgery grew 9% driven by strength in perfusion and cannula, as well as the Nautilus ECMO Oxygenator. Our endoscopy business grew 13%, driven by continued adoption of GI Genius. GI Genius uses the power of artificial intelligence to detect polyps in real time during a colonoscopy, integrating seamlessly into a GI doc's existing workflow. GI Genius results in a 50% reduction in mispolyps versus a standard colonoscopy, which plays an important role in the prevention of colon cancer. Turning to businesses in our highest growth markets, cardiac ablation solutions grew 6% on strong market procedural growth. Now, over the coming years, we expect this business to be a very meaningful growth driver for Medtronic. We are leading the way in bringing pulse field ablation catheters to market in both the focal and single shot segments. In focal PFA, we continue to ramp manufacturing of the Sphere 9 catheter and remain in limited market release in Europe. Sphere 9 can perform both PFA and RF ablation and drives high density mapping all from the same catheter. And it integrates seamlessly with our differentiated Affera mapping system. In the U.S., we expect to complete the 12-month follow-up in the pivotal trial for Sphere 9 in the coming weeks, and then we'll prepare for FDA submission. In Single Shot PFA, we just received CE Mark for our PulseSelect catheter, and it will be commercially available early next calendar year. We are now the only company with approved catheters for both Single Shot and focal PFA. And in the U.S., the FDA is reviewing our PulseSelect submission, and we expect to be one of the first companies with a PFA catheter in the U.S. market. Now with our PFA catheters and the Affera Map/Nav system, combined with our leading Arctic front cryo solution and differentiated flex cath cross-transceptal system, we expect to drive strong long-term growth in the fast-growing $8 billion EP ablation space. Now turning to Structural Heart, overall the TAVR space continues to grow in the high-single, low-double-digit range. In Q2 we grew mid-single-digits, which was below the market. Now we declined slightly in the U.S., comping difficult prior year comparisons when we initially launched Evolut FX and customers purchased for stock. Yet we grew 4% sequentially, evidence of the strength of our product. In Europe, we grew high-single-digits and received CE mark for Evolut FX at the end of the quarter. And in Japan, we continued to win share and grew in the mid-30s on the continued adoption of Evolut FX and expanded ESRD indication. Our Evolut platform has now shown superior valve performance, compared to surgery in randomized trials that extend to five to 10 years after initial procedure. And last month our landmark Evolut low-risk trial was presented at TCT and published in Jack. The trial randomized patients to Evolut or best-in-class surgery. As you can see in this chart, Evolut, which is the blue line, had a lower rate of death or disabling stroke, and the difference continues to diverge each year, going from a 2% difference at two years to 2.9% at three years and growing to a 3.4% difference at four years. This resulted in a 26% reduction in death or disabling stroke with Evolut at four years. And no other transcatheter valve has shown better valve performance and outcomes, compared to surgery. Valve design matters and this differentiates us competitively. Physicians understand this data. This is compelling to them, and it's compelling to patients. So as we look ahead, we expect the combination of this data, coupled with the global rollout of Evolut FX to drive our TAVR growth above market. In neurovascular, we grew high-single-digits when you exclude sales in China where the coils market is subject to volume-based procurement. We continue to see very strong growth and flow diversion, which was up low-20s globally. This is being driven by our innovative Shield Technology for treating brain aneurysms, which is available on both the Pipeline Flex and Pipeline Vantage flow diverters. In Robotic Surgical Technologies, we increased our installed base as we continue the international launch of our differentiated Hugo robotic system. In the U.S., our EXPAND URO pivotal trial continues to enroll and is on plan. And we're happy to announce that we have FDA approval to start our U.S. Hernia indication pivotal trial for Hugo. Adoption of Hugo is positive, with surgeons appreciating features that are core to the system, including Touch Surgery Enterprise Digital Technology. This AI-powered video solution, currently available for both robotic and laparoscopic surgery, creates a new paradigm for case review and performance improvement. We've already deployed it in over 20 countries and we're continually developing our connected digital ecosystem and we're excited about the upcoming launch of Touch Surgery Livestream to enable live streaming and sharing of procedures securely and seamlessly. We expect Hugo, equipped with advanced digital capabilities, to be a meaningful growth driver for us in the years ahead. We believe surgeon preference with our open console and modular design, our leading position in minimally invasive surgery and instrumentation, our connected digital ecosystem and data enabled insights, along with our world-class surgical training program and partnerships will meaningfully advance the low penetration of robotic surgery around the world. And in Diabetes, our customer base is expanding sequentially as users around the world purchase the MiniMed 780G system. 780G is the only AID system to make correction boluses every five minutes, offer flexible glucose targets as low as 100, and feature meal detection technology. This combination is resulting in high time and range. Users are achieving or exceeding their glycemic targets, and importantly, realizing the relief that comes from burden reduction in their diabetes management. In Q2, our diabetes business grew 7%, its highest growth in 10 quarters or five years when you exclude the COVID comp in Q4 of FY \u201821. In international markets, we continue to see robust mid-teens growth driven by the recurring revenue from CGM and consumable sales to customers that have adopted our AID technology. And in the U.S., this was our first full quarter of the 780G launch, and we're meeting or exceeding our launch goals. Our U.S. pump sales increased over 30% sequentially. The number of unique 780G prescribers has increased over 20% since last quarter, with many returning to Medtronic as they learn about the differentiated outcomes users are getting with 780G. And we also continue to see very high CGM attachment rates in our 780G installed base, meaningfully above the rates prior to launch. All of these leading indicators give us confidence that we'll see a significant ramp in our CGM and consumable sales in the U.S. and return to year-over-year growth in the back half of this fiscal year. We've been driving this turnaround, and as we look ahead, we expect diabetes to drive even more meaningful growth for us. We expect the majority of the intensive insulin management space to move to smart dosing through either AID systems or smart MDI. And we're well positioned to take advantage of this trend, as we're the only company investing in a complete ecosystem of differentiated technology for people living with diabetes, including next generation durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, sensors, and algorithms. So with that, let's go to Karen for a deeper look at our Q2 financial performance and our fiscal \u201824 guidance raise. Karen? Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Geoff. Looking at our financials, overall it was another good quarter. Our revenue grew 5% ahead of expectations, and adjusted EPS was $1.25, $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance range, with about $0.03 from stronger-than-expected revenue $0.03 from better gross margin, and approximately $0.01 coming below the operating profit line. As Geoff mentioned, we remain focused on delivering durable growth. Based on the changes we've made, including our operating model, incentives, and capital allocation, we've positioned the company to deliver sustainable mid-single-digit growth on the top line. And you are seeing that play out for four quarters in a row now. Looking at our second quarter revenue growth, you can see the diversification coming through, which is important to driving long-term durability. As Geoff stated, our three portfolios grew mid-single-digits, and diabetes accelerated to high-single-digit growth. The broad-based growth also came through on a geographic basis. Western Europe grew high-single-digits, with strength across many cardiovascular businesses, diabetes, neurovascular, and pelvic health. And Japan grew mid-single-digits and was also driven by strong results in many cardiovascular businesses, as well as surgical and neurovascular. Emerging markets grew 9% or 13%, when excluding Russia given the sanctions. We had low-20s growth in the Middle East and Africa, high-teens growth in South Asia, mid-teens growth in Southeast Asia, and low-double-digit growth in Latin America. China grew high-single-digits, as some of the VBP that we expected was delayed until later in the fiscal year. While our adjusted gross and operating margins declined in the quarter, both were ahead of expectations. With gross margin, about a third of the year-over-year change was due to currency, and the remainder was driven by inflation. And our adjusted op margin decline was entirely driven by currency. On a constant currency basis, it increased 40 basis points. We're executing to implement efficiencies in our expense structure, and you can see this in the 90 basis point improvement in SG&A. Below the operating margin line, we benefited from higher global interest rates on our investments, and this was partially offset by a higher-than-expected tax rate, mainly due to jurisdictional mix of profits, as well as a lower benefit from stock-based compensation. Turning to capital allocation, we continue to prioritize investments and innovation to fuel and sustain our long-term growth. We're disproportionately investing in some of the fastest growth markets in medtech. And we have a long-standing track record of returning capital to our shareholders, primarily through our strong and growing dividend. And to the extent that we don't find high growth, high return, tuck in M&A we would expect to return additional capital to our shareholders by retiring shares. Now turning to our guidance. Given our second quarter outperformance and continued strength in our underlying fundamentals, we're raising our full-year guidance today on both the top and the bottom line. We expect fiscal \u201824 organic revenue growth of 4.75%, an increase from the prior 4.5%. For the third quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 4.5%. And while the impact of currency is fluid, based on recent rates, foreign currency would have an unfavorable impact on full-year revenue of $100 million to $200 million, including an unfavorable impact of $0 million to $50 million in the third quarter. On a comp-adjusted basis, our third quarter guidance represents acceleration from the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter, as we're ramping a number of recent product launches in the back half of the year. In diabetes, we're projecting the U.S. to return to growth in the second-half of the year on the continued adoption of 780G and the associated CGM and consumable sales. In Medical Surgical, we have the continued rollout of the Hugo surgical robot and GI Genius. In Neuroscience, there's our AiBLE ecosystem in spine, our inceptive closed loop pain stem device in Europe, and we're awaiting FDA approval for both Inceptiv and our Percept RCDBS device. In Cardiovascular, we're ramping our TAVR and PFA launches in Europe, starting the rollout of EV-ICD in the U.S. and Europe, and we are now starting our Ardian sales in the U.S. This all gives us confidence in the continued durability of our top-line growth. Moving down the P&L, our margins this year continue to reflect the impact of currency and inflation. And some of the volume-based procurement tenders in China that were expected in the first-half have shifted to later in the year. That said, we're focused on continuing to drive efficiencies in our expense base, and we've got our global operations and supply chains centralized to take advantage of our scale. As you know, stabilizing our margins and then improving from there remains a top priority. On the bottom line, we're raising our fiscal \u201824 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.13 to $5.19, an increase from the prior range of $5.08 to $5.16. While we expect FX and tax to be a few pennies more unfavorable in the second-half, we are pleased with the momentum we have demonstrated and our pipeline from here. For the third quarter, we expect EPS of $1.25 to $1.27 and on foreign currency, based on recent rates, we're seeing an unfavorable impact of 6% on full-year EPS, including an unfavorable 5% impact in the third quarter. Before sending it back to Geoff, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I want to extend my gratitude to our 95,000 employees around the world, who come to work every day to deliver on our mission. You all play important roles in alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for two patients every second, which makes this world a far better place. Back to you, Geoff. Geoff Martha : Okay, thank you, Karen. Now I know GLP-1s have been on your mind, as the promise of these drugs has certainly had an outsized impact on medtech stocks, including ours, over the past four months. So I thought it would be helpful to share with you our view on their potential impact on our markets. Now, GLP-1s are clearly an exciting class of drugs for patients, and the select data presented at AHA suggests the potential for a large market. That said, the key takeaway from our analysis is that outside of a modest impact on the bariatric surgery market, which we believe will be temporary, we don't see these drugs impacting Medtronic\u2019s growth outlook, even long-term. This expectation is based on our extensive, science-based work. Like many of you, we've modeled potential uptake and impact based on epidemiology, based on what we've seen historically with other drugs, and based on the relative risk reductions and adherence rates seen in select. So given the select results showed smaller impacts on the more obese patients, we believe that bariatric surgery will remain the gold standard for addressing obesity. We also know that many of the patients that try these drugs do not stay on them for more than a year, likely due to durability, side effects, or affordability, which creates opportunities for new patients to consider surgery. For these reasons, we believe the current headwinds on U.S. bariatric procedures will stabilize over the next several quarters and return to growth by calendar year 2025. And this is modest and manageable within our broader diversified surgical business. Now with diabetes, our customers are primarily Type I, with only 10% of our installed base in Type II insulin-dependent patients. We do expect growth in our Type II business going forward, but Type II pump penetration rates are so low that even using aggressive GLP-1 modeling assumptions, we don't see any meaningful change in our diabetes growth outlook through 2030. Now we'd be happy to discuss this in more detail in Q&A, including our view on the select trial and its potential implications for medtech. Now Before we go to the analyst questions, I'd like to close with a few brief concluding thoughts on our progress. You're seeing in our results that many of the challenges that have held back our growth have largely been mitigated, whether that's diabetes, China, or the issues in our supply chain. And we've established a track record of delivering durable mid-single-digit revenue growth, which we expect to continue in the back half of the fiscal year. We have some really compelling product approvals that drive our growth not only in the back half, but for years to come. There's been a number of things that have happened recently, big things. In the last four weeks in particular, with our TAVR data that gives us just such an advantage in the marketplace, new product approvals like EV-ICD, geographic and indication expansions. And last Friday, we got Ardian approval. This opens up a multi-billion dollar market opportunity for us. And with over 1 billion people worldwide with hypertension, the opportunity is massive. In fact, just 1% penetration of the target market represents over $1 billion of revenue. So we're focused on executing to deliver the top line. And at the same time, we're taking action to run our businesses more efficiently to counter the impacts that inflation and currency are having on our margins. And we've been implementing an extensive transformation to improve the durability of our growth. We've changed our operating model, brought in extensive new leadership, increased capital allocation to our highest growth opportunities, and are implementing a culture based on execution, speed and playing to win. And now we're positioning the company to take advantage of our scale in areas of operations and supply chain, core technology, and how we go to market with large customers around the globe. You're already seeing results from this today. And as we go forward, our focus is on translating the durable revenue growth that we've established into durable earnings power. This is a winning formula for creating value for shareholders and we are laser focused on making that happen. Now with that let's move to Q&A where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question. A - Brad Welnick : [Operator Instructions] Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Jeff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of the Diabetes; Mike Marinaro, EVP and President of the Surgical & Endoscopy businesses; Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular portfolio; Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience portfolio; and Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical portfolio. [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Oh, great. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the question. Maybe, I'll ask, both of them upfront. The first, Geoff, you talked about how most of the headwinds are largely mitigated. I look at the guidance implied in the second-half of the year, it's a point of growth or so below the first-half. So maybe just talk about how we should think about the lower growth in the second-half versus the first-half and the reasons for that? And then part b, if I look to 2025 or fiscal year \u201825, The Street has been pretty close to your long range plan of 5% plus on the top and 8% plus on the bottom. Is that the right way to think about next year? Are there any headwinds or tailwinds we should be thinking about here like potential dilution from the monitoring business? Just want to try and get Street numbers, correct as we head into year-end? Thanks so much. Geoff Martha : Sure. Well, let me kick it off, and I'll -- thanks for the questions, Robbie, I'll kick it off and then hand it over to Karen. In terms of the headwinds being mitigated, what I'd say is the markets are pretty stable, especially relative to what we've seen over the last couple of years, with procedures, I think, back to normal growth and the staff -- in the staffing issues that are -- that were hurting the procedural growth or I think more or less under control. Pricing has been stable, we're - we can talk China later, we're working through the China VBP, but that's largely behind us. Still a little bit more to go, but largely behind us. So yes, and then our own internal, the changes to our global operations and supply chain, that was a big one for us and has been a big one. And we're seeing our teams perform much better. And like I said, we're turning that into a strength for us, a strategic long-term strength, and our supplies in a much better situation. So that's -- and then then, of course our pipeline is coming in, and I'm sure we'll get into that in the call here with a lot of new approvals plus the prior approvals that we're starting to launch, and they're having meaningful uptake. So there's where the optimism is. In terms of how to think about the back half versus the first-half and then getting into FY \u201825, I'll turn that over to Karen. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Geoff and Robbie. So just on the back half, Robbie, our comps do get a little tougher as you know, but we've got a really strong innovation pipeline that we talked about. And that\u2019s driving growth acceleration actually from the first-half to the second-half. We\u2019ve got our diabetes business returning to growth in the second-half, we talked about our extensive pipeline, EV-ICD, PFA, Hugo, Evolut FX,. and now the Ardian approval. And so we're confident in this growth acceleration, and we're confident that, that's going to continue beyond the back half of next year. We think about FY \u201825, you know, it's still early. We have two quarters left in this fiscal year, and we're laser focused on delivering the rest of this year. We're also at the beginning of our planning process, so we're not ready to give specifics. But I do know that all of you are working on your calendar year models for our competitors. So happy to give you some perspective based on what we know today and what we're thinking about. And I'll start with revenue, because we've been focused on consistently delivering that mid-single-digit revenue growth, and you've seen us do that for four quarters now. Our new full-year guide for this fiscal year is 4.75%. And as I mentioned, we've got the strength of those numerous product approvals in big markets that are launching around the world to help drive our back half growth. And, obviously, we're confident that strength will continue into next year and beyond. On margins and down the P&L, there are some puts and takes. We've got inflation stabilizing a bit, but it's still higher than historical, but again, it's stabilizing. Currency is dynamic, and as you know, the U.S. dollar's been strong. So we're likely facing a headwind from FX, but we'll see how that shakes out. Global Tax Reform will likely be a headwind. But as always, we're focused on driving offsets everywhere that we can. Geoff talked about it, we've made progress on cost of goods sold and cost out, starting with centralizing our global ops team. We have work to do, but those teams now have tangible programs in place to drive that work. And we'll continue to drive pricing as an important lever. We've built a new muscle on pricing, and our focus is to keep it strong. We've been working hard on controlling expenses, and that includes maintaining discipline on our largest driver of our expense, which is our headcount. So I hope that gives you some color on just the puts and takes. But to summarize, I'll remind you what hasn't changed? And that's our long range commitment of driving durable mid-single-digit top growth, of driving leverage down the P&L, of driving a strong free cash conversion and a growing dividend, which all combined ultimately, delivers a double-digit total shareholder return. What has changed though is our progress toward that commitment. You've already seen us at mid-single-digit top line. We've talked about the strong pipeline that gives us confidence in its durability. And, obviously, we've talked about the programs we have in place. Whether it's in headcount management, COGS, cost down, pricing discipline, and they're all levers to help us offset the headwinds and over time, establish that same durability on the bottom line. Robbie Marcus : Thank you. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Robbie. We'll take the next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, everybody. Congrats on a good quarter. Karen, just to sum up all those comments on FY \u201924. I heard the leverage down the P&L comment. It sounds like based on what we know today, unless there's some kind of major surprise, there's still a good ability for -- there to be enough offsets to drive EPS growth faster than revenue growth. Just want to kind of make sure that's a fair comment? And then and, Geoff, I did want to follow-up on your thoughts on GLP-1s, post the Select trial. First, if there's any color you'd add on, on the Select trial and the cardio endpoints in diabetes prevention that maybe didn't mention in the prepared remarks? Karen Parkhill : Yes. Travis, thanks for the question. Clearly, next year and beyond, we're focused on driving that leverage down the P&L that I talked about. And, obviously, when you drive leverage, it's your bottom line's faster than your top line. But at this stage, it's still early. We're at the beginning of our planning process, and we're going to give you more on FY \u201825 as we are ready to guide. Geoff Martha : Hey, Travis. Good to hear from you. You know, on GLP-1s so, you know, so first of all, I just want to make it clear that, like, we see that it's an exciting class of drugs with a large opportunity. And I'm sure just like you, you know, I talked to many patients that are benefiting from these drugs, from a weight perspective, from mental health perspective, it's pretty amazing. You know, that being said, we've done a lot of work, and outside of the near-term temporary impact on bariatric surgery market we don't see these drugs impacting our growth outlook, even in the long-term. And then and on the bariatric piece, that as we mentioned, it's a small part of our revenue, low-single-digits, and the rate of decline has stabilized there, and I think we see that, that coming back here in the coming year even. So, we did do a lot of work here, and I'm going to you know, it was, like I said, science based and looking at epidemiology and really digging into Select. And what we do have on the call here, our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Laura Mauri, and I thought I'd, you know, maybe kind of call her in here, bring in a relief picture here on that question to talk a little bit more about Select and kind of what we're seeing out of that. So, Laura, can you can you chime in here? Laura Mauri : Sure. Thanks, Geoff. Yes, Travis, the Select trial results that were presented at AHA gave us a lot more detail beyond the top line that we heard about back in August to really look at the endpoints and look at the drug adherence, understand the details of the trial results. And, you know, as you as you know, these were obese patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. And as Geoff said, this is a very important advance for this patient population. But the results didn't change our overall impression that there will be a negligible effect on the growth of cardiovascular procedure volumes. And that's based on a couple of things that we saw in the detailed results. First, the number needed to treat was much higher, and that means it's setting a higher bar for treatment, compared with other things that are used in guidelines. And then we were -- we saw that there was a lack of effect on cardiovascular death and that's something that if it had been present, would have spurred more adoption, and the lack of that is important because it will not spur the wide adoption and coverage, that we might have been, looking at if that had been positive. And then, you know, the only effect on the composite endpoint was non-fatal MI, not stroke, or cardiovascular death as I mentioned. And as you know, the discontinuation rates we're in nearly a third of patients due to the nausea and GI side effects. And, clearly, we know from practice that rates of adherence are even lower, and that results in lower treatment effects. And then there were a couple of interesting findings in the trial. You know, as Geoff mentioned earlier, the higher BMI population didn't seem to have as much benefit, and there was no significant treatment effect in the North American subgroup, which is certainly something that, I think we'll want to understand better going forward. So using a range of assumptions, we updated our models across the major cardiovascular procedures, and the inputs to that, we're looking at U.S. procedure volume, across different procedure areas, using data on the prevalence of obesity for each of these procedure populations. And then a range of penetration adherence assumptions all the way up to including, what we've seen over time with statins, which is, you know, are really well-tolerated and just freely available and part of guidelines for the past 30-years. And then we also input the, obviously, the risk reduction seen in each the endpoints from the Select trial or literature based on weight loss to look at treatment effects. And the bottom line is that the reduction to TAM growth, over the next 10 to 30 years is really negligible on the cardiovascular procedure outlook. I think it's really important to also note what this analysis doesn't include, and that's the that there will probably be offsets in the markets that are really underpenetrated or new, like PFA or Ardian, because of the growth, the rapid growth in those areas. And then there's in fact potential upside for patients and procedure growth, because of the potentially longer survival or lower BMI that makes a greater funnel of patients eligible for cardiovascular procedures. So I'll pass it back to Geoff, I know there was a question as well, about the effect on hemoglobin A1C. Travis Steed : Yes. Well, what thank you, Laura. You know, and while we're on the topic, maybe on that one. I mean, Q -- any comments on diabetes relative to GLP-1? Que Dallara : Yes. I mean, we, like, well, Laura mentioned, we spent quite a bit of time studying this, and I think there's some evidence from Select that would say, there may be a slowdown, in the prediabetic population towards insulin, dependency, and maybe some in Type II will come off insulin, but we believe this number to be very small and more than offset by the fact that there is low penetration of Type II, using AID. And the fact that when you look at the funnel of 3 million to 4 million who require basal insulin with 25 million non-insulin Type IIs, as well as the over a 100 million pre-diabetic population. It doesn't changed our point of view on the long-term, smart size of the market as well as the growth rates. And as Geoff mentioned, at the beginning, the majority of our business, more than 90%, is in Type I. And so, you know, we remain pretty optimistic about, the growth and market profile in diabetes. Geoff Martha : Alright. Thanks, Que. I mean so I mean, Travis and others, I mean, as you can see, you know, beyond the fact that the areas that we get questions on Type II intensive, hypertension, AFIB, obesity, besides the fact, these are just woefully underpenetrated from a medtech perspective, we've done all the analysis that, you know, Laura and Que just gave you the tip of the iceberg of. And that's why, you know, we're -- we feel strongly that, we don't see these drugs impacting medtronic's growth, medium or long-term. So I hope that answers your question and then some. Travis Steed : Yes. Super thorough answer. Thanks a lot. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Travis. Next question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick : We'll take the next question from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo Securities. Larry, please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two product questions for me. One for Sean on Ardian congratulations. Don, can you talk about the ASP, you know, the reimbursement pathway and the ramp? And for Brett, you know, the slides talked about completing the six month primary endpoint on the pivotal TITAN 2, IT&S trial. Does FDA want 12 month data? Could you talk about the form factor here? And how you see IT&S being positioned relative to sacral neuromodulation? Thank you. Geoff Martha : Well, Larry, it's Geoff. Good to hear from you, and thanks for the question. On, before I turn it over to Sean on Ardian, I just -- I do want to just say, look congratulate the team, here at in the cardiovascular space of medtronic and leaders passed, I mean, this has been that have been involved. This has been a long journey, and we are really, really, excited about the approval. You know, we have a lot of data here in our RCTs. You know, we consistently saw, a mean 9 millimeters to 10 millimeters of mercury absolute office blood pressure drops at the initial primary endpoints, in this case of three, six months, and actually more in the real world setting and additional drops over time from these primary, assessments. So, you know, this is a game changer and look this is compelling as the data is and as much as we have. It doesn't even tell the whole story. I mean, you talk to physicians out there that are involved in our trials, and the excitement's palpable in patients. Here, we have a number of patients been on this for years, and talking to them and how it's changed their life. And we're actually having a patient come in and talk to the entire company here in a couple weeks. It's very exciting. And so a big opportunity for patients, and a real big opportunity for us too. And so getting into some of the specifics, you asked about reimbursement. I'll turn that over to Sean, and then we can go to Brett to talk about -- I believe you're asking about the tibial opportunity and but why don't we start with Sean? Sean Salmon : Larry, thanks for the question. As you know, the ramp is going to be highly gated by reimbursement, and we've been working that in parallel with the regulatory approval all along. We see the payer split to be roughly 50 :50 between Medicare and commercial payers of private insurance, and we've been, of course, pursuing both local and national, coverage determinations from Medicare. And that's an important input into the private payer decisions that will happen state-by-state and payer-by-payer. We've been in contact with those private payers, the largest ones, certainly. And the response so far has been very open and willing to engage with us to understand our data. And what's particularly of interest to them is the long-term data, which is atypical for a new therapy like this to have thousands of patients out three years from the therapy. So that's encouraging. Of course, you know, the Medicare population is the most important for us and to your question, that there are these alternative pathways that have been established by Medicare for temporary add-on payments, both in the inpatient setting with NTAP or the new technology add-on payment, as well as in that outpatient setting for transitional pass through payments or TPP. And given that the simplicity spiral system is a point through device designation. We will avail ourselves to those pathways for approval, over that two and three year period as we work to establish more permanent, reimbursement for like a national coverage determination. On that front, there is this T-Set pathway or the transitional coverage for emerging therapies that we're going to avail ourselves to. It's not finalized yet. We look forward to, that ruling coming out. We've seen the commentary has been largely, very, very positive along the way and in line with what we had been suggesting both to CMS and the Biden administration as well as other stakeholders along the way. And of course, CMS is also considering other refinements to covers with evidence development programs that we've used successfully as we've established many, many therapies as you know, including TAVR, Micra, ICD, CRT devices over time and we'll avail ourselves to those as well. So rest assured, we're working hard on reimbursement. It's really critical for the ramp of this technology, and we're getting a degree reception so far. Geoff Martha : Okay. Thanks, Sean. Brett, you want to answer part two here? Brett Wall : Yes, absolutely. Larry, good to hear your voice. Thanks for the question. The TITAN 2 study, was a six month follow-up, with the actual study design, and we will follow those patients for 24 months. So we'll be following, those patients that have, additional data as well. The form factor is about 2.8 cubic centimeters, really about the size of roughly half a stick of gum and it fits, in the ankle same place for everyone. This opens up a significant patient population. There's over 4 million people in the United States, that have discontinued their dual drug therapy or failed two drugs, and they are now receiving incontinence devices at home, adult incontinence products as opposed to seeking additional therapy. This is a 15 minute procedure. We now have established Category 3 reimbursement, and we'll be utilizing that to further, develop out the reimbursement profile. This particular product and technology opens up a substantial population that is not seeking help or seeking a therapy right now. We're in a modular submission. We'll be submitting the data here shortly, and this is an exciting new technology that opens up this field and will contribute to its ongoing growth. Larry Biegelsen : Okay. Thanks, Brett. Geoff Martha : Yes. Thanks, Brett and thanks, Larry. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take the next question, please Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. Hi, Geoff. Thanks for taking the question. I had two product-related questions here. First one, just at a high level, right? You had three pretty meaningful product approvals in the past few months between EV-ICD, PFA and your RDN approval, right? You're already doing mid-singles. With all of these incremental growth drivers coming in, is that now a mid-single plus? I'm just curious how you're thinking about this new product opportunities. Geoff Martha : Well, thanks for the question, Vijay, and thanks for pointing out the robust nature of the approvals. And these are really, we believe, and as you saw in the commentary, unquestionably differentiated products in large markets and growing markets that we have a high confidence in. And this gets to our commitment to make this growth durable. And as we've seen over the last couple of years, whether it be market conditions or internal things, which I am -- we are working so hard to make sure these internal boogie men disappear through changing our fundamentals, this is the -- this breadth of approvals in these high-growth markets, I believe, will help me for the first time sleep well. Because it gives you the durability that we're talking about in that revenue number, which is so important. Everything flows from there. So at this point, before we start talking about plus, I just want to make sure that we are very durable and reliable mid-single-digit growers in different types of environments, good and less good. And then we can flow from there about leverage on the P&L and things like that. So that's my overview on those three -- on the pipeline in general. Vijay Kumar : And maybe my related product question here, perhaps for Mike on robotics here. You mentioned installed base went up in Europe. Any sense on what the size of that installed base is? In this U.S. clinical trial, you said it's on plan. But any sense and when this trial might end, perhaps timing for an FDA approval? Mike Marinaro : So thanks for the question, Vijay. First, we will continue -- we are continuing forward with our installs, have added to the installed base. We're not quoting numbers of installations at this time, but we are increasing on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Our procedure volume is picking up on a quarter-on-quarter basis as we work through availability of our instruments and then getting the system into the U.S. will really start to see acceleration of our program. Geoff commented and you just noted that the EXPAND URO study is on track, and we're very excited in speaking with our investigators there, and they're enthusiastic about the product and the program. And so that continues forward. We're not going to give time lines of U.S. approval for that, but I will tell you it's proceeding according to plan. And then as Geoff noted, we're very excited about the hernia IDE approval, which allows us to take a big step in the general surgery more quickly than we had anticipated and to start to engage the general surgeons with Hugo here in the United States in a segment where we are very active today. Of course, we have a large business and sales channel in the area of hernia repair. There's a real hunger for capacity and a growing volume there in hernia in the United States. And so now running these IDEs in parallel will allow us to start to really pick up momentum as we contemplate the entry into the U.S. market. So we are on plan. I'm not giving specific dates for approval yet, but also very excited about the opportunity to move into general surgery and in with the general surgeon with this hernia IDE approval. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s it. Thanks, guys. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Mike. I mean, I know there's a lot of interest in this. And look, I just emphasize Mike's comments. Step one was to have a robot that has the capabilities and strong physician acceptance. And we feel strongly that we have that. And now we're building up our experience primarily in Europe and of operating of the robot out in the wild and then really, as Mike mentioned, building out that instrument portfolio and executing on the U.S. trial so that we can launch in the U.S. That will be between the U.S. and some new instruments that will really drive a lot of growth here. So anyway, more to come on that. But thanks for the question, Vijay. Ryan Weispfenning : Yes, thanks, Vijay. Next question, please Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Kristen Stewart with CL King. Kristen, please go ahead. Kristen Stewart : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering if you could provide any updates on the patient monitoring respiratory interventions spin? Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Kristen, for the question. We're continuing to work on the separation of that and our focus through all of it is to maximize shareholder value. No big updates. Kristen Stewart : Perfect. Thanks very much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Kristen. Next question, please. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Matt O'Brien at Piper Sandler. Matt, please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Brien: Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Hey could you guys hear me? Ryan Weispfenning : Yes, we can hear you, Matt. Matt O\u2019Brien: Yes, okay. Thank you. So just one question, Geoff, for you specifically. It's -- you're a $30-plus billion revenue company but you talked about more tuck-in acquisitions historically. Just given your size, given the strength in terms of new product flow, I'm just wondering if now is the time to be more aggressive from an M&A perspective just given the pullback that we've seen in some of these on the public company side of things, just to be able to do a bigger deal to really solidify your growth algorithm going forward. Is now the time to be more aggressive? Are you more amenable to doing bigger deals now, just given strong balance sheet, kind of got the operating model together, et cetera? Thank you. Geoff Martha : Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. And yes, clearly, I think you're seeing asset prices come down. And it's a tough operating environment. I think they're going to continue to come down, in the mid-cap space in particular and below. And we definitely have the capabilities, as you pointed out, to do bigger deals. All that being said, our focus still is on tuck-ins. And we've got a lot of big organic -- or now organic programs between just Ardian, the robot, PFA, diabetes, I mean, the list goes on. There's a lot of big organic pipeline going up against these high-growth markets that we're really focused on. And I would augment that with the appropriate tuck-ins. So I'm not going to -- I don't think we're really focused on, and we're not going to signal that we're focused on any kind of bigger deals at this point. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay, thanks, Matt. I think we have time. I know we're running a little bit long, but let's take two more questions, please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Rich Newitter at Truist. Rick, please go ahead. Rich Newitter : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just on -- we saw just more broadly in medtech a little bit of seasonality or weaker, I think, third quarter for a number of your competitors play out. Just wondering if you could comment on the trend throughout the quarter? Was August unseasonally, kind of, weaker than what you would have thought? And what's been the normal pickup? Is it stronger-than-expected into the 4Q, especially if you could talk about kind of exit trends from September into October? Thank you. Geoff Martha : Sure. Thanks for the question, Rich. I'm going to ask Karen to answer that one. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Rich. I would say we saw strength throughout the second quarter no matter what month you looked at. And I think that's driven in part by just the strength of our product offering. When we look at the first few weeks of this quarter and how that's been trending, it's been trending well. We're tracking to the expectations that we set in our guidance at this stage. Rich Newitter : Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Rich. We\u2019ll take the lasty question, please Brad. Brad Welnick : Final question comes from Shagun Singh from RBC Capital Markets. Shagun, please go ahead. Shagun Singh : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Just, I guess, a follow-up on Hugo. One of your competitors recently showcased their surgical robot that had an invisible design and twin motion capabilities. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on the competitive landscape? Do you see it as a rising tide? Or just how do you think about your technology offering versus competition? And then I was just wondering if it's possible to get any more specific color on how October and November is shaping out? Thank you for taking the questions. Geoff Martha : Well, I'll ask -- thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Mike to take the Hugo question and I'll follow-up on that one. Mike Marinaro : Thanks, Shagun. So we were very interested to see the latest developments from our competitor here relative to their program. And I'll say that they were about as expected no surprises there. We continue to be very excited and optimistic about the differentiation of our program with an open console, with a modular design with the ability to have flexibility in terms of location or site of care, which is highly differentiated from what we heard there in their discussions, as well as what we see in the market today. And so we see that differentiation continue and the reasons that our customers like Hugo to continue to be differentiated reasons. More broadly speaking, though, the good news is that there continues to be just real interest in expanding the penetration of robotics across multiple fields in surgery. And we're seeing continued increase in procedural volumes on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And so it's good news for the field as that interest grows. So we're well positioned and the field continues to expand, which is a good story for Medtronic. Geoff Martha : Yes, and just to build on that, I mean, we talked about -- we call it robotics, but I would argue it's broader than that. And this isn't the first time we're out to change the dynamics of an entire market. That's what we're doing in the spine market right now. And it goes beyond robotics. It gets into interoperative imaging or visualization navigation, presurgical, AI-based planning. And like with -- and Mike's role here with Hugo, we've got Touch Surgery Enterprise, which is a leading digital platform with AI-driven digital platform. And like you're seeing in spine that's played out over the last couple of years, it's changing the competitive dynamics or what's important in the marketplace for our physicians and even patients. And you're seeing the impact as what you're seeing in the spine market as many competitors. It takes a lot of expertise. It takes a lot of capital to make this happen. And you're seeing competitors fall by the wayside. And I know there's been a big one here recently with NuVasive and Globus coming together, and we'll see how that plays out. But I believe we've demonstrated an ability to do this. And this is the kind of experience. And I know we're up against a big competitor in Intuitive in the surgical space, but we believe we've got a lot to offer here. And we are going to drive a change in how people think about the space and the competitive dynamics, and we're really confident and excited about that. So with that, I think we'll bring the call to close. Thanks for sticking with us a little longer. And I really appreciate the questions and the support and continued interest in Medtronic. And we look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our Q3 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Tuesday, February 20. With that, thanks for joining us today. And for those in the U.S., I'd like to wish you and your families a very happy Thanksgiving this week and enjoy the holiday and stay safe. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : [Video Presentation] Good morning and welcome to Minnesota, where we finally have some snow. I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. And I appreciate that you're joining us this morning for our Fiscal '24 Third Quarter Video Earnings Webcast. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 26th, 2024, and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the Executive VPs covering our segments will join us. And we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements. And actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC. And we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and third quarter revenue in the current and prior year reported as other, which stems from prior business separations. There were no acquisitions made in the last four quarters, that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the second quarter of fiscal '24 and are made on an as-reported basis. And all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue-share in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth calendar quarter of 2022, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter. [Video Presentation] Geoff Martha : Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our momentum and solid execution continued this quarter as we establish a track-record of consistently delivering mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Diabetes took another step forward with double-digit growth supported by a return to growth in the US. I'd also note that particular strength we saw in multiple businesses like Core Spine, Cardiac Surgery, Structural Heart and Cardiac Pacing. And we had strong growth across International markets as we expand access to our innovative healthcare technologies all around the globe. At the same time, we've had a rapid cadence of new product approvals and we're continuing to differentially invest in our pipeline of highest growth opportunities. We're advancing innovative core technologies like robotics, AI and closed-loop systems. And with five AI products already FDA approved, we're leading the way in bringing the tech into MedTech. We also continue to make progress on our comprehensive transformation of the company. We're incorporating a performance driven culture that's based on execution, speed and playing to win. And we're leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies. So when you look at our financials this quarter, you're seeing the early results of our focus on restoring earnings power and converting our earnings into strong cash-flow, and we're using that cash to both invest in high-return opportunities and return value to our shareholders. So we're executing and we're delivering, and we expect to continue over the coming quarters and years given our momentum. Our ongoing transformation, our breakthrough innovation, our exposure to strong secular growth markets and our numerous catalysts across the business. Now, before I get into the details of our Q3 results, I do want to mention that we provided a Portfolio Management update this morning on our patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses. After a comprehensive review, we have decided to exit our unprofitable ventilator product line. And retain and bring together our remaining PMRI businesses into one business, which we're calling acute-care and monitoring. Now we've determined, it is in the best interest of Medtronic, its stakeholders, the ACM business both near and long-term to exit vents because of its increasing unprofitability and market preference shift to lower acuity ventilators. Now as we exit vents, I want to recognize the strong legacy of our business and the Puritan Bennett brand. And we're committed to serving the needs of our customers and honoring our ventilator service contracts. And I also want to thank the employees in our ventilator business, who played an incredible role during the pandemic to dramatically expand production to get ventilators to the communities around the world that needed them. And while we exit, we do believe that existing manufacturers can meet the customer demand for new ventilators going forward. Now at the same time, we decided to retain and refocus the remaining PMRI businesses. Three main factors have driven this decision. First, we have strong conviction in our ability to lead and drive growth in acute-care and monitoring, given our improved competitive position. And our ability to properly fund this business with savings from exiting vents. Second, the importance of data in this space is changing rapidly. It's becoming the basis of innovation. And this fact further improves our competitive differentiation. And lastly, as a company more broadly, we continue to prioritize profitable, innovation-driven growth and category leadership and ACM can deliver both. That does not mean we will shy away from additional portfolio moves going forward. But the bar is high for any strategic activity that dilutes our focus on our profit and growth. So when you take these decisions together, we're able to provide increased investment for acute-care and monitoring, using the savings from vents and bringing two businesses together, all without creating dilution to our P&L. Now let's get into the details behind our Q3 results. We continue to look at our portfolio in three categories, established market leaders, synergistic and highest-growth businesses. In this quarter all three grew in line with our expected growth algorithm. Our established market leader and synergistic businesses grew mid-single-digits, while our highest growth businesses posted high-single-digit growth and we expect their contribution to our overall growth to further accelerate in the quarters ahead. Now, looking first at the established market leaders, a combined they made up just under half of our revenue and grew 4%. Starting with Cranial & Spinal Technologies. We're driving consistent above-market growth on the continued adoption of our AiBLE ecosystem. CST delivered high-single-digit growth in Core Spine, mid-teens growth in biologics and high-single-digit growth in enabling technology. We had strong double-digit unit growth in StealthStation navigation, O-arm Imaging and Mazor robotic systems. A leading indicator for future growth in this business. We also continue to see strong adoption of UNiD Adaptive Spine Intelligence, our integrated AI-based surgical planning solution. Now with AiBLE, we're offering a complete robust ecosystem of enabling technologies and associated implants for spine surgeons. Our global footprint, which includes over 10,000 systems is over four times greater than the nearest competitor. And with this scale and extensive and rapidly increasing installed-base, we're transforming the spine industry, we are leading the way. As more surgeons adopt our integrated spine technologies and in an environment where there is disruption from consolidation, we're attracting the best sales teams to Medtronic to grow and expand our business. Next in surgical, we grew 3%, our Wound Management business won share growing in the high-teens on the strength of our V-Loc barbed sutures. We also had solid mid-single-digit growth in hernia products, as we won share in synthetic permanent mesh with our ProGrip platform. And as expected, our surgical growth continue to have a modest impact from declines in bariatric surgery. Now we still believe this impact will be temporary as more patients become eligible for surgery, and as patients seek a more permanent treatment to weightloss. To wrap up our established market leaders, Cardiac Rhythm also grew 3%, driven by high-single-digit growth in cardiac pacing, our micro leadless pacemakers continued to post strong results growing 15% driven by the launch of our next-generation Micra AV2 and VR2 devices. We're also benefiting from the adoption of conduction system pacing, an alternative to traditional single or dual chamber pacing. Our 38-30 lead the only one on the market approved for conduction system pacing, continue to grow strong double-digits. In CRM, we also began training and the limited launch of our Aurora EV-ICD. We expect the EV-ICD to reaccelerate our Defibrillation Solutions growth in the coming quarters. As I've shared with you in the past, Aurora is a game-changer in the ICD space. It delivers the benefits of a traditional ICD including similar-size, longevity and pacing features. But without the leads in the harder veins, and these benefits can be realized with one device and only one implant procedure. We expect our advantages will not only displace the competitor's device, we will expand the population far beyond the existing segment and be a strong growth driver for CRM. Now turning to our synergistic businesses, combined they grew mid-single-digits in Q3. And I'll highlight some of the drivers here. Let's start with Aortic which grew 13% on supply recovery and continued momentum of our Endurant AAA franchise. Cardiac Surgery grew 10% driven by strength in Perfusion and Cannula and ECLS Oxygenators, given competitor quality issues and the strong sales in international markets of our Avalus surgical valve. Coronary grew 7%, driven by double-digit growth in both guide catheters and balloons. And we increased our drug-eluting stent share in the US and in Europe on the continued rollout of our Onyx Frontier drug-eluting stent. Now turning to businesses in our highest-growth markets. As I mentioned earlier, together these businesses grew in the high-single-digits this quarter, and we expect their contribution to our growth to accelerate going forward. Now diabetes led the way, growing double-digits on the global adoption of our game-changing MiniMed 780G system. We're seeing strong sequential momentum, growing 5% over the prior quarter. Our customer base is growing sequentially and we're driving more revenue per customer. In the US, we not only returned to growth, we grew mid-single-digits, driven by nearly 50% revenue growth and insulin pumps. We doubled our new users year-over-year, attracting those on multiple daily injection as well as users of competitor systems. Users are choosing 780G for the outcomes it delivers. With intensive insulin users, these outcomes matter. And the 780G is highly differentiated. It's the only AID system to automatically adjust and correct sugars every five minutes. It offers flexible glucose targets as low as 100, and features are proprietary meal detection technology. This leads to high time and range for users. And this type of glycemic control is coming with less effort and burden. As users realize the relief that comes from spending more time in automation with our SmartGuard technology. It's worth pointing out that in a recent third-party survey of nearly 2,000 US diabetes pump users, the 780G scored number-one in overall pump satisfaction, among Type 1 CGM users our Guardian 4 Sensor mirrored competitor sensors in overall satisfaction. And during the quarter, we secured CE Mark for our Simplera Sync sensor for use with the 780G, and we look to begin the limited release this spring. And in US, we're planning to submit the 780G with Simplera Sync to the FDA in the first half of this calendar year. Simplera Sync is half the size of our current sensor. It has a disposable design and is much easier to put on. Now we've been driving the diabetes turnaround for some time, and I got to tell you it certainly feels really good to return to double-digit growth. But we're not finished here, there is definitely more work to be done as we work to bring to market an even more robust ecosystem of differentiated technology for people living with diabetes, including next-generation durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps sensors and algorithms. And as the intensive insulin management space moves to using smart dosing through either AID or Smart MDI, we expect an acceleration in the growth contribution from our diabetes business. Now turning to Cardiac Ablation Solutions, we delivered 11% growth in International markets, including 9% growth in Western Europe. Our strong International growth as well as our overall performance continues to be driven by our leading Arctic Front cryo solution as Pulsed Field Ablation is still in the early stages. We are seeing though a lot of enthusiasm in the market for our PFA products. In Europe, we're the only company with PFA offerings for both the single shot and the focal segments. And in single shot, we have now started the limited market release of our PulseSelect PFA system here in fiscal Q4. And we're seeing very efficient procedures, and after just a couple of cases. And so the learning curve is really short. The catheter handling and maneuverability has been excellent due to its small shaft and our custom 10Fr bidirectional sheath. Clinicians are also reporting no noticeable muscle contraction with our PFA product, which is beneficial for patient experience. In focal, we continue to ramp manufacturing of the Affera Mapping System and Sphere9 catheter and remain in limited market release in Europe. Sphere9 is the only catheter that can perform both pulsed field ablation and radiofrequency ablation and high-density mapping. It's really an all-in-one catheter. In the US, our CAS business declined in the quarter. We faced the first full quarter of competition in the cryoablation space, which is a space we created and had been the only player. In addition, many customers actually held back purchases as they awaited the launch of our PulseSelect PFA catheter, which is now commercially available. We do expect to improve from here as we roll-out the recently approved next-generation Nitron CryoConsole and PulseSelect, the only PFA catheter FDA-approved for both paroxysmal and persistent AF. And in addition to the European feedback, clinicians have consistently commented on how well it's visualized and how easily it connects to their mapping system. So, we're also making progress in bringing our Affera Mapping System and Sphere9 catheter to the US. With the last patient follow up in our SPHERE Per-AF Pivotal Trial now completed. We expect to see the results at a medical meeting in the first half of this calendar year. With an $8 billion market size, expanding our share in this underpenetrated cardiac ablation space is a big opportunity for us. We expect our growth profile to improve over time. First, moving towards market growth and then winning share as we bring our rich pipeline of innovation to patients you need this technology. In neurovascular this quarter we grew high single-digits, when you exclude sales in China, where the market is subject to volume-based procurement. We continue to have strong double-digit growth and flow diversion globally. This is being driven by our innovative Shield Technology for treating brain aneurysms, which is available on both Pipeline Flex and Vantage flow diverters. In Robotic Surgical Technologies, we continued growing the installed base for our differentiated Hugo Robotic System in International markets. In the US our EXPAND URO pivotal trial continues to enrol and we expect to have first enrollment in our hernia trial very soon. We expect Hugo equipped with advanced digital capabilities to be a meaningful growth driver for us in the years ahead. We believe surgeon preference for our open console and modular design, our leading position in minimally-invasive surgery and instrumentation, our connected digital ecosystem and data-enabled insights along with our world-class surgical training program and partnerships will meaningfully advance the low penetration of robotic surgery around the world. Now turning to Structural Heart, we grew high-single-digits in the quarter, including mid-single-digit sequentially, as we see ongoing adoption of Evolut FX and its improved design and market-leading valve performance. In Europe, where FX was launched for the first full quarter, we grew double-digits. And Japan grew in the low 20s on the continued adoption of FX. I'm pleased to share the news today that we have submitted Evolut FX+ to the FDA for approval. FX+ has three windows in the frame to allow easy coronary access, while providing the same dependable valve performance of our Evolut platform. And we were also pleased to hear that one-year trial results of our SMART Trial will be presented as a late-breaker at ACC, on April 7th. We're excited to see the results and are looking-forward to having both FX+ and the SMART Trial as well as the continued strength of our four year low-risk data as catalysts for our Structural Heart business. Now with that, let's go to Karen for a deeper look at our Q3 financial performance and our fiscal '24 guidance raise. Karen? Karen Parkhill : So looking at our financials, our third quarter was another quarter where we delivered on our commitments. Our revenue grew 4.6% ahead of expectations, and adjusted EPS was $1.30, $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance range. We attribute the beat to stronger-than-expected revenue growth and gross margin, offset by $0.04 from greater-than-anticipated currency impact, primarily from the devaluation in the Argentine peso in December. We're delivering durable mid-single-digit revenue growth and have now for several quarters. As Geoff mentioned, International markets were an important driver for us. Our non-US developed markets grew 6%, including 8% growth in Western Europe and 7% growth in Japan. In fact, we had double-digit growth in several of our businesses across both of those regions. Emerging markets grew 10%, we had high-teens growth in the Middle-East and Africa and mid-teens growth in South Asia. China grew low-double-digits as some of the VBP we expected there continues to be delayed. And Eastern Europe grow in the low-single digits given Russian sanctions. In the US, we grew 2%, we have several new product approvals that are at the earliest stages of their launches and expect those launches to positively impact our US growth over the next couple of quarters and beyond. Looking down the P&L, we delivered a strong quarter. Both our adjusted gross and operating margins were ahead of expectations. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.1% improved year-over-year, overcoming a 60 basis-point headwind from foreign exchange and continued elevated inflation. We attribute the favorability primarily to the delayed China VBP and lower freight costs. We also continue to see traction from our pricing efforts and an early benefit from our comprehensive COGS efficiency efforts. While our adjusted operating margin of 25.2% declined 70 basis points, it was entirely driven by currency. In fact operating margin on a constant currency basis was up 160 basis points from improvement in gross margin and strong SG&A leverage, as we continue to drive efficiencies across the enterprise. Below the operating margin line, our adjusted tax rate was a little higher than anticipated, mainly due to the jurisdictional mix of profits. On the flip side, income on our investments was also a little better than expected with higher rates. It's worth noting that while our adjusted EPS was flat year-over-year, it grew 8.5% on a constant currency basis from the leverage we drove down the P&L. We also significantly improved our free cash flow and conversion in the quarter. Now turning to guidance. Given our top and bottom-line beat and continued strength in our underlying fundamentals, we're raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 4.75% to 5%. For the fourth quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 4.5%. On a comp-adjusted basis, this is an acceleration from the third quarter, as we continue to ramp our recent product launches. With the exit of ventilators that we announced today, we are moving the associated revenue to the other segment, starting in the fourth quarter. As is the case with all revenue in other, we will exclude it from our organic revenue growth. And additional details can be found in our third quarter earnings presentation. Regarding currency based on recent rates, we would see a full-year revenue impact in the range of an unfavorable $15 million to a favorable $35 million, including an unfavorable impact of $70 million to $120 million in the fourth quarter. On the bottom line with the beat in the third quarter, we're raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.04 at the midpoint to a new range of $5.19 to $5.21. I'd point out that given our durable performance, we've been able to increase this guidance by $0.15 at the midpoint from where we initially started the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted EPS of $1.44 to $1.46. And regarding currency based on recent rates, we're seeing an unfavorable impact of 7% on full year EPS, including an unfavorable 5% impact in the fourth quarter. Lastly, while we'll give our fiscal year '25 guidance on our earnings call in May, after we finish our planning, I want to share our early thoughts. You've seen us deliver durable revenue growth for several quarters, and we expect that to continue. Down the P&L inflation, currency and tax are currently headwinds to earnings growth. And we expect to continue to increase our investments in R&D. That said, we're very focused on driving offsets, where we can, and improving the earnings power of the company. And regarding the portfolio management decisions we announced today, while the Street's FY'25 numbers didn't yet reflect the potential separation, with today's decision we're able to increase investment in innovation-driven growth without near-term earnings dilution or an ongoing impact to cash-flow, all with a focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value. I want to close by expressing my sincere gratitude to all of our employees for your hard work and unwavering commitment to the Medtronic mission. Your dedication was instrumental in achieving our results this quarter, and making a difference for so many people around the world. Thank you. Geoff, turning it back to you to take it home. Geoff Martha : Okay, thank you. But before I wrap up, I want to note that Tom Holleran passed away last week at the age of 94. Tom provided decades of leadership to our company. First as General Counsel, next as President and as a Director on our Board for many, many years. In the early 60s, Tom was one of the instrumental people who created our Medtronic mission together with our founder, Earl Bakken. Tom was also a significant leader in the twin cities and beyond and served on several company boards. Our thoughts are with Tom's family as they celebrate his life. Now, before we go to analyst questions, I'll close with a few brief concluding comments on our progress. You see now for several quarters in a row that we're delivering on our commitments with durable mid-single-digit revenue growth. And when you look over the last couple of quarters, we've had a rapid cadence of meaningful innovative product approvals, many of which are just getting started, including EV-ICD, both PulseSelect and Affera in PFA. Inceptiv for SCS, Percept RC for DBS. And of course, our new Simplera Sync sensor in diabetes. And we can't forget Symplicity for hypertension. When you combine these with our investments to enter surgical robotics, along with the strong execution we're having in businesses like spine and diabetes, this is what gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering durable growth. At the same time, we've been sharing with you our efforts to restore the earnings power of the company. And we're seeing those efforts begin to show up in our financials. And the comprehensive transformation that we've been working on streamlining our operating model, aligning incentives, revamping our capital and portfolio management activities and instilling a performance-driven culture, well, this is also having an impact. These changes take time and we're certainly not done, but it's very encouraging to see our progress and where we stand today. And equally exciting are the catalysts that we see coming, which we believe will lead to significant advancements for patients and value-creation for both healthcare systems around the world and our shareholders. So with that, let's move to Q&A where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to just one question. And only if needed a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question. A - Brad Welnick : [Operator Instructions] Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of Diabetes; Mike Marinaro, EVP and President of the Medical-Surgical Portfolio; Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience Portfolio. We'll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue. Operator : We'll take the first question from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Larry, please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on another nice quarter here. I wanted to just focus my one question on the fiscal 2025 comments, Geoff and Karen. You talked about durable growth, is that, should we think about that as mid-single-digit organic growth? And just help us, I think, there'll be some concerns about what we're seeing in the AFib business given the low-double-digit decline in the US. What are the puts and takes to consider there. And on earnings Karen, can you quantify those headwinds inflation, tax and FX in fiscal '25 and consensus is at about 5%, are you comfortable with consensus EPS growth? Thank you for taking the question. Geoff Martha : Yeah, well, first of all, thanks for the questions, Larry. Maybe I'll start with the CAS one, and then Karen, maybe, Sean and I will take the AFib one and then Karen can talk about the FY'25 questions. So I'm going to phone a friend and tap Sean here in a second here. But on -- but on our AFib business, look we are confident in the investments that we made that are going to bear fruit here. We haven't seen that translate into financials yet, but there's lots of leading indicators here that we're seeing that give us confidence both in you know one in continued I think stronger performance than people might think in cryo. But importantly in PFA for both PulseSelect organic program and then Affera. But Sean, do you want to comment on this a little more specifically for Larry. Sean Salmon : Yeah, sure, Geoff. So Larry, in the US what we had experienced was the first time ever a competitor in the cryo segment, so we had a 100% market share and we had the competitor ramp up their production, we felt that in the fourth quarter. I think there's also some anticipation for some new products we're launching including Nitron Console a refresh on our capital equipment for cryo. And of course the PulseSelect, which just started its launch in United States after the quarter closed. And that's doing very, very well, the feedback has been exceptional, doing well in the United States, doing well outside the United States. And I think those catalysts to growth of Pulsed Field for both the PulseSelect, that's the single-shot technology as well as our point-by-point ablation is driving a lot of enthusiasm. So, I think we're going to see a return to growth and into next year we really feel the full force of those launches. So it's a step-back certainly in the United States with the 11% growth worldwide or outside the United States, I should say, is giving us a lot of confidence. This is a pipeline that's poised to return us to growth in that segment. Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Sean. And on FY'25 Larry, I would just start with the fact that we're really pleased with our performance through these last several quarters. Q3 was another solid quarter, our fifth consecutive quarter of solid mid-single-digits. And I would point out that we drove that mid-single-digit growth this quarter off of mid-single-digit comps last year. And that's what we expect to continue into FY'25, you know, we've been working through our planning process, and we expect to wrap that up in advance of our Q4 earnings call. So we'll give our guidance in May. Not ready to give you real specifics, but from a high level, we've had no major changes to the puts and takes for next year that we discussed on our earnings call in Q2. And we're focused on obviously setting up guidance that sets us up for success, prioritizes innovation and allows us to deliver on our commitments. But just on margins and down the P&L, there are puts and takes, we've got inflation that's stabilizing a bit, but it's still higher than historical. Currency is always dynamic, but at recent rates we are facing a decent headwind from FX and we'll just have to see how that shakes out. Global tax reform is likely to be a headwind, but as always, we're focused on driving offsets, where we can. And as you know, we've made, we've made good and real progress on our COGS cost out work, and that started with centralizing our global ops and supply chain, and focusing those teams on putting in place tangible programs that we now have in place to drive that cost-out work. And always, we're continuing to focus on driving pricing as an important lever. We've built a new muscle around pricing and we're just making it stronger and stronger. And then we're always focused on controlling expenses. We've got discipline on our largest driver of our expense, which is our headcount. And we expect that to continue. So really no major changes from what we laid out last quarter. Larry Biegelsen : Okay. Geoff Martha : Okay, thanks, Larry. And I'll remind the analysts, please stick to one question and a related follow-up if needed. Brad, can we take the next question, please. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Great. Thanks and good morning everyone. Wanted to ask on the Patient Monitoring business, the original intent was to try and sell it or spin it, you're now keeping it and exiting the ventilator business. Just maybe walk us through the thought process. What happened in the market and why this is the best outcome for Medtronic? Thanks. Geoff Martha : Sure, I'll take that one, Robbie. So a couple of things, I'll start with -- a couple of things have changed. And I'll start with what -- we do have strong conviction in driving profitable category leadership in this what we're calling acute-care and monitoring business. And a couple of dynamics have changed. And just to remind the monitoring component, the patient monitoring component is the biggest part of this -- of that -- of those businesses that we intended to spin. I think the biggest thing that changes are two things. Our improved competitive positioning. You know is in our Monitoring business in particular changed over the last year. As we are working on the process, we continue to run the business. And it performed well, and the competitive dynamics versus our main competitor Massimo changed significantly for the positive for us. And we believe that we can ensure that, that change is durable with the increased investment and we find a way to make that increased investment, which leads to the decision to wind-down the vents business. It's a very difficult decision, but the business became increasingly unprofitable throughout the last year. The growth slowed even more. And the dynamics within the vent segment are changing, moving to lower acuity ventilators. And our kind of I'd say unique, and worthy contributions are more in the higher acuity hospital based. And so with that market changing and becoming increasingly unprofitable, our decision to wind that down creates the oxygen, the investment if you will, that we can fund the monitoring side of the equation here and ensure that this, our competitive positioning versus Massimo we can -- we feel like we can extend it. And another dynamic that has emerged is the use of data and the importance of data in this space. And that's been changing and becoming increasing. And actually, I'd say, it's the basis for innovation and our confidence in taking that data, and translating that into meaningful iteration, rapid iterations as well as disruption over time is pretty high, given what we've been able to do with AI and other parts of the company. And so you add all this together, and I finally say that, the last thing I'll make a comment on is, as a company more broadly, we continue to prioritize profitable growth and category leadership. When you take all these factors together, we believe we're able to provide increased investment for this acute-care monitoring business what we're calling at ACM now using the savings from brands and also bringing the two -- these were two separate businesses, our respiratory interventions business with ventilators in it and our monitoring business, bringing them together at the leadership level also creates some savings. And then we can find that the incremental investment needed for the monitoring business, all without dilution to our P&L. So, you know, the last thing I want to say is, this was a difficult decision, and it doesn't take anything away from our employees who played such a pivotal role during COVID in driving ventilator innovation and responding to the global needs during the COVID pandemic. And I also want to give a nod to the just the legacy of the Puritan Bennett brand, which has been so strong. And we're proud of the rich legacy of this business and Puritan Bennett ventilators, and this decision has not been easy. And last thing I'll say this does not mean that we're going to shy away from additional portfolio moves. So don't read anything into that. But the bar is high for any strategic activity that's going to dilute our focus or our earnings. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay, thank you, Robbie. We'll take the next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Joanne, please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. There are lot of products that I could ask around. So I'm just going to throw a couple of headline ones out there. Diabetes, congratulations on a return to US growth. Is there a way to peel that apart a little bit on new accounts or new patients versus renewals? And I guess my second question has to do with Hugo. And if you can give us a little bit of a state of an update on how those launches are going outside the United States? Thanks. Geoff Martha : Well thanks Joanne for the questions. You know, obviously, we've been working this diabetes turnaround for some time, and it hasn't been a straight line, but we definitely have some momentum here on 780G, that platform, and just our capabilities here, to use the data like, I was talking about the Patient Monitoring business here as well to create algorithms that really are differentiated and drive differentiated outcomes for patients. And that's playing out globally, and now in the United States. So I'll Que -- maybe Que if you could come in and answer Joanne's if you could peel it apart a little bit more for Joanne, I'd appreciate it. Que Dallara : Yes, look we're very pleased with the progress that we've made every quarter since 780G launch. And we are seeing new patients grow significantly as well as renewals, so both are progressing very well. It will take time to rebuild our installed base, but you can see with the pump growth that we saw in the US, 40% -- high 40s year-over-year, that's going to be followed by consumables and CGM growth as well. So we expect to continue to make progress every quarter, but pretty pleased with how the markets reacted to the product introduction. Geoff Martha : Okay. Thanks Que. Mike Marinaro can you jump in on Hugo here? Mike Marinaro : Yeah, and thanks Joanne for the question. So we continue to see very good progress with Hugo outside the United States with an expansion of installations, and countries around the globe. In fact we entered into two new sub-regions in Central and Eastern Europe. And are continuing to see very good response to the things we've talked about previously. So the open console, the very crisp visualization and increasingly very good feedback around our Touch Surgery Enterprise platform, which on its own continue to expand and had a very good quarter with installations both with Hugo and in our broader surgical business. Also as Geoff noted, during the commentary we continued very good progress with our EXPAND URO IDE here in the US and are preparing for our first patient enrollment in the hernia IDE. So, in total, good reception, a sharpening sort of appreciation for the features of Hugo. I think an emergence of the digital ecosystem and an appreciation for that as well. Geoff Martha : Yeah, I'd say Joanne on this one -- thanks, Mike, first of all, and I'd say on this one, in the robotic system and the features are differentiated and has been -- and been well-received, but it's broader than that as Mike pointed out. I mean it's about the digital platform that comes with it, and as well as the instrumentation, as we transition instrumentation in our laparoscopic business onto the robot particularly stapling in energy. All these moves build momentum, build capabilities momentum over time and we're seeing -- we saw that play out in the Spine business. We bought Mazor and it wasn't an overnight change. You saw our last couple of quarters have been, but it took the integration of these things, you know, Mazor with our navigation and then imaging and then getting these AI-guided surgical planning systems, all these things coming together, you know, every quarter more progress have built the ecosystem we have today, that's really driving that, not just the growth for Medtronic, but to growth for the Spine industry right now. And we expect to do the same thing in soft-tissue surgery. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay, thank you, Joanne. And we'll take the next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay? Geoff Martha : Yeah, hey, Travis. How are you doing? Travis Steed : Good, good. Hey, Geoff, curious if you could talk a little bit more on the gross margin productivity. Some of the things you're driving there. And can you still get the kind of 2x to 3x annual cost savings on the gross margin line. And last month, at the investor conference you talked a lot about leveraged EPS growth. I'm just curious if that's a comment that applies to FY'25 or if that was more of a longer-term comment? Geoff Martha : Sure. Let me tell you. I'll start off and transition to Karen. On the gross margin a couple of things that I'd point out. One is pricing, Karen talked about that. I do think what we're seeing here is a lot of innovation in the industry and a lot of Medtronic. And this innovation, we're finding is valued. It drives value in the health system, and I think we've gotten better at showing the health economics of the innovation that applies from the innovation in addition to the clinical value. I think in the past, we were pretty indexed on clinical value. And more recently, we keep that focus and then add the health economics, and it's getting paid for. And we're I think doing a better job of making those points and getting that pricing and I do think it's durable. So the pricing has increased, I'd say, for the company overall, 200 basis points or so relative to the past, and I think we're going to keep pushing for even more. On the converse, if you don't have the innovation, be prepared for that as well because I think hospitals have gotten more sophisticated and purchasing, and your price is going to pay for that if you're not keeping up with the innovation. But given where we are on the product cycles and giving us pricing muscle, we feel good about that being incremental especially to the historical baseline. The other you asked about is cost goods sold productivity, and the answer, the short answer to your question is, yes, we do think it's sustainable, we've got lots of opportunity here. Can you think about it, we have this pretty big footprint of factories and distribution centers and too many suppliers I have said in the past. Now with Greg Smith coming in a couple of years ago and we've centralized that, we can take a strategic look across that portfolio. And we have a long list of cost-down programs. And then we've ensured that we've effectively contracted those between our global operations supply-chain team and our operating units, because it takes release product engineering to make sure that these cost programs can happen in our operating unit. So we feel good about that, and we feel that that's sustainable. So those are two big changes that impact positively gross margins now and into the future. And speaking in the future, I'll turn it over to Karen to talk about your FY'25 leverage question. Karen Parkhill : Yeah, so just on, I'll just add on gross margins too, we're pleased with our performance that we had this quarter. We overcame a 60 basis point headwind from FX and continued inflationary pressures. And a lot of that was driven by strong pricing, which Geoff talked about. We also did have some continued delays and China VBPs in Aortic and Peripheral Vascular and Stapling. And those VBPs could be coming through this coming fourth quarter or this current fourth quarter and potentially into next year. So that's just something going on in gross margins. You know, as we talk -- as we think about leverage down the P&L clearly we're focused on driving leverage. And I think we talked about it last quarter, Travis, clear leverage is where your bottom-line grows faster than your top-line. We're focused on getting there eventually. We're not ready to talk about that for FY'25, it's still too early for our planning guidance. And I've already pointed out, lots of different puts and takes for next year. Geoff Martha : Yeah. Like Karen said pricing on the gross margin side, pricing, cost of goods sold productivity a lot of focus there. Karen mentioned earlier on the call about discipline around our G&A. Our people are the number one driver of our cost there and so we put a discipline in there that we're holding to. And then finally just setting up the portfolio for profitable growth and the decision on with the changing dynamics, the decision to hold our Monitoring business, because of the confidence in the profitable growth is evidence of that, is setting up the portfolio, the right way. So, I'll leave it there on the focus of on recovering the earnings power of the company, and we'll provide more details on that FY'25 look next quarter. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thank you, Travis. Next question, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Geoff, good morning to you. I guess one on earnings question here. I look at your peers, their earnings have grown versus fiscal '19, 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Medtronic earnings have essentially been flattish. Can Medtronic commit to perhaps above trend earnings growth over the medium-term as you play catch-up, similar to what your peers have done? And I think related to that, Geoff, in the past, you've mentioned about a $400 million drag from investments in RDN, Hugo, where are we on those investments? Are they still a drag, when can those be profitable to the business? Geoff Martha : Thanks, Vijay for the questions. I'll start with the latter question on RDN and Hugo. And let Karen handle the earnings growth ones and further comment on RDN and Hugo. I'd say, on, look Hugo, the way we're looking at Hugo is a part of our broader surgical franchise, an important part of that. And it needs investment. And it is, if you look at Hugo specifically, it is taking a meaningful amount of investment to keep it going here. We've reached -- I love the milestone that we're at now in terms of robot that's out there that's performing well and has got great features that are valued by physicians globally. The feedback has been strong. But we still got more work to do. We've got to get our instruments on there. We've got to complete the US trial, we've got to continue to build out a US -- capital equipment US sales force. So this is a tall order. But the -- our confidence in executing there is high. And it's important to this huge business, our surgical business, which is our biggest business and drives a lot of profit and cash flow. And I say our confidence is high and we're up against a strong competitor in Intuitive. But we like our competitive positioning overall and especially against the other potential robotic companies there. And the dynamics of this market, we think you know play in our favor. So there is investment there. On RDN, by the way, we're really trying to call Symplicity now. We got to get -- we'll get ready for some consumer education on this hypertension therapy. So we're trying to get rid of the RDN term as much as possible. So we got a square jar going on around here on that one. But on hypertension, this one we believe will start to show some profits here. So it's much less of a drag, and we hope to, in the next couple of quarters, the medium-term, this to generate not just revenue, but income, it's a highly profitable product line for us with high gross margins and it will be a positive to our overall mix. And like I said, Hugo, it's going to take investment, but this one I think will provide oxygen, not in the next quarter or two, but over the medium-term here. So I'll leave it there, but it's -- and turn it over to Karen. Karen Parkhill : Yeah, and I would just say on earnings, we've made good progress on driving the earnings part of the company just in this year. I noted that we've been able to increase our guidance on the bottom line by $0.15 at the mid-point from where we initially started the year and that's driven by the strong track-record that we've drove -- that we've driven in the last -- the first three quarters of this year. And we do expect that to continue. Over the medium and long term, we are committed to the right earnings growth. There's no -- there's no debate about that. And we're focused on overcoming the headwinds that we've got over that timeframe and delivering on that growth. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thanks, Vijay. We probably have time for two more questions, Brad. Take two more. Brad Welnick : Okay. The next question goes to Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Miksic : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Can you hear me okay? Geoff Martha : Yeah, we can now. Matt Miksic : Great. Thank you. So maybe just a follow-up here on some of the products that you've mentioned recently approved and I think some of the products that you hope to see approved in the coming quarters and I'm thinking of like Aurora and PulseSelect and maybe some additions to the US approved products in diabetes. And I know Sean mentioned sort of the rough trajectory for AF ablation. But maybe you know on that business for example, any additional color around cadence, is this something that we start to see improve in the fourth quarter or is this sort of like a early to mid '25 kind of process and some of the same commentary for sort of cadence and trajectory in Aurora, and for example, maybe the diabetes business would be super helpful. Thanks. Geoff Martha : Sure. So maybe I'll start with Sean. Before I turn it over to Sean, as I pointed out in the commentary, all the puts and takes in the -- our ablation business, we call, Cardiac Ablation Solutions, our AFib business, we do see an acceleration in this business and even in the fourth quarter here. So -- but I'll turn it over to Sean to talk about AFib and then Aurora. Sean Salmon : Yeah, thanks, Geoff. And Matt the trajectory is obviously going to be upward for both the EV-ICD as well as the CAS business in total. As you launch these new technologies, there are some training that you have to do to make sure that the physicians are comfortable with how to use the products and that's of course something we are very deliberate about to make sure that there is a good patient outcome and good acceptance of the technology. And that's something we do pretty frequently at our business. So we're really, really good at it. And the feedback has been excellent. The procedure efficiency on PulseSelect has been -- we're getting these cases done in like a half an hour, and the acceptance on Aurora has been exceptional too. So as I said I think it's the same story for both of those technologies, where you push growth now but into next year will the full impact of these innovations. Geoff Martha : Que, you want to comment on diabetes? Que Dallara : Yeah, look, we continue to push the pipeline in diabetes. Starting with Simplera approved with CE Mark last September, followed by Simplera Sync recently approved that we announced at JPMorgan. And we completed our clinical trials for 780G with Simplera Sync in the US, which we expect to make in this first half of the calendar year. So that's the cadence that you should expect. And as Geoff mentioned in his opening comments, we have next-generation products that we discussed at ADA last year that we continue to make progress on and aggressively moving to get next-generation tethered pumps and patch pumps out to the market. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thank you. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Que. Thanks, Sean. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Matt. I apologize to the analysts that we weren't able to get to. We have time now for one more, Brad. Brad Welnick : The final question comes from Anthony Petrone at Mizuho Securities. Anthony, please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : Thanks. Can you hear me okay? Geoff Martha : Yeah. Anthony, we can. Anthony Petrone : Okay, great. Geoff Martha : Yeah, Anthony, we can hear you. Anthony Petrone : Just on -- one condolences on the passing of Tom to the team and his family. And maybe one just going to Structural Heart, maybe just to set up on SMART Study, quick two-part question. One was that ahead of schedule, was it expected to be at TCT instead of ACC. So as the late-breaker getting approved the surprise. And then maybe just high level, how do you think that study will play out once we have the results, it is head-to-head in TAVR, in high-risk symptomatic severe. So just thoughts on how you think that data is received once it's out there, post ACC at that session in the coming weeks? Thanks. Geoff Martha : Well, thanks. First of all, Anthony, thanks for the comment on Tom Holleran. He is a real legend around here. And just a great guy. So we're going to miss him. On Structural Heart, two comments before I turn it over to Sean. First, I really applaud the business for their evidence generation in total. We just did our low risk data, and we publish it every year, not just when it's convenient. And then they had the courage to do a head-to-head, which is not, you know, something that's often done in our space. And so, I could tell you that I, for one, love that just the commitment to data and the competitiveness to go head-to-head. And I'm very much looking forward to the results, that are going to come out in early April at ACC. But in terms of the specifics of what you're asking on how it might play out, I'll turn that over to Sean. Sean Salmon : Yes, thanks, Anthony. The completement of enrollment happened in October of '22, so that's a 12-month endpoint for the study, and that pushes you really out of the window for TCT. So, I think we're on schedule, I'd say, we're pleased to have been accepted as a late-breaker at ACC. But that's really as expected I'd say. In terms of the trial itself and how it will be received, I think just right the momentum that we have on data from the notion 10-year data that's low-risk patients out to 10 years showing superior durability of our valve compared to surgical implants, and then our four-year low-risk study with hard endpoint benefits and a widening benefit on serious outcomes like mortality and disabling stroke. And of course going head-to-head in a really important patient population, those with a small analysts. We said that's about 40% of the global market. Really prevalent among women and within smaller patient populations like in Japan for example. So that's, I think it's really important and compelling data, it's a one year outcome which portends long-term outcomes. And I think you know we're excited for the reception of those results. And we do think that, that's a catalyst for growth for us with our really unique position in that particular subset of patients, which is a big chunk of the market at 40%. Geoff Martha : Okay, thanks, Sean. And so just to wrap it up here. One final comment on the ventilation, the Monitoring and Ventilation decisions you know as a result of these portfolio decisions, Bob White will be leaving Medtronic and he has been just such an impactful and important leader for the company for a long time. And although the friendship will remain strong, we're definitely going to miss working with him day to day, and I want to wish him -- I want to wish him well. And I know that comes from the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee and everybody at Medtronic that's interacted with Bob just a high ethical leader and just a good guy, and we wish him well. And in terms of -- and so for in terms of today I just want to thank everybody for the questions. Definitely appreciate your support and continued interest in Medtronic. And we hope you'll join us again for our Q4 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Thursday, May 23rd. And again we'll update you on our progress and how we finished the fiscal year, but also look ahead to fiscal '25. So with that thanks for spending time with us today and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning. I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations and I appreciate that you're joining us this morning for our Fiscal '24 Fourth Quarter Video Earnings Webcast. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024, which ended on April 26th, 2024, and our outlook for fiscal year '25. After our prepared remarks, the Executive VPs covering our segments will join us and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial achievements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements. And actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC. And we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency, prior year revenue from a one-time IP agreement in Structural Heart and fourth quarter revenue in the current and prior year reported as other, which stems from prior business separations. There were no acquisitions made in the last four quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the third quarter of fiscal '24 and are made on an as-reported basis, and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the first calendar quarter of 2024 compared to the first calendar quarter of 2023, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter and the year. Geoff Martha : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered a strong finish to the fiscal year with broad strength across our businesses. Each of our four segments delivered mid-single-digit or higher revenue growth and this was on top of a strong mid-single-digit performance last year. Throughout fiscal '24, we delivered consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth with over 5% for the full year. At the same time, we're making progress on our commitment to restore our earnings power, which is evident in our fiscal '25 guidance. We're executing COGS cost-out programs while maintaining pricing and maximizing efficiencies in our operating overhead. And we're translating our earnings into strong and improving cash flow, which we're investing to drive future growth and return to our shareholders. We also continue to enhance our operating model to make the company even more resilient, and our global workforce is embracing a performance-driven culture that is translating into durable results. We made solid progress in fiscal '24, and the momentum we're building into the new year has me very excited for '25. We're at the beginning stages of new product cycles. The runway from the differentiated technologies we've recently launched, along with the innovation we will launch over the next 12 months, give me significant confidence in our ability to drive durable growth. These launches put us in a strong position in some of MedTech's most attractive markets like AFib, Structural Heart, robotics, neuromodulation, hypertension and diabetes. And this is further enhanced as we apply AI across our portfolio. All that to say, we are very optimistic about what we can achieve here in fiscal '25 and beyond. Now let's turn to the details of our Q4 results, where we had a number of standout performances. We look at our businesses in three categories. Established market leaders, Synergistic and Highest Growth. Our Established Market Leader and Synergistic businesses both grew mid-single digits, while our Highest Growth businesses delivered high single-digit growth. Looking first at our Established Market Leaders, combined, they made up just under half of our revenue and grew 5%. The highlight of the quarter was Cranial & Spinal Technologies. After growing 6% or higher every quarter this year, CST accelerated to 9% growth in Q4. I want to say that one more time, 9% growth in Q4. This was driven by an outstanding quarter for capital sales with Neurosurgery growing 14%. We had double-digit revenue growth in Mazor Robotics, StealthStation navigation, O-arm Imaging and Midas Rex powered surgical instruments. And this pulled through Spine Implants and Biologics, with high-single-digit growth in Biologics and mid-single-digit growth in Core Spine, including 8% Core Spine growth in the US. We also continue to see strong adoption of UNiD Adaptive Spine Intelligence our integrated AI surgical planning solution. Here, we're taking data and building deep learning models that see patterns and create personalized outcomes for patients. As I've been sharing for several quarters now, our strategy of combining best-in-class implants and biologics with our best-in-class enabling technology, and then adding our unique intelligence into the procedure, is a winning formula in Spine. We call it the AiBLE ecosystem, and it's a big competitive differentiator for us. AiBLE is creating value for patients. It's winning over surgeons all around the world. And it's changing the competitive dynamics of the Spine marketplace. And it's attracting the best reps to Medtronic to expand our business. Next, in Cardiac Rhythm Management, Cardiac Pacing Therapies delivered another strong quarter of high-single-digit growth. Our Micra leadless pacemaker franchise grew over 20%, driven by the adoption of our latest generation, Micra AV2 and VR2, which improved procedure efficiency and increased battery longevity by 40% to 16 or 17 years. Now we hold the vast majority of share in the leadless pacing space. We also continue to expand our pacing leadership as the only company to offer an approved lead for an innovative alternative form of pacing called Conduction System Pacing. Our 3830 conduction system pacing lead grew over 40%. In Defibrillation Solutions, we're seeing good early adoption of our innovative Aurora EV-ICD, which requires no leads in the heart. Now as more implanters complete their training, we expect EV-ICD sales to ramp and become a significant driver of CRM growth, taking share from the competitor's S-ICD system. Next, in Surgical, we grew 5%. Our Advanced Energy product lines grew high-single-digits on the continued launch of our Ligasure XP Maryland vessel sealer. We've now taken energy share from our main competitor for six quarters in a row. Our Wound Management business also grew high-single-digits as strong sales of our V-Loc barbed sutures also resulted in continued share gains from our main competitor. In Q4, we expanded the capabilities of our Touch Surgery digital ecosystem. Just as our AiBLE ecosystem is transforming Spine, Touch Surgery is transforming laparoscopic and robotic surgical procedures. We collect robust datasets from surgeries, including video, to create models that inject intelligence into these procedures. We've launched 14 new AI-based algorithms on our Touch Surgery Performance Insights platform just at SAGES last month. These first-in-class algorithms automatically analyze surgical procedures from anatomy to critical structures, enabling surgeons to objectively assess performance. We also launched Touch Surgery Live Stream, which enables secure and seamless telepresence, including training and proctoring, from a procedure room to really anywhere in the world. Overall, adoption of our Touch Surgery ecosystem is accelerating, and it's becoming a very important differentiator for our Surgical Franchise. Now turning to our Synergistic businesses, combined, they grew 5% in Q4. Cardiac Surgery, ENT, and Endoscopy all grew high-single-digits. Pelvic Health, Coronary, Peripheral Vascular and Neuromodulation all grew mid-single-digits. In Neuromod, Brain Modulation had an outstanding quarter, growing low-single-digits. This was the first quarter of benefit from the launch of Percept RC with BrainSense technology, the only complete sensing-enabled DBS system on the market. Here, we are seeing a strong uptake and excitement for this exclusive technology, and it's extending our number one leadership position in DBS in both Europe and in the US. Our Neuromod business also received really great news at the end of Q4, with the US FDA approving the Inceptiv closed-loop spinal cord stimulator. The Inceptiv platform is a gamechanger in chronic pain therapy. The device automatically senses and adjusts stimulation, 50 times a second, 24/7, with no required interaction from the patient. And the therapy is delivered from the smallest and thinnest closed-loop SCS device on the market, along with the best 3T and 1.5T full-body conditional MRI access. Given all these advantages will now be carried in the bags of our very large SCS salesforce, we expect Pain Stim to grow above market in the coming quarters. Now let's cover the highlights from the businesses in our Highest Growth Markets. Combined, they made up 20% of revenue and grew high-single-digits. And we expect that their contribution to overall growth will accelerate over the coming quarters as we launch new technology. I'll start this quarter with Cardiac Ablation Solutions, which delivered 21% sequential growth in the quarter, including 23% in the US. This was driven by our Pulse Field ablation products, which are more than offsetting declines in our cryo product line. Q4 marked the first quarter of our PulseSelect PFA catheter launch. It's off to a great start, with strong adoption from both focal RF and single-shot users. As we expand the PulseSelect launch, we also continue to advance our robust pipeline of PFA technology. Last week, US pivotal data for our Sphere-9 focal catheter presented at HRS and published in Nature Medicine. These data were impressive, especially when you consider we were studying persistent AF patients, the most challenging to treat. We showed Sphere-9 has an excellent safety profile, superior efficiency, and numerically higher freedom from recurrent AFib compared head-to-head with the market-leading traditional RF ablation technology. Sphere-9 can perform both PF and RF ablation as well as high-density mapping, all from a single device. And we're looking forward to offering US clinicians this first of its kind wide focal catheter. The output of all this is that we expect our CAS business to continue to accelerate its growth throughout the coming fiscal year as we increase our PFA account training and catheter production to meet the high demand. And over time, we expect our CAS business will reach market growth and then win share. And this will be driven by our PFA launches and the pull-through of our broader portfolio, treating the growing population of patients with AFib. Next, in Structural Heart, TAVR continues to be a very important growth driver for Medtronic. And we grew high-single-digits in the quarter. Structural Heart had two meaningful developments during Q4. First, data from our SMART trial was published in The New England Journal of Medicine and presented at ACC last month. SMART, well, it clearly showed our valve was better than Edward Sapien in small annulus patients who are primarily women. This is a large segment of the TAVR space, about 40%, which is larger than most realized. Now while it takes time to broadly change clinical practice and change customer contracting, we're seeing early signs from many loyal Sapien users that they expect to increase their usage of Medtronic valves, and we're building our business for that growth. The second important development in Q4 was receiving US FDA approval for Evolut FX+, our newest TAVR valve. FX+ has large windows in the frame to allow easy coronary access, while providing the same exceptional valve performance of our Evolut platform. We've just started the limited launch now and are receiving really strong positive feedback from physicians. Full market release is expected in August. So when you consider our four-year low-risk data, our SMART data and our new FX+ valve, we expect this combination to drive our TAVR growth at or above the market, especially as the FX+ launch ramps in our second fiscal quarter. Turning to Robotics Surgical Technologies. We're establishing a strong foundation here and we continue to expand the Hugo system install base. In the US, we are nearing completion of our Urology pivotal trial. We also have now started enrollment in two new indication studies, hernia and gynecology. In addition, our development teams are making progress bringing our advanced surgical technologies to Hugo, such as ICG and our Ligasure vessel sealing technology. In Diabetes, our team delivered another strong quarter, growing 11% globally. In the US, we grew 12% as the rollout of the MiniMed 780G system continues. New US users doubled year-over-year again this quarter. And since launch, we've seen a significant increase in CGM attachment rates, resulting in high-teens growth in US CGM revenue in Q4. Users are choosing our differentiated 780G system for the outcomes it delivers, all with less effort and less burden. 780G is the only AID system that provides both basal insulin adjustments and correction doses every five minutes. It offers flexible glucose targets as low as 100 and features our proprietary Meal Detection technology. This all leads to 780G users achieving a high time in range as well as spending more time in automation with our SmartGuard technology. In Europe, we began the limited launch of Simplera Sync with 780G, and we're preparing for commercial launch this summer. The early users and their healthcare providers are giving us fantastic feedback. Simplera Sync is half the size of our current sensor, is disposable and it's a lot easier to put on. And in the US, I'm pleased to announce that we have now submitted Simplera Sync to the FDA. Look, the turnaround in Diabetes is palpable and now becoming a sustained growth story. We're committed to getting the business back to market leadership. This is why we're investing heavily in expanding indications for 780G system and developing next-generation differentiated technology. This includes durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, CGM and software and algorithms. You've seen us execute a steady drumbeat of submissions, product approvals and expanded indications, and this is a cadence we expect to continue. We're the only company building out a complete ecosystem of leading technology for patients who require intensive insulin management. We believe this strategy positions us well and will drive our growth as the market continues to shift to Automated Insulin Delivery and Smart Dosing. Finally, turning to hypertension. We believe Simplicity will become an important growth driver for Medtronic. Since gaining approval last year, we've been training physicians, and we're getting very favorable feedback from both clinicians and patients. We've also been working very closely with both CMS and private payers in the United States, and expect to make significant progress on coverage and payment here in fiscal '25. With over 1 billion people worldwide living with hypertension and every 1% penetration into the target market is over $1 billion of revenue, our Simplicity procedure represents a massive opportunity. Now with that, let's go to Karen for a deeper look at Q4 financial performance and our fiscal '25 guidance. Karen, over to you. Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Geoff. So recapping our financials. The fourth quarter was yet another where we delivered on our commitments, growing 5.4%, ahead of expectations. We continue to drive durable mid-single-digit revenue growth, as committed, with more than 5% in fiscal '24. Importantly, we accelerated our comp-adjusted growth every quarter. And adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter was $1.46, at the upper end of our guidance range and exceeding consensus. The strength of our global business was apparent with broad-based growth around the world. As I noted last quarter, we expected our US growth to improve as we launch new products, and we delivered that with mid-single-digit growth. Our non-US developed markets also grew mid-single-digits, including 7% growth in Western Europe and 5% growth in Japan. And Emerging Markets remained strong, growing 13% and now comprises 18% of our total revenue. Looking down the P&L, our adjusted gross margin was roughly stable at 65.8% as our cost-out programs offset inflation. And our adjusted operating margin declined slightly more than expected, given higher sales incentives on the higher revenue, along with increased investments we've made in SG&A to support upcoming product launches. That said, we delivered operating profit in line with expectations. We also continued to drive strong improvement in our free cash flow during the quarter, as we focused across the organization on working capital. In fact, our free cash flow increased by 14% over last year to $5.2 billion, with a conversion rate well north of 100% in the back half of the year. Looking ahead to fiscal '25, we expect to continue to drive a year-over-year increase in both free cash flow and our conversion rate. Turning to capital allocation. Our robust balance sheet allows us to operate from a position of strength. As you know, we prioritize both investing in our future growth and returning capital to our shareholders. We continue to evaluate tuck-in M&A opportunities against a high bar as we prioritize profitable growth. And to our shareholders, we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow. In fact, in FY'24, we returned $5.5 billion through both dividends and share repurchases. And over the past few months, we've repurchased over $2.5 billion in the open market, reflecting the confidence we have, as we finalized our plan, in our ability to deliver ahead. This confidence is also evident in the decision by our Board to increase our dividend for the 47th consecutive year, which we announced this morning. The yield from our growing dividend is an important component of the total return we generate for our shareholders. It's worth noting that we've been able to grow our dividend by 30% over the past five years and 130% over the past decade. Now turning to our guidance. After six quarters in a row, we firmly established a track record of delivering durable mid-single-digit revenue growth. And as Geoff mentioned, we're at the beginning stages of many new product cycles that enable confidence in our top line. Given this backdrop, we'd have you start the year modeling our fiscal '25 organic revenue growth at 4% to 5% including 4% to 4.5% in the first quarter. Our product launches will be ramping through the year, so we expect revenue growth to accelerate through the quarters as well. By segment, we'd expect our three portfolios to be roughly aligned with the corporate average and Diabetes to grow above the corporate average. Our organic growth guidance continues to exclude revenue reported in other as well as foreign exchange. And I direct you to the guidance slide in our earnings presentation for additional details. Regarding currency, based on recent rates, we would see a full year unfavorable impact to revenue in the range of $275 million to $375 million, including an unfavorable impact of $85 million to $135 million in the first quarter. Down the P&L, we expect expansion in our operating margin as we drive efficiencies in our overhead spend. At the same time, we continue to appropriately invest in R&D to drive future growth. Taking all of this together, we're guiding our fiscal '25 non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.40 to $5.50, including $1.19 to $1.21 in the first quarter. This includes an unfavorable 5% impact from foreign currency for the full year, with an unfavorable 6% impact in the first quarter, based on recent rates. Our fiscal '25 outlook reflects our commitment to restore our earnings power, with EPS growth at the midpoint of about 5%. Importantly, at current rates, the impact from currency lessens through the year, so we expect to be ending the year with high-single-digit EPS growth on a reported basis, in line with our longer-term objective. Now, as we close this important fiscal year, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to the employees of Medtronic around the world. The important results we delivered this year are all due to your hard work, dedication, and commitment to Medtronic and our mission. Thank you for being the driving force behind our success. Geoff, sending it back to you. Geoff Martha : All right. Thank you, Karen. Now before we go to the analyst questions, I'll close with a few brief remarks. I hope you're feeling what we are, that the momentum at Medtronic is building. Momentum that was set in motion by the comprehensive transformation we embarked on a few years ago. We streamlined our operating model. We put in place performance-driven culture, and we change incentives. We brought in new leaders. We improved how we allocate capital. And we started the work of driving significant operational efficiencies to leverage our scale. This transformation is taking hold, and you're seeing it in our results, and just in time for a very important Medtronic milestone. We're celebrating our company's 75th anniversary this year. It was back in 1949 that a medical electronics repair business was started in a garage in Minneapolis. Now certainly, a lot has changed over the past 75 years, but what hasn't stopped from the humble beginnings in that garage is our spirit of innovation and our dedication to delivering life-transforming health technology that alleviates pain, restores health and extends life. As we celebrate our past, we are even more excited about our future. That legacy of invention and market creation continues today and you see it. You see it with our PFA products in AFib, our sensing products in Neuromodulation, our 780G and Simplera Sync system. You see it with our robotics with our Evolut TAVR system, and our Simplicity hypertension procedure and the dozens of new products across our businesses. Our pipeline of breakthrough innovation is impressive. And I'm incredibly excited about the impact that these products will have on patients, on physicians and on our performance. It's these new product cycles, combined with exposure to secular growth markets and an aging population, that put us in a great spot to continue delivering durable revenue growth. And when you add this to our improving earnings power, our strong free cash flow and dividend growth, you have a great formula for creating shareholder value. Finally, I'd like to join Karen in expressing my gratitude to our employees watching today. We've been through a lot of change. But through it all, your unwavering focus on our mission and performance has propelled our company forward. Your contributions matter, not just for Medtronic, but for the millions of patients around the world that depend on us. And as we continue to innovate and grow, I'm confident that, together, we will achieve even greater heights in fiscal '25. So with that, let's move to Q&A, where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to just one question, and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question. Brad Welnick : For the sell-side analysts that would like to ask a question, please select the Participants button and click Raise Hand. If you're using the mobile app, press the More button and Select Raise Hand. Your lines are currently on mute. When called upon, you will receive a request to unmute your line, which you must respond to before asking your question. Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded For today's session, Geoff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of Diabetes; Mike Marinaro, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical portfolio; Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience portfolio. We'll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue. A - Brad Welnick : We'll take the first question from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the EPS guidance, ex-currency, 9% to 11%. I guess buyback maybe adds 1% to 2% there, but still kind of above kind of what Medtronic historically has done. So wanted to kind of understand the puts and takes better on your EPS guidance and how you're going to get there. And then kind of longer term, you're talking a lot about restoring earnings power. How should we think about kind of the pathway on growing kind of EPS beyond FY'25? Thanks for the question. Geoff Martha : Well, Travis, thanks for the question. I'm going to hand this to Karen in a second, but let me just make a few opening comments on this. Look, the earnings power is something we've been working on for years. For example, we started our aggressive global operations and supply chain transformation over three years ago. We've been improving pricing. You see that in our FY'24 results, and we're strengthening this muscle and building on our momentum on pricing going into FY'25. We've made some tangible changes to mix, like exiting our ventilation business and divesting our dialysis business. These are a couple of examples which Karen will go through in more detail. But the point is, I think there's structural -- programmatic structural changes to the enterprise that are allowing us to achieve top line growth, but at the same time growing that earnings power. Like I said, they're structural, they're programmatic and they're giving us the confidence into FY'25 and beyond in terms of that earnings power improvement. So Karen, can you walk through some of the details on this. Karen Parkhill : Sure. Thanks, Geoff, and Travis. So I would say in '25, we're focused on three key things. Delivering continued mid-single-digit top line growth while executing on our strong pipeline, investing in our high-priority growth drivers and restoring the earnings power of the company as Geoff talked about. And our guidance all starts with confidence and durability on our top line. We've got really high confidence given the track record that we've had over the last six quarters and the fact that we've got this very robust pipeline coming to market. Much of it has already been approved by regulators and much of it is also moving from limited market release to full market release. So we expect on gross margins it to be flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis because we've got cost down and pricing offsetting inflation. And on operating expenses, we continue to make appropriate investments in R&D to drive our future growth. And we'll really drive leverage in SG&A and that's through programmatic changes that we've implemented throughout the company, including discipline on headcount, focus on discretionary expenses. We've always got increased use of automation and digitization, and we've elevated the review and reporting on our expenses and our margins and we've driven some structural changes, too, like eliminating our respiratory interventions operating unit. And on this expense, we've taken costs out already, and you're seeing the full benefit of it this year. We actually drove this kind of leverage in '24, it was just masked by the impact of the true-up and incentive compensation that we did from '23 to '24. And then on top of operating leverage, you'll see a large benefit from reduced share count, which will be a bit offset by incremental interest and tax. But when you put it all together, we expect this 4% to 5% top line growth, along with operating leverage and share count, to deliver that high-single-digit EPS growth for the year. And as our currency headwinds abate, we've said we expect high-single-digit actual or reported EPS in the back half of the year. And that goes beyond this fiscal year. So beyond FY'25 we're focused on maintaining this mid-single-digit revenue growth and continuing to drive leverage down the P&L to deliver that high-single-digit EPS growth. Travis Steed : Great. Thanks a lot. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Travis. Next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Great. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start, I wanted to zero in, in the guide, you have accelerating revenue growth, it feels like, throughout the year, with first quarter where it is, probably second half better than first half. I was hoping you could spend a minute on some of the products there because there's a lot of moving pieces and how we should think about the sources for upside and your confidence levels around that upside? And then I have one follow-up. Geoff Martha : Sure. I'll take a stab at this, Robbie, and Karen can jump in if I missed anything here. Well, first of all, look, we've got a lot -- as been pointed out by many of you on the call here, a lot of approvals here recently in really high-growth areas, and we're in the early stages of these launches. But specifically, to answer your question here in FY'25, some of the -- one is in Structural Heart with Evolut FX as it moves from this limited market release in the US to a full market release we're seeing strong uptick. And the SMART trial continues to build -- the SMART trial results in small annulus continues to build on our body of clinical evidence. And we are seeing it changed referral patterns. I mean it's pretty clear here what to do with these patients. And it's a bigger cohort of patients that I think most imagined at 40% of the market. So Structural Heart, TAVR is one. Evolut FX plus the changing referral patterns from SMART. PFA is another one. We've got PulseSelect here. You saw the results with over 20% sequential growth in the business, and we really haven't seen anything from a far yet. That's coming. So PFA is going to be a big one for us. And throughout the year, it's accelerating. And leadless, not only, I mean, look, we -- first of all, we still maintain the lion's share of the market here. And we just launched -- recently launched it and we're continuing to take share. We just launched Micra AV2 and VR2. And the market is expanding. UnitedHealth Group which you guys know is the largest commercial insurer in the US, just updated its policies to cover leadless pacemakers. And so you see us performing strong, new launches in an expanding markets. That's some of the cardiovascular related ones. And again, our EV-ICD as well. So there's a lot for FY'24, in this fiscal year from cardiology. Neuroscience also has a lot. I mean, Spine saw the acceleration. We expect that to continue with the combination of the implants plus the enabling technology plus the AI having a real impact. And this has been something we've been building on. And you're seeing good performance relative to the competition. I mean I know there's a lot of buys out there on Globus. But when you look at apples-to-apples, we grew 9% and they grew 3%. On an apples-to-apples pro forma basis in the year, when you look at the combined NuVasive and Globus, that's three, and we're nine. That's a pretty big gap. And we're -- and we've got four times the installed base, which is really a key to growth in that market now. ENT continues to do well and that's accelerating from the continued adoption of Propel and Sinuva that came from the Inceptiv acquisition. And then, of course, in Neuromod, with the closed-loop Technology, Percept RC, in my prepared remarks, you heard DBS growing double-digits. And then right at the end of the quarter, we got the launch of -- the approval of Inceptiv, which is our ECAPs closed-loop stimulator for pain. We think it's a better product that's on the market with our large sales force, we're going to do some damage there. And then the diabetes, the 780G, US growth continues low-double-digits. I think we're going to continue to surprise people on diabetes and show continued strength. And then, of course, Hugo and Ardian are both really good leading indicators of growth that you'll be seeing later in the year. So I mean there's a lot spread across the businesses. And that's why we have the confidence in the mid-single-digit revenue growth and Karen talked about how that translates to the bottom line. Karen Parkhill : Yes. And I would just add just briefly that our end markets are growing, our back orders are down. Our supply chain has improved. The impact of VBP in China is largely behind us. And then obviously, we've got the long list of products that Geoff talked about. Geoff Martha : Yes. And said another way, we're entering the year with a lot less questions too, like risks. Like go back a year ago, China, a lot of uncertainty there. We had a high-single-digit growth for the year, accelerating throughout the year, double-digits in the last two quarters. So these are -- putting these things, some of these questions, risks or obstacles behind us is also, I think, another one. That just the elimination of those plus the addition of the new products is, you add it all up, it feels good going into the year. Robert Marcus : Great. Maybe a quick follow-up here. Karen, I appreciate the high-level building blocks down the P&L. I was hoping you could put a little more meat on the bone. You talked about gross margin expansion, how should we think about that? It sounds like R&D deleverage, SG&A, you have a lot of costs. I think that drove the miss in operating margin in the fourth quarter. So how do we think about the level of investment versus savings in SG&A? It sounds like that does get us to a positive operating margin expansion. And then how do we think about the level of tax? I know it's gone higher, but how much higher? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Sure, Robbie. So just on the detail on gross margin, I said we expect it flat on a constant currency basis. We will have some currency headwinds, about 0.5 point of downward pressure on gross margin at recent rates. But as I said, we've got good cost down and pricing offsetting inflation there. And as those currency wins on the gross margin line should abate as we move through the year and be away be gone as we exit the year. As we look at R&D and SG&A, I would say in R&D, we're focused on continuing to invest. It's a critical priority to us. I've talked about it being the one line item that's allowed to grow in line or more than revenue in certain years. And we've been focused on driving efficiencies across the company, including in R&D to enable these levels of investment. Some of the recent portfolio moves we've made like setting up the JV for our renal care or shutting down our ventilator business has allowed us to reallocate investment in our highest strategic priorities in R&D. So that remains an area of investment. And then on SG&A, we are focused on driving continued significant leverage in SG&A. And I talked about the programmatic savings that we've been driving that you're seeing more this fiscal year than you saw last year. We actually drove this kind of leverage in '24. I said it was just masked by the impact of the true-up in incentive compensation. So we're excited about what we're going to continue to drive in SG&A. And then on tax, we expect tax to be a bit of a headwind given global tax reform. We're pleased with the work that we've done to offset some of this, both on the tax line and above the tax line, but we expect it to be about one point higher than we had this past fiscal year. Robert Marcus : Thank you, Karen. Geoff Martha : So, Robbie, when you think about FY'25 on the bottom line, as Karen mentioned, that's going to come from operating margin actions. And it goes beyond expense management. These are programmatic changes we've made in FY'24. And we'll see the full benefit of these are changes that are made in the bank, and you'll see the full benefit of that in FY'25. On the gross margin line, which is super important, those programs are underway. And as Karen mentioned, it's hard to see that because of some of the inflation and FX. But as we get into FY'26 as those abate, you'll see that gross margin start to expand as well. So we think we've laid this out the right way and got the programs lined up against it and have been working on it for some time. And we'll see those benefits accrue over the next couple of years. Robert Marcus : Great. Thanks a lot. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Robbie. Next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice sprint here. Geoff, one on your restoring EPS power comments. What does it mean? What is the right base we should be thinking of? Are we thinking of operating margins perhaps getting back to upper 20s? Is there a time frame for that? And maybe some clarification on what that means. Geoff Martha : Well, look, I'll let -- I'm going to have Karen answer that. She kind of hit on that some in our prepared remarks, but I have her kind of redo some of that. But the -- like I said just a second ago, on the operating margin, we've got a lot of confidence in that for the year given the changes we've already made and the changes we've already made in the gross margin line and are continuing to expand, those will start to hit in the latter part of the year and move into next year. I'll let Karen kind of quantify it. Karen Parkhill : Yes. And just on restoring the earnings power, Vijay, it means that we are focused on driving that durable mid-single-digit top line. It starts there, but then driving leverage down the P&L to deliver high-single-digit EPS. And you'll see us exit the year of FY'25 doing that, and we're focused on maintaining it and driving it continued from there. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And just related to that, when you say operating margin leverage this year, is that on an ex-FX basis? Or what's the implied operating margins on a reported basis for fiscal '25? Karen Parkhill : Yes. We're expecting margins around 26% in '25, and that's on a reported basis or up from where we were, yes. Vijay Kumar : Thanks, Karen. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Vijay. Next question, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Larry, please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a nice quarter here. Sean, it was great to see the mid-single-digit growth in AF Solutions in Q4 and congrats on the Affera data. How should we be thinking about the AF business before the Affera launch in the US. just remind us in the launch timing there and where you are with supply and your ability to get mapping equipment and personnel out there in the field. Thanks for taking the question. Sean Salmon : Thanks, Larry. First of all, the business is doing exceptionally well in the sequential growth that we've seen and the demand and interest coming out of both HRS and ERA for our new technologies is really astonishingly great. It's really, really high. And I'd say in the United States, Pulse Field is moving pretty fast there and we're catching that wave, obviously, with our first entry here. And I'd say that there's, as we scale up for further penetration of therapy, there's lots of other approvals we're getting around the world. There's expansion of capacity. And the most important thing to get it fair to the United States was that last module of clinical data, as you saw, that was really pristine taking on head-to-head the market leading technology and just narrowly missing on superior efficacy. So that's all boding well. To your point, though, the things we have to get right are scaling up manufacturing, and that's something we've put a lot of effort toward. We moved into new Medtronic facilities, away from the sort of acquired clean room that we purchased with Affera. And the last point, you'd asked about capital, and that's certainly not going to be a barrier to our success. We have all kinds of ways of helping with capital acquisition, including placing capital, leasing, catheter costs, things like that, that will be availing ourselves to throughout the launch of that product as well. So look I think all things are going up. We're really excited about Pulse Field ablation and the customers are really kind of beating the door down for it every single day. So it's exciting to be part of. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the question. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Larry. Next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Pito Chickering at Deutsche Bank. Pito, please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Hey, good morning, guys. Quick questions on margins this quarter. The operating margins are a little bit softer expected due to SG&A pressures. Can you just walk through what the variance was services expectations. Like you talked about higher comp and support for product launches. Just want to make sure I understand what happened versus what you're expecting. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks, Pito, for the question. You're right. So with the outperformance that we had on the top line, we did have some incremental incentive accruals in the quarter on sales incentive comp. And we've purposely driven investments in our strategic growth drivers as we work to commercialize many of the exciting innovations that we've got heading into '25. We did all this and absorbed the incremental incentive comp and investments while still delivering on our financial commitments and beating the bottom line, but that was it was driven by. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then Cranial Spine were pretty strong this quarter. Can you just talk about durability of that growth and sort of where we should be thinking about that growing in fiscal '25. Thanks so much. Brett Wall : You bet. Hey, Pito, it's Brett Wall. Thanks for the question. We think it's very durable. If you look at where this business is going, as Geoff mentioned, we grew three times our nearest competitor in the space and that's on a very large base of business. We are recruiting the best sales reps. We have this technology system with AiBLE that is allowing us to change how spine surgery is being done. We are recruiting physicians, sales reps and our technology is making a difference in the marketplace. We see that as durable for several, several quarters here. Geoff Martha : Yes. Just one final point on that, Pito, is like the -- the model is -- the industry is changing to this capital equipment, this enabling technology. Now the enabling technologies has to have good stuff. It has to be integrated, it has to have value, AI is a big piece of that. And it's accounts are making investments in a company now. The Medtronic ecosystem, AiBLE, versus some other ecosystem, and there's not many out there, right? So that's why we keep emphasizing our installed base. And it's also changing the industry structure because this takes a lot of expertise and capital to build these ecosystems. So you don't have this long tail of tiny spine companies that are preying on docs. Those are going away. And so that's why we think this is durable. And we're -- this -- yes, we're investing heavily in this area and have been for years. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much. Ryan Weispfenning : Thank you, Pito. Next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Josh Jennings of Cowen & Company. Josh, please go ahead. Joshua Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had trouble with the mute button there. I wanted to ask about emerging markets, almost just under 20% of the revenue base grew double-digits in fiscal '24. Maybe just help us understand some of the puts and takes there. And I think, Karen, you said most of the VBP headwinds are behind Medtronic now heading into fiscal '25. China is almost 40% of the emerging market revenue base. Can you just talk about overall emerging market trends, expectations for sustainable double-digit growth and specifics around China? Can we see acceleration in Medtronics performance growth in China? Thanks for taking the question. Geoff Martha : Sure, Josh. Thanks for the question. Look, as I think most of you know, I mean, emerging market focus has been something that we've been on for a long time, and has been almost like an independent growth driver for us up until basically COVID, right, when certain markets like China shut down and then you had VBP. So the last couple of years have been choppy on emerging markets, I would say. But those fundamentals are coming back, right? VBP is almost like China is a big one there, right. VBPs are mainly behind us, not totally. You've seen, I'd say we're 80% of the way there. And you've seen the growth accelerating throughout the year for us. The last two quarters, double digits for China. When that last, call it, we don't think the -- there's a little bit of, I'll call it, hanging chads on VBP and the timing of those tenders in some of our smaller businesses in the like aortic or peripheral vascular, and there's a little bit left in neurovascular. When those hit, it could impact the quarter, so going from that double-digits down to mid-single. But we see in any given quarter, mid-single to high-single to double. But China is by and large back and the procedures are strong. And that's a big part of our emerging market business. And we're a combination there of import and local. That also gives us some strength our local product investments. And those local products also can be exported to other parts of the world. So I think the other thing we've done here over the last couple of years is empowered our emerging market leaders a bit more than we had in the past, and they're able to allocate resources, I think, more effectively to -- because the health care is local and these markets have different emphasis on different clinical areas. And some have more cath labs than others, and that makes a difference, for example. And so with our emerging market leaders able to have more influence and control over the resources that's helped accelerate our growth as well. So I think the fundamentals are back, especially in China. Our -- some changes we've made to our -- like our model and our incentives have helped as well and our continued investment in value products. You add all that up and I see this as a continued strength and a continued source of growth for the company over a decade plus. Karen, anything else? Karen Parkhill : Yes. I would just say on VBP, that can affect the quarter at an OU level, but we don't necessarily expect it to affect total Medtronic. Joshua Jennings : Great. Just maybe one quick follow-up. Any product launches that we should be thinking about as we build out our -- update our models for fiscal '25, particularly in these emerging markets, but China specifically? Thanks. Geoff Martha : Well, in China, specifically, we did just get approval for Ardian. So that will take some time to get into all the hospitals, but we think that's going to do well. Our -- we think our CST business, again separate from, I think, to some of the trends you're seeing in the US. We've got a strong local portfolio there and a nice flywheel of local innovation. So a local version of Mazor that's coming out a local version of our cell station navigation that's coming out. So I see strength there. And then we've also started local manufacturing of some of our cardiology products. We -- I was just there a couple of weeks ago where we -- I saw the -- our local pacemaker coming off the line right next to the giant Tesla plant. We have plant. Not quite as big, but it's a damn good implantable technology plant, and we're proud of that. So I think those would be some of the areas that I'd highlight in China. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Josh. Take the next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Rich Newitter at Truist Securities. Rich, please go ahead. Richard Newitter : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe first, just on Spine. You continue to put -- the turnaround in that franchise continues to unfold high-single-digit growth. And following up to an earlier question, I appreciate that you're growing faster than your closest competitor there. But you've talked about potential disruption from recent M&A and spine mergers as kind of being a once-in-a-decade opportunity. So can you comment on what, if any, contribution you've been seeing from the M&A environment to your benefit already and what's out in front? You mentioned rep hire, you mentioned competitive conversions. I'm just trying to get a sense of whether we're at the point where you're seeing those benefits? Or are there still more to come out in front, we could maybe even see these growth rates accelerate? Brett Wall : Yes, Rich, it's Brett Wall. Thanks for the question. We are seeing contribution now from some of those conversions that we're seeing really across the United States, as you know, which is the largest spine market. And we see that continuing over the next several quarters here. And as Geoff mentioned, it's a combination of this technology portfolio, including AI surgical planning, including robotics, including power and surgical instrumentation imaging and navigation, putting that all together is creating this very attractive place where very good teams and reps and groups of people want to come together to work with Medtronic. So we have a very active program there. We're getting good contribution now, and we see that contribution continuing as we move forward. We have a very compelling story for those individuals to come along. And as was mentioned earlier, it's a lot more difficult now for companies that don't have that ecosystem to bring the customers and these individual teams of reps and others along in that process. So we see that continuing. We're going to continue to invest there. And as I mentioned, we have a compelling story for them to join Medtronic. Geoff Martha : Yes. I think taking a step back also, Rich, on this, this whole ecosystem approach, capital plus consumables and CST, that's largely informing what we're doing in surgical as well and how you acquire the capital with innovative financing and earn-outs and things like that, this is helping us. And that's what gives us confidence also in our surgical business as we bring in robotics, with Hugo there as well. And the second point I'll make is, look, you're starting to see the turnaround in both diabetes and CST. And the point there is when we focus on these type of opportunities, we're going to get results here, and you're seeing it there. And we're putting that same kind of focus on Hugo and our broader surgical business and our AFib business CAS. These are two big opportunities that we're focused on. And there's a lot of -- I know there's a lot of questions that we get on those two areas. And like CST and diabetes with the kind of focus we're putting on it at the leadership level of the company, I'm confident you're going to see those be growth drivers for the company as we move forward. And you're seeing it now in CAS. Richard Newitter : Thank you. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Rich. Go ahead. Richard Newitter : And just on the robot in surgical, you're nearing the completion for the Euro trial. Just curious if you could provide an estimation, timing wise. Should we be expecting we could see a submission in '25 and potential launch end of fiscal '25, early fiscal '26? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Geoff Martha : I'll let Mike Marinaro answer that question. Mike? Mike Marinaro : Yes. So thanks for the question. I won't estimate when we will submit for the urology indication, but also note that we are nearing completion. And in the quarter, we also initiated our indication work for both our GYN indication as well as Hernia indication, which will be really important for us as we move into general surgery. So critical that we are now operating across multiple indications. So that as we come into the market, we can have a series of launches across each of those to capture larger and larger pieces of the market, and we're seeing good execution early execution inside of each of those studies as well. Richard Newitter : Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Thanks, Rich. We are just past the top of the hour. So we'll take one more question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick : Our final question will come from Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Miksic : Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just a couple of follow-ups on some of the pipeline programs that you talked about. Just to frame expectations around for Ardian, Simplicity, when does that, do you think, start to noticeably show up and start to demonstrate some of the potential that you were describing earlier, Geoff? And then on diabetes, you filed. I wasn't sure if I recall whether you filed Simplera with 780G for repeats, for adults, for both? And I guess the question is, is that mean that before this coming fiscal is out that we'll start to see some traction with that new sensor in the US? Thanks. Geoff Martha : Thanks for the questions, Matt. I'll have the subject matter experts answer those. I'll start with Sean on Simplicity. Sean Salmon : Yes. Thanks, Matt. As I think you know, the most important thing for us to establish reimbursement. That's the catalyst which starts to make things tick upward for us. We'll look toward the final inpatient rule for outpatient reimbursement. That will be in the kind of late July time frame. I don't know if that's going to be there. But the vast majority of our procedures are going to occur in the outpatient setting, and we're pursuing both transition payment there as well as, most importantly, national coverage determination with evidence development. And we're in active conversations with CMS on that and, of course, pay private payers. So we expect the contribution to begin this year, as Geoff said, at the outset, paying down timing. It's not like we have a statutory date on these things, it's just when these come through. But suffice it to say, there's a huge effort to get that reimbursement established in place. We're also changing guidelines in Europe. We expect that to happen late this summer, which will help with adoption there. And we've got new approvals, not just China, but also Health Canada. Those would be catalysts. But it really is -- the most important thing is unlock on reimbursement and that's a full court press for us. Geoff Martha : Okay. Que, you want to answer the diabetes one? Que Dallara : Yes. We filed the Simplera Sync, which is the integrated sensor with 780G system in the US in line with expectations. It's hard to comment on the timing with the agency, but we're eagerly awaiting approval for that system. And just to remind everyone that we had limited launch of the Simplera Sync with 780 in Europe in five countries. That's going well and we're looking forward to expanding that to a full commercial launch in the summer. And then, of course, Simplera within InPen, we launched late last year. It's now in 15 countries, also doing quite well. So we anticipate that what we're seeing in the OUS markets will also happen in the US. Matt Miksic : Excellent. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Geoff Martha : Thanks, Ryan. And thanks for the questions, everybody. We definitely appreciate your continued interest in Medtronic. And we hope you'll join us for our Q1 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Tuesday, August 20th. We'll update you on our progress against all these strategies and our commitments. So with that, thanks for spending time with us today, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ryan Weispfenning : Good morning and welcome to another Medtronic Earnings Day. I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations, and I appreciate that you're joining us this morning for our Fiscal 2025 First Quarter Video Earnings Webcast. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Gary Corona, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Gary will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on July 26, 2024, and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2025. After our prepared remarks, the Executive VPs from each of our four segments will join us and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements, divisional and geographic revenue summaries, and non-GAAP reconciliations. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause our actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and first quarter revenue in the current and prior year reported as other. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the fourth quarter fiscal 2024 and are made on an as-reported basis. All references to share gains or losses are on a revenue and year-over-year basis and compare our first fiscal quarter against our competitor's second calendar quarter. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earning during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter. Geoff Martha : Hello everyone and thanks for tuning in today. As you saw in our results, we're exceeding our commitments and increasing our outlook for the rest of the year. This is now our seventh quarter in a row of delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth. And we drove earnings growth, increasing adjusted EPS to 3% on a reported basis and 8% constant currency. And we're tracking to delivering high single-digit EPS growth on a reported basis as we exit the fiscal year. Our underlying markets are healthy. We're driving operating rigor. And new product innovation is fueling our diversified growth across many large secular growth markets that matter. At the same time, we continue to invest in our pipeline, which we expect to drive growth in the short, medium, and the long-term. We are at the front end of many new product cycles, in markets like diabetes, pulse field ablation, TAVR, neuromodulation, hypertension, and robotics. We're focused on driving scale across our manufacturing, technology, and commercial organizations, and making progress on our ongoing portfolio management work. Now, as we deliver innovation and continue to execute on our transformation, this will lead to strong returns for our shareholders. Now let's turn to the details of our Q1 results and discuss our performance. Looking first at our highest gross businesses, combined they grew 8% and made up 21% of our revenue. We expect their contribution to our overall growth to increase in the coming quarters, as we continue to launch new technology. Starting with cardiac ablation solutions, we're at one of those moments in med-tech, where a new technology is causing a rapid shift in the treatment of a disease. In this case, PFA is that technology for AFib. We've been investing in and developing this technology over many years. We're well positioned here, and we're confident in our ability to execute and take advantage of this opportunity. In-line with what we said last quarter, our CAS growth rate accelerated in Q1, growing over 6%. We're seeing rapid market adoption of our PulseSelect PFA catheters, and its growth is more than offsetting [crowd declines] (ph). The PulseSelect launch has been successful, with more than 550 physicians in 20 countries having treated over 10,000 patients. To meet the strong market demand, we're dramatically increasing our PulseSelect catheter manufacturing capacity and expanding into new accounts. As a result, we expect PulseSelect to meaningfully accelerate our overall CAS growth rate through this fiscal year, including a strong acceleration in Q2. And then we have our differentiated Sphere-9 focal catheter. This all-in-one catheter can perform high-density mapping as well as pulse field and RF ablations. We expect Sphere-9 will allow us to capture more revenue per procedure, as it will take the place of other competitors mapping and RF catheters. We're in limited launch in Europe, and we've submitted to FDA for approval earlier this calendar year. As we launch and scale Sphere-9 and our fair mapping system, we expect our cash growth will accelerate even further over time, as we reach and then exceed market growth in this large and fast growing $9 billion cardiac ablation space. Next, in Structural Heart, we continue to deliver high single-digit growth excluding the impact of our Harmony Pulmonary Valve that we relaunched last year. During the quarter, we started with the limited US launch of our Evolut FX plus TAVR valve and have now begun full market launch this month. FX plus is important for two reasons : one, it allows for easier coronary access due to the large windows in its frame; and two it creates an additional opportunity to reiterate our positive SMART trial results with our customers. SMART showed our superior valve performance in small annulus patients who are primarily women, and this was just another proof-point in our broader focus on health equity. The SMART patient population is sizable, making up about 40% of the TAVR space. With this combination of FX plus, our superior four-year low-risk data and SMART data, we expect to continue to grow at or above the market in the quarters ahead. In Surgical Robotics, we are investing in building a foundation for future growth. In Q1, our installed base continued to grow and utilization per system steadily increased. And in the US, we've now achieved the targeted enrollment for the EXPAND EURO trial. This is a meaningful milestone. And beyond that, enrollment in procedures in our other two US indication studies : hernia and gynecology are going well. We also continue to make progress bringing our advanced surgical technologies to Hugo such as ICG fluorescent imaging and LigaSure vessel sealing. Next in Diabetes, we had another strong quarter, growing 13%, with double-digit growth in both the US and international markets. In the US, we reached the one-year milestone of the launch of the MiniMed 780G AID system. We are driving high single-digit growth in pump revenue and over 30% growth in CGM revenue with our high CGM attachment. In international markets, we initiated the full market release of the Simplera Sync sensor, and we're getting \u2013 we are just getting great feedback on the ease of insertion and its usage. This adds to the already high satisfaction of our 780G system, where we've been the Number One rated AID system by DQ&A for the past two quarters. So we are confident in Simplera and our CGM pipeline. And to add to this, two weeks ago, we announced our global partnership with Abbott, where we'll bring to market an integrated CGM based on Abbott's most advanced CGM platform. The sensor will integrate exclusively with our AID and SMART MDI systems. It will also allow us to offer more choice to patients, increase our installed base and grow our diabetes revenue. And we expect to do this while maintaining the same revenue per patient and being neutral to diabetes gross margin. Look, we are committed to being Number #1 in the fast-growing AID and smart MDI space, and this partnership will help ensure just that. Now turning to hypertension. Securing broad reimbursement remains key to unlocking the opportunity to our simplicity blood pressure procedure. We were pleased that CMS has finalized the inpatient payment and has now proposed an outpatient payment. And we continue to engage with CMS at the national and local levels to establish coverage, a key enabler so that this therapy can reach patients. Now this is important as hypertension affects more than 1 billion people globally and nearly half of all US adults. Despite the availability of numerous classes of pharmaceuticals, only one in four adults in the US have their hypertension under control. Furthermore, more than 700,000 deaths in the US every year are directly attributable to hypertension. And the burden of hypertension cost the US health care system between $100 billion and $200 billion a year. So you can see why there is just an important role for our simplicity procedure to cost-effectively improve public health. Now turning to our synergistic businesses. Neuromodulation was a highlight this quarter, growing 10%, well above the market. This is a business where the investments we've made over several years in sensing technology in the brain and the nervous system are now paying off. Sensing and closed-loop technology is becoming foundational for the Neuromod space. It's reinvigorating these markets, and we have a clear lead. First in Pain Stim, we grew 11%. This was the first quarter of our inceptive launch in the US. Inceptive is our first closed-loop spinal cord stimulator and it is transforming the way we treat chronic pain. The device automatically senses and adjust stimulation 50 times a second, 24/7 with no required interaction from the patient. And the therapy is delivered from the smallest and the thinnest closed-loop SCS device on the market. It also has the best full body conditional MRI access. The other big driver of Neuromod growth was our brain modulation business, which grew 14% on the continued launch of Percept RC with BrainSense technology. Percept transmits electrical signals to specific brain targets affected by debilitating neurological disorders like Parkinson's. It then captures and records these signals equipping physicians with the valuable data and the insights needed to personalize the therapy. And just last week, we became the first and only DBS company to receive FDA approval to offer DBS surgery, while the patient is asleep. Now this innovation means a less stressful surgery for the patient and potentially shorter procedure times. We look forward to continuing to advance our leadership position in brain modulation. Now looking at our established market leaders. Combined, they made up just under half of our revenue and grew 5%. Collectively, we can depend on this diversification not only for reliable revenue growth, but also their disproportionate contribution to our profits and cash flow that we can then invest in higher growth areas. Cardiac Rhythm Management grew high single digits with high single-digit growth in Defibrillation Solutions and low double-digit growth in cardiac pacing therapies. Our Micro leadless pacemaker franchise grew over 20%, as the market continues to adopt our latest generation of devices. In Surgical, we grew low-single digits. This was lower growth than prior quarters, primarily driven by the difficult comparison from back order fulfillment in the first half of the last fiscal year, as well as the Korean market slowdown from the ongoing physician strikes. Now we expect that Surgical will return to more normalized growth in the back half of the fiscal year as these comparisons ease. And in Cranial and Spine Technologies, we grew mid-single digits. Our spine business continues to just really outperform the market with 7% global and 9% US core spine growth. This sustained share capture is being driven by our AiBLE ecosystem. AiBLE's differentiated features and the sheer scale around the world is -- it's a winning formula for our Spine business. It's good for patients and surgeons, and it's changing the competitive dynamics in Spine. AiBLE is helping us win share and attract the best sales reps and distributors to join our Medtronic team. With that, I now want to welcome Gary Corona, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, to his first Medtronic earnings broadcast. Gary has taken over for Karen Parkhill to whom we wish all the best as she starts her next chapter. Gary joined us a little less than two years ago after an impressive career with General Mills. He's been leading our corporate finance team and has been instrumental in enhancing both our capabilities and our rigor, which has been a key enabler to our beats and raises. And as he stepped into the role, we haven't missed a beat. So I want to welcome Gary. Gary Corona : Thanks, Geoff, and I too want to thank Karen for all her contributions to Medtronic and her support of me personally. I'm energized to step into this role and continue the momentum that we have as a company. I'm honored to lead our talented global finance team and want to send a big thank you to the entire Medtronic organization for your support. I've been able to hit the ground running, and I'm excited to work together with Geoff and the leadership team to drive performance and achieve our financial commitments. I'm looking forward to having conversations with many of you in the investment community over the coming weeks. Now I'll recap our Q1 financials and give you some additional details on our outlook. We started this fiscal year by continuing to deliver on our commitments with revenue growth at 5.3%, a full point above the midpoint of our guidance. This translated into EPS that was $0.03 ahead of our guidance midpoint. We are driving diversified growth, and you can see this strength come through when you look by business or by geography, as both new product innovation and commercial execution is fueling our results. Our cardiovascular portfolio accelerated to high single-digit growth, and we saw continued momentum in neuroscience and diabetes. Our US growth also accelerated on contributions from cardiac rhythm management, PFA and neuromodulation. And our international markets grew in the high single digits, including mid-teens growth in emerging markets. Moving down the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin was 65.9%, down 50 basis points, but ahead of expectations. As expected, the decline was entirely driven by the 80 basis point impact of currency. However, we continue to make progress on our underlying margin improvement activities. In Q1, pricing from our new innovation and our cost-out programs offset inflation, resulting in a 30 basis point increase in our gross margin on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted operating margin was 24.4%, in-line with expectations. This was a decline of 40 basis points versus last year, but up 60 basis points in constant currency. Turning to capital allocation. Our philosophy hasn't changed. We continue to balance investments for future growth, including tuck-in M&A, with returning capital to shareholders primarily through our dividend and from time-to-time, through opportunistic share repurchases. This calendar year, we've seen a significant value opportunity in our shares and allocated more capital to share repurchase. Since our Q4 earnings call in May, we repurchased an incremental $1.5 billion of our shares and in total, $4 billion over the past two quarters. We believe these buybacks will have an attractive return given the conviction we have in growing our revenue, earnings and free cash flow. And as we go forward, we'll continue to focus on tuck-in M&A. Now let's cover guidance. Given our Q1 outperformance and positive momentum, we are raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect fiscal 2025 organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 5%, an increase from the prior range of 4% to 5%. For Q2, we are expecting to deliver another quarter of mid-single digit growth in the top line. And we'd have remodeled organic revenue growth of approximately 4.5%. Based on recent rates, FX would have an unfavorable impact to fiscal 2025 in the range of $110 million to $210 million, including $10 million to $60 million in the second quarter. Moving down the P&L, we continue to expect our operating margins to expand this year, as we drive efficiencies while also investing behind our product launches and in our long-term pipeline. And based on recent rates, currency becomes much less of an impact to our margins and bottom-line after the second quarter. Taking this all together, we're raising our fiscal '25 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.42 to $5.50, an increase from the prior range of $5.40 to $5.50. For the second quarter, we expect EPS of $1.24 to $1.26. The fiscal year '25 guidance range continues to include an unfavorable 5% impact from foreign currency, including an 8% impact in Q2. Further details on our annual guidance can be found in the guidance slide in our presentation. To wrap up, I want to emphasize that we are laser-focused on driving top-line growth and restoring the earnings power of the company. You saw that in our Q1 results, and you see it in our outlook for the rest of the year. We expect our EPS growth to accelerate in the back half as the impact from currency lessons, exiting the year with high single-digit growth. Geoff, back to you. Geoff Martha : All right. Thanks Gary. Now before we go to the analyst questions, I want to close with a few thoughts. Since becoming CEO, we've made a lot of changes to this company, all designed to improve performance. Chief among these strategies is how we allocate capital to disproportionately focus our R&D, our venture and our M&A investments on the highest growth market opportunities, while still making sure our other businesses are competitive. And now you are seeing the payoff, as we are at the front end of some exciting new product cycles. You're seeing it in diabetes and in neuromodulation, in TAVR and PFA. And as I look at our pipeline, I expect this momentum to continue, as we invest heavily in future growth opportunities like hypertension and surgical robotics. We've also been working on the fundamentals. The foundation of this company is now much stronger. Quality and operations are in a better spot. And we're investing in enhancing our digital capabilities across the company to improve our speed. We're playing more offense. We're building capacity in strategic growth areas. We're looking to further increase organic investments and are on the hunt for the right tuck-in M&A opportunities. We've integrated a performance-driven mindset and an incentive structure that reinforces this. And in some cases, we've changed leadership, to add increased operating rigor to our mission driven culture. Now taken all together, this is now translating into the top-line growth momentum and improved earnings power that you are seeing in our results. And as we continue to execute, this will create meaningful value for society, and for shareholders. Finally, I would like to thank all of our employees around the world. I realize that we've driven a lot of change, and that can be uncomfortable. I appreciate all that you've done to embrace these changes, and it is rewarding to see your efforts paying off. As we look to the next 75 years of Medtronic, I'm excited about the possibilities before us. Together, we are building a stronger and more resilient company. So thanks for all that you do to fulfill our mission and to serve patients. So with that, let us move to Q&A where we are going to try to get as many analysts as possible. [Operator Instructions] If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Brad can you please give the instructions for asking a question? A - Brad Welnick : [Operator Instructions] Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Gary and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of Diabetes; Mike Marinaro, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical portfolio; Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience portfolio. We'll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue. We'll take the first question from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Geoff, congrats on a really nice quarter here. Maybe my first question here is the organic execution in the quarter, well above your guidance expectations, I think north of 100 basis points. It is also about your annual guidance, right? It seems like it was pretty broad based. Based on your current outlook implies like your back half should be below what your 1Q performance was right. So maybe just talk about sustainability of 1Q, why these trends can sustain in the back half? Were there any one-offs that drove Q1 performance? Geoff Martha : Hi, Vijay, good to hear from you. Yes, let me just answer that question directly. There was no one-offs that drove the performance. And overall, I'd say, it is sustainable because like I said in the commentary, we are in the beginning stages of some really exciting product cycles here into high-growth markets. In our Q1, I'd see a couple of things sort of like neuromod getting to double digits. That is really all about the new technology that we've missed the first quarter, we had both our pain stim closed-loop therapy inceptive, as well as DBS closed-loop therapy out there at the same time. And that growth is really driven by -- that's -- we think that's the new foundational technology sensing in the neuromod market and it's -- that growth is driven strictly by demand of these new products and pricing uplifts that came with them. Structural Heart, there's a lot of questions around the market there. And we're seeing consistent market growth as we've signaled in that high single digit and we're just really getting -- launching FX+ going from limited market at least a full market release, which is exciting. Plus the accumulation of all the data, smart, low risk, et cetera, is a real tailwind for us. Two businesses that had a particularly strong Q1 that I'm not sure is going to -- at that high level that throughout the year, one is Diabetes. Diabetes should continue to have growth well above the company average. But we're now annualizing the US launch of 780G. And so I can see diabetes in the teens last quarter. I'm not sure we are going to be able to sustain that the whole year. And CRM also had a really good quarter, some great -- we have a really nice product portfolio across the CRM, all the CRM segments. But we are not banking on CRM growing 8% every quarter. Those two -- there was nothing onetime about them, but just really strong execution. And I think across the company, I could just keep going on the list. There's just a lot of new products out there in the early stages. So overall, we feel good about the underlying fundamentals and where we are headed, and we're focused on delivering on our commitments and issuing guidance, issuing guidance sets us up for success. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Geoff. And maybe one follow-up related to that on the guidance question. Gary, welcome to your first earnings call. The gross margin performance here in Q1 really strong. But your guidance still does assume a pretty meaningful step up in operating margins for back half, right? And when I look at your EPS guidance, [low-end] (ph) was tweaked, but it looks like there was some benefit from share repurchases. I don't know if your prior guidance had baked in a [1.5 billion share repo] (ph). So maybe just talk about your margin visibility for second half and did that change over the last three months? Gary Corona : Yes. Thanks, Vijay and it is nice to meet you. I look forward to having a chance to meet all of you in person. Let me tackle your question about buyback first. And I'll take you through the puts and takes of the first quarter EPS. Our EPS starts with our top-line. And as Geoff mentioned, our revenue growth was really strong, a full point higher than the midpoint of our guide. And Geoff talked about the highlights. The midpoint of our guide, $0.02 of the $0.03 was really driven by the top-line strength that he mentioned. Gross margins were strong, about 40 bps ahead of consensus and operating margin was in-line. Below the line, there were some moving pieces, and that netted to about $0.01 with the benefit that you mentioned from the share count helping. But we also had lower interest income and some pressure on the tax rate. So that's a little bit more visibility into Q1. As we think about the leverage first half, second half, the underlying leverage we are driving is pretty similar on a constant currency basis with high single digit every quarter. The ramp is really an FX story. Significant pressure on the first half due to FX, and that will wane in the back half. Constant currency growth ticks up slightly, as we drive stronger revenue growth as a number of our therapies get to full market release. And as you know, we tend to have a pretty strong fourth quarter on the margin front. So that's the story on how the leverage will play out throughout the year. Vijay Kumar : Great. Thanks guys. Geoff Martha : Thanks Vijay. Take the next question please Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on a good quarter. With my one, I wanted to ask about Diabetes. This is a pretty big shift in strategy for you. You've always been the provider with both the pump and the algorithm and the CGM, all in one. Now with Simplera about to launch, maybe just walk us through the strategy of why partnering with Abbott was in your best interest. Does this change your strategy at all? And how do we think about external versus internal investment in Diabetes moving forward? Thanks. Geoff Martha : Yes, Robbie. I'll let Que answer that question. Go ahead, Que. Que Dallara : Thanks, Robbie. I would say our strategy hasn't changed at all. I think what's really changed in the market is really a widespread recognition that AID really does provide better outcomes than CGM alone or MDI alone. And we always knew that there was a large installed base of users that wanted access to our technology, our AID system. We still believe in the system benefits exceed the sum of the parts, as you mentioned, wrapping it all together with our algorithm, the CGM, the pumping devices. And the typical integration you see in the market is puts a burden -- puts a technology burden on the part of patients. And so we wanted to find a way to provide the one Medtronic experience, the one phone number you can call for patients that may prefer a different sensor. And we are pleased to say that we found a path that works for patients from an experience standpoint, as well as for Abbott and for ourselves. And so that's what I would say, would be in response to your question. The strategy hasn't changed. We've just found a way to expand access to a broader installed base. And I think what hasn't changed is really our commitment towards the system, our confidence in our CGM. The Simplera launches, Simplera and Simplera Sync launches in Europe have gone very well. We are very pleased with the early experience. And we're pleased that we now have FDA approval for Simplera in the US, and we are working with the agency to get Simplera sync approved as well for integration with the 780G system. Robert Marcus : Great Thanks for that. Geoff Martha : Thanks Robbie. Next question please Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America Global Research. Travis please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter. I'll ask my one question on TAVR. And I just wanted to get kind of what you're sensing in the market today given some of the comments from the competitor there? And looking forward, when you think about the FX Plus launch, how do you expect that to impact the market, impact the share? And is that going to help you with some of the smart data and how you see the TAVR market playing out? Thanks a lot. Geoff Martha : Hi, Travis, I'm going to hand that one over to Sean. Sean Salmon : Perhaps thanks for the question. Look the TAVR market, we think is pretty solid. I think we're growing in line with the market in high single digits right now. And of course, the data momentum that we have, the low-risk data versus surgery. I think that's been very compelling, and we're going to read out 5-year on that data in the coming year here as well. And of course, SMART Day has really gotten a lot of attention for the right treatment strategy for small annulus and particularly in women, and that's resonated really globally to as small annulus is sort of a function of body habitats as well. FX Plus has done exceptionally well and its early launch. We did a full limited market release in the month of July, and we saw that momentum really pick up. So I think that will afford a really good continued access or continued growth of that part of the segment. What people really like is those bigger windows, you can then align onto the native coronary anatomy. So overlapping the costs to making sure that you get that material alignment and preserving future access. So that's all done without any trade-off and deliverability. It's got the features of FX, which really improve the usability of that device. And of course, the US is moving into full market launch right now. And within this year, we'll also obtain approvals in other geographies, which will keep the momentum going. So for us, I think the market is working really well and we're excited to bring this new technology. Travis Steed : Great. Thanks a lot. Geoff Martha : Thanks Travis. Next question please Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS Securities. Danielle please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Good morning everyone. Congrats on a good start to the year here. Que, I just wanted to follow up on diabetes. And just how should we be thinking about this partnership with Abbott. Appreciating you're not giving time lines here. But how are you thinking about it and how it could grow the installed base, sort of what are you thinking about? I mean, Abbott has a pretty large installed base today. So should we be thinking about that as low-hanging fruit for the pump side of the business. Any more color you can give on how we should think about this changing the trajectory for the Diabetes business. Thanks so much. Que Dallara : I mean I think the most obvious opportunity are for a very large installed base of users that prefer the Abbott sensor to now have access to our technology. So unfortunately, I can't give you time lines, but rest assured that we're working as fast as we can to get to incorporate that sensor into our system and really providing that one Medtronic experience where there's one single app patients can choose between 2 sensor options, but still experience our AID system and the automation that comes with our algorithm. And so that's the user experience we want to bring to the market. We think that's pretty differentiated, and it allows us to tap into the largest CGM installed base in the world in addition to our own -- growing our own installed base. Danielle Antalffy : Thanks Danielle. Next question Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo Securities. Larry please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. For my one question, I wanted to ask about the progress with Hugo for Mike and Jeff. So it sounds like you've reached the targeted enrollment in EXPAND Euro, the pivotal US trial. When are we going to see the data? What's the time-line for US filing? Could we see potential launch this year or next year? And Geoff, there's still questions around your commitment to Hugo. Just maybe put any of those concerns to rest here. Thank you. Geoff Martha : All right. Thanks, Larry. Well, maybe I'll let Mike answer the first couple of questions, and then I'll come in afterwards. Mike Marinaro : Yes. Good morning, Larry. So on Hugo, we are happy with the progress we're making in the clinical work. As mentioned, we have reached targeted enrollment. There is still work to do as we reach the final endpoints and then completing the filing. So we won't be giving a specific date in terms of submission, but very good progress, and very appreciative of the work that we're doing together with our surgeon partners and our teams. Also, as noted, we are making good progress in the enrollment of both hernia and the gynecology clinical series that will allow us to then have a cadence of indications, which will be critical to the US launch. So very good work across the clinical series and again, appreciative of the work of our surgeon partners and teams. Geoff? Geoff Martha : Yes. So look, as Mike said, look, there's a couple of things on Hugo here, 2 inflection points that need to happen for us to see the impact at the Medtronic level, the US approval and then just getting our leading instrumentation onto the robot and other capabilities. And as Mike mentioned, we're making progress on both. So this is like a midterm growth driver for us, I'd say, beyond the fiscal year. But get back to your question on our commitment, Larry. We're absolutely committed to this. And with all due -- it's -- we do think robotics is really across many different surgical areas, including orthopedics, where we play in Spine is a big driver in the space. And we're committed to being not just part of it, but being -- helping to lead that like we are doing in Spine. And with -- now we are up against a really strong entrenched competitor here in the soft tissue space. But we are committed -- we have levers to pull. We have a great surgery franchise. We've learned quite a bit about robotics over the years. And also the understanding that it's more than just the robot. It's a lot of other technology that goes in there imaging, navigation, the instrumentation AI, so the digital piece. So there is a lot of levers to pull, and we are committed and we are confident. And I'd just point back to a couple of years ago, other franchises that people were questioning, can you compete whether it is spine or whether it's diabetes or neuromod. We're focused on it. You've seen those all get to a much, much better spot with the focus and investment, and that's where we are on surgery. And my level of confidence on this is high because of the levers we have to pull, the team we have in place, the franchise we have. But knowing that the entrenched competitor is very strong. So understanding that, but still knowing having confidence in our team. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thank you. Geoff Martha : Thanks Larry. Next question please Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from David Rescott at Baird Equity Research. David please go ahead. David Rescott : Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong start to the year here. Geoff, I heard your comments on being on the hunt for M&A. I'm curious if you could help us kind of understand maybe what areas strategically you think make the most sense in the portfolio when you -- and think about the size of the Medtronic portfolio, I guess how do you balance that kind of near term, what can be needle moving versus what can move the needle over the two-year to three-year period and three-year to five-year period? Thank you. Geoff Martha : Thanks for the question, David. Yes, I mean, look on the M&A side, this is one of the areas, just as part of our larger capital allocation strategy, right? Our -- we talk about little C capital allocation and big C capital allocation. We're talking about allocating our money to the areas of highest growth. And the M&A strategy has to play with our organic strategy and both are pointed towards the highest growth areas. Ablation -- AFib ablation is a case in point where we do the [Affair acquisition] (ph) as well as a needle crossing acquisition. That's -- those are the areas that we're pointed to. But we are still focused on value-creating tuck-in M&A. So with that growth and margin profile that I just talked about. So it's -- I don't want to point out specific areas other than the high-growth areas that are whether they be a product tuck-in to an existing business or an adjacency to an existing business tuck-in. That's where we are focused. And I think nothing is changed there, except that I think over the last 1.5 years or so, we've had a lot of operational focus areas that we've had. And that's been the focus is really getting the operations. Our operations footprint in a better spot, our back order is down, things like that, quality in a better spot. We are in a much better spot there, and I think can focus more of our energies on M&A. And the explanation I just gave is where we'll be focused. Geoff Martha : Thanks David. Next question please Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Matt Taylor at Jefferies. Matt please go ahead. Matt Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to double-click on some of the comments that you made on the Structural Heart market. And I'm really curious about your thoughts on capacity now and going forward. And I know you said that you haven't seen signs of a slowdown in the market. But do you have concerns about capacity there longer-term or more broadly, is that a limiting factor in that business or any of your businesses? And how would you deal with that as an organization to help free up more capacity to help your therapies run through? Geoff Martha : Well, look, I'd say overall -- I'm going to hand this over to Sean, Matt. But the structural heart space, TAVR, Mitral is coming, tricuspid. It's very underpenetrated still. So I do see a huge and then patient benefits are clear. Sean mentioned the data, whether it be low risk or now our SMART trial. The data is clear. It's underpenetrated -- and so I still think this is a strong growth market. I'll let Sean touch again on kind of where we are, where the market is, if you will, on capacity and what we're seeing and then maybe come back. Go ahead, Sean. Sean Salmon : Yes. Thanks for the question. We're not hearing from our customers about capacity constraints, of course. So our sample size may be a little smaller than our competitor. But we ask about the future with the service line as they add additional things into the Structural Heart component of it. It doesn't seem like at the operator level, there's concerns in the US, of course, the freedom of beds for post procedures that goes beyond TAVR. That's been a challenge. But we are seeing some shifting of procedures to lower acuity settings to make room. And of course, the valve clinic, which works these patients up. That's something you just add capacity too when you need future capacity to expand it and you get a long runway to look at it. So I think with the expanding indications, we're pursuing a moderate [aortostenosis] (ph) population, which is about 2.5 million people in the US and transcatheter mitral replacement valves and things like that. So we'll work with centers to make sure that they have adequate training of operators and help them to expand capacity if it needs to be. But in the short run, I really don't see a challenge. And I think hospitals have a long enough runway to plan for the space that they need it. So I don't think it's a constraint on the future growth prospects of Structural Heart in total. Geoff Martha : Yes. And look I agree with you on this one. And when we see situations like that, when there is capacity. In the past, we've stepped in and helped hospital -- our hospital partners with capacity. Like in Europe, many -- several years ago, we helped build out a number of -- and managed a number of cath labs when there was cath lab capacity constraints across Western Europe, I could see us doing this in the ASC space in the US to help build out that. And we'll partner, we talk with the imaging companies because a lot of the capacity is tied to imaging and work with them and work with our health care delivery partners to build out that capacity. So that's how we would handle it, if we were to see an issue, but we're not -- as Sean said, we're not hearing that in TAVR. Matt Taylor : Great. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Geoff Martha : Thanks Matt. Next question please Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from David Roman at Goldman Sachs. David, please go ahead. David Roman : Thank you. And good morning. I was hoping you could go into a little more detail on [Affera] (ph). Geoff, you mentioned that it's still -- obviously, pending FDA review and that you're in limited market release outside the United States. Can you maybe give us a little bit of perspective of what you've seen in Europe now about a year post CE Mark and whether we should use that as a proxy for thinking about how this product ramps in the US. Geoff Martha : Sure. Thanks for the question, David. A lot of interest, obviously, and in our cash business and Afib right now. And maybe I'll go back to Sean on this one. Sean Salmon : Yes, Dave, thanks for the question. The demand for PFA has really been unbelievably strong. And we're ramping up our capacity, as Geoff mentioned, meet that stronger growing demand right now. And those gains that we are seeing are more than offsetting that Cryo business, of course. And we're really in a unique position having this offering of both a single shot approach with our PulseSelect and then the point-by-point approach with Affera. PulseSelect, it's really gotten more case volume so far as we're moving that launch both within Europe and the United States. And what we're hearing from customers is the precision and predictability of the handling of the catheter. And importantly, that it shows up really well, both on mapping systems and on ultrasound. And that's important because you got to put the electrodes in the right spot of tissue, so you get you get good ablation in isolation without doing extraneous injury, and that's really been appreciated. And of course, the point-by-point approach with a Affera is really unique and differentiated for us as well. The same catheter being able to create this beautiful map and you can use either energy source, depending on where you want to be anatomically to avoid things like coronary spasm and the Isthmus lines. And also, the lattice tip, it's a really maybe underappreciated part of this Sphere-9 catheter. It's got this lattice that has excellent electrode stability, and it's 3 times wider than a normal kind of ablation electrode, you use for RF. So the precision and speed of that is really fantastic. So look, on the technology side, everything is going really well. You're asking about ramping in Europe, there are more cost constraints in Europe, of course, than what we see in markets like the US and Japan, where new technology even at a higher price seems to get adopted. So the uptick of PFA would be relatively slower but still robust as we go ahead with this technology. I think there's some lingering questions on durability, and we'll see some data at the upcoming AP HRS meeting, where we'll show longer-term durability of our PulseSelect catheters. We've already demonstrated that with Sphere-9. And I'd say, look, the opportunity to offer patients something that's really safe, really effective last a long time I think really just open up the aperture for more and more patients to flow through. Waiting list or a challenge for that business, and I think having a more efficient procedure with great workflow really helps. And then, of course, we can leverage the larger portfolio of Medtronic to help with sort of the economics of this in any country and around the world. So look, I think the future for pulsed field ablation, we're just getting going, but this is going to be a really robust growth market for a long time to come. Geoff Martha : Yes. And just to emphasize something Sean said, we're really excited to be the only player with differentiated offerings in both the single shot and this point by point segments of the market. Both PulseSelect and Affera have differentiated features. Sean mentioned the handling of the catheter in PulseSelect, and that's really ramping for us quite well right now. And Affera, the ramp, obviously we don't have approval yet in the US and the ramp for that will be a bit a little behind where we are with PulseSelect. But PulseSelect is doing really well. And I think it's -- I think you just don't -- yes, I think the analyst community is kind of has moved past PulseSelect a little bit. And I'm not sure that's the right call. I mean it's doing really well. Geoff Martha : Thanks David. We will take the next question please Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Jayson Bedford at Raymond James. Jayson please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : Can you hear me okay? Geoff Martha : Yes, we can, Jayson. Jayson Bedford : Okay. Maybe just to follow on just on the [CAS question] (ph). One, I guess do you find that folks are waiting for in the US for Affera/Sphere-9? And then second, you did talk about an acceleration in [CAS revenue] (ph) going forward and acceleration in growth. Do you expect to be in a position to grow faster than the market exiting the year? Geoff Martha : Sean, do you want to take these? Sean Salmon : Yes. I guess on the first question, Jason, of course, people really, really want Affera. The vast majority of the ablation market favors point-by-point solutions with mapping in the United States, in particular. So the appeal of that product is really strong, but no one is waiting for it. I mean there's -- we're getting as much usage, maybe actually more from traditional point-by-point users, as we are getting from single-shot users. And as we bring that technology out I think the uptake is going to be pretty robust and rapid on top of what we are already doing with PulseSelect. So yes, I think that we've got the opportunity to grow faster than the market within this fiscal year, depending on the launch timing. Geoff Martha : Thank you Jayson. The next question please Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Joanne please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you so much for taking the question. Can we spend some time talking about the renal denervation market and the CMS NTAP for simplicity. How do you see this market developing now that reimbursement is getting behind the product? Thank you. Geoff Martha : Yes. Thanks for the question, Joanne. I mean, look, we're -- like I said before, I'm super excited about our [end] (ph). And it's good to see the reimbursement taking shape. With the CMS with the outpatient payment determined I'm sorry, the inpatient payment now determined and the outpatient payment on the table here it's getting closer to that unlock, that reimbursement unlock. And I'll let maybe Sean comment on this as well. Sean Salmon : Yes. Thanks, Geoff. And Joanne, thanks for the question. The payment is one part of it. We have coating and coverage, most importantly that need to come. So the coats are already established. We've got the -- as you noted, an NTAP we have inpatient coating, but outpatient is going to be more of the kind of procedure volume. We think less than 10% of the procedures are going to be done with more than a single midnight stayer on the inpatient setting. So really, it's that TPT or transitional pass-through payment that we're really waiting on. And we did hear from CMS on that this summer just this month where they're supporting our approach here for that application. This is a breakthrough device, so that helps to get into those kind of payment codes. And we expect to see that happen pretty soon. And of course, we are working really closely with CMS and with commercial payers on making sure we have coverage policies that are going to facilitate patient access. And again, being a breakthrough technology that helps you with the kind of urgency and speed at which we'll see CMS move. So look, I think all things on the reimbursement front are pointing exactly in the direction we are hoping to get them. And we're excited to ramp this technology up and make it available. The -- I will say that the level of excitement we're getting from physicians and from hospital systems about this new service line they can offer, as well as patients and the early outcomes for patients that have been treated on the sort of case-by-case basis have been really phenomenal. So look, I think that unlock, as we've said all along, is going be reimbursement, and we are marching toward that. So we're excited about the opportunity here. Geoff Martha : Thank you, Joanne. I think we've got time for maybe two more questions. We\u2019ll take the next question Brad. Brad Welnick : The next question comes from Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt please go ahead. Matt Miksic : Hi, thanks so much for the question. And I just -- If I could -- two quick follow-ups on some of the topics that have already been kind of explored here. The first for Sean, just on TAVR, I seem to remember that with the FX launch, there was some effect of price premium. There was some period of kind of stocking as you got into the launch. And I'm just wondering if you could shed any light on the sort of shape of the next few quarters, as you really begin to roll out FX Plus. And then the second for Gary on FX. I think there's some questions around the fact that the top line FX impact actually eased a little bit, but the FX impact on the bottom line, the headwind, 5% remain the same. If you could maybe just flesh out for us again where some of the impacts of FX are in the P&L and how we think about those as the year progresses. Thanks so much. Geoff Martha : Sean, do you want to take the question? Sean Salmon : Yes, sure. So we are -- across the board, we price for value. And we think there's more value so while modest price premium is built into our TAVR launch but it really is about picking up more volume on cases, more implants. And the dynamics that you typically see when you bring a new product out are customers burning down their shelf inventory as they put a small amount of stocking per valve size, like a par level as they ramp up for new technologies. And we saw both those dynamics occur in the early launch accounts where people are picking up a little bit of inventory, but also taking down inventory for the prior model, the FX in the case of the US. So it's always a sort of switching dynamics. But I think that, that's already baked into everything we are forecasting for the continued growth of this product. Gary Corona : Matt, this is Gary. And yes, as you mentioned, the US dollar has weakened a bit in the first quarter, and you'll see the benefits of that in the top line where we've communicated an improvement in the impact. If recent rates hold, we now expect FX on revenue to be a negative impact of $120 million to $210 million, and that compares to $275 million to $375 million. On the bottom line, the benefit is delayed due to our hedging program. But we do expect to realize the benefits in future years where FX will show up for us this year, will be a little bit different. It's going to show up a bit more in the gross margin line for us this year. And as we mentioned, the impact of foreign exchange will wane in the back half of the year and as our strong underlying earnings growth on a constant currency basis continues after we delivered a really nice shape of the P&L in the first quarter. We'll see that benefit flow through to reported EPS in the second half. Ryan Weispfenning : Okay. Thanks, Matt. We've got time for one more question. If we didn't get to your question, if there's any analyst on the line that still have questions, feel free to follow up with me after the call. We'll go to our last question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick : The final question comes from Patrick Wood at Morgan Stanley. Patrick please go ahead. Patrick Wood : Beautiful. Thank you so much for taking the question. Quite a high level one. But you guys are now, I guess getting the benefit of some heavy investment in previous years in the base business. And so I guess the question is, does that -- how does that make you feel of the interplay between reinvesting for growth on the product support side, on innovation relative to margins over the next, I don't know, year or two? Like how do you see that interplay going forward of earnings leverage and investing in the base business versus trying to drive the top-line? Any updated thoughts there would be great. Thanks. Geoff Martha : Sure. Thanks, Patrick. Look, we are committed to driving leverage down the P&L a company of our size. I mean that's something we should be able to do. We've got a lot of levers to pull that a lot of levers to pull to achieve that things and free up, at the same time free up even more money for investment, which I'll get to. But we are doing a number of things, measures to hold our kind of overhead and enabling expenses low -- flat to low so that we can reinvest more in the top-line. So we're doing things that we've really focused on -- just like we have capital allocation focus, we also have a focus on our headcount and allocating human capital where that goes and got that under in a good spot. We are driving -- we're holding our -- really trying to hold our G&A flat as a base case and then target areas we want to add for growth like for example, as the Ardian reimbursement comes in, we'll be adding more on our direct distribution for that. So a very disciplined process to put -- hold our expenses flat as a base case for G&A and then invest in the high-growth areas. And also through a number of programs to drive efficiencies in our enabling functions, including the use of AI to drive some of these efficiencies. So a lot going on there and really committed to investing back into the business for growth, whether it be on the direct distributor or the sales side, but more importantly, even on the R&D side. And so we've raised that organic investment of -- despite some of the challenges we've had over the last couple of years, we've raised that organic investment. And look, the tuck-in M&A, as I mentioned earlier, we'd like to kind of maybe over time here, increase the cadence of that to support the -- because of the cash flow of the company is strong to support the organic -- that organic R&D. So that's how we're thinking about it. I think we can drive that earning that leverage down the P&L. We've got a lot of different levers to pull to do that, at the same time, freeing up even more investment both from our income statement into R&D, but also using the strong cash flow from the balance sheet for tuck-in M&A. That's how we're looking at it, again prioritizing these high-growth areas, but at the same time, making sure that the rest of our businesses are competitive. And I feel like we've gotten to a good spot on that, and we'll see. We're seeing the benefits of that now, and we're going to continue to see the benefits of that on into the future.
