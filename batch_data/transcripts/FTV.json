With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first earnings call as an independent public company. This is certainly an exciting time for Fortive. We're pleased with our results as we delivered outstanding free cash flow performance and margin expansion despite core revenues being down slightly reflecting challenging economic conditions. On July 2, we successfully completed our separation from Danaher well ahead of schedule and with remarkable efficiency. We were able to achieve this outcome by leveraging the Fortive Business System tools and our deeply-rooted institutional knowledge and results orientation. Given our decentralized operating model, the separation didn't change the day to day for the majority of our employees. What is clearly evident, however, is that a reinvigoration of our culture is installed across the organization. The separation provides Fortive with the capacity for disciplined acquisitions and growth investments to strengthen our businesses and market-leading positions. The Fortive Business System will continue to be the cornerstone of our competitive advantage by providing a playbook for accelerated innovation and superior customer satisfaction that will, in turn, drive improved core sales growth, operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow conversions.  We are committed to embracing our strong culture of continuous improvement and driving shareholder value for the long term. And now, turning to the quarter for a more detailed discussion of our results. Please note that the following results are presented on a stand-alone basis from Danaher's historical results. Adjusted net earnings of $219.8 million were up 40 basis points over the prior year. Both reported and core revenue declined 50 basis points. Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up low single digits and developed markets were down low single digits. High-growth market results were driven by high single-digit growth in China and strong double-digit growth in India, offset by continued weakness in Latin America. In developed markets, we continue to see soft industrial activity and weak distributor demand in our North American Professional Instrumentation businesses. While we continue to execute well, the economic environment remains challenging in some markets and geographies. We are encouraged as we enter the second half of the year with EMV starting to ramp up, key innovations launching across the portfolio and continued strength in high-growth markets. We also have a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter.  The power of the Fortive Business System was demonstrated by adjusted gross margin expansion of 53 basis points to 49.6%. The improvement was driven by pricing, procurement savings and successful Lean initiatives across the portfolio that more than offset volume headwinds. Adjusted operating margins of 20.8% were essentially flat to the prior year, with core adjusted operating margin expansion of 9 basis points as gross margin improvement was mostly offset by onetime G&A costs. We were very pleased that despite core revenue being slightly down, 4 out of our 6 platforms had core operating margin expansion in the quarter.  We generated approximately $278 million of free cash flow, up 6%, and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 116%. Free cash flow is one of the most important metrics at Fortive as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. As we have indicated, our capital allocation bias is to deploy our strong free cash flow towards acquisitions. Our M&A funnel has expanded nicely, in part, due to the separation and the general choppiness of the markets over the first half of the year. Our experienced deal team is focused on the execution of our M&A strategy, and we are confident in the strength and diversity of our M&A funnel.  Turning to our segments. Reported and core Professional Instrumentation revenue was down 5% relative to prior year. Acquisitions contributed 50 basis points of growth, which was completely offset by unfavorable currency. Core adjusted operating margins were down 177 basis points for the quarter, reflecting reduced end market demand, technology growth investments and the timing of high contribution margin projects in our Pacific Scientific EMC business. Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue declined mid-single digits, primarily reflecting reduced demand in semiconductor, consumer electronic and some industrial end markets. Field Solutions revenue declined to low single digits, reflecting a mid-single-digit decline in Fluke, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in Qualitrol. Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digits in Western Europe, primarily due to double-digit biomedical and network sales growth, but offset by high single-digit declines in the U.S. reflecting weaker distributor demand. Our continued investments in customer-led innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated products, including our recently launched Fluke Connect condition monitoring offering. This is the industry's first system of portable sensors and network gateway and software that customers can access anywhere, anytime and use advanced analytics to make preventive maintenance decisions. We are very excited about this unique product offering in an important step forward with our connected devices strategy.  As a result of our innovation, growth and productivity initiatives at Fluke, year-on-year operating margins were up 50 basis points. Qualitrol's mid-single-digit growth was driven by strong OEM sales outside of the U.S., with end customer demand based primarily in the Middle East. We continue to see meaningful wins at Qualitrol, and believe this business will continue to be a key growth contributor for Field Solutions. In Product Realization, a mid-single-digit core revenue decline, primarily reflecting reduced demand for Tektronix products, was partially offset by core revenue growth in Invetech. Despite double-digit growth in China and share gains from our optical solutions, Tektronix saw high single-digit core decline broadly reflecting weak semiconductor and consumer electronics activity outside of China. One final timely note on Tektronix, we were selected by NBC as the audio and video test equipment provider for its production of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio starting this Friday. Our Sensing Technologies platform saw high single-digit core revenue decline in the quarter as continued industrial softness was partially offset via growth in the medical food and beverage and aerospace and defense markets. The teams proactively managed cost to maintain core operating margins despite the volume shortfall. Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. We realized both reported and core revenue growth of 3.5% in the quarter. Core adjusted operating margins improved 166 basis points, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and increased volume. Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high single-digit growth in the quarter. Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivered the fourth consecutive quarter with high single-digit core revenue growth. EMV-related demand in the U.S. spurred double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. Many customers are still in the process of upgrading indoor payment systems from last October's liability shift, and we are well-positioned to benefit from the outdoor liability shift slated for October of 2017. In May, Gilbarco launched FlexPay IV as the next generation industry-leading line of EMV-certified dispensers, reflecting continued innovation as our first major hardware product launch stemming from our partnership with Verifone. Also in May, Gilbarco released the industry's first multi-network credit and debit, EMV-certified petroleum retail point-of-sale solution. Support of multiple common payment types reduces consumer confusion around inserting versus swiping their card at the payment terminal. Multi-EMV cards format support ensures that all EMV-capable cards are processed as a chip payment, reducing consumer ambiguity and increasing consumer satisfaction while maximizing the retailers' protection against fraud and liability. Telematics had a strong quarter with high single-digit growth led by strong double-digit core revenue gains in high-growth markets. As you may recall, we integrated Navman and Teletrac last year, bringing these 2 companies together to create one strong business for us from both a global market and technology perspective.  This quarter, we drove solid installed base growth in our largest SaaS business in Fortive. We believe we are well-positioned to increase revenue into our subscription base and create stickiness given our offerings to help customers with safety and compliance.  Automation & Specialty components posted low single-digit core growth decline for the quarter as growth in Kollmorgen was more than offset by declines in the rest of the businesses. Jacobs Vehicle Systems continue to be impacted by the weakness in the North American truck market, partially offset by strong double-digit growth in Europe. Our Franchise Distribution platform posted low single-digit growth. At Matco, we grew revenue at mid-single digits as we continue to gain share via both increased same-store sales and franchisee adds. Using FBS tools such as funnel management and digital marketing, Matco has posted mid-single-digit growth or better for 24 of the last 26 quarters. To summarize, we are encouraged by continued strength in our Industrial Technologies segment and stabilization in our Professional Instrumentation segment. Through the successful deployment of FBS, we were able to launch new products, take market share and realize operating efficiencies across a number of businesses. Focused execution, combined with the strength and diversity of our portfolio, allowed us to deliver margin expansion and generate outstanding free cash flow despite challenging macro conditions. We are initiating adjusted diluted net EPS guidance for the third quarter of $0.56 to $0.60. For the second half of 2016, we are initiating adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $1.21 to $1.29 and continuing to assume low single-digit core revenue growth.  In closing, our value-creation strategy is focused on core revenue growth, operating margin expansion and free cash flow deployment biased towards acquisitions. We will follow a strategic and financially disciplined approach to M&A with the goal of building market leadership positions and increasing returns on capital. We are committed to the principles of the Fortive Business System to deliver customer-driven innovation and shareholder value over the long term. We are very excited about the future in establishing our own independent record of strong performance for many years and decades to come. Lisa Curran : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Ren\u00e9e, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis : Congrats on your first quarter out of the gate. I just want to talk a little bit about the M&A backlog and how that's changed. I mean, a lot of your management team and development team, I guess, really came together in the last few months. So where are you, if you had to put in terms of kind of what inning? Or where are you, as far as you think, capability to be able to go out and execute a transaction right now? And maybe just give us a sense of where you are in the pipeline, whether it's a full pipe, and how you feel, the confidence you have and what you see in being able to deliver something maybe even in 2016. James Lico : Yes. Thanks, Scott. I think as you mentioned, our team has come together in the last 90 or 120 days, an experienced team. As you know and having spent 20 years in this game, you can never predict when a deal will happen. But we're very busy right now. The funnel is in very good shape. I think in terms of both the breadth and diversity of the funnel is what really excites Chuck and I. We have a good set of value deals that we think  -- but also some good deals on the growth side that might be slightly higher valuation, but would still give us a solid return over time. I think the most important thing is we'll continue to be disciplined. And we think the funnel is -- this environment is pretty good. The funnel is growing. And I would expect us to continue to build the funnel and transact something. You can never predict timing, but I think we're in a very good place right now. Scott Davis : And just as a quick follow-up, I mean, where do you -- in your underlying businesses, where do you feel better or where do you feel worse from the Analyst Day and outlook? James Lico : I would say that when we look across -- I'm not sure there's any place we'd say we look worse. I think the North American market has been slightly more noisy. And so in that place, in the last maybe month or 2, we've seen that firm up a little bit. But it's still mixed depending on the vertical. Strength, I think we saw it. Certainly, Transportation Technologies continues to be in a strong position. We've seen some good improvement in Qualitrol, Matco, as we described in the prepared remarks. And then Kollmorgen having growth in the second quarter, I think, is a nice place to be. So I think on balance, that's what gives us confidence in the guide here to be low single-digit growth in the second half. And I think right now, if you look at high-growth markets, we'd say, other than Latin America, pretty good. So as you look across regions, you look across businesses, there's a number of places where we saw either firming up or an improvement. And I think we're in a -- we'll be in a good place for the second half here. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Congrats on the first quarter out of the gate here. So just a quick question on the follow-up on the M&A stuff, just remind us what your targeted financial hurdle is? Is it the old Danaher kind of 10% thing? Or is it more nuanced than that? And also, I think the messaging was you think you have the capability to kind of do, I think you said $2 billion to $3 billion over a 3-year period, but that -- kind of that would be weighted towards kind of the next year or so. Charles McLaughlin : So, yes. Steve, this is Chuck. I'll take those in reverse order. The M&A that we think that we can -- the capital we can deploy is representing $3 billion over the next 2 to 3 years. So I think you've got that exactly right. The hurdles, I think going back to what Danaher's traditionally -- both Jim and I come from strong Danaher roots. Discipline means, for us, 10% in 3 years,  5 years for more of a platform-type deal. There's going to be certain situations where we'll stretch beyond that, and there'll be either small deals that maybe we see a great opportunity for value creation down the line. But most of the time, that is really going to be around those 3- and 5-year metrics. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then I think you said low single digit for the second half. What do you expect for the third quarter for organic? Charles McLaughlin : So we're coming from a flattish in Q2, and -- it will be low single digits but probably accelerating. We run into an easier compare when we get to the fourth quarter, but not in the third quarter. But we're still moving into low single-digit core growth in Q3. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Congratulations on your first quarter out of the gates. Yes, so there's obviously a lot of debate about the sustainability of the EMV upgrade cycle. Maybe Jim, could you offer some perspective on where we are in that penetration curve? Are we maybe 20% through, halfway through? I mean, how sustainable do you think this upgrade cycle is? James Lico : Well I think if I break EMV into 2 places, one, the indoor and the outdoor, we still are seeing growth on the indoor side, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. So we think that will continue. As we've talked out there a little bit, industry experts would put that penetration in around 50 in the marketplace. I don't suspect we'll ever get to 100. On the outdoor side, we're very early stages. If I were to do a baseball analogy, I'd feel like we're in the first or second inning here. So not sure what that is on a percentage basis. We will see some acceleration though in the second half due to EMV, both on the indoor and a little bit on the outdoor side. So you'll see that. As we mentioned before, we still believe it's a $500 million incremental opportunity over the next several years. And we're still not calling the timeframe in that other than the next 2 to 3 years just given how early we are in the outdoor penetration cycle, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Okay. No, that's very helpful. And then a follow-up on Tektronix. It's been somewhat disappointing for the last 4 years or so. What do you think it's going to take to get this business back to growth over the next couple of years? I mean, is there an upgrade cycle? Is there an NPI cycle? What's -- what will it take to get back to growth? James Lico : Well I think when we look at -- we'll see some stabilization there in the second half as we -- some of that will be comp-related. But also, some of that is really some of the things they've been doing that will start to see some traction. I think when you look at the strength that they've had in China as well, what you'll really see is when there is a good macro trend, they're taking advantage of that. And double-digit growth in China, I think, is representative of their strength of their position in some places. We've certainly been investing there. In the second quarter, they have strong healthy gross margin expansion, but we took the opportunity to continue our technology investments. I think that's the beauty of the strength of our portfolio, is the opportunity to do that. And we'll see some of that in the part of 2017, in the second half of 2017. So I think you'll see continued stabilization through this year. And we think that while the macro trends there are a little tough right now on a global basis, particularly in the U.S. and in Western Europe, we think we're in a slightly -- we're in a better position, if you will, starting in '17. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Winoker : I'll echo my congrats for this first quarter out of the gate. That's great. Can we just stick on the Professional Instrumentation segment for a little bit? You just talked about Tektronix. I guess it's also the third quarter for Fluke where we're down. Last quarter was down mid single, high singles down before that in the fourth quarter, and this one's mid single, right? So just give us a sense for what's really -- what's going on there? You've got a good business, but what, on the macro front, is really hurting there? James Lico : I think what we're seeing is some slowness in the U.S. Fluke is probably the one place where we get a little bit of second derivative situation relative to oil and gas. Where we don't have a lot of direct oil and gas exposure, we do have some second derivative. And we see that geographically in the U.S. where we're growing pretty well with distributor sales out on the coast, but in the middle of the U.S., we're slightly slower. So that'll continue for a little bit. We were happy with a high-growth market growth there, particularly in India and China. So I think -- and also, continuing to get margin expansion in the second quarter despite the decline of Fluke, I think, really means we're continuing to get good price, it really shows the strength of the business. With the Fluke Connect condition monitoring launch and a number of other innovations in the second half, I think we'll start to see some acceleration. Beyond the comps in the fourth quarter, we'll start to see some acceleration as we get into 2017. Steven Winoker : So Jim, since you're mentioning the oil and gas impact there as well, so if oil sort of stays at these levels, does that affect your view of growth in that segment then? James Lico : I don't think it does anything more. I think what we saw is we're sort of sunsetting a lot of that. And we're seeing -- you see that -- some of that in some of the publicly-traded distributor customers that we have, is that we'll start to see that as we get through the end of the year. As I said, we don't have a lot of oil and gas exposure in the portfolio. Fluke North America might be a little bit, but most of it's really more second derivative, as I mentioned, a little bit in the sensors process. But we don't think where oil is at today means any precipitous drop even where we're at right now is really -- is much more of an impact at this point. Steven Winoker : Okay. Can you just speak also -- the whole Verizon acquisition of Fleetmatics for $2.5 billion,  does that -- how does that impact the industry for you guys as far as your perspective's concerned? James Lico : Well, it's interesting. It isn't necessary -- we've obviously known Fleetmatics in particular because we've competed against them. We don't think that necessarily changes the competitive dynamics. Telogis and Fleetmatics  are slightly different properties. So we think we're are in a good position. I think what it does is it establishes the strength of the market, both long-term growth and if you have a high -- if you're a large subscriber account like we are, it just shows the value of those kinds of properties. So I think, really, what you've seen with those acquisitions is really established the strength of our portfolio. We had a very good quarter relative to not only revenue growth, but also subscriber growth, and that's really ultimately in a fast business like that. That's what it's all about. We think we're in a good place. Obviously, I won't -- never comment on what happens until acquisitions from competitors is finalized. But we think we're in a good position, and I think the second quarter just amplified that position. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Jim, can you just remind us where we are in Fluke Connect at this point, and what your expectations are there? What's the reception been like so far, et cetera? James Lico : Well, I'd say, when you -- the condition monitoring offering that we're launching here right now is a very exciting offering. It's a combination of just -- not just software and some of the things that we've demonstrated, but it's also a set of sensors, a network gateway that really gives you ease of installation. This is really our real breakthrough in Fluke Connect is really with the condition monitoring launch that we'll have going -- coming out right now in the third quarter. It will still be a small impact in the second -- or the second half of this year. Part of it is the SaaS offering around the analytics offering. So I think we'll start to see, obviously, good additions to the portfolio. There are some hardware sales as well. So we think that'll start to accelerate into the fourth. But it's really a 2017 and 2018 story when it starts to have meaningful impact in the business. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then given the tough end markets out there, I was a little surprised about the growth at Kollmorgen. I mean, is that a particular market or a particular initiative that's driving that business to grow at this point? James Lico : Well they had good high-growth market performance. That was certainly part of it. I think that really shows to the technology offerings. Some of the work they've been trying to take the business into nontraditional applications like robotics has really been a big helper in some of the robotic initiatives they got in the China market. But across high-growth markets and even in Western Europe, they had good performance. So I think it really speaks to the power of FBS, the strategy that we've had to take us into different markets, and you're starting to see some benefit there. Obviously, they do have some tougher markets as well. We've seen that in some other players in the industry. But I think it's really been the work that we've done to try to make that business less cyclical.  And really, a little growth here by some other segments is really starting to pay off a little bit. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just on the low single-digit organic sales growth guide for the second half and the acceleration within that. So when we're looking at the 2 segments, are you expecting a similar rate of acceleration at both in the second half? Or is it more weighted to PI because its trends are weaker right now? Charles McLaughlin : Julian, it's Chuck. I think that it's really similar. What we're seeing is we've got some of our good growth drivers in Industrial Technologies. That business is a little bit ahead in the recovery and the growth. But it's really about the acceleration  of references running into an easier compare in Q4. But I don't see it differentiated. They're both improving going forward sequentially. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And then, I guess maybe talk a little bit about the sensing business. So I guess on the face of it, the end markets and what it does, it's playing to a number of very favorable trends. It's been actually pretty weak for sort of 18 months or so. So how much sort of reinvestment do you think is needed by Fortive to get that business sort of back on its feet? And is it essential, I guess, to have acquisitions on top? Maybe organic investment isn't enough. James Lico : I think we were -- I think as we look forward, we'll see some good end market exposure. Our Anderson business is an example. Has good exposure into the sanitary market in the food and beverage industry. So they have some good macro trends that will deliver growth in the second half and into 2017. I do think it's going to take, for the remainder of the business, some time for us to continue to build on some of the good work that's already been done. M&A activity would certainly help accelerate in some key strategic areas. As we mentioned, I think when we were out over the spring, that this is a place where Chuck and I, as we go through our strategic plan efforts here in the late summer, early fall, we'll certainly get a better sense of some of the needs that the business will have given the different framework. But these are good businesses. As we mentioned, they did an outstanding job in the second quarter of protecting margins. They're steeped in DBS -- in FBS. And we'll have -- I think we'll have some good opportunities as we get into '17 and '18 as we build on their strategic plan this year. And Julian, you get $5 for getting -- drawing out DBS out of me for the first time on the call. So remind me next time I see you. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Patrick Newton : I guess, Jim, with Verizon acquiring Fleetmatics, I guess 2 questions come to mind. One is, how do you see the competitive landscape changing, I guess, given the scale Verizon will have from both the Fleetmatics and recent Telogis acquisitions? And then also given the Verizon multiple paid, would Fortive potentially look to monetize its competing Teletrac business? Or is this business very core to Fortive's portfolio? James Lico : Well I think on the scale question, for sure, they'll have a larger business. But this will still put up as one of the larger subscriber account Telematics businesses in the world. So we still think we have scale in this business. And certainly, from our perspective, we think we're in a good position. So I think we -- Fleetmatics has been a good competitor. I don't suspect that in the next 12 to 24 months, that'll change. I think they'll continue to be a good competitor, and we'll have to continue to run the play that's been successful for us around driving subscriber growth. I think as we think about monetizing it, we like this part of the portfolio. I think the prices that are being paid in the industry have -- are very representative of certain companies and the needs for them to do things. But we've looked at M&A activity in that space as well, and I think there's a mix of deals out there. So we think we can continue to build our own strategy here and we'll run our own play. We like the business as part of the portfolio we have today. Patrick Newton : Great. And then I guess just as a follow-up, kind of digging into the M&A conversation, you did talk about a growing pipeline in the prepared remarks. And as we kind of think here about timing and think about geographically, from a timing perspective, is it reasonable to think that we should, given the growing portfolio, see something announced perhaps before year-end? And then given the dollar strength and higher contribution of revenue from North America, would it be reasonable to assume that you're more willing to prioritize overseas acquisition? James Lico : I think on the first one, I would -- the timing of deals is always hard to do. Having done this for a while, it's always hard to predict. But I would think, as busy we are, we would hope to get something done before the end of the year. Returns are really more important than any one individual area. So I think while we -- when we look at our funnel, it's certainly global. It has representative opportunities throughout all geographies. Certainly, Europe is very representative of our funnel, and you never know where things will happen. But we're focused on a disciplined approach to returns. And any onetime currency situation or whatever is not necessarily going to be something that would drive us to do one thing over another over the long term. We have said that deals would probably bring our tax rate down over time, but again, that's another example of we wouldn't do anything necessarily for the tax rate, we would do it because it accelerates our business strategically. And ultimately, that also gives us a financial return, part of which might be lowering the tax rate. But we're always strategy first, return first, and that really -- that's why we're excited about the funnel being strong. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim, can you talk a little bit about the margin decline that we saw in Professional Instrumentation in the quarter? I mean, it was slightly bigger than we expected. And if you look at your guidance for the year of 30 to 50 basis points, at least for the second half, of 30 to 50 basis points of core operating margin expansion, I think that compares to 9 basis points for the quarter. So is it just the investments coming down that you mentioned, the technology investments that's going to help you? Is there anything else going on in the business that should get you to your guidance? James Lico : I'll take the PI thing, and then Chuck can comment on the go forward. I think when you look in the quarter, we definitely have -- took the opportunity to take some investments. I think what we like about PI is the fact that we were up 50 basis points in gross margin improvement. I think that really speaks to the power of FBS. You saw that at Fluke. You saw that at -- you saw good improvement at Qualitrol. We had good improvement at sensors, where we offset their volume decline. We did have some challenges in Product Realization. As we mentioned, the volume decline in tech hurt as a little bit, and some high contribution margin opportunities at the Pacific Scientific EMC which moved out into the second half. So those, I think, on balance, when you look across the portfolio, the fact that 5 of our 6 platforms had gross margin flat to up, really speaks to the power of FBS. And I think that really speaks to what we'll do -- what we can do here. So while Professional Instrumentation was down a little bit, when you peak below the numbers, we had some good performance in several platforms. Charles McLaughlin : And then, Andrew, on the go forward, looking at operating margin expansion, in the second half, we -- as we've been talking about low single-digit core growth. But we have around 50 basis points to expect in the second half of OMX. [ph] A little bit more in Q4 than in Q1, because I think we're accelerating through those things. But I think a little -- I thought I heard you say 9 in Q3. I'd expect a little bit more than that. Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes, I think it was 9 in Q2 [indiscernible]. Charles McLaughlin : Definitely, 9 -- so I understand, 9 in Q2. That's just a function of being flat. It's just little under flat, but a good acceleration from Q1. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, that's helpful. And then can you guys talk about the inventory situation that you see at Fluke right now? You mentioned weak demand from distributors. But are they still in destocking mode where inventories at this point relatively low in the channel? Charles McLaughlin : We're in -- we have good -- very good visibility to inventories, on a global basis, throughout Fluke. And we're in a very good inventory position. We don't see any issues there. There's always maybe 1 or 2 people that might be a little higher. But on balance, we've got very good visibility. We had great relationships with our top 20 channel partners around the world, and we feel we're in a good position here. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joseph Giordano : We touched on it a couple of times, but can -- if you look at your China business like in aggregate, I know it's hard given the amount of business that, that touches. Most of the commentary on, I feel like this earnings season, has been pretty negative on China. You guys sound incrementally more positive. So what are you seeing there specifically? Anything kind of Fortive-specific that's driving that? Or is that kind of -- how would you compare what you're doing in China to like the current environment, broadly speaking, in China, I guess, is maybe how I'll ask it? James Lico : Yes. Well I think as we said, this is probably a place where the breadth of our portfolio helps us pretty well, because we don't have exposure to any one vertical in China. You're seeing semiconductor expansion and electronics expansion that's occurring in China benefits Tektronix, and to some extent, Fluke. Gilbarco's had some good additions in the China market as well. So a number -- we mentioned Kollmorgen as well doing well in China as well. So I think some of our businesses are off a lower base, and so the power of what they've done from an innovation perspective and from an FBS perspective is helping them. And that, really, when you add that all up broadly, means that we've been mid- to high single digits here in China over several quarters, and think that can at least continue into what's in the guide. Joseph Giordano : All right. And then, when you look at GVR, good growth this quarter. What do the comps look like in the second half for that business versus the first half? And maybe if you had to flesh out how you get to that 500 million like in broad strokes, like what major assumptions are within that number in terms of terminal rate of adoption and things like that? James Lico : Yes, I think we'll run against a slightly tougher comp at Gilbarco, I believe, in the fourth quarter. So little bit tougher comp there. But we think we can continue to sustain what we've got with a good, active funnel and a number of things that we've got going. The FlexPay launch that we talked about in the prepared remarks is just a good example of bringing more innovation in helping us take share in the market. Relative to our assumptions, we don't think we'll ever get to 100% penetration in 2 to 3 years, so we sort of assume that kind of an 80% penetration might be achievable in the next 3 to 4 years. But to be honest with you, when you look at the outdoor penetration  we just started, we revise those models every month based on what we've seen both in terms of actual sales and orders, but also on what we're hearing from customers. And I think those models will really get more refined as we turn the table on '16 and into '17 as we see a more active customer base. And so while we could make some predictions around what that looks like, I think we're really -- were probably 5 to 6 months away from really knowing what that might look like to hard code that into whether that's 2 or 3 years or 3 to 4 years at this point. Joseph Giordano : And then if I can just sneak one in for Chuck real quick. What was the effective adjusted tax rate for the quarter? And what  should we be thinking for the full year? Charles McLaughlin : The effective tax rate for Q2? Joseph Giordano : Yes. Charles McLaughlin : Q2 was the 60 -- let's see, the -- because we had a good guide. I think it's around 60. Doing the math in my head. 32%. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And that's... Charles McLaughlin : And going forward, I  think 30% is a good number for the second half of the year. We'd like -- we think we have a chance -- we expect to get down in 2017 into the 20s. And we've got a few things to put in place. We might even get there yet this second half. But I think 30% for the second half is a good number. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. James Lico : Well, we appreciate all the time that everybody had for us today. Obviously, we're unbelievably excited about the future at Fortive. We're looking forward to continued conversations with everybody around all the good things that are going on and, really, what the opportunity is for us. Lisa and Josh are available for calls today and tomorrow. So we look forward to talking to you and we'll see you real soon. Thanks, everybody. Operator : This does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is David, and I will be your conference facilitator this afternoon. This conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fortive Corporation's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Lisa Curran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Curran, you may begin your conference. Lisa Curran : Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. With us today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by SEC Regulation G related to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.fortive.com, under the heading Financial Information. I would like to highlight that we have posted updated supplemental financial data to our investor website to reflect immaterial corrections to the carveout allocations of revenue, gross margins and SG&A in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.  A replay of the webcast will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations, and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of the conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call until Thursday, November 3, 2016. Once available, the link to this conference call will -- call replay rather will be posted under the Investors section of Fortive's website under Events & Presentations. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics relate to the third quarter of 2016, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-over-year.  During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. Our results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our team's impressive execution to deliver solid core revenue growth, outstanding margin expansion, free cash flow, well in excess of net income; and earnings outperformance. The Fortive Business System is the driving force behind our performance and is the cornerstone of both Fortive's culture and operating model.  We recently held the first-ever Fortive CEO kaizen, focused on our key shareholder and customer-facing metrics of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. Kaizen means continuous improvement and our kaizen events are one of the many ways we commit to this Fortive value as our way of life. What makes the CEO kaizen unique is that more than 50 of our top leaders across the company go shoulder to shoulder with our front-line operators this year at 4 selected sites to attack our highest priority initiatives. The CEO kaizen was an exciting milestone for me personally, and I'm energized by the breakthroughs and amazing results achieved during this event. With the launch of Fortive, we have a great opportunity to deepen our dedication to the Fortive Business System and show the power of 24,000 people devoted to our purpose of providing essential technology for the people who create, implement and accelerate progress.  With that, I would like to turn to the quarter for a more detailed discussion of our results. The following information reflects year-over-year increases or decreases relative to the updated supplemental financial data that Lisa described at the top of the call. Adjusted net earnings of $233.1 million were up 22.2% over the prior year. Sales grew 2.8% to $1.6 billion, with core revenue increase of 2.7%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 60 basis points of growth over the prior year, which was partially offset by approximately 50 basis points of currency. Geographically, solid performance in high-growth markets drove revenues up mid-single digits, and developed markets improved to low single-digit growth. The high-growth market results were primarily driven by India and double-digit growth in China, partially offset by weakness in Latin America where we realized a double-digit decline, given continued challenging market conditions.  In developed markets, we saw low single-digit growth in North America, primarily driven by the strength of EMV-related demand for our Gilbarco offerings and strong growth at Matco and Qualitrol, and mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe. We expect the Western Europe growth to moderate in the fourth quarter.  The power of the Fortive Business System was clearly demonstrated with outstanding margin expansion. We were very pleased that 4 out of our 6 platforms had both growth and operating margin expansion in the quarter. Gross margins expanded 30 basis points to 49.3%. Operating margins of 20.6% were up 140 basis points versus the prior year, with core adjusted operating margin expansion of 150 basis points. The strong margin expansion represents above-average incremental fall-through of approximately 75%, reflecting favorable mix and sales growth weighted towards the end of the quarter.  During the third quarter, we generated $300 million of free cash flow, up 50% over the prior year and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 134%. Cash generation was unusually strong this quarter in part due to the timing of interest in tax payments. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be above 100%. Our M&A funnel continues to expand, and I remain confident regarding the growth opportunities presented, given the size and diversity of our pipeline. During the quarter, we closed 2 important bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $200 million that accelerates several of our key strategic initiatives, which I will talk a little bit more about later. We expect to remain active on the deal front, with a continued disciplined focus on accelerating growth and returns through our M&A strategy. The adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter improved to 27.6% versus our previous outlook of 30%. We expect our adjusted rate going forward to be approximately 28%.  Turning to our segments. We were pleased to see improved performance in Professional Instrumentation, with revenue up slightly, reflecting 70 basis points of core growth, partially offset by 40 basis points of currency and 10 basis points from the impact of acquisitions in the separation. Reported operating profit margin increased to 22.3%, and core operating margins were up 110 basis points for the quarter, primarily reflecting a favorable business mix to prior year as well as successful price and productivity initiatives. During the quarter, Professional Instrumentation realized approximately 40 basis points of favorable price.  Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue increased low single digits, led by demand for test applications and connected equipment monitoring solutions. In field solutions, core revenues were up low single digits, led by mid-single-digit growth at Qualitrol and low single-digit growth at Fluke, reflecting good demand for handheld industrial products as well as our thermography and network offerings. Fluke delivered mid-single-digit growth in both Western Europe and China. This strong growth was partially offset by continued weakness in certain North American end markets. Fluke continued to demonstrate the strength of innovation through numerous awards, including 2 Electrical Construction and Maintenance Magazine Product of the Year awards for Fluke Connected assets in the software maintenance management category and for Fluke TiX560 in the cameras and imaging equipment category. During our last earnings call, I highlighted our Fluke Connect, Condition Monitoring System as an example of customer-led innovation. I'm excited to report that the reception to this new product offering has been outstanding. This product is an important step in our connected device strategy, which was recently accelerated via the acquisition of eMaint Enterprises, a global leader in SaaS-based computer -- computerized maintenance management software. The combination of Fluke Connect toolbox with eMaint's SaaS offering will allow for increased asset uptime via the seamless integration of maintenance devices data and systems. Fluke and eMaint have joined forces to usher in a new era of connectivity and are set to deliver groundbreaking asset reliability platforms for multi-industrial customers around the world. Qualitrol's mid-single-digit growth was primarily driven by the high-growth markets, where we saw solid asset protection growth and market share gains, driven by the refinement of our go-to-market strategy. This quarter marked Qualitrol's 10th consecutive quarter of positive core growth, and we're excited about our position in this important condition-based monitoring sector. In Product Realization, core revenues were slightly up, led by double-digit growth in our PacSci EMC business. The stronger-than-normal EMC growth reflected the timing of several projects that you will recall moved out of last quarter. Year-to-date, EMC delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth.  As expected, Tektronix core revenues declined low single digits and improved sequentially, reflecting sales improvements in nearly all regions and a return to positive growth in our high-growth markets. Tektronix is now our largest business in China, and it continued to outperform in the region by recognizing double-digit growth, given strong demand for our solutions, geared for new wafer technology in the semiconductor industry and data center applications. By leveraging our FBS growth and innovation tools, we've been able to upgrade our 70-gigahertz real-time oscilloscope with advanced software to target data centers where high-quality -- very high-quality signal measurements are critical to ensure data center uptime and performance.  Our Sensing Technologies platform saw a low single-digit core revenue decline in the quarter, as declines in our control product lines were partially offset by solid growth in our sensing businesses, which was driven by exposure to the medical and food and beverage verticals. We were pleased to be awarded a multi-year contract with NAVSEA to supply electrical products to the U.S. Navy, with the potential to realize approximately $300 million -- $3 million in revenue over the next 12 months.  Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. We realized reported growth of 5.1%, with core revenue growth of 4.7% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 90 basis points of growth over prior year, which was offset by approximately 50 basis points of currency. Reported operating profit margin increased to 21.4%, and core operating margins were up 230 basis points for the quarter, primarily reflecting strong volume growth, productivity as well as material cost and supply chain improvements. Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high single-digit growth in the quarter, with Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of high single-digit core revenue growth, driven by our best-in-class retail fueling portfolio. At Gilbarco, we're starting to see a deceleration in EMV-related demand for indoor point-of-sale solutions as the liability transfer occurred in October 2015. However, demand associated with the pending outdoor liability shift in the U.S. has increased for both dispenser and EMV payment kits. While we are in the early innings, growth is weighted towards kits this quarter. On the innovation front, Gilbarco recently released contactless and 2D barcode scanner options on FlexPay IV, our market-leading EMV payment platform. We are winning not just in the U.S. but in other international markets as well. Our new PCI 4 payment platform continues to gain traction in the market since its launch in Q2, securing our market-leading position, which helped us to close a multimillion dollar 5-year contract with a leading major oil retailer in Italy.  Telematics realized core growth of low single digits in the quarter, reflecting strong international growth. The recent launch of our new SaaS platform called Director has been well received, and the installed base transition will take approximately 18 to 24 months to complete.  In keeping with our Transportation Technologies platform evolution from retail fueling to smart transportation, we closed the acquisition of Global Traffic Technologies or GTT and entered an attractive market adjacency with mid-single-digit or better growth characteristics. GTT has a market-leading position in traffic management systems and delivers advanced transportation solutions to help emergency, transit and traffic personnel increase safety and minimize traffic congestion, while maximizing resource efficiency and performance.  Moving to Automation & Specialty components. The platform was slightly down for the quarter as double-digit growth in high-growth markets was mostly offset by weakness at Jacobs Vehicle Systems. JVS saw strong growth in China, offset by continued weakness in the North American truck market. The automation businesses of Kollmorgen and Thomson grew low single digits. This was the second consecutive quarter for positive growth at Kollmorgen, reflecting performance in high-growth markets and collaborative robotics and return to growth for Thomson, which was primarily driven by strength in their distribution channel and medical equipment sales growth.  Continued investment and innovation, including robotics, is driving key market share gains as we continue to outperform the market globally. Our Franchise Distribution platform posted mid-single-digit growth. Once again, Matco grew revenue at high single-digit rate as we continue to gain share via both same-store sales and franchisee adds.  Hard-line and power tool sales growth was driven by demand generated at our second-largest sales meeting of the year. Matco's mid-single-digit or better core revenue growth record is now at 25 out of the last 27 quarters. We are very proud that Matco is ranked as #27 of the fastest-growing franchisees by an entrepreneur magazine.  To summarize, we are very pleased with the quarter. We allocated capital, launched new products, gained market share and realized operating efficiencies across our businesses to deliver great results. We're initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.63 to $0.67, which includes assumptions for low single-digit core revenue growth and incremental growth investments and restructuring. For the second half of 2016, we are increasing our adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $1.30 to $1.34.  The third quarter of 2016 was a great example of the strength of our portfolio through the cycle. How FBS drives growth -- both growth and cost efficiencies and how accelerated revenue growth of high-margin businesses translates to strong operating margin expansion that delivers free cash flow for organic and inorganic investments and superior shareholder returns. Lisa Curran : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. David, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Scott Davis from Barclays. Scott Davis : I got a bunch of questions, but I'm just trying to figure out -- I always thought Fluke as being a bit of a canary in a coal mine from a macro perspective. And A, tell me whether you agree with that? But B, do you get a sense that we've seen a bottom in the industrial macro? It sounds like emerging markets perked up for sure or -- but the U.S. hasn't come back yet. So maybe just a little bit of color on Fluke specifically and what you see there. James Lico : Yes, I think -- first to your question. I do think that the purdue [ph]  of the Fluke industrial business is probably more the canary in a coal mine, to use the metaphor. I think if you looked at Fluke just -- we were very happy about the performance. The Fluke industrial business had a good quarter. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that Western Europe and China was very good. But I think on balance, what we saw in the quarter was stability and a little bit of improvement through some of the product innovations that are going on at Fluke. We talked about Fluke Connect and some of that is helpful, some other products that they've launched here this year. So I think on balance, we've said stabilization. We saw a little bit of a pickup at Fluke as we said, and we think that, that should continue. It's really not around easier comps, so this is -- we do think is really a little bit of improvement here. Scott Davis : Okay. That's... James Lico : And maybe, one other -- Scott, maybe just to finish that thought, I'm sorry. The other thing we look at is the point-of-sale information. Obviously, with the number of publicly traded distributors that you know well, we saw a little bit of improvement in point-of-sale through the quarter. Scott Davis : Okay, that's helpful. And then I was surprised when I -- you guys have actually done a fair amount of transactions this quarter. Most of them are really too small to do a release on, but -- and you talked a bit about GTT, which something I don't really know anything about. But how do you think about -- I mean, given the size of Fortive, can you -- the balance between the smaller deals -- I mean, some companies say, \"Hey, the small deals take just so much time and you don't get as much bang for your buck.\" But other companies say, \"Hey, that's where the valuation and values make the most sense.\" So when you guys looked at your opportunity set at transactions, how do you think about the pros and cons of the 2 different ways to think about it? James Lico : Well, I think -- Chuck and I -- I think we are really pleased with the diversity of the pipeline right now. And as you mentioned, the -- we're really excited about bringing on eMaint and GTT into the portfolio, into the Fortive family this quarter. They're great additions to our strategy around positioning our businesses around secular trends. In the case of eMaint, really around SaaS-based business, it's a 100% SaaS business. In the case of GTT, we're really reframing Transportation Technologies around some of the new trends in urbanization and safety because of traffic congestion. So I think you'd see our deals continue to be those kinds of deals. But we do have a diverse pipeline right now. You can never time when deals will occur. But both diversity across platforms and size, we're seeing both of those right now. So it's hard to predict when things would occur. We would certainly like to do more sizable transactions. So it's not that we won't -- we'll just be doing small bolt-on deals. You're right in your comment. These are probably -- the return on these are in the lower -- in a fewer years than maybe a larger scale more platform-like deal, but we think balance of that is good for us both short term and long term. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Steven Winoker : I just wanted to start with the thinking behind the cadence of organic growth through the second half that we've already seen and into the rest of the year. That -- obviously, up almost 3% core was, I think, better than anticipated. And as you sort of had talked about fourth quarter, originally, you talked about the easier comps, you talked about a better setup in acceleration through the end of the year. What I'm hearing now is a little bit more stabilization at that level. Maybe give us a little color for the puts and takes around your thinking as you head through the rest of the year. Charles McLaughlin : Steve, this is Chuck. Really we're not seeing the second half all that much different than we thought of maybe 3 months ago. We've got 2 things going on here and posting what we consider as -- we're very happy with the core growth. We talked -- Jim talked in the call about-- taking some backlog down out of our EMC business, which is maybe a -- not accretive. We already had that in the second half and it just -- we got it in the third quarter. We saw some real strength in our portfolios across Western Europe and  -- where we had 4 out of our 6 of them really posted mid-single digits. We think we're taking share there. It's -- we really don't think that going forward that's really going to be that strong of an organic grower. So half of -- without those 2 things, we think that in the third quarter, we would have been around 1.5% core growth. And so therefore, when we look forward, we still see low single-digit, probably about the same, maybe a little better than we just printed in Q4 . Steven Winoker : It's really helpful. Another question on restructuring and the investments headed into the fourth quarter. So -- I mean, certainly, one of Danaher's practices historically was to only call out separate restructuring when it was very large and they absorbed restructuring every quarter. That was just part of the current business reporting. I assume that you're pursuing the same approach, and this is sort of an extraordinary amount of restructuring but you have a regular approach too. And also on that same point, Danaher seemed to time the restructuring spend very well relative to slack forward demand. So maybe just give us a little color on your thinking and incentive behind this special restructuring being called out. James Lico : Well, I think that -- Steve, it's Jim. A couple of things, maybe. First, I think what we tried to call out is both restructuring and growth investment. These are incremental to what we are already planning, as you mentioned. Our history here is to do maybe what we have called some quiet restructuring around businesses as we see fit. We think that with some of the overage in the quarter that we had, we were -- obviously, I think demonstrates the strong earnings potential we have when we get a little bit of core growth. And we made the decision, I think, to manage the business both for the long and short term, a little bit of incremental growth investment, to double down on a number of things that we think are really important. You heard about a couple of those on the call like Condition Monitoring at Fluke and then Gilbarco's EMV portfolio. So we are doing a little bit of that. Certainly, as Chuck mentioned, some of our markets are a little noisy, and so there are some product lines and businesses where things are not maybe as good as they need to be, and so we'll take the opportunity to do some things to make sure that those businesses continue to invest next year through taking some costs out. So a good balance of things. Because it's incremental to our prior guidance, we thought it was important to highlight it. But I think on balance, we're exceptionally excited about the quarter. And I think the degrees of freedom that we have in order to invest in the business is really the takeaway for everyone. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : So did you -- and I'm sorry if I missed it. Did you quantify the mix between sort of cost reduction initiatives and growth initiatives in 4Q? Charles McLaughlin : We think it's likely to be evenly split between those 2 things and in the range of $0.04. Nigel Coe : Yes. Okay. That's sounds great. Makes kind of sense. And then you just mentioned that the core growth saw somewhat similar or maybe a little bit better than 3Q. The comp, obviously, plus 3% in 3Q '15, minus 3% in 4Q '15, so you've got easier comps. So would we expect maybe a slight kind of sequential deterioration? How do we think about that comp effect, I guess, is my question. James Lico : I think when we think about the Q4, we'll probably -- as Chuck mentioned, I think when you take into the backlog that we were able to -- that really was shipped in 3Q, you take -- we don't anticipate Western Europe to be as good as the third quarter. We -- it will probably be a little bit better against that 1% or 2% that we might have had when you take those out of 3Q. So I think we'll sequentially be a little better. But again, I think given the environment, it's -- I think we're cautiously optimistic. But against the backdrop of what we're seeing in other -- with other peers in other markets, we think it's appropriate to be cautious to make sure that given the external environment, we manage the business appropriately. Nigel Coe : Absolutely. And a quick one on tax rate, Chuck. 23 -- you said 28% going forward. Just to clarify, that 28% is for 4Q and 2017? Charles McLaughlin : So it's 28% in the fourth quarter and into 2017. What we've been able to do is accelerate some of the tax work that we were confident we were going to get done in 2017. And we're going to get and been able to bring that forward into 2016. Operator : We will take our next question from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Just on the M&A front. Jim, perhaps you don't want to talk about the 2 deals individually, but collectively. Can you give us a sense of the multiple paid and what you do think the return profile of those deals are? James Lico : Yes. I'd certainly give you a little bit more color on the deal. The 2 in the quarter were eMaint Enterprises for Fluke and GTT, which is within our Transportation Technologies platform. Both great businesses. Both directed towards secular trends with a good growth profile, but small. Those -- the multiples on revenue would probably be higher-than-normal given the smaller nature of the deal. They're probably closer in the 3x to 4x range on a revenue multiple. But I think the most important thing is around return. And given the nature of how these businesses are consistent with what we're trying to do within those platforms, the return profile is very good. It's certainly within the 10% in 3 years. So I think you'll, from time to time, probably see us pay a little bit more, pay up a little bit for growth here, kinds of things to the platform, but probably more than likely in many cases be smaller. And so -- and more adjacent, and so we can get to the return profile pretty quickly. Jeffrey Sprague : Right. And then on Tektronix, good to see a little bit of a turn there. Could you speak little bit more broadly about what's going on with new product launches and how that business might be setting up into the -- especially the early part of next year, but maybe all of 2017? James Lico : Yes. The -- we were very pleased in the quarter, given the -- while they were still -- while they still declined in the third, they were sequentially better than the -- from the second quarter. So that standpoint, we were pleased with performance. And as we noted -- as I noted in the highlighted remarks, the high-growth markets turned to growth. So I think that's a really good trend for us, and we think that probably continues. China continues to lead the way there. That's really a few years of spadework that we've done both on the product side and the go-to-market side to be prepared to take advantage opportunities there. So I think the team is executing very well there. The North American and Western European markets are still pretty noisy and many of those -- many of the vertical markets we play in are just outright slow. So I don't expect that to improve anytime soon. We've also got -- while we don't have a lot of business in the semiconductor industry in North America, you do see a lot of consolidation there. So I think on balance, we think the next couple of quarters continue to be rough. We think as we get into the -- maybe the back half of '17, we've got a new platform -- some new platform technologies and products coming out that we think can help us make a little bit more of our own luck. But at this point, in terms of just kind of -- we're not expecting any big macro tailwind to help us there. So I think on balance, we're trying to make our own luck and the team is executing well. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Just on EMV. I mean, you talked about the indoor slowing and you talked about some of the growth being more kit-driven. Maybe just a little more color on that and how would you say things are tracking versus your expectations, better, worse or just different? James Lico : I think -- well, as we noted, we still are -- we are still getting indoor revenues. So maybe to be clear on that, it's just that, at this point, it's now starting to decelerate. And we're just starting to see the EMV product lines, if you will, EMV dispensers and kits start to sell now. I think as we look at the funnel, Chuck and I were with the team a couple of weeks ago for the strategic plan. I had an opportunity to grow through the funnels. And I think from that standpoint, the funnels look very good. We're starting to see some of the business transact. As we noted in the remarks, we did see more kits this quarter, and so I think it's not -- I wouldn't draw any trend into that yet. We'll continue to update you as we go through. We continue to believe that this is a $500 million incremental market opportunity for the players in the market. But it's still very early days, and while we like the progress we've made, I certainly think that trying to determine what that mix between kits and dispensers will be is probably a few more quarters here before we really see that. But we see -- we do see customer enthusiasm, and I still maintain that this thing is going to draw out well beyond the -- I think everything we've seen. We had the National Association of Convenience Store trade show last week and -- there -- and -- I think what we saw there was -- was customers there. We definitely heard that not everybody is going to go from -- during 2017. Shannon O'Callaghan: Right, okay. And then just in terms of the acquisition pipeline, I mean, it makes sense that your first couple would be in Fluke and Transportation. Is that still where the most kind of developed acquisition pipelines are or do some of these other platforms have things that are visible now? Charles McLaughlin : Shannon, this is Chuck. We're -- as Jim was saying earlier, we really like the funnel, but it's not focused in any one business. I think the only things you can really read about these 2 acquisitions is it's not really where -- it's just where the first 2 happened to be. I think when you look at our first 5 to 10, you're going to see there's a spread in where they go across our businesses and also in size and scale. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a follow-up question on EMV. You sort of noted that you see indoor EMV deceleration. So what's the adoption rate that you can estimate at which it started to decelerate significantly? James Lico : I think most of -- so we don't see -- in the point-of-sale business, we don't see all the markets. So we have to sometimes take some of the other -- we have to combine sort of with all the other industry players. We have a little bit better view of payment on the outdoor because we sell a dispenser in that market. But on the -- we think probably we're in the 70% range probably right now. I think that's what prognosticators are probably at. And quite frankly, I don't -- we don't think it'll get to 100%. So the tail-off probably now is -- I don't think we can estimate when we get to -- when the next 10 points come. But certainly, the slowing rate right now means that we're starting to see probably relatively close to saturation. Andrew Obin : And just a broader question, just going back to your commentary about macro just being soft. During the Analyst Day in the summer, you thought you could sort of hit those rate of GDP, GDP+ growth, given the overall weakness in the industrial market. And, I guess, 4Q, you do have easy comps. Do you think it's still a reasonable expectation into next year? James Lico : Yes, I do. I think when you look kind of where we've been, we think we're in the range of GDP. And certainly with -- we're not completely tied to that because we're tied to some good secular trends like what we've got going at Gilbarco. But also -- with EMV. But also at Qualitrol where condition monitoring becomes a real important thing for utilities around the world. So I think you see the acquisitions that we have this quarter as well, trying to tie to things that even in a tougher industrial environment are going to resonate with customers who are trying for better productivity and safety in their operations. So we think that's still achievable. And as I think we mentioned, over time, as we get the M&A cycle moving a little bit to accelerate core growth within the platforms, GDP+ is probably achievable as well. Operator : We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Lee Sandquist : This is Lee Sandquist on for Julian Mitchell. After a very strong Q3 margin expansion, how do you think about the potential going into Q4, keeping in mind that longer-term 30 to 50 bps of core operating margin expansion target? Charles McLaughlin : I think with -- Lee, thanks for joining. I think -- this is Chuck. Looking forward, that 30 to 50 bps is -- we feel very good about that. I think that will continue to show margin expansion, especially when you look over multiple quarters. But we are -- we obviously overshot the mark this quarter. It's going to be like that. Sometimes, it's a little stronger, a little less. But when you look forward over 3 or 4 quarters, I think you're going to see 30 to 50 bps as exactly where we think we should be. Lee Sandquist : It makes sense. And then in terms of organic growth, it sounded like that picked up throughout the quarter and towards the end of the quarter. Which businesses saw the biggest progression throughout that period? Charles McLaughlin : I don't know that it actually picked up. I think by my month, it is actually pretty stable, although I would say we had probably a big September last year and we have some strength here. But I think the PacSci EMC business is -- was an area where we got some big order out the door, and then we saw the Western Europe, as we noted. We're probably in some areas of strength that maybe we didn't see it at the beginning of the quarter. James Lico : Lee, maybe I'll just add. As we said before, we did -- I think what we said in the earnings call in August was things were pretty stable, but September was a big month. And so I think that's what we really always see is September is always a big month. It's hard to make a macro read in August until you see September play out. We were very pleased to see how September played. As I mentioned -- and I think Chuck is exactly right in his comments around what we saw. So I think if we were just sort of -- we think -- we're not calling any macro tailwind here at any point in time. We saw stability through the quarter. We saw a little bit of stability at the end of the second quarter. So a few quarters in a row of stability is sort of -- is our sort of base plan of how we think about things right now. Operator : We'll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Richard Eastman : A quick question. Can I just broaden out? There's been a number of questions around the Professional Instrumentation segment of the business. And again, we've got an easier compare in the third -- in the fourth quarter, which you kind of addressed. But as you get into -- that being the more cyclical piece of the business. When you get into '17, I mean, is this -- which pieces of the business here -- could drive PI to a core growth rate of GDP? James Lico : Well, I think for sure, we'd start with field solutions. I think as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Qualitrol, while not the biggest business in Professional Instrumentation, but 10 consecutive quarters of core growth and several of their new offerings, I think, will continue to drive growth there. We think that what we're doing with Fluke Connect and connected devices and the combination with eMaint will also be something that can create a little bit of our own luck as well. So I think those are 2 places. I already mentioned a little bit about Tek in the second half. Our sensors businesses should start to come back to growth. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, some good business with the Navy. There's a number of other situations that we think play out that could potentially give us a little better performance here going forward. So obviously, we haven't given 2017 update yet, but that's where we're sort of -- Chuck and I will go into the budget here shortly, we'll sit with all of our businesses here in our sort of budget season and we'll have a better sense of kind of how they're thinking about the lay of the quarter as they lay in a number of their growth initiatives. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then when I look at the core op profit in each of the -- in each of PI and IT, in the PI segment, it was plus 110 bps; and in IT, it was up 230, the core. And is that, Chuck -- maybe this question is directed at Chuck. But is that mix in both of these segments or were there some cost takeout pre-split? Or how do we think about the magnitude of the core increases in op profit? James Lico : Well, I think first thing, it starts with FBS, and everything we do across all the portfolios, including price, that helps But it's not just price. It's -- we're continuing -- our procurement teams do a wonderful job of finding ways in leveraging our scale in what we do. So that's the #1 bar on the Pareto chart. I think that when you look at Industrial Technologies, it's a little easier to see with the core growth that we're seeing there. But relatively, just in the positive territory, this is a good -- it's not a big tailwind from any cost takeout, it's really the deployment of FBS. Richard Eastman : Okay. And just last question. On GTT, again, just kind of searching around a little bit for that business and maybe trying to size it. Given their technology, it seems like a fairly small revenue business, given how that technology can apply to so many markets. Is that kind of safety market -- telematics safety market, if you will? Is that quite fragmented? I mean, why is that company not bigger relative to the benefits that their technology kind of bring to the marketplace? James Lico : Well, I think first, they're mostly a U.S.-based business, so I think that's first and foremost. They are business not of huge scale. I think one of the things we always bring to the party on these small bolt-on deals is the ability to scale the business. And I think entrepreneurs and folks around the world always look for us to be a scaler of their business. And so that's certainly true with both the deals in the quarter. So I think that it starts with that. And as we mentioned, these businesses are under $50 million in revenue. So we think they're great businesses. We can scale them. In the case of GTT, they really are helping municipalities. If you think about it quickly, they helped -- they started with the business that helped firetrucks, and other first responders changed the signal in order to go through streets. But they moved into urbanization through a number of things with municipal buses and things like that. So they're really very much in the forefront of helping traffic move through cities, and as you can imagine, a pretty big problem, not just in Seattle where we live, but everywhere around the world. So an opportunity to globalize the business, for sure. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Chuck, you mentioned 40 bps of price in PI. Maybe you can talk about what price versus cost looks like moving forward in both segments. You mentioned that was a decent contribution to the improvement in margin with PI, but maybe you can talk about broad base for the company. Is 40 bps kind of what we could see here or could that get worse a little bit if steel comes up again? How do we look at it? Charles McLaughlin : Well, I think that your date, and for the year, we think we're going to average 50 basis points. So I don't think that 40 is really out of line at all, and it's pretty much what we saw -- we've seen the last couple of years. So I do think that price is something that we've -- with our strong positions. And you look at our gross margins and -- that we've been able to get. Versus cost takeout in terms of material cost takeout is I think what we're talking about here, that's a pretty -- that's a big lever as well, maybe even bigger than price. Price sometimes -- we talk about it more, but there's -- our procurement teams do a great job of taking out 2% to 3% annually, and that's just a huge tailwind for us. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. And then, Jim, China, double-digit growth in China, it seems particularly strong. I think it's even better than it's been. Can you talk about where you've seen the incremental strength? I know you mentioned Tektronix improving, but is it broad-based across the company that you're seeing more strength in China? How much of it is the market versus sort of the own self-help that you're working on? James Lico : Well, yes, thanks, Andrew. I think China, as I mentioned -- just to go finish the Tek thought, for sure, Tek is doing a good job, and they've had several quarters in a row of good performance in China. I think it goes back to last year. So I think that they're certainly tapping into several trends on investment and doing an exceptional job there of, I think, doing better even than the market. I think if you look more broad-based, and we do have pretty good broad-based growth, we're seeing growth in our automation businesses and even -- while our sensor businesses are not growing overall, they're growing in China. So -- and then Fluke continues to do well. So it actually is fairly broad-based, but I do think that this really is part of -- part of our success has to do with the fact that we've been in China for a long time. Our businesses have continued to look for new areas of growth. We have a lot of capability over there in terms of manufacturing, engineering, so your product design for the market. And I'd like to think that part of our performance is the fact that we were very much tapping into a number of the drivers that go on in China as a Chinese company would because of our long-term establishment of being over there for quite a long time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : So I just want to -- just to make it clear, the fourth quarter organic, 1.5% to 2%, I mean, is that kind of what you're saying or is it kind of firmly in that 2% range? Charles McLaughlin : No, it's firmly. I think what we're saying is -- for the fourth quarter is better than what we printed then just in the third quarter but still low single digit. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. Better than what you printed, like the 2.7% that you printed [indiscernible]. Charles McLaughlin : Yes, so 2.5% to 3% core. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. Got it. Sorry. I know there's going to be some questions about that tomorrow. And then just to be clear on this EMV stuff. So how much of the growth from the high single-digit growth at GVR or Transportation Tech, however you want to talk about it, is coming from EMV? And then you talked about it decelerating in the fourth quarter. What is the kind of step-down in that growth rate for the fourth quarter? I would assume that it's all related to EMV. And is there any risk that at any time in the next several quarters there's kind of a tough comp that would create a negative result at GVR? James Lico : So, Steve, first, let me apologize. Let me make sure that I'm clear. We do not see a step-down at all at Gilbarco in the fourth quarter. We will see continued strong performance. And we don't -- while no one has a crystal ball, certainly, the -- I think it's 5 consecutive quarters of growth there, a very good growth. We see that continuing for many -- for as long as we can see out there right now. So there will be no deceleration at Gilbarco in the fourth. I just want to make sure that's clear. What I was trying to say is that the point-of-sale part of EMV will start to decelerate, and the outdoor side of EMV is accelerating. So that's kind of the plus and the minus. Just to characterize that, that -- the outdoor opportunity is much bigger than the indoor because, as you can imagine, there's only 1 or 2 payment devices inside the store. But there might be as many -- 10 dispensers on the outdoor. So the opportunity is much bigger. And so -- and we're just starting to see that. So we'll see good performance in the fourth quarter at Gilbarco against a good -- against a tough comp. So we feel very strongly. To your question about where the growth there is coming from, certainly, the U.S. is driving a good chunk of their growth, but they're still growing. And so Gilbarco -- I mentioned the share gains they've been having in Europe, particularly with a major oil retailer in Italy. But a number of share gains across a number of big customers in Europe and around in many of the high-growth markets. So not every high-growth market is growing for them. Latin America has been a challenge. A couple other markets have been challenges. They've had good growth in the Middle East. So I think that's where they stand. And we continue to see -- EMV will be a driver of their performance, but it won't be the only place where they perform. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. That's great clarity. I mean, you guys were kind -- it sounded like you were talking it down a little more. So that's... James Lico : Yes, I apologize for that. C. Stephen Tusa : No, not at all. That's why I asked the question. Great clarity on that. The $200 million or the acquisitions you've done year-to-date, just remind us how -- will they add -- how much will they add to earnings next year? Kind of what's the 2017 accretion from what you've just booked mathematically? Charles McLaughlin : Yes, Steve, this is Chuck. The -- we're not expecting a big accretion. They're not -- certainly not dilutive, but they're going to really hit hard in years 2 and 3. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brian Drab with William Blair. Brian Drab : First question, just on the margin. You have this nice 150 bps of expansion -- core expansion in the third quarter. It sounded like there was some timing involved in that, I think you said, given that some of the revenues booked close to the end of the quarter had some favorable drop-through. Does that -- and I also have the guide in front of me now. So I'm just trying to triangulate in on. So does this mean that gross margin and/or operating margin is down a touch sequentially into the fourth quarter? Charles McLaughlin : No, I wouldn't say that gross margins had come down sequentially at all in Q4. So no, I wouldn't say that. I think that from a -- what we're saying -- trying to say is some of the revenue in the fourth quarter, mostly, the PacSci EMC stuff, may be moved into the third quarter. But that's all we were trying to signal there. Brian Drab : Okay. And then on GTT, this is interesting because it's within your highest growth subsegment, I guess, within the telematics, high single-digit core growth. Can you talk about what this does to the $3 billion approximate TAM that you have in that subsegment? How large is the TAM for GTT? And what has the growth rate been at GTT? And what would you expect it to be going forward? James Lico : We think the market is at least a mid-single-digit grower. I have to think about it, but I think we're -- I think the available market there is maybe $0.25 billion or something like that for their specific segments. I think the broader thing that we have the opportunity to do, as we mentioned, is we moved from just retail petroleum to the more telematics revenue as well as new things around smart transportation. We do have an opportunity to add a bigger available market to the platform over time. So this is a good start but not -- certainly maybe, we've evolved the platform with telematics a few years ago, we've evolved it again with GTT and we'll continue to evolve it over time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joseph Giordano : I wanted to talk a little bit about commercial markets. There's been some talk about some of those markets getting a little bit weaker, and I was wondering what you're seeing there, maybe from some takeaways from Fluke. James Lico : Well, I think we don't have -- in the sense of commercial sort of retail, we don't have a lot of exposure to that. And I -- but I would say mostly -- I'm just thinking as I'm talking. I think on balance probably, stable would be the best way to think about it for us. When we think about the whole construction industry in that respect, residential is a very small part of our business. Facilities maintenance, a big part of our business. Commercial construction, kind of not a real big piece either. So I think when we look at those -- the segments, when we really think about Fluke, it's mostly facilities maintenance, so in many cases, it's the buildings that are already built, if you will. Joseph Giordano : Okay, fair enough. And then the strength at Qualitrol, can you maybe dig into that a little bit? Like what -- anything specific you'd call out as to what's driving that versus like a generally more weak power market? James Lico : Yes. We -- well, we sell to utilities -- and generally, we -- our value proposition, if you will, is to be OEM-agnostic, meaning that when utilities have a multiple OEM equipment -- specialty transformers, we're going to be the OEM-agnostic condition monitoring system that goes in. So utilities are trying to get -- in the developed world, you've got the growth around the aging infrastructure and utilities needing to make sure that the equipment they have today is working. And in -- obviously, in high-growth markets, you've got the opportunity of expanded infrastructure. So those are really the drivers. They're doing a wonderful job of really growing the business, very global business. They did some changes to their go-to-market strategy this year that are -- have some good results as well. So it's not just market, but also, they're making a lot of their own -- luck through some implementation of some good FBS tools. Joseph Giordano : When you talk about that in the emerging -- in like -- places like China when they talk about the capacity -- newbuild capacity slowing, and I'm sure that -- I'm guessing that, that business is more of like a new capacity addition in those kind of markets, how are you seeing that there? James Lico : I think in -- well, first, I would say I was in the Middle East. Obviously, you asked a China question, but I was in the Middle East with them a couple of weeks ago, and they've got good growth in the Middle East, even against a tough Middle East comp. But China, they are seeing growth. They're doing well there. Again, while you continue to see maybe some of the big power plants, they're not really tied to the power plant construction as much as they are tied to the infrastructure in terms of getting power to cities. So in that respect, we're seeing growth. I think for the year, they've grown very well. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Patrick Newton : I guess, first, a clarification on EMV. I believe in an earlier answer, you said that you're seeing it draw out a little bit longer. So should we think of 100 bps of organic growth related to EMV in 2017 as maybe being a little bit slower? And then just with commentary on kits outweighing dispenser demand at this point, should we think about, all else equal, a little bit lower revenue contribution but a higher margin? James Lico : I don't -- Patrick, thanks for the question. I don't think we'll call what the growth will be for 2017 just yet. Relative to the time frame, we still stand by sort of a 5-year time frame, with probably 4 years left. Maybe we'll probably put this year into that 5 years. I think that's what we said. We've been consistent around that. And we think in 2020-ish kind of time frame, it will continue to play out. So that's how we see it. As I mentioned -- relative to growth for next year, we're still looking at funnels. We're still -- we're obviously still closing business. So we'll really have a better sense of how much growth that will add to the portfolio. But 100 bps to Fortive was -- is our base case of what we've been talking about. There's nothing to suggest to us, at least at this point, that, that wouldn't be true. And then finally, on the kits versus dispensers, certainly more kits in the quarter. Our $500 million market sizing over the next several years sort of takes into account a kit versus dispenser model. And nothing in the quarter would necessarily put us off anything material off that model. Patrick Newton : Great. And just one more, if I may. Jim, just a big picture question. You clearly have an increased focus on software. That was a highlight at your Analyst Day, and you've touched on this somewhat in your remarks today. But could you highlight some progress in the quarter across the entire Fortive portfolio and maybe help us understand the software contribution to overall Fortive revenue? James Lico : Yes. I'd maybe take the last question first. It's still a small part of our revenue, but it's an important part of our revenue. I think it's an important part of our story strategically. Chuck and I just finished all the strategic plans with our businesses. And clearly, software is finding its way into the strategy and the value proposition of our customers across the portfolio. In terms of highlight, we certainly talked about it with Fluke Connect and the launch of their condition monitoring solution, which gives them a SaaS-based solution that they're selling today. We combine that with eMaint. We now have some revenue of SaaS-based. We start now with a SaaS-based revenue base at Fluke, and we'll move from there. It probably won't be material for a couple of years, but the growth rate will be exceptional. Insite360, which is our offering at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, is doing exceptionally well. We've talked about our telematics business. A little bit less revenue growth in telematics this quarter but a very good subscriptions. And with almost 0.5 million users of telematics solutions around the world, with all -- with a SaaS-based revenue solution, I think we're in very good position to grow the business. But as I mentioned over time, that really means that it will have a material impact in several years. We'll continue to invest like we did with eMaint when we find opportunities to accelerate our positions. I think that's what the wonderful part of our ability to deploy capital is, is Fluke had a computerized maintenance management software addition to their software portfolio, and we accelerated that strategy by 4 years with the addition of eMaint. So I just think that's exactly what we're going to do around the portfolio and a real opportunity to add a SaaS-based revenue to the portfolio over time. Thanks, Patrick. Great to talk to you.  And thanks, everybody, for joining us. We really appreciate your time this evening, most of you on the East Coast. Have a great evening, and we'll look forward to catching up with you. And I'll give it back to Lisa. Lisa Curran : All right. Thank you. Thank you, David. That's it for the call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank all of you for your participation. And you may disconnect at any time.",

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We closed 2016 on a positive note delivering outperformance from both core sales and earnings growth perspectives as our outstanding team of 24,000 employees around the world, leverage the power of the Fortive Business System. 2016 was a remarkable year as we not only launched Fortive, but seamlessly serve our customers accelerating product innovation maintained or expanded leading market positions in all of our businesses and lift our values by holding over 700 Kaizens including the CEO Kaizen we highlighted last quarter. And our first two quarters as a standalone company, Fortive delivered over 3% core revenue growth, expanded core adjusted operating margin 90 basis points and gross margin 60 basis points. Delivered free cash flow conversion of 129% and grew adjusted earnings 12% all while continuing to invest in both growth and productivity initiatives and M&A that will allow Fortive to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Living our values helping our customers accelerate progress and leveraging the power of the Fortive Business System positions us well for 2017 and beyond. Turning to the fourth quarter of 2016 for a more detailed discussion of our results, let me first remind you that the following information reflects year-over-year increases or decreases relative to the supplemental financial data posted to our website. Adjusted net earnings of $237.7 million were up 3.6% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.68. If not for the $0.04 of additional investments we guided last quarter, adjusted net earnings per share would have grown 9%. Currency was an additional $0.01 headwind to adjusted EPS. Sales grew 3.3% to $1.6 billion or a core revenue increase of 3.5% reflecting growth in five out of our six platforms. Acquisitions contributed approximately 90 basis points of growth during the fourth quarter, which was more than offset by approximately 110 basis points of unfavorable currency translation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Geographically for the second quarter in a row, North America and Western Europe drove low single-digit revenue growth in developed markets. High growth markets accelerated to high single-digit growth in the quarter driven primarily by China and improved results in Latin America partially offset by challenging Middle East markets. North American growth of low single-digits was driven primarily by strong performance at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Matco, Fluke and Kollmorgen. Western Europe growth of high single-digits continues to reflect outperformance to the general macro environment as market share gains were realized across both professional instrumentation and industrial technology segments. As we guided last quarter, we use the outperformance in third quarter of 2016 to invest opportunistically back in our businesses in the form of both long-term growth and productivity investments. Even with those additional investments, we delivered solid margin performance in the quarter demonstrating the value of FBS and focused execution. Gross margin was 49% reflecting 90 basis points of expansion over the prior year. Operating profit margin was 20.8% which reflects core adjusted operating margin expansion of 20 basis points. During the fourth quarter, we generated approximately $278 million of free cash flow and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 124%. For the full year, free cash flow conversion was 115%. Turning to our segments, Professional Instrumentation posted core revenue growth of 1.2% and acceleration of almost 50 basis points over the third quarter of 2016, reflecting continued stabilization in North American industrial markets. FX was a significant headwind in the quarter of approximately 130 basis points, partially offset by growth from acquisitions of 40 basis points. Professional Instrumentation operating profit margin was 23.1% reflecting a core operating margin decline of 30 basis points driven primarily by long-term growth investments undertaken in the quarter partially offset by decreased amortization. Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue increased low single-digits primarily led by good performance of both Fluke and Qualitrol, which comprised our field solutions platform. Field solutions core revenue was up low single-digits in the quarter with Fluke and Qualitrol posting low single-digit and high single-digit growth respectively. The growth at Fluke reflected solid demand for handheld industrial products in North America as well as Western Europe. Sell-through data continues to improve in both regions. The integration of eMaint Enterprises continues to go well and we\u2019ve seen positive customer reaction as we launch combined offerings to provide our Fluke Condition Monitoring Solution. eMaint held a customer conference in November, where customers have the ability to preview the new integrated solutions to improve productivity of labor resources, increase equipment up time and increase asset life via shifted predictive maintenance. We were overwhelmed by the number of customers eager to be early adopters, and while it\u2019s still early days on the commercialization front, the sales funnel expanded approximately 30% in January versus December. We\u2019ll continue to keep you updated on this important growth driver for both Fluke and Fortive. The Fluke team continues to innovate and expand the Fluke connected tool box as evidenced by the recent release of the Ti480 Infrared Camera. The Ti480 introduces 640 by 480 resolution into a ruggedized pistol grip form factor to maintenance professionals across a variety of vertical markets. We\u2019ve seen incredible traction with this camera during it\u2019s first six weeks on the market and are excited about it\u2019s growth prospects going forward. Qualitrol\u2019s high-single digit growth marks it\u2019s eleventh consecutive quarter of positive core growth. Demand continues to be driven by utility customers in high growth markets particularly the Middle East and APAC regions where we continue to gain share with OEMs. The Qualitrol team has made important progress executing their condition based monitoring strategy. And leveraging it\u2019s broad offering to customers clearly FBS has played a critical role in improving funnel visibility and marketing identification. Moving to product realization the platform, core revenues were down low-single digits this quarter reflecting project timing of PacSci EMC and Invetech. For the year, these two businesses grew at low-single digit rates. Given the nature of these project based businesses it\u2019s not unexpected to see variation in growth quarter to quarter. We do have good line of sight into the backlog at PacSci EMC and Invetech and we expect continued low single digit growth trajectory forward. Tektronix reported low-single digit core revenue growth during the quarter reflecting continued outperformance in China of high-double digits and stabilization in developed markets. China growth remains to be driven by the conductor semiconductor and communications segments where we continue to gain market share with our industry leading technology. In North America we\u2019re seeing signs of stabilization. But no signs of recovery in the computer and semiconductor segment. The military, government and educational sectors continue to perform well here and we see tremendous traction with our 70 gigahertz real time Oscilloscope particularly within data centers. Our Sensing Technologies platform posted high-single digit core growth in the quarter. The controls end markets continue to be challenged partially offsetting strong outperformance in our sensor businesses where we saw new key account wins globally and increased demand for our MRO products in North America. Moving to our industrial technology segment, we realized core revenue growth of 5.6% in quarter. Acquisitions contributed approximately 130 basis points of growth relative to prior year, which was partially offset by a 100 basis points of unfavorable currency translation. Reported operating profit margin, increased to 20.7% and core operating margin was up 80 basis points for the quarter reflecting margin expansion across all platforms. Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high-single digit growth in the quarter with Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivering high-single digit core revenue growth. During the fourth quarter, we experienced a headwind from the EMV related indoor point-of-sale solutions that was more than offset by an increase in outdoor EMV related demand for both dispensers and payment kits. The November 2016 announcement regarding the outdoor liability shift in the U.S. to 2020 did not have an impact on our fourth quarter results as most customers had already ordered before year end, consistent with their capital spend budgets. Looking forward we don\u2019t expect the delay to affect the total incremental outdoor EMV opportunity that we previously outlined. And we continue to believe that this is a three to four year opportunity. Net, net we view the 2020 timeline as a positive as it reduces our customer\u2019s near term liability and also because we expect the incremental outdoor EMV impact will be more evenly distributed over the next several years. Telematics realized core growth of low-single digits in the quarter with most of the growth stemming from outside the U.S. Director our new SaaS platform continues to gain traction and we\u2019re encouraged by our record high installed base in the United States. We\u2019re further encouraged by the recent ELD or Electronic Logging Device decision that clears the way for ELD adoption by the transportation industry beginning in 2017. Automation and specialty components posted mid-single digit, core revenue growth in the quarter. Automation growth was offset by core revenue decline in Jacobs Vehicle Systems which was impacted by the challenged North American heavy truck market. Within automation Kollmorgen and Thomson both grew core revenues high-single digits. Thomson\u2019s growth was driven by distribution, medical equipment, and off-highway vertical markets. This is Kollmorgen\u2019s third consecutive quarter of growth and was reflective of outperformance in both developed and high growth markets driven primarily by targeted efforts in the medical robotics and metal-forming verticals. Kollmorgen\u2019s use the speed design review help them execute their robotic strategy to address secular growth in collaborative robotics and they grew revenue strong double digits in China in 2016, as a result of their FBS commercial growth tools. These are just a couple of examples of how our businesses leverage FBS to drive growth and outperform their markets. Moving to franchise distribution, which posted low-single digit growth for the quarter, I\u2019m happy to share that once again Matco grew revenue at a high-single digit rate as we continue to gain share via both same store sales and franchise apps. Matco Expo, Matco\u2019s largest franchise event of the year is in the first quarter of 2017 and we are anticipating record attendance of almost 10% over the prior year. Matco\u2019s mid-single digit or better core revenue growth track record is now 26 out of the last 28 quarters. To wrap up, we have a strong finish in the fourth quarter contributing to a solid start for Fortive. As I had alluded to before the reinvigoration of our culture was evident as the Fortive Business System drove both core top line and earnings out performance while allowing for investment in the future. Our excellent cash flow performance combined with our strong balance sheet leaves us well positioned for disciplined acquisitions and growth investments to strengthen our businesses and market leading positions in 2017. We are initiating our full year 2017 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $2.60 to $2.70, which includes assumptions for low-single digit core revenue growth, amidst stable end markets. Combined with the benefits of our additional restructuring and growth investments this past quarter, as well as decreased amortization we anticipate core margin expansion in excess of 50 basis points with an effective tax rate of 28% for the year. In 2017, we expect currency to be approximate headwind of 100 basis points to 200 basis points to the top line and $0.05 to EPS. As you can see from the waterfall in the slides, we expect productivity and restructuring benefits to provide a $0.04 to $0.05 tailwind and low-single digit core revenue growth at a 30% to 35% fall through to contribute $0.04 to $0.13. Our resulting 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.60 to $2.70 implies growth of 7% at the high-end of the guidance. We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.54 to $0.58, which also includes an assumption of low-single digit core revenue growth. In closing I want to say how proud I am of our 24,000 employees for all that we\u2019ve accomplished in this milestone year. I\u2019m looking forward to Fortive\u2019s first full year as a standalone company. Fortive\u2019s culture of FBS and accountability will serve our customers and you, our shareholder as well as we live our values and work every day to deliver essential technology for the people who accelerate progress. We\u2019re committed to making 2017 another great year. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Lisa. Lisa Curran : Thanks Jim. Before we move into questions I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to announce that Fortive will host its first Investor and Analyst Day on May 18, 2017 in New York City. Further details will be circulated soon. That concludes our formal comments. David, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Thanks, good afternoon everybody. I\u2019d love to \u2013 Jim, get your thoughts on the M&A pipeline actually sort of stepping back for a minute here it\u2019s obviously an important part to the overall business model. And in terms of how that\u2019s tracking the capability building up what you see and what you would like investors to have from an expectations perspective in terms of both direction and kind of how you see that maybe playing out over the next year? Jim Lico : Thanks Steve. I think first of all, M&A continues to be our main priority so no change in that. We think today, we have about $3 billion worth of capacity over the next couple of years. And so we\u2019ve got plenty of opportunity. As we mentioned on prior calls really a number of things have been happening in relative to building our own capacity, couple deals that we\u2019ve got done in the third quarter as we mentioned on the prior call. Nothing this quarter but certainly we\u2019re very busy and I think we are very fortunate to be in a position we are at right now from a balance sheet perspective. I\u2019m highly confident we will get some things done in 2017 with a breadth of deals both from a size perspective and across the platforms. Steven Winoker : And our bid-ask spreads in places which you think are favorable enough to getting deals done? Jim Lico : Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say pricing has been an issue at all I think at the end of the day, we\u2019ve been very much \u2013 we\u2019ve been active and I think we haven\u2019t seen much change in pricing over the last 12 months. Steven Winoker : Okay, great. And maybe just a little color \u2013 I know you had already guided to that $0.04 of additional investment last quarter and I\u2019m looking also at the core margin contraction and professional instrumentation. I think that $0.04 would probably translate to something like 120 basis points headwind overall for the whole company. But maybe just talk about where we spent, did you spend more than that is there additional restructuring how that \u2013 what was the makeup of that 30 basis point contraction that kind of thing? Chuck McLaughlin : Hey, Steve. This is Chuck. The restructuring that we spent \u2013 we spent additional $0.02 and that was fairly evenly split between the two platforms may be a little more in terms of PI but pretty evenly split there and then I think \u2013 the other $0.02 we did an additional on growth spend. Jim Lico : Yes, mostly I think the other $0.02 on growth was mostly in PI I think, Steve as it translated we were able to accelerate a number of things around condition monitoring, some things we want to do on the new platform to tack as well as a couple of incremental investments in other parts of the portfolio. So that just gives you a sense of both the restructuring and the growth. Steven Winoker : Okay, great. And Jim, I got you just one last thing which is what are you really sensing underlying drivers of sentiment in growth across your customer discussions particularly in light of all of the political and other changes or since November what are you hearing out there and Chuck probably should maybe comment on the tax position for the company as well? Jim Lico : Okay, we will take that in a short answer but certainly as we talk to a number of customers we\u2019ve been out. I think there is not a real change at this point with anyone\u2019s out look at this point, lot moving around and most customers are really started waiting to really understand if there\u2019s difference from a policy perspective that are actually going to be enacted. So I would say its still very early days we note at the stabilization in the North American market from really the third to the fourth being pretty consistent so no real uptick and nor is there one plant in our guide. Chuck McLaughlin : Steve, from the tax standpoint as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of there\u2019s so many \u2013 there\u2019s breadth of opportunities out there and changes going it\u2019s really hard for us to put a fine point on that but we would note that the corporate tax rates coming down is going to be favorable for us like it is all industrials. We\u2019re little more overweight in U.S. and we think and we know it to be a net exporter so all the scenarios I\u2019ve seen so far are going to be favorable to us but we haven\u2019t baked any of that and we are going to wait until something gets a little closer to print before we start quantifying that. Steven Winoker : Sounds great. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thank you, Steve. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Steve. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning, guys. Jim Lico : Hey, Scott. Chuck McLaughlin : Hey, Scott. I\u2019m trying to get a sense \u2013 I mean just a couple of things and one just nitpicky but is this \u2013 is 6.1% kind of the level of R&D that you expect to kind of stay at longer term and same kind of my question SG&A added, maybe you addressed why that went up year-over-year but is that function of some of the new acquisitions are came in or is that a \u2013 kind of a new level now that you\u2019ve had a chance to hire people that you needed to hire and build-out the corporate structure that you\u2019ve needed? Jim Lico : The R&D, the 6.1 we\u2019ve been right around there, up or down 10 basis points and now you expect this to be there, when you click down by opco there\u2019s going to be some changes this projects ebb and flow but no real changes to our R&D from \u2013 we want to change the investment level. So its just the normal place. The big thing that\u2019s going on in terms of SG&A is the growth investments we put in, in the second half of the year as we saw the top line strengthening we kicked off a little bit more investment and we really called out some of that in the third quarter when we overachieved in the third quarter so we\u2019re going to even put a little bit more to try and accelerate and help us out next year. Scott Davis : Fair enough. And then just a follow-up I\u2019m guessing you guys would be pretty disappointed if you just did 3% to 7% EPS growth your first full year out of the gate. Is this \u2013 would you characterize this is a fairly conservative forecast that you would certainly hope to be able to beat or don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth but we can address that a bit, how you think about that? Jim Lico : Scott, we think of it in a couple of ways first the guide doesn\u2019t assume any M&A. And so whether you are getting into high single-digits without the benefit of deploying using our balance sheet is what we\u2019ve been really consistently saying and we feel pretty good about that. Having said that, as Jim said we expect to deploy some M&A and that\u2019s the thing I think is going to take our \u2013 that I expect to take our earnings growth up over the next year or two. Scott Davis : Okay. Best of luck, guys. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks Scott. Have a good day. Operator : We will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks, evening guys. Just want to \u2013 can you hear me? Jim Lico : Yes, we can. Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yes. Hi, Jim. So can you just maybe talk about the low single-digits growth for next year, and how that\u2019s \u2013 how you\u2019ve seen that shaken out by segment and maybe by SPU? And maybe just as a follow on to that, if you just look at some of your canary in a coal mine businesses such as automation, up high single-digits. It feels like there\u2019s a bit more of a powerful recovery maybe warm in here. You obviously not ready to make that call, but maybe just dress up on that as well. Chuck McLaughlin : So, Nigel, the thing is on the core growth it has low single-digits that\u2019s we posted a couple of low single-digits in the second half of 2016. Our markets remain stable. We\u2019re not seeing a big change in them going forward and that\u2019s really about what we\u2019re seeing in the way with what\u2019s the guide is going forward. Certainly there are some things that are going up and down by regions and by product lines, but net-net we haven\u2019t seen any big recovery. Jim Lico : Nigel, maybe just a little bit of color, I think as we said in the prepared remarks, regionally we expect sort of the U.S. and kind of the developed markets to be \u2013 what I would say relatively stable in that kind of low single-digit range, will probably get a little bit uptick in the high growth markets above that, maybe mid single-digits and the high growth markets for the year. So that\u2019s kind of our thought here. We don\u2019t anticipate any big shift in any of the markets. Relative to operating company, certainly we\u2019re seeing a little bit better growth in places like Fluke that we expect, in automation, Kollmorgen\u2019s three quarters in a row, track record is pretty good \u2013 is obviously very good, we\u2019re very pleased with that. And then some of the perennial folks like Matco and Gilbarco will continue to do well. But I think it\u2019s a very balanced approach to growth I think as we think about it, both regionally as well as within \u2013 as Chuck mentioned in the segments and certainly as you drill down in the operating companies, pretty balanced as well. Still a little noisy at Tektronix, particularly in the developed markets, they\u2019re doing an outstanding job in their high growth markets, particularly in China as we noted on the prepared remarks, but we still think Tek is going to be a little noisy in the first half. Nigel Coe : Okay, that\u2019s great. It\u2019s great color. Just as a quick follow-on, the bridge looks very reasonable in totality. You\u2019ve had a little bit of a couple questions on the incremental margins for next year, 30% \u2013 35%. I think a lot of folks see you as a 35% or maybe better flow through. Anything \u2013 just thinking about it now, is it going to be conservative, anything in terms of growth investment, restructuring that you think into next year? Chuck McLaughlin : Well, Nigel, two things one is if you\u2019re looking at on the bridge there, we do call it 30% \u2013 35%. But we also call out a couple bars back where there\u2019s productivity that probably take that number to be a little bit higher and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been seeing this year being a little bit better on that flow through getting to the OMX of around 50 basis points. Nigel Coe : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much. Jim Lico : Thanks Nigel. Operator : And we will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good afternoon. Jim Lico : Good afternoon. Chuck McLaughlin : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Hi. My first question was really just be on the industrial tech piece and GVR specifically. You\u2019d mentioned some sort of headwinds around the indoor rollouts in Q4. So I just wondered how you see that playing out over the next kind of 12 months in terms of the U.S. indoor versus outdoor growth rates. Chuck McLaughlin : So we would expect the indoor to be a headwind now for the next four quarters or so, Julian. It\u2019s really \u2013 we\u2019re at about what we would say is kind of a run \u2013 a typical run rate, almost a replacement rate at this point. So it will be a headwind the rest of the year. We noted that for Fortive the EMV outdoor would be around 100 basis points of health. We probably now think that\u2019s going to be a little bit under given the announcement to 2020. We still have a firm belief in the strength of the opportunity over the next three or four years through 2020, but maybe an air pocket or two this year as some of our customers may be delayed things a quarter or two. I think very consistently with what we talked about because we\u2019ve been talking about EMV over 12 months, haven\u2019t been in the industry for a long time. We really don\u2019t think it will be the summertime before really have a good sense of how this is going to roll out over the next couple of years. Julian Mitchell : Understood, thanks. And then my follow-up would just be around the sensing business. That have had a very tough couple of years I think maybe some share loss in their, seem to come back in the fourth quarter. Maybe give a little bit of detail on what drove the sensing recovery and what sort of growth rates you should expect that piece to have over the next sort of 12 months? Chuck McLaughlin : Well, I think first we were pleased in the fourth quarter with the performance. We think about the sensing platform as two pieces, the control aspect which is things like temperature controllers and then peer sensing particularly our sensing businesses Gems and Anderson-Negele. The sensing businesses are going to certainly grow in the mid single-digit range, they\u2019re really \u2013 they had a little bit easier comp in the fourth quarter, but they\u2019ll post that some of those comps through the year and I think we have good growth this year. That\u2019s on the backs of some new OEM wins as well as just broader MRO performance. So what we think \u2013 I think we\u2019re probably in that low to mid single-digit growth for them for the platform for the rest of the year, little bit depended on how the control site does, but we\u2019re very bullish on the sensor side of that and we think they will have a good year in 2017. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Chuck McLaughlin : Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks Julian. Operator : We will take our next question from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Sprague : Good day everyone. Jim Lico : Hi, Jeff. Chuck McLaughlin : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Hi. Jim, could you touch a little bit more on really Tek and how you see it plane for the year? I think through the back half of 2016 you\u2019re kind of gearing up for some new product launches, just kind of a refresh going on. Is there any particular timeline to think about in terms of meaningful things hitting the market or do they expect some kind of more gradual progression there? Jim Lico : Yes. So the fourth quarter performance was really more of a story of just them blocking and tackling well. The high-growth market is doing very well. China, India, number of those markets doing well. So there really was not as much an innovation story, that\u2019s really to come. I think we highlighted that they have a new platform coming out in the second half of the year, which we\u2019re really excited about. We think it will deliver some increased revenue for sure. And we just passed a major milestone on that platform here a couple of weeks ago, so it gives us even more confidence that launch is going to be on time in the second half and that will start a series of new products over the next several years. So it\u2019s not just sort of one big launch in the second half, but really office platform that will keep a level of innovation in the marketplace that we\u2019re excited about. So the tech team is doing \u2013 I think we\u2019ll see a little bit choppy first half. I think they will probably be okay in the first quarter because they\u2019re little bit easier comp in the first quarter as well. But I think as we get to the second half we\u2019ll see improved performance. Unidentified Analyst : In a similar vein in terms of kind of growth initiatives maybe update us a little bit on the Fluke Connect. You mentioned it in your opening script, but how that is progressing maybe the size of the business at this point if you would like to share with any other color around that. Jim Lico : Yes. When we launched the condition \u2013 we have the Fluke Connect tools out for a few years and then just as we mentioned on the new infrared camera, this is the launch of another connected tool which is great. So that level of innovation we\u2019ve continued into the marketplace. The condition monitoring solution that will certainly highlight at the Investor Conference as well. We\u2019ll give you a sense of that, but that really got launched in the fourth quarter. Early days as I mentioned that combined with the eMate suite, software suite that will be an integrated solution here shortly. And we\u2019re seeing a lot of dual selling that\u2019s able to happen with the team relative to the getting sales leads and building funnel. But it\u2019s still fairly early days, not a lot of revenue yet. I think one thing the sales cycles a little bit longer. This is a SaaS-based solution. So it takes a little bit longer to get the customer to think through that. So I think we\u2019re probably not going to see meaningful revenue to the second half, as we work through the lead gen, work through the funnel and then obviously you need to build momentum with SaaS-based business before it starts to bring the cash register. So we \u2013 it\u2019s really probably a second half even in the 2018 kind of story, but we\u2019ll \u2013 we\u2019re very \u2013it\u2019s still early days I said in the prepared remarks, but I think we\u2019re in a very good place relative to the solution and the way customers are really understanding and getting to understand the solutions. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Jim Lico : Maybe just a final note on that \u2013 we\u2019ve got about that the target market on that is about 600,000 manufacturing sites around the world where they really, really don\u2019t have a solution today and can really easily install the solution for a low, with a very low interest costs and ability to upsell them with new features over time. So it takes a little while to get out of those places and get the lead generation engine going, but we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve started and I\u2019m very \u2013 I\u2019ve got great optimism here. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Richard Eastman : Yes. Good afternoon. Jim Lico : Hi, Rick. Richard Eastman : Jim, Chuck, maybe one of you could just address pricing and how much price we\u2019re able to capture in 2016 and maybe what the outlook is for 2017. And just kind of flow that into the gross margin discussion, I\u2019m curious with gross margin of 90 basis points year-over-year. What\u2019s the realistic pacing of improvement? We gross margin year-over-year that we should look forward kind of help you pay for the other investments. Chuck McLaughlin : So Rick, it\u2019s Chuck. Couple of things for the year, I think we were up 40 basis points in pricing and our gross margins \u2013 the easy one going for 50 basis points is a good thing to plug in looking forward deploying FBS from all the levers that we have that it sometimes it can be a little higher, sometimes going to be a little lower. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 those are the quick answers. One thing I feel like a probably get your next question is Q4 was actually down in pricing and it was down 20 basis points largely due to the some big deals around EMV. If we call that out, we would\u2019ve been up 10 points to 20 points and special instrumentation and industrial technologies, but because of that EMV some of the big deals, some of the big guys that did post negative in Q4, but still 40 basis points for the year. Jim Lico : And maybe this is a final point, even though we did have a little bit more price at Gilbarco on the quarter, we had excellent gross margin in performance in the quarter. So one of the things we look at the combination of pricing gross margin is probably part of your question Rick, is to make sure that even if we\u2019re giving up a little price, sometimes we\u2019re giving price on maybe higher software or something that inevitably brings higher gross margins in the portfolio anyway. And in this case even with that price, we are able to as you pointed out to deliver excellent gross margins. Richard Eastman : Yes. Is it noticeable, the mix of business shifting again towards description toward SaaS. Is that noticeable or is just really about price and about and FBS at this point. Jim Lico : I think at this point it still price in FBS. I mean that we really do as you know, we drive businesses really hard on a regular basis around continuous improvement on gross margins. Price is an FBS tool and we utilize it in every business every year. So those are just kind of standard work in our businesses. If our SaaS and software today its 4%. Those businesses were up about \u2013up double digit. I think if we look at all those collective offerings in the quarter, but it\u2019s still a small part of the business. It\u2019s really going to take a little while for that, that to really be a meaningful impact. And that part of our confidence whenever we get the question about our ability to drive gross margins over time, it\u2019s not only the power of FBS, but it\u2019s also the business mix that we can see over the next four or five years that coming at us. Richard Eastman : Yes. And then just last question on the telematics business, the shift has been going on, I\u2019m going to say industry wide, but certainly at Fortive towards more of a SaaS-based model for subscription on within the telematics business. Is that going to continue and will it keep the growth rate within the telematics business kind of in this low-single digit range here for another 12 months or could that accelerate. Jim Lico : Yes. It should accelerate. I think the market\u2019s growing. I think as we pointed out last couple of quarters that our non-U.S. business has been exceptionally good. We added in the fourth quarter double-digit units into the portfolio, but because of a variety of different things that we needed to do relative to some customers they didn\u2019t necessarily, it doesn\u2019t necessarily transition in the quarter right, because it SaaS takes a number of quarters to play out. So we think that this certainly can be the markets growing in the U.S. mid to high-single digits and in some segments even higher than that. So we really believe. We\u2019ve launched this new director platform as we mentioned in the prepared remarks and we\u2019re excited about it. We need to get it more pervasively through our installed base. And we think once that\u2019s more in with more customers are opportunity to change the trajectory that growth rate is pretty good as we move throughout 2017. Richard Eastman : Understood. Okay, thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks. Have a great night. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Good evening everyone. Jim Lico : Hi Shannon. Chuck McLaughlin : Hi Shannon. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Hey Jim maybe just follow-up on the EMV, the idea of maybe people pushing things out a little bit, post the deadline. I mean have you heard that so far and also what\u2019s your view on how the mix of kits versus the dispensers might shift versus now that there\u2019s a longer timeframe do you think people might get the kit and wait for a full dispenser upgrade. Maybe just some thoughts on how the push out might affect some of the dynamics even if the overall opportunities. Thanks. Jim Lico : Yes, I think our instincts, right, as we said we really wouldn\u2019t know what the rollout would be. I think our instincts would tell us right now. I know it\u2019s not as much customer conversations as it is instinct haven\u2019t been in the industry for 20 years. Our instincts tell us will be a little bit of a pause here for customers as they think about the rollout strategy. That will be months and quarters not years. So but \u2013 and that\u2019s why we think we come off a little bit of that 100 basis points maybe a little bit less than 100 basis points. But those are the upside of that is \u2013 as they probably a better curve in terms of rollout, and as you mentioned we think probably less kits and more dispensers. So probably, as we get to mid-year, we\u2019ll have a better sense of that, where we remodel it every month, but I think our model will be more accurate. And at that point, we\u2019ll have a better sense for the market opportunity. But I think we always knew that there was probably going to be some level of push out and this really is probably mostly good news for us relative to how the next several years are look. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, thanks. And then as you think about the payoff from some of these growth investments, I just \u2013 you look at a business like Qualitrol that\u2019s grown for 11 straight quarters. It seems like every once in a while, you guys have a business like that goes on one of these run. Was that the result of some growth investment prior year, you saw particular market opportunity and if the current spending, do you see that kind of opportunity in other business and then you\u2019re spending money on now. Jim Lico : Yes, it\u2019s a couple things. One is that some expansion in resources around sales force around the world. The business just is doing great globally. That\u2019s number one. And in a couple of acquisitions, we did several years ago that gave us that can some of the products from a condition monitoring perspective that are driving some growth as well. So there \u2013 the team is done and that\u2019s the growth flywheel that we talk about metaphorically, so often about how acquisitions even small ones could accelerate growth in mid-size businesses and we think that that opportunity exists in a number of places in the portfolio. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Great, thanks. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hi guys, good evening. Jim Lico : Hi, Steve. Chuck McLaughlin : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just touch on organic growth for the \u2013 have you\u2019re going to start here for the first quarter just generally and then anything seasonally to think about on the EPS split, as it work for the year from a quarterly perspective. Jim Lico : Yes, I think the core growth as we\u2019re talking about a slow single digit, but we do have an easier compare in Q1. So it\u2019s probably going to the higher end of that range in Q1. And then I think that the EPS split as it goes through the year, we\u2019re still learning as we go here, but it\u2019s going to be something like 22, 26 \u2013 26, 28 if I get the numbers. That probably didn\u2019t adequately. But it\u2019s in those range\u2026 Steve Tusa : Okay, perfect. And I know I snap on it talked about some weakness in their business, maybe just from a macro perspective anything to talk about their growth rates \u2013 growth rate wise, it\u2019s been pretty strong in the last couple years, just curious if there\u2019s anything that changes here in the intermediate term. Jim Lico : Yes, they had a strong quarter, again the team is really executing well. They\u2019re continuing expand franchises, which really drives growth. We really kind of make sure that same-store sales are good. I suspect there was a little bit annoyed and if we went month to month, but as we really roll up the quarter, it was still very good. So I think at this point, what we\u2019re seeing right now with a combination of just wonderful attendance rate at our expo here in a couple of weeks as well as a good start. I think we\u2019re still going to be in that mid to high single-digit range for a while now. They\u2019re doing a great job. As we\u2019ve said and I know this is, FBS is really just one of our \u2013 from a growth perspective, is one of our best businesses for deploying FBS and our \u2013 in from a growth perspective. So they\u2019ll continue to do that. And I think will continue to perform well. Steve Tusa : And then one last one, you may have discussed if I may have missed it, sorry, if that happened but any \u2013 on the acquisition front, any commentary on whether it\u2019s kind of tougher to get things to the finish line with all the uncertainty out there out of Washington. And any color around, the phase of discussions between the buyers and sellers or even just being able to see the deal given the uncertainty around tax rates et cetera. Jim Lico : Nothing yet, I think we\u2019ve been number of things that we\u2019re doing actively have been going on for a little while. I don\u2019t necessarily get a sense that anyone\u2019s holding up for doing anything, because of waiting for Washington to do anything. And obviously, our discussions are global as well. So between the various things that go on both from a macroeconomic perspective in a geopolitical situation, you\u2019ve got a number of elections in Europe as well, which provide some uncertainty and usually uncertainty is a good thing, so for M&A. So I think all those things roll up to I think a pretty good environment right now. And as I mentioned before the bit out they haven\u2019t changed radically. So I \u2013 that\u2019s what gives me confidence say I know we\u2019ll do some deals here in 2017. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys. Jim Lico : Thanks, have a great evening. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Steve. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Obin, Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good evening. Jim Lico : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question on China. Can you just talk about Chinese trend and we\u2019ve been hearing that there are some messages in China about delays in capital spending in the first quarter yet. All the numbers that have been reported by corporate so far very good, and everybody believes that things continue to accelerate. Can you just give a more detail lead as to what you\u2019re seeing in China? Jim Lico : Yes, sure. I think, one we don\u2019t have a lot of CapEx businesses in China. So we\u2019re really fortunate to have things that are more related operating expense kinds of things. We\u2019re certainly getting the benefit of the secular trend in Tektronix, where they really well positioned themselves over the years to take advantage of a lot of the semiconductor and communication expansion that\u2019s going there and they\u2019re doing exceptionally well. So that\u2019s in our \u2013 certainly in our number and really have to do with \u2013 it really isn\u2019t a macro point. I think we go around the rest of the portfolio though we\u2019re continuing to see strength with a number of our OEMs that our automation team has partnerships with in our cultural business has and our food business is done pretty well as well. So we had \u2013 we just had an exceptional fourth quarter. I don\u2019t necessarily think that the strength that we\u2019ve seen is necessarily what happened all of 2017. But we still feel very bullish on what China look like next year and think it\u2019ll outpace our overall growth rate next year. Andrew Obin : You\u2019re not seeing a slowdown in China so far. Jim Lico : Not really, not really \u2013 it\u2019s still early right, you could never call China until about March, because of the new year in particularly the way the new year was position this year. So it is the \u2013 having run China for a long time. I generally try not to make any predictions and so well into March. Andrew Obin : That makes sense. And just one question, you sort of highlighted highway Thomson being very strong. Could you just comment what region or end market that refers to? Jim Lico : That\u2019s mostly a North America and a little bit of China comment. Their positions are pretty niche. So it really is market share gains for them and business with that size a few big market share wins really makes a big difference. Andrew Obin : Terrific. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, guys. Jim Lico : Hey, Andy. Chuck McLaughlin : Andy, how are you doing? Andrew Kaplowitz : Good, how are you? So Western Europe grew high single digits in the quarter and last quarter I think you said it was going to moderate, it doesn\u2019t seem like it did sell. So maybe you could talk about that. And then how concerned are you that geopolitical risk over there could moderate the growth as you go into 2017 because it does look like it\u2019s performing pretty well for you right now. Jim Lico : Yes. You\u2019re exactly right. Thanks for calling out my inability to forecast the geography. But clearly I think what we saw, some really good performance with some work that we\u2019ve been doing like at Kollmorgen on collaborative robots where they have a number of strong customers in Europe. And the number of businesses as well that are really more secular driven than any macro. And that continued in the quarter, but we don\u2019t think that that will continue. You mentioned some of the geopolitical risk I think we \u2013 Chuck and I would say that that does exist. We\u2019re monitoring it to understand it and we do think that Western Europe will moderate through the balance \u2013 through 2017. But we still think it will grow, we still think its probably at least a low single digit grower right now and it might be a little bit more noisy month to month and maybe even quarter to quarter because of what we just described on the election cycle. But I still think given our positions and what we\u2019ve been doing from an execution perspective, we feel good that we can get growth out of Europe this year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Chuck maybe you can talk about free cash flow conversion that you mentioned at end of the year that 115%, I know you guided its greater than 100% for the year. But can you talk about if there\u2019s any reason why free cash flow conversion would materially change in 2017. The business does ramp up a bit more, do you need more working capital to fund the business any sort of puts and takes that we should think about as we go into 2017 here? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes, I think you got pretty well nailed. 115% for the year I think that\u2019s a strong number for us. There\u2019s a couple of things that give us a little downward pressure we have a little bit of amortization rolling off in the year into 2017. We also finish really strong in our collections and that has a little bit of artifact to the days and how they fell out and probably be wise for us to count on that. So we think definitely over 100% and I think that\u2019s a good number for us. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. And just real quick follow up. The weakness that you said at GBS we start to see orders pickup in the U.S. heavy truck market have you seen any impact on the business yet or is it too early for that. Jim Lico : I think its certainly still early, their story for performances they have done a great job of mitigating much of the North American challenge \u2013 with a great challenge with a great business in China. But we\u2019re \u2013 its still a little early days on North America and if that\u2019s going to tick up or not. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks guys. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead. Patrick Newton : Yes, good afternoon, Jim and Chuck. I guess my first question is on EMV I think in the past one of the key competitive advantages that was highlighted was first market with qualified products. I\u2019m just curious if the delayed enforcement opens the window for increased competition or is that more of an indoor phenomena. Jim Lico : Well, certainly the certifications and those kinds of things are certainly something that was from an early perspective is really one of the reasons why we have such great growth last couple of years in North America. At the end of the day there\u2019s really it\u2019s sort of mostly a two horse race here and with good competitor there in Wayne. So I think at the end of the day how that will play out over the next several years is how we predicted. So we were never counting on that certifications being our competitive advantage. Our real competitive advantage is being number one, and dispensers being number one in payments and having the largest retail POS system for retail petroleum in the industry. So you combine that with our lead detection capability at Veeder-Root that ultimately is our completive weapon it\u2019s the technology we have at the site that we think is how we compete in. It\u2019s a logical competition amongst smart minded players if you will. So we \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reason why we like the market so much. Patrick Newton : Great. Thank you for the detailed answer. And I guess shifting to M&A focusing on a transaction that occurred in the test measurement industry rather large take out to whatever extent you can comment. Did you look at the asset and if so any discussion you can provide there and if not why not. And then just given that we\u2019re seeing that test measurement industry kind of heat up given multiple companies are looking to roll up the industry can you help us compare how this fits into your ranks as an M&A opportunity relative to your other platforms. Jim Lico : Well as we think about M&A relative to both field solutions and product realization or where Fluke and tech are. We certainly feel very strongly that additions to the set of solutions that we want to add at Fluke in manufacturing, in facilities where we take advantage of our huge installed base as Fluke are going to really like eMaint like we did last quarter are going to be the transactions or something bigger that would give us the ability to leverage our position around the world. Those are great deals and I think we\u2019ve said over time that our funnel for field solutions is been good for a while. Relative to tech and product realization, there was certainly a large transaction \u2013 we know the company well, we used to be in that industry but we got out of it. So we really were interested in it, we felt strongly that that exposure to the telecommunications players and things like that over time was probably less where we were going. So I think from that perspective it\u2019s probably safe to say that while we were in that business a number of years ago and so we know a number of the players in the industry, its where we\u2019re going with Tektronix is really around service and adding capabilities there to reduce volatility, to improve the margin structure, built on the great brand that we have attacked. Those are going to be the kind of deals that we would typically play that would be in our suite spot. But nothing in industries where we\u2019d likely see more volatility and where we\u2019d see consolidation amongst customers. Patrick Newton : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck. Jim Lico : All right. Thanks, Patrick. Have a great night. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, good evening guys. Jim Lico : Hey, Joe. Chuck McLaughlin : Good evening. Joe Ritchie : So following up on that price cost question from earlier, I guess what your expectation in for 2017. Are you baking in much material or labor inflation and your ability to use price to offset any of that. Jim Lico : So Joe, what we\u2019ve got begin is \u2013 what we normally have been looking for we think we have opportunities for 30 to 50 basis points of price. I think your question, on the cost side about what we expect from commodities and inflation and we\u2019re not really seeing a lot of inflation and if this plan. So when we see it will react to it. And we also have one of the great things about our portfolio\u2019s we\u2019re not exposed to a lot of commodities. So as this mean we\u2019re perhaps zero, but fairly little. So we haven\u2019t seen much of that upward pressure but even when there is we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a big driver that we won\u2019t be able to offset. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I guess maybe thinking on the margin point for a second. I saw that in your 2017 earnings bridge. You did get caught about $0.04 or $0.05 productivity and restructuring benefits. How much flexibility do you guys have to potentially collect this number higher and in this net of the growth investments that you\u2019re making in 2017 as well? Chuck McLaughlin : So what we haven\u2019t here is \u2013 in on that line is the investments that we made in prior years in 2016. How much we think that\u2019s going to improve our earnings because we invested in the business in the year before. So that\u2019s what that is the whole guide does include we expect to be doing restructuring in these businesses at all times. So in any point in time there\u2019s with the number of businesses we have and things going on there\u2019s always some level of this restructuring. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Got it. Jim Lico : Joe, I just wanted to add to that. That includes growth to \u2013 so when we think about it what Chuck and I view on our quarterly basis as we mean with every month we meet with our operating leaders to go through the financial. And if we think we have opportunity both either on the cost side or on the growth side will typically make decisions for incremental investments as we see the quarter play out. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That makes sense. Thank you, guys. Jim Lico : All right, thanks, Joe. Operator : We will take our next question from Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open. Brian Drab : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just have two quick follow ups to earlier questions. On the free cash flow for the year, do we need to see a pickup in M&A activity for you to get to that 100% and above to get to that threshold \u2013 given you \u2013 if without that you won\u2019t have some of the low hanging fruit in terms of working capital generation. Jim Lico : No, good question, but no, no our guide have been 100% or 105% free cash flow to net income does not assume any significant change in that. Going forward over time I can see that percentage working up with when we \u2013 as we do more M&A and get that benefit amortization you\u2019ll see it come off of 100% to 105% to something higher. But that is not in there now. Brian Drab : Okay, thanks. And then I may have missed this. But when you\u2019re talking about the impact of price, I heard you talk about 2016 in the fourth quarter but what is baked into the 2017 forecast in terms of price. Chuck McLaughlin : So we have but baked into next year 50 basis points of operating margin \u2013 gross margin expansion. Price is a piece of that and we would expect through the cycles to get 30 to 50 basis points there. Not every quarter but when you take a look at three or four quarters that\u2019s what we typically average. Brian Drab : Okay, thanks very much. Jim Lico : Thanks, Brian. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open. Charley Brady : Hey, thanks guys. Just a couple of quick one\u2019s here. Can you give me a little granularity on a lot of talk around border tariffs and kind of make a sense of any meaningful amount of COGS that you\u2019re getting from outside that goes into the U.S. manufacturing operations? And if there were something meaningful that we hit that line in your cost of goods sold line. And then on the other side of that kind of what you\u2019re manufacturing maybe outside the U.S. you\u2019re bringing back and get sold in here that could be affected by any kind of border tariff or tax? Jim Lico : Well, there\u2019s a lot of scenarios out there and we\u2019re watching them all. But net, net from the best way, the way we\u2019re working on it that we were a net exporter here. And so every scenario that I have seen this is going to be favorable to us. We do have things that we import externally but we export more. So every \u2013 so far in every scenario that I think we\u2019re going to turn out to have a lower tax rates as if and when they pass the law and in act. Charley Brady : Okay. Thanks, that\u2019s all I have. Jim Lico : All right, thanks, Charley. Lisa Curran : All right. We thanks for joining us today. Remember we announced our Investor Day will be May 18 and Josh and I are around this evening if you have any follow up questions. Tomorrow as well, thank you. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at any time.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our performance as we began our first full years at Fortive. We had a strong start to 2017 by delivering mid-teens adjusted earnings growth above the high end of our guidance in mid-single digit core revenue growth. All six of our strategic platforms grew core sales reflecting strong volume, gains in market share and accelerated performance in high growth markets. Through the successful deployment of the Fortive business system, for the third consecutive quarter we were able to once again deliver above market revenue growth, margin expansion and solid free cash flow. We are committed to create sustainable long-term value for both our customers and shareholders. Our culture of continuous improvement, disciplined capital deployment and secular growth drivers give us confidence in our future and expectation of continued outperformance for 2017. During the first quarter we held our first annual leadership conference and rallied our team around Fortive's shared purpose, a special technology for the people who accelerated progress. Our top global leaders gather to review our 2016 performance, benchmark FBS practices and communicate our priorities for 2017 and beyond. We recognized Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Qualitrol and Matco as our top core growth company. Fluke was recognized with our leading innovation award and finally Qualitrol was honored with our CVD Award which is given to the company that demonstrates the greatest achievement across our core value metrics. The conference again demonstrated to me the powers of FBS and culture, the energy around our values and our team's strong belief in our future. With that I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA net earnings of $209.4 million were up 15.1% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.60 based on effective tax rate of 26.7% for the quarter. Sales grew 4.1% to $1.5 billion reflecting a core revenue increase of 4.9% as all our platforms posted core growth. Acquisitions contributed 20 basis point of growth during the first quarter, partially offset by 100 basis points of unfavorable currency translation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Geographically developed markets grew core revenue low single digits reflecting continued strength in Western Europe and stable demand in North America. North American growth of low single digits reflected strong performance that Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Matco which was summoned up by Jacobs Vehicle Systems. We continue to outperform in Western Europe hosting high single-digit growth as continued market share gains were realized across both professional instrumentation and industrial technology segments. High growth markets accelerated to low double digit core revenue growth in the quarter with strength across Asia. Double digit growth in China was driven by Tektronix, Qualitrol, and Morgan [ph]. India also grew revenue double digits, primarily reflecting Gilbarco Veeder-Root tender wins and in the Middle East and Africa region Fluke drove high single-digit core revenue growth. Gross margins was 48.5% reflecting a 140 basis points expansion over the prior year with five out of our six platforms expanding gross margin. Along with the restructuring initiatives undertaken in 2016, our gross margin expansion has enabled us to continue to invest in new product development and sales and marketing. Operating profit margin was 19.2% with core operating margin expansion of 160 basis point driven by volume and margin fall-through. We were able to deliver continued margin expansion through targeted application about BS tools across our businesses and supply chain to drive increased productivity. During the first quarter we generated approximately $121 million of free cash flow and delivered a conversion ratio of 61% which is consistent with our -- with expectancy seasonality. For the full year we continue to believe that our free cash flow ratio will be greater than 100%. Turning to our segments, professional instrumentation posted sales growth of 2.7%, comprised of 4.6% percent core revenue growth offset by a 120 basis points currency headwind and 70 basis points due primarily to the separation from Danaher. Professional instrumentation delivered 22.1% operating margins with 160 basis points expansion of core operating margin reflecting favorable volume and the amortization, partially offset by 40 basis points of diluted operating margin associated with acquisitions. Advanced instrumentation and solutions core revenue increased mid-single digits during the quarter with similar performance in both field solutions and product realization. Field solutions core revenue was up mid-single digits in the quarter with both Fluke and Qualitrol posting strong core revenue growth. Fluke mid-single digit core growth results were led by high single-digit growth at Fluke Industrial which is the largest Fluke product line consisting of our handheld instrumentation. Regionally performance was strongest in Western Europe with high single-digit core revenue growth driven by market share gains in the improving macro environment. While small today, the Fluke Solutions grew double digits as eMaint continues to deliver strong growth while eMaint and Fluke condition monitoring to top honors and the plant engineering 2016 product of the year awards in the maintenance software and maintenance tools and equipment categories respectively. The Fluke team continues to introduce the Fluke Connect digital platform and we will be unveiling our new brand and go-to-market strategies throughout May during a series of customer events across the U.S. You will see much of this at our Investor Day in May where we will talk more broadly about our digital strategy and the industrial Internet of Things. While our digital presence is important in Fluke, I'd like to highlight ongoing innovation focused on building out the contractors tool [ph]. In our networks product line, Fluke released the DFX8000 [ph] cable analyzer which is the industry's first category eight field tester. The DFX8000 [ph] significantly reduces the cost of copper certification for datacom infrastructure contractors and data center network engineers. The Fluke networks team set up in a room and incorporated FBS tools including speed design revenue and lean software development into their innovation process to significantly reduce time to market. Qualitrol delivered mid-single digit growth and posted strong growth in China for project wins across several of its product lines. Qualitrol solutions for electric grid assets have embraced data centric solutions leveraging its broad portfolio of sensors. As the need for grid reliability evolves, Qualitrol's incorporating data analytics and smart sub-enterprise condition monitoring software to expand their value proposition to customers. Moving to product realization, the platform core revenues were up high single digits for the quarter led by low double-digit growth at Tektronix. We are encouraged by Tektronix's continued performance in high growth market. Tektronix has driven strong performance in the high growth markets for the application of FBS growth tools, same as utilized transformative marketing processes to identify micro segment to present strong share gain opportunities focusing on these targeted areas, the team has used the FBS growth tool set, to develop personnel base campaign expect successfully generate lead and improve win rates. Tektronix saw its third consecutive quarter of double digit growth in its Keathly's product line. Keathly's growth has been driven primarily by 3D sensing and consumer electronics, where product is integrated into the production line to test LED, laser diode and flat panel display. This is another example of how our businesses provide a central technology to accelerate customer innovation and bring next generation products to market. On the new products front Tektronix introduced the industry's first 32 gigabit per second protocol where bit error rate test and analysis system. The new BSX series bird scope delivers unique visibility into the underlying root cause of physical layer issues by capturing the exact location and timing of bit errors. The primary applications of the BSX series target the fast growing datacenter market. Our sensing technology's platform saw mid single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. The team continued to execute on the NAVSEA [ph] project and recently secured the second order associated with this important project for the U.S. Navy. Anderson, Gems and Setra all benefited from General improvements in their key verticals including food and beverage, HVFD [ph] and industrial. Moving to our industrial technology segment, revenue grew 5.4% core revenue growth was 5.1% for the quarter with acquisitions contributing an additional 110 basis points of growth offset by unfavorable currency of 80 basis points. Both reported and core operating profit margin increased 180 basis points from Q1 2016 driven by Gilbarco Veeder-Root volume more than 250 basis points of margin expansion of Kollmorgen and improved productivity across the platforms. Our transportation technology's platform posted mid-single-digit growth in the quarter with Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivering high single-digit core revenue growth. The performance at Gilbarco Veeder-Root reflected our double-digit growth in Western Europe and our expectations for low double-digit growth in North America. The outperformance in Western Europe was due to large orders in the U.K. and Germany. The strong growth in North America was driven by an increase in outdoor EMV related demand for both dispenser and payment kits. Global dispenser sales were up double-digits reflecting the strength of our product offering around the world. Further demonstrating our market leading technologies stores partner exclusively with Gilbarco Veeder-Root for both point of sale or indoor and dispensers outdoor to deliver EMV capability to their 400 sites. Telematics realized core growth of low single-digits in the quarter with mid-single-digit growth outside the US. As part of our restructuring actions taken last quarter, telematics realigned the US sales and marketing teams in order to better position the company for long term success. As a result we expect to see improved growth in the second half of the year in the US. Automation and specialty posted low single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Automation growth of mid-single digits was offset by a core revenue decline in Jacobs Vehicle Systems which is still challenged by the North American heavy truck market. Within automation Kollmorgen and Thompson both grew core revenue mid-single-digit reflecting increased demand and generally stable end markets. Thompson's growth was broad-based across its key verticals with most of the growth driven by medical equipment in all highway vehicles. Kollmorgen's continued growth reflects increased demand in high growth market and success globally in the robotic medical equipment and semiconductor verticals. Moving to franchise distribution, the platform posted mid-single digit growth for the quarter with Matco posting core revenue growth of mid-single-digits aided by the Matco Expo which saw a record attendance. The expo provides Matco franchisees with an opportunity to see the latest innovation attend training sessions and place orders to further grow their businesses. This year the team introduced its new line of tool storage equipment, revel which is another key innovation milestone achieved by the Matco team. In addition to strong core revenue growth in tool storage this quarter, Matco also delivered strong double digit growth in diagnostic. To wrap up we had a strong start to the year as we continued our momentum from the second half of 2016. We are well positioned for acquisitions and growth investments due to our current business strength and market leading positions. The Fortive business system is the driving force behind our success today and tomorrow. We are confident in our organic and inorganic opportunities and expect continued outperform as we are advantaged by multiple secular growth drivers. We look forward to explain our growth playbook and outlook in more detail at our first Investor Day on May 18 in New York. We are raising our full year 2017 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $2.68 to $2.78 which includes assumptions for low to mid single-digit core revenue growth. We continue to anticipate core margin expansion in excess of fifty basis points and are alluring our expected effective tax rate of 28% to a rate of 27% for the year. We are also initiating our second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.65 to $0.69 which includes assumptions of mid-single-digit core revenue growth and an effective tax rate of 27%. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Lisa. Lisa Curran : That concludes our formal comments. Camille, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis : Hi, good evening guys. Jim Lico : Hi, Scott. Scott Davis : Good afternoon I guess it is for you. It's going to be late evening for us I think. But you know professional instrumentation, everything sounded so good I have to ask a question what wasn't good? What was slow or what kind of fell below your expectations if I may ask it from that angle? Jim Lico : Yes, I think you're right we were really pleased with what we saw around the hornet [ph], Scott. I think probably, if we were to say one place, probably North America as a region would have been maybe not as strong as some of the other parts of the world we mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the strength of Western Europe. That was certainly true with Fluke and Attack, our two largest businesses within the segment. So on balance I would saw North America, we like to see a little bit more of improvement in North America as we see the rest of the year play out. Scott Davis : Now for your products to sell through distribution, I assume that -- I don't - I can't remember what percentage that Fluke sells through distribution. But was any part of this snap back, do you see anything related to some increased comments out there and some inventory-restock, some of the distribution level on get a sense if the sell-through is equivalent? Jim Lico : Yes. So we see about, I think Fluke's business and channels in the 75% or more range. So they may have pretty good visibility in terms of inventory positions as well number of our other businesses, specifically around Fluke where we get the best clarity data. We do not and really in professional instrumentation, we really did not see inventory build within the channel. So saw through the quarter point of sale, got a little bit better but we didn't see any subsequent addition of the word beyond that, that would have said our inventory positions or anything more but relatively quiet through the quarter. Scott Davis : Okay. That's all I needed guys. Thanks guys and good luck. Jim Lico : Alright, thanks Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Steve Tusa : Hi guys, good afternoon. Jim Lico : Good evening Steve. Steve Tusa : So just on the kind of organic trajectory, over the course of the rest of year, obviously good start at around 5% this quarter. You were saying in the second half it's going to kind of go to low single-digit. Can you maybe talk about obviously you have the EMV thing out there that everybody is aware of but what about the other businesses. Is there anything in there that is going to swing around from the current rate of growth to either better or worse from first half to second half year-over-year? Chuck McLaughlin : Hi Steve, this is Chuck. The main thing you're seeing in our guide is that the second half of last year was really strong for us at 3% in the second half. So when you're looking at moderating what is off to a really good start in the first half, that's the main thing that's happening. Jim Lico : And just as we you know as we sat out I think it's really true from several months ago is that the barcode what the -- in the second half, we still think will get better because we're going to that summertime, and that -- that's some potential upside probably to where we're at right now. Steve Tusa : So it is a potential upside to where you are. Jim Lico : Yes, we would think that more upside than down side at this point, obviously it is still early in the year, there's probably some -- we're probably hedging a little bit on what's going on in places like higher growth markets where we've been really strong and that even if that tempered a little bit, we will be in a very good shape in high growth markets in the second half. Steve Tusa : And what was G&A up in the quarter or down. Jim Lico : I think it is down sequentially and there's a little bit of timing there but we're -- just if you're talking about the corporate overhead or the G&A. Steve Tusa : Yes, the G&A portion of SG&A. Jim Lico : It's flat from last year. Steve Tusa : Okay, percentage of sales or absolute. Jim Lico : At both I think. Well, so it's down a little bit and as a percentage of sales and I think we're flattish from last year. Steve Tusa : Okay, that makes sense. One last one, the acquisition pipeline, I know it's kind of a generic and you can probably interpret -- probably entered a very generic way what is -- what the pipeline looking like and is there anything that kind of percolating here. Jim Lico : And I think -- I think the tone I had in the first quarter was similar to how I view right now I feel very confident we will get some deal done in the year, we certainly been busy in the half year and all those good words around that. We've seen from things transacted at the areas, but I think if we look at the funnel we really believe strongly that the funnel contains a lot of opportunity that would get us that returns we suggest within the realm of how we think about the deal. So we feel publish on the year, and we should have done this for a long time, you never know -- you always work on timing, but I feel strongly we're going -- we will get a few things done for sure. Steve Tusa : Okay, great, thanks a lot guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Hi, good afternoon guys. Obviously a nice quarter from Electronics. I think that we haven't seen so many quarters of high growth. So I'm just wondering we've seen so many in companies, I'm wondering if it's a function of [indiscernible]. Jim Lico : I would definitely think that some of what we're seeing is a better market, I wouldn't any way shape or form suggest that's not it, I do think we've done some nice things around making our own luck, we talked a little bit in our prepared remarks of the good FBS the team is doing -- and you really see that in China, our work we're clearly out growing the market in china, we are doing a really good job, and their high growth market sales were very good, and the has a lot to do with the business, which is semiconductor related but it's also sharing related within conductor. So these are few places I highlight that are a little bit better above market opportunity and we still think that the opportunity for North America much of that reside in the new platforms, as we launched the new platform we think that that will give us some opportunity second half in North America, we do -- we are on track with that launch. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about some other innovations but we're on track for new scope launch. We think we are in a good place, and that will have some impact that will happen that will put us in a good position for 2018. Nigel Coe : Great. Then secondly maybe for Chuck, the free cash we saw a significant build in working capital. I'm assuming obviously the stronger sale that's natural, but is that because we saw more demand sort of back in the quarter. Chuck McLaughlin : No, I think actually what you should expect for us going forward this right in the zone to get us to the 105% conversion ratio we've been talking about. I would look at the trailing 12 and took out the tailwinds for amortizations, we're right on 105% there, so I think we pay out our ICP in Q1 and there's other timing payments, and I think that that's really what you should expect to see going forward. Nigel Coe : Okay, and then you mentioned Chuck, the intangible -- you saw big drop off in PI. What was that driven by. Chuck McLaughlin : 10 years ago we bought Tektronix. Nigel Coe : Of course you did, thanks. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks Nigel. Operator : Next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon, this is actually [indiscernible] for Julian Mitchell. It looks like we're already seeing some savings from the Q4 restructuring actions. Is this program ahead of plan and what's your expectation regarding the cadence of savings over the next three quarters. Chuck McLaughlin : I don't know whether it would be a head of plan but it can -- we do restructuring we expect returns within the year, and I think that that's what you're seeing, and in part, but we also have -- we have a good margin fall through and that's not all from restructuring, but I'd say we're right on track where we expected to be. Jim Lico : The nice thing about growth market, is we really saw really strong FBS work been done in places like our business in Gilbarco, they've been really working hard to be able to deliver more revenue without a lot more investment, I think it's just -- you see these really strong benefits of what we can do with when we -- when we have more volume we don't add capital, we are doing much more productively and so you see a little bit of revenue go a lot -- goes a long way and really those businesses in particular done a really nice job. Unidentified Analyst : Understood, and pricing and IT was flat this quarter after being in pressure in Q4 some peers have discussed price increases in the retail fueling market recently, so can you just talk about your pricing dynamics -- the pricing dynamics in the retail fueling market and how those might have changed in the last couple of months. Chuck McLaughlin : I think that in Gilbarco we saw some of our bigger deals, as we bundled that it broke down the average price, I think this as we look forward that's moderated somewhat as we forward we expect to return to our seeing our normal pricing as we go forward in the year. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Hello, a couple of quick ones for me. Jim, I was wondering if you were willing to kind of look -- a little bit on Fluke connect what we might be hearing in the next month or so in terms of size of Fluke count you might be launching or the breadth of the rollout, and we expect it to have a measurable impact on your organic revenues this year. Jim Lico : I think that what we are doing in May is we're really doing a multiple city tour with what the eMaint and Fluke select solutions, will be unveiling new brand, we got some branding that we're doing there, we got some branding that are going to market and some integration we are doing with those business to make customers solutions look better. So I think that what you will see sort of continued evolution of innovation it's just kind of continuing at the same pace, more connected devices continuing to come out to just make sure that the upgrade cycle within the portfolio continues. I think what you'll see in conferences is really that sort of whole cost strategy playing out in a way that really makes sense. We are really pleased with the eMaint work and the team there and everything going on, still small business but accelerating well. Looking at it it's really a 2018 story with the current revenue model the way it is, it really it takes a little while to ramp up. And again as I mentioned I would say we're continuing to see those things happen a little slower than what we -- what we anticipated and I mentioned that the first -- in the January call and that that's really -- that's really continued. So from a building while but that is going to take us a little while to ramp that up to a way to really impact the organic growth. Jeffrey Sprague : Right, and then just on west Europe you called that out actually on couple businesses. You think that was doing in the market or is that kind of a genuine pickup going on there. Jim Lico : Well, I haven't watched other sort of talk about Western Europe too, I've found that the market there is a little bit better, the breath of strength that we're having would probably indicate that as well, but work -- we're doing a lot of good things making our own luck, I'd certainly like to work as an example we mentioned the tender wins to Gilbarco, their story is really robotic story, the work that they've been doing with several of the large European robotic OEMs has been really fantastic and they're doing a great job there, so these are just a few examples, we call those guys out in the prepared remarks. Fluke had tactic good quarters too, I think some of that is market but also some of that in the work they are doing, particularly the channel partners to really engage with their marketing efforts to build their portfolio if you will, and I think in balance we're in a good place. And that is why I said I think by and large -- I am saying maybe it is low single digits in Western Europe, I really think for 2017 we are probably more mid-single digits for Western Europe for the year. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question coming from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi everybody, Jim, you said in response to the M&A question, you said you have to get a few things done something to read into that, like more smaller versus one bigger. Jim Lico : Well, I think getting my words right, you dig them right, I am just saying. I think that is a funnel comment John, I think we definitely see the breadth of the funnel pretty good. And I do think that as we laid out those small, medium and large, how we think about it was large over $500 million in cash capital deployed, medium being under $500 to kind of $100, and then I think under $100 being small. We see a number of things within all those categories. So we feel good that we'll get something done and hopefully we'll be able to talk about more and proper names rather than things, and I think as we get later in the year that will certainly be true. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for that, can we talk about Tektronix for a second. So I think you said high single digit growth, which is obviously much better right. The question I'm wondering I'm assuming that China was much more rapidly growing than that, as you're rolling out this sort of software back down -- Bone for U.S customers kind of holding back such that when these new product launches are pending, because obviously customers must know their stuff is coming, they're going to actually see Tektronix kind of on the collectivism in China holds pick up its growth pace meaningfully in the second half or in the coming quarters. Is that possible? Jim Lico : Yes, a couple of things, one we actually had a second double digit for the -- for the quarter and they were strong and they were -- they were good in the developed market as well as hyper market, it was just that Europe was much better. I think what will see through the year, is the new platforms just happen to be less a software platform than really a hardware platform, it is really oriented toward customers from or where we tend to have a little bit, we have more customers in North America than we do elsewhere in the world. So it just tends to be more oriented that way. I really don't think it will hold back situation as much that's just an orientation of solutions, and then I think on the high growth market success, it does happen do a little bit with the mix of semiconductor customers to some extent being in those parts of the world, I mentioned that in a previous question and so our success and [indiscernible] portfolio really suggests that we are seeing good strength with several vertical, but that being one of them and it tends to be mores Asia based. So I wouldn't read too much into that mix, but I do think that just to come back to original question, I don't think we're seeing much hold back, I just think things have been a little bit slower to come back to U.S with the kind of customers we have in the U.S. Unidentified Analyst : I just want to press you on that little bit, I guess I'm not completely clear, you telegraphed pretty widely these new product launches and so forth, why would customers be buying now -- why don't they just wait for new products coming in the U.S in a few months I guess that's my point. You suggesting that's not happening, I'm just curious as to why. Jim Lico : Yes, I think we have a broad portfolio, I think the one we have been clear with is not where the platform necessarily is within the various price points and segments, so we don't get to the but embargo date here a little bit, and so from a customer perspective they just know something new from Tektronix; they don't necessarily know where and so if people have a need right now that they tend to buy a need rather than buy ahead of thing or -- so I think I think -- that's why I don't think we're necessarily seeing much whole back at this point. Unidentified Analyst : And then just based overall on company trends and the growth rates you saw I guess in China and US. You expect things and realize what you guide is but all our sequel is there are any sort of reason that things may I don't know, not play on kind of but a continuing improvement type of trajectory? That makes any sense? Jim Lico : No\u2026 Unidentified Analyst : Order book or anything like that? Jim Lico : I think things so far have held in so I think from that standpoint every -- kind of think about real time but more than anything I think it's as if we look at three quarters in a row of kind of growth rates in and around the same number; we kind of have a guide out there that thinks at least second quarter will be at mid-single digit and that's better. I think the fodder on the second half is really the bark of actuation as we had indicated and also just -- there is an unknown; if we just -it is early in the year. I think we've been trained early and as we said in the first quarter, it's always sort of let but the back kind of give us a better sense of where reality will be. A year ago we were -- we weren't sure; the second half ended up being better than we thought. So I think that's just what we're thinking. I think if I were to just maybe just go back to what I said before our high growth markets have been really strong and I guess maybe more cape that might be a little bit more negative would be that things slow down a little bit more there. That would still be performance for us but it would be a little bit little bit less than where we're at right now. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Okay, thanks very much. Appreciate it. Jim Lico : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Dean Dray with RBC. Dean Dray : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Jim, I was hoping you could comment on the initiative to place more of your instruments and inline testing. You called out key fully but I know there's other applications of fluke and how big are the initiative -- More manufacturing automation? Jim Lico : I would call it more - you're not going to like that. Hopefully we're not get this, we're losing feedback here. Dean Dray : Sounds like same this end. Jim Lico : It does. Okay, so we're just getting the feedback. So I'm just going to talk. Dean Dray : It sounds fine. Jim Lico : Okay. We really don't have a big initiative. I mean like that is indicated, deeply send a little bit more production cap a little bit more. But I'm down -- we don't have a major initiative event like that and so they've got innovation work we've done it resulting in the results for the for the quarter and quite frankly for the year. Dean Dray : You are just not focusing on because we're hearing and seeing more manufacturers put online testing. Is it because your instruments are you their board bench top or handheld? Jim Lico : Well I think certainly we tended to attack to the example we've tended to stay away from large scale manufacturing cap applications so that that's something we just intentionally done over the -- at Chuck mentioned the ten years we known Tech 9. If fluke we have moved toward from inline sensors and put connect is really an example of that where we have found I pick sensors that allow for the solution so in that case we actually do have in life sensing where we think it makes sense relative to the workflow that exists with Fluke So beyond that it's really a company-by-company situation but our mission in Fluke is not really be a broad base necessarily center player as much of this is a really technician in the making is perfect and more cool armed them with their ability to troubleshoot and diagnose problems. Dean Dray : Great. That's helpful. And for Chuck, you just remind us that total balance sheet capacity for M&A at this time? Chuck McLaughlin : Well we've been talking about deploying over three billion in the next two and a half years and I think that's still good number. Dean Dray : Did I notice that your euro denominated TP right now is at a negative interest rate? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes, you did. Dean Dray : How much more of that you want to do? Chuck McLaughlin : We're very happy with that program and could extend we expand it and those rates stay there will were intended to do so. Dean Dray : Good to hear. Thank you. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Dean Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, guys. Just want to follow up on Kollmorgen for a second I think last quarter you had high synergy growth in that business year-over-year and I think that's clear last you mid-single digit but you did talk about the penetration in the robotics. I mean we know it's a very strong growth market right now significantly so maybe if there were more color on Kollmorgen sort of what do you think for the year and is there any other part of that business that's a little slower because I would think that business could accelerate versus decelerate. Jim Lico : Well, I think you're exactly right. We've had several good strong quarter at Kollmorgen over the last several quarters. I would think about it this way; we've got a nice job -- of robotic in a number of customers that I mentioned on previous question. We've continued to move our around some opportunities what we call mobile robotics, that's really been warehousing and really if as what we used to call our AGV which is really mobile robotic business as robots become more pervasive in warehouses and things like that. Those are clearly opportunities and we think it will it gives us the continued ability to grow the business. We're going up a little bit easier path in the first quarter so we're a little higher this quarter but we think certainly growth there. Of course that's a business that tends to you win it, you have a design win and then it plays out overtime. So I think it's a little bit longer cycle business. So we think we're in a good position here for the next several quarters and we'll see how we continued design win come and also our customers volume goes; because obviously we also need our customers to be using some of those products more often in order for the business to grow. So we're very comfortable with the growth rate right now. As I said, first quarter is a little bit higher than normal but we think we'll see good growth this year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. And then I want to ask you that GBS, you mentioned still modestly declining. I would imagine you do you have easier comparisons and mapping and since the year goes on and I think the heavy truck market has shown signs of improvement. So can that business turn here as we go throughout the year as you go throughout the year what's your expectations for GBS. Jim Lico : What we -- what we certainly in the first quarter have worked it up pretty tough comp. We've got grape business in China there that's continue to perform but we still see, as far as we can see right now we were hearing and listening to what market players are suggesting and things might get better every year. I can I think that probably the hate that's going to occur given that the fairly that he order book so we're still keep some challenges here over the next week or. I Phone five. Andrew Kaplowitz : Alright guys, appreciate it. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Patrick Newton : Yes, good afternoon Jim and Chuck. First question is just on electronic - new platform at least for the second half. Could you tease us with any performance matrix or features that could make the platform disruptive in the market and are we right to think that this is also a market expansion where you'll have an opportunity to target more automotive and embedded opportunities? Jim Lico : Well Pat Byrne, President of Technology will kill me if I gave too much more away I'm going to platform until we launched it. So I'll let Pat do that once the embargo occurs. But I do think it is an opportunity for us to solidify current market positions and also add some applications that we've not historically done as well in and I think that that's what we're excited about. Patrick Newton : Oh it's worth a try. And I guess Chuck, one for you is obviously a tax plan discussed by the White House earlier this week. I'm curious that if this tax in its current form or something similar to it that the change the way that Fortive looks at M&A opportunities on a global basis or how you think about signing the bills. Chuck McLaughlin : I don't think it changes anything about where we would look, what we think they were cost or we the value we see to it that it might change that equation but probably change it for everybody. We'll wait and see if anything comes to the one page that came out yesterday. One way to go - but every scenario I see is creative to us and so I hope they do get something done. Patrick Newton : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Good luck. Jim Lico : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Drab from William Blair. Brian Drab : Hi. I just have one question to left in my list at the moment. Heading into the separation Oh it's down to her if she said that you thought that that you have the EMV opportunity could add about a hundred basis points to grow from a consolidated basis but here just wondering if you look at what. What that's contributing is that more than one hundred in the quarter and what do you expect through this year on a full year basis Jim Lico : I think yeah I think when we suggested that it was certainly with the idea that the dead line would be in twenty seventeen. So from that standpoint that would have push out we'll probably fill 100 basis point but in anyone quarter it's hard to nail down exactly what the number was. I would suggest that probably in this quarter we're probably pretty close to that, maybe a little bit better than that but probably in around 100 basis points I think. Chuck McLaughlin : I've looked at it and if we go back to maybe where before the ramp started, it's been three years and we're up about 300 basis points over that three year timeframe. As Jim said there is just some absent close in that but we think we're right on-track with that. Second half maybe puts a little pause in that and the longer timeframe -- I think -- we think it's a net positive that maybe flattens off the peak there but we think the sizing of it as we originally envisioned it well maybe a little longer timeframe is still pretty accurate. Brian Drab : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe [ph] with Cowen & Company. Unidentified Analyst : I'm the guy for the full year, so it seems like most of the incremental bump here is in the second half where you're expecting a bit of a deceleration on the organic options, so what specifically kind of was incremental I guess on the cost side that's driving that? Jim Lico : Well, thanks for your question. First of all, I think that the -- it's pretty evenly split, not balanced in the second half of the year on the take up since we did beat me in Q1. It's evenly split between the tax rate coming down to 27% and also then seeing some strengthening and raising our outlooks slightly over the whole year but it's pretty balanced by quarter and I'd say it's really $0.04 for the year, $0.01 a quarter for volume and $0.01 for tax. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, fair enough. I guess I'll shift a little bit auto; I know you guys place in a very specific way with macro and stuff but I know that's an area that people are a bit more concerned about generally speaking. What are you seeing? What are your customer saying there? Are they a little bit more nervous about production rates or anything more recently than they were maybe three/six months ago? Jim Lico : Yes, so I think the way we think about the auto industry is mostly get Matco -- when we just think about peer vehicle, really -- obviously, Matco plays into the maintenance and dealerships and maintenance shop and really they don't really care if it's a new car or an old car, it's really about size of the fleet. So to some extent if people are holding out of their cards longer, it actually helps Matco. So I think we don't get a lot of visibility just to the new car production level, that's a $17 million U.S. car number, a $16 million number; we're sort of out of the realm of that, it doesn't really -- it really doesn't affect us that much Joe. So I think we really think about the total vehicle population and the complexity of those vehicles and the changes in those vehicles and as long as there is more complex vehicles that are harder to repair, I think those are good trends for Matco. Unidentified Analyst : I totally appreciate that. I mean, I know that they don't really care specifically about it but just wondering if maybe you have been hearing if these guys were just kind of shop talk around where things might be going but if you're not\u2026 Jim Lico : I wish we had a real world like that but we really don't. Unidentified Analyst : Fair enough, thanks a lot guys. Operator : That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to our speakers for closing remarks. Lisa Curran : Thank you, Camille. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you in May at our first Investor Day.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our performance as we mark Fortive's first anniversary. One year ago, we launched Fortive with a greater strategic focus. Key to that was accelerating growth investments to strengthen our market leading positions and capital deployment for acquisitions. The Fortive Business System was highlighted as the cornerstone of our competitive advantage. FBS is our playbook for accelerated innovation and a superior customer satisfaction to drive improved core sales growth, operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow. We have consistently made meaningful progress towards all of our strategic and operational goals since the separation.  I'm happy to announce that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Industrial Scientific Corporation, a leading provider of portable gas detection instrumentation and a safety-as-a-service pioneer in an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $600 million. The addition of Industrial Scientific accelerates our digital strategy and creates a stronger platform for connected solutions for critical applications in maintenance and safety. The business is a natural extension of our current field solutions portfolio and have highly complementary customer base.  Consistent with both Fluke and Qualitrol growth strategies, Industrial Scientific generates recurring revenue from a subscription-based model, which combines hardware, monitoring software and consumables into a safety-as-a-service offering. We are assuming a second half close without a meaningful impact to 2017 results, but we do anticipate 2018 earnings accretion. Now I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Our adjusted net earnings of $249.9 million were up 13% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.71 with an effective tax rate of 26.3% for the quarter. Sales grew 4.7% to $1.6 billion, a core revenue increase of 5.4%. 5 out of 6 strategic platforms grew core sales mid-single digits or better, reflecting strong volume, market share gains and continued performance in high-growth markets. The favorable impact from acquisitions accelerated to 40 basis points of growth during the second quarter, partially offset by 110 basis points of unfavorable currency translation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Geographically, high-growth markets core revenue grew double digits with continued strength across Asia. High-teens growth in China was driven by increased demand for Tektronix, Qualitrol, Thomson and Kollmorgen. Excluding China, high-growth markets core revenue grew low double digits.  Developed markets core revenue grew low single digits, reflecting continued strength in Western Europe and incrementally better industrial markets in North America. North American growth of low single digits reflected strong performance at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Fluke and Kollmorgen, which were somewhat offset by Jacobs Vehicle Systems. We continue to outperform in Western Europe posting high single-digit growth as continued market share gains in key project wins were realized in Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Qualitrol and Kollmorgen.  Gross margin was 49.4% as approximately 60 basis points of expansion and Professional Instrumentation was offset by nearly 45 basis points of contraction in Industrial Technologies. Notably, field solutions expanded gross margins 125 basis points in the quarter through the use of FBS lean tools driving supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies. We are pleased that, for the first half, we delivered strong gross margin expansion of 70 basis points.  Operating profit margin was 21.4% with core operating margin expansion of 90 basis points in the quarter and 125 basis points year-to-date. Both periods benefited 65 basis points from lower amortization.  During the second quarter, we generated $217 million of free cash flow and delivered a conversion ratio of 90%, which keeps us on track for greater than 100% for the full year. Using FBS tools across our operating companies, we were able to improve working capital turns by 0.5 turn led by strong improvements at Fluke, Tektronix and Gilbarco Veeder-Root.  Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 4.8% with core revenue growth of 6.6% and operating margin of 24.4% with 240 basis points core expansion, which includes 140 basis points benefit from lower amortization. Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue increased high single digits during the quarter, driven by strong growth in product realization and field solutions.  Field solutions core revenue was up mid-single digits in the quarter with both Fluke and Qualitrol posting strong core revenue growth. Fluke's mid-single-digit core growth was led by Fluke Industrial and Fluke Networks, which delivered mid-single-digit and high single-digit growth, respectively. As we highlighted last quarter, Fluke Networks' performance reflects the continued impact of the FBS growth room with sales conversions up 30% sequentially. Industrial growth was led in North America, where sales were up mid-single digits, with point-of-sale data trending better across all product categories. eMaint continues to grow sales double digits, leveraging the strength of Fluke's large installed base.  In May, we launched Fluke Accelix, which is the platform brand for our digital and condition-based monitoring offerings. Additionally in late June, we acquired SCHAD, a small technology company based in Germany. The SCHAD technology adds a suite of software products that simplify data integration and mobile work management for our customers. We have also reached an important early phase milestone for Fluke Accelix by starting key pilots with several large customers. Qualitrol delivered high single-digit growth led by further penetration of conditions-based monitoring solutions for European and Chinese OEMs as well as utilities in the Middle East. Good growth in North American retrofits was driven by FBS as we focused on improving funnel visibility and identifying adjacent market opportunities. In China, we gained share with transformer OEMs via new product penetration and ultra-high voltage transmission. In June, the Qualitrol team closed the key order for comprehensive monitoring system for a Middle Eastern national electrical utility. We are pleased with our high-growth market expansion strategy as our go-to-market investments in targeted geographies continue to pay off. Moving to product realization. The platform core revenues were up low double digits for the quarter led by growth in Tektronix. Tektronix low double-digit core revenue growth continues to be driven by high-growth markets where sales grew strong double digits this quarter. This performance reflected in part Keithley 3D sensing sales in Korea and China. China continued to deliver low double-digit growth, driven by increased demand for our leading technology targeting the optical and semiconductor end markets. We see encouraging signs entering the second half of this year as the China semiconductor market build-out is only in the middle of what we estimate to be a 5-year opportunity.  We launched the Tektronix 5 Series mixed-signal oscilloscope in June, which is the first in a series of hardware and software launches. We are pleased with the performance to date and the strong positive reaction and technology reviews received from the market. This groundbreaking technology favorably positions us in our targeted automotive and power segments, which is consistent with the strategy we discussed at Investor Day. As we previously noted, this new platform will have a more meaningful impact starting in 2018. Our sensing technologies platform delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter led by double-digit growth in high-growth markets and improved stabilization in the U.S. Growth was primarily driven by China and general industrial end market improvement in the U.S. Our sensing technology teams continue to see accelerating progress on our strategy of broadening our system development capability. As an example of this, we saw greater than 30% sequential improvement in our target vertical funnels at Gems.  Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenue grew 4.7% with core revenue growth of 4.5% and delivered operating margin of 20.9%. The favorable impact to operating margins from increased demand for our products overall was offset by greater R&D investments and a decline in franchise distribution core revenue. Year-to-date, strong volume and improved productivity drove 90 basis points of core operating margin expansion.  Our Transportation Technologies platform posted mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter led by mid-single-digit growth in Gilbarco Veeder-Root. The performance at Gilbarco Veeder-Root came in better than expected on share gains in Europe and Brazil and with several large North American retailers who continue to upgrade to EMV-capable dispensers. Global dispenser sales were up high single digits, reflecting the preference of our products around the world.  We were excited to announce last month that Gilbarco Veeder-Root successfully processed the industry's first U.S. EMV chip transaction at a fuel retail site using our passport point-of-sale solution in Encore fuel dispensers. We also launched [ Ligo ], our new fuel point-of-sale system from Orpak in high-growth markets. This technology is a key building block to future Insite360 services and to advancing our systems strategy in high-growth markets. We are on track to close on the previously announced acquisition of Orpak in the third quarter of 2017.  Telematics realized core revenue growth of low single digits in the quarter led by strong SaaS sales growth in Australia and New Zealand and increased installed base in Europe. These results were partially offset by a sales decline in North America despite improvements across key metrics in the U.S. Given this positive trend, we expect to return to growth next quarter in the U.S. with an acceleration to exit the year at mid- to high single-digit growth at telematics. Automation and specialty grew core sales mid-single digits driven by double-digit growth in high-growth markets and robotics, both of which are aligned with our high-growth market and IoT growth initiatives. Growth was partially offset by flattish sales at Jacobs Vehicle Systems.  Kollmorgen posted low double-digit core revenue growth, reflecting strong demand across our global industrial automation product line, which is driven by continued robotic strength in Europe, China and Japan. Comau, a leading European player in mobile robotics, recently launched its new mobile robotics solution, Agile1500, utilizing Kollmorgen's guidance control system. Thomson delivered low single-digit core revenue growth driven by double-digit growth in high-growth markets, reflecting key project wins for factory automation applications in Asia. Jacobs Vehicle Systems is continuing to see strong sales in China and an improvement in North America, reflecting an increase in heavy-duty truck orders.  Franchise distribution core sales declined low single digits, reflecting a low single-digit decline in core revenue at Matco. For the first half, hardline core revenue grow -- grew high single digits, and the Maximus family of diagnostic products grew core revenue double digits. Despite the strength in these product lines, we have seen a pause in demand for tool storage.  To wrap up, we took important steps towards accelerating growth with both organic and inorganic strategies. Progress towards our EMV, high-growth market, digital and portfolio enhancement growth initiatives, including $1 billion of announced acquisitions since the separation, positions us well going into the second half of 2017 and into 2018.  We are raising our full year 2017 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance range to $2.72 to $2.80, which includes our updated core revenue growth expectation of mid-single digits and an effective tax rate of 26.5%. We continue to anticipate core margin expansion in excess -- in and around 50 to 70 basis points for the year. We are also initiating our third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.69 to $0.73, which includes assumptions of mid-single-digit core revenue growth and an effective tax rate of 26.5%.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Lisa. Lisa Curran : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Hope, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : So the deal, $600 million I think. Can you just remind us, just break down the billing you spend and then on this specific deal, a little more color on sales margins to the extent you can give us? James Lico : Yes. So I'll start with the second one on the $600 million. We're really excited about ISC. It's a business that we've been known for a long time. We've been friends with the McElhattan family for a long time. It's been a long-term cultivation. They'll do probably in the range of $170 million to $180 million of revenue this year. This will fit our return profile of 10% in 3 years on the ROIC model. So we feel really good about the returns here and how we think the business will do. It's very consistent with our strategy that we've talked about relative to digital initiatives, the fact that these are connected instrumentations. They're deep into the customer workflow and in critical technology, which is essentially like our shared purpose essential technology. And the revenue -- it's a recurring revenue subscription-based model for a good portion of the revenue as well, so the financials and the strategic aspects of the business are really good. We -- this is in around -- for 2018, around 10 to 12x EBITDA so I think a great opportunity for us to create value over the long time at a price that, quite frankly, we can get to a return profile in the time frames that we've been disciplined about. C. Stephen Tusa : So like $0.10 of accretion next year-ish? Charles McLaughlin : Well, I think we'll wait till we get the deal inked and closed and then wait for the guidance next year. But we expect to be accretive next year for sure. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then the other deal, just remind us of what else makes up the $1 billion? Charles McLaughlin : So the first couple of hundred million, we acquired eMaint and GTT in Q4 of last year, and then earlier this year, there was Orpak for around a similar amount. And then we did a small technology deal called SCHAD. It's single digits acquisition, but we got some technology that'll help us with our connected solutions. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. So then one last question on the second half. You're growing mid-singles. It doesn't look like that much of a slowing relative to the first half, but EMV is obviously kind of staring us in the face. So what's getting better in the second half to offset the -- what is kind of an unexpected EMV slowdown to get to kind of back to the mid-singles? James Lico : Yes. So first, I think I would say that the third quarter for EMV looks pretty good. So we had a couple of orders that came in that'll keep us maybe a little bit better for the third. I would suggest that the other part is really the North American industrial market broadly, Steve. We've seen an uptick through the quarters here in places like Fluke. As we mentioned on the prepared remarks, our sensor businesses in automation all saw improvements in North America. So it's really the combination of a little bit better EMV than we originally thought and probably to some extent, the North American industrial market sort of solidifying a little bit as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Yes. Just to follow on, on ISC. Does this kind of [ sort of the ] kind of affected your product line for -- within the [ sig ] umbrella? Or do you intend to run this as a stand-alone business? And what kind of proportion of revenues would you describe as SaaS? James Lico : Well, first, we would run it -- we really see this as the third leg of the field solutions platform. So there's certainly some synergy with Fluke and the core customers with Fluke. The -- we see some real opportunities with -- if you think about in a variety of industrial environments where a maintenance worker is also using safety technologies. We've seen a real opportunity to link what we're doing with connected solutions both with Fluke and with ISC. But ISC will be a, we think, a stand-alone business that has a great growth profile in and of itself. I think the recurring revenues in the business today are around -- right around 40% or something like that, but there -- but it's the high-growth part of the business. So if you sort of compound that over time, it becomes a very good recurring revenue business over a longer period of time. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's great. And then just turning to industrial. You called out R&D as a headwind to margins this quarter. Obviously, margins were pretty flat year-over-year. Anything else in there? Is there any mix impacts, [ price roles ] to think about as well? And then you called out the franchise as a pause in the storage solutions. I think we saw some weakness from Stanley in auto, Snap-on, too. So I'm just wondering, any perspective you have on what's causing this pause? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. So on the margin compression and looking at Industrial Technologies, it has to do with Matco. That's slowing. It's one of our highest-margin businesses. That just gives a little bit of a mix. But we think that even with that, that slowing that we're seeing there, as we -- when we look year-to-date, we're seeing good margin expansion. We think by the end of the -- as we move forward into the second half, we're going to continue to see that. But at this point in time versus a tough compare, that's the main reason. James Lico : On the franchise distribution, we noted in the prepared remarks we see some product lines that are pretty good. We had a 10% increase in our expo participation from a year ago, so that metric was pretty good. A lot of the forward-looking metrics around health are good. And number of the product lines are very good, we've mentioned, in diagnostics and some of our hardline tools. It really is -- the slowness really is in tool storage. As you mentioned, I think a number the other folks in the market have also denoted the same thing. We get a lot of good data off the truck in terms of what we see from a sales out perspective, and we do see some slowing. So I don't necessarily think -- we've had 4 or 5 years of really strong mid- to high single-digit growth here, so I think this is more a pause than anything. Certainly, when we go back to other times when we saw a long-term slowing, we didn't -- we saw changes in some of those health metrics that we typically see. So we'll probably see a little bit, maybe another quarter or so as we work our way through some of this, but I think on balance, we feel the business is still good. And we think we can do some things that might make a little bit of our own luck here as we get later into the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just focusing again on the Industrial Tech segment, is there any impact you're seeing right now from input costs there? And I guess was the -- the assumption was that the gross margin decline was a blip simply from mix? Or should we see, for example, better pricing in the second half in IT that will help that gross margin rebound? James Lico : Yes. We feel that -- in terms of the margin profile, as we mentioned -- Chuck mentioned a minute ago, we had a couple of things on the mix away from Matco and into any other business within the segment is obviously a mix challenge. But we had a few onetime things that occurred. But as we look year-to-date, both gross margins and operating margins are good for the segment. So we really see this as more of a onetime thing. As we go into the second half, we're highly confident we can continue to get good margin improvement in Industrial Technologies. Relative to input costs, we really don't see -- this really is not driven by input costs. Our PPV numbers, our purchasing cut price reductions that we get are very good. It's something that Chuck and I look at every month. We look at our input costs pretty detailed as well, and we're in pretty good shape in that regard. Price has been good across the portfolio. I think 5 of our 6 platforms got at least 20 basis points of price or more, so -- and many in the 30 to 50 range. So we still think we can be in the 30 to 50 point range on price for the year. So I think, really, the gross -- some of the gross margin things that occurred we really think are more of a onetime nature, and we feel very good about what we're going to have going into the second half. Julian Mitchell : And then my second question would just still be within Industrial Tech but on the sort of turnaround effort within telematics. Just give us an update with that reorganization underway, how you're thinking about the progress there. And also, I guess, it sounds as if you are going to see an improvement in sales trends. How much is that sort of end market-driven versus your own reorganization? James Lico : Yes. I think -- well, I think the end market's been pretty good, and I don't think the end market is necessarily picking up. There's a little bit of help with ELD, but that's not a huge percentage of the market. So we really think that the improvement is what we've been doing. We're obviously very focused, as we talked on many calls, around the fact that we wanted to improve the business there. We started with the integrated platform. We've changed our go to market in some respects and changed some of our go-to-market investments to take advantage of that. We have the highest number of gross adds in North America than we've ever had, I think, in a quarter in the past quarters. So our churn numbers are looking good. Our gross add numbers are looking good. Our -- what we look at in terms of how we look at average prices is improving. So all of the long-term go-forward metrics that we look at are all very good for the quarter. But obviously, in a SaaS business, it takes a little while for all that to sort of churn through into a revenue projection. So we think by -- as we said in the prepared remarks, we think mid- to high single digit exiting the year, and there's no reason why we can't see that kind of growth into 2018. So we think we'd be at least at market at that point but still working really hard to do better than market as we push into the following years from there. Charles McLaughlin : Nigel, as you remember, what we're talking about here is mostly a North America challenge. Outside the U.S., we continue to do well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Just on the point-of-sale color, Jim, I know you pointed to industrial kind of being better in the back half, offsetting maybe EMV. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on the point-of-sale strength that you're seeing, how broad it is? It sounds like it's mostly centered in Fluke, but perhaps, it's broader than that. James Lico : Yes. We've talked the last 2 quarters that the U.S. was stable. We certainly would suggest now that it's starting to get a little bit better. As you know as well as anybody, we've got -- we get pretty good visibility at Fluke in terms of point of sale, and we really see all of that in the point-of-sale data. So the mid-single-digit kind of growth that we've seen in North America at Fluke, as an example, is really consistent with what we're seeing in point of sale. So we're not seeing any inventory build or anything like that. We also get pretty good point-of-sale information at places like Kollmorgen as well, so we've seen some similar trends there in Thompson. So we feel pretty good that the trend is -- right now is occurring. Jeffrey Sprague : I was also just wondering on the deal pipeline, the notion that this is someone you've known for a long time and cultivated. But maybe as part of Danaher, maybe that got pushed on the back burner and wasn't even a live prospect if they were even prepared to sell. Just kind of comment on that. I mean, is there stuff that -- where the trail maybe got cold, where you're kind of warming it back up? And does that in any way influence your pipeline here as you look into '18? James Lico : I think what has influenced the pipeline, I talked a little bit about this over the last 12 months. A little bit of what has influenced the pipeline more broadly is the fact that it's a more focused industrial company with a strategy similar to like ISC around connected devices, taking advantage of digitization and kind of the mobile workforce. You start to see more of the kinds of strategies that we're thinking about and certainly, in ISC's case, very consistent with how they were thinking about where the world's going. So there are those situations, for sure, in the funnel where we could definitely point to businesses that had been more interested in talking with us. I think, in this case, maybe a little bit less true this had -- this also had to do with the family's timing and how they wanted to think about things. So I wouldn't necessarily jump to the conclusion that this wouldn't have happened in a prior life. But we're really excited to have them as part of the team. We see the world very similarly. And I would also say that, really, when you think about field solutions and what the Wes and the team have done, they've really gotten ISC done, as we've articulated, the consistency with the strategy, the small deal that we did with SCHAD, which gives us some great technology around -- it would really integrate and facilitate industrial sites with data facilitation amongst multiple kinds of applications. And just large and small, I really think that articulates the breadth of the funnel. We've been talking for a while that the breadth of the funnel's pretty good, and I think this quarter is a great example, accelerating strategy in field solutions with the -- both a large deal and a very tiny technology deal that accelerates strategy as well as finalizing Orpak. So I think this is a -- I think why we're excited about this quarter in many respects is that all of these things that we've been talking about as we celebrate our 1-year anniversary come together in a very similar way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch : So Jim, just to put a finer point around your commentary on Industrial Technologies profitability, I mean, do you expect, as part of your third quarter guide, year-over-year op margins to be up? Or do you -- I'm just trying to understand. Are you expecting kind of the trajectory of margins to get back to up by the year-end? Or what would you say to that? James Lico : We would expect that both segments will have good operating margin expansion in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. John Inch : All right. All right. So that clears that up. Can I ask you about the ISC for a sec? So what kind of growth do you expect out of this business as you apply your tools to it? What sort of a growth rate on the top line would you expect? And I don't know if you said there were revenue synergies. But if there are, could you maybe talk a little bit to what those might be and how significant that could be? James Lico : Yes. So when we think about the value creation, clearly, we're buying a great business with a great team. And as a stand-alone business, this business will do well. It's been a mid-single-digit grower through the cycle for a number of years. And the iNet platform, which is really that safety-as-a-service platform, has been growing even better than that. So as that becomes more of the part of the business, the growth trajectory of the business should improve to high single digits over -- in the not-too-distant future. So that kind of gives you the growth profile of the business. We see for -- from a synergy perspective, one, obviously, we can help them with global reach. Fluke in our field solutions platform is our most global platform with -- both Fluke and Qualitrol have tremendous growth in and around the world. We'll certainly help them invest in more technology. They'll help us with some things. We can help them. Certainly, M&A is going to be an aspect of this. We'll be able to bring capital to them with many of the ideas they have. So that's really -- those 3 things are really focused on growing the ISC business and accelerating with the team that's there. I think, certainly, FBS is a wonderful opportunity as we met with Justin McElhattan, who's the CEO of the business and will stay with us. Justin was most excited. They made some good progress on FBS on the lean side, and I'm really excited about some of the growth and leadership tools that come -- that we can bear to the business. So those are all good synergies. Specifically though around where there's an opportunity, we've coined this term [ safetenance ], which is the combination of safety and maintenance. And what that really is, is when maintenance professionals go into environments wherein many of them regulated, where they need gas detection equipment, that they're using Fluke tools. And so this combination of being able to work within the maintenance workflow like we do with eMaint, being able to apply Fluke connected tools along with their tools and bring that about is also a growth opportunity. So it's not the biggest driver of the model, but we certainly think that's a good growth opportunity for the platform over time. John Inch : [ Safetenance ], huh, I like that. James Lico : I haven't trademarked it, so hopefully, the team has. John Inch : And in that [ safetenance ], I think you're -- the conference call operator was Hope. Now you got hope, so you're on track here. Maybe one more for me. You raised prices by what appear to be a pretty significant amount in the PI business. Is that -- what was that? Was that Tektronix new product? Or how did you accomplish that? And can it be sustained? James Lico : Well, I think, yes, I think it can be sustained. I think We've had good price over our -- we're working off even good price comps quite frankly. I think, if I recall, last year, the second quarter was a really a good price comp for us last year, tough comp if you will. So I think we can maintain it. It speaks to the -- we talk a lot about the strength of our market positions. And part of that is the differentiated technology that we have. And part of that is the brand and the strength of the market -- the relationship we have with customers that ultimately gives us some pricing power. We don't -- certainly don't use that to an advantage, but we certainly see creating more value allows for us to take more price. On the new products, we won't see price because that -- we take that out of our price calculation. So on the new products, you might see better gross margin, but we don't creep that in our price calculation. So... John Inch : Yes. I think it said it was like up 0.3 for the first half but up 0.6 for the second quarter, which that's a pretty big difference. So what -- are you -- you're suggesting that -- I'm assuming that, that wasn't all compare. There were other things going or [indiscernible]. James Lico : No, that's right. Yes we did improve a little bit. I think at Fluke, we had a much better second quarter. I think we had moved some price increases around the world. I think we had moved them from the first quarter to the second quarter. So I think we started to get traction on that in the second quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim, you just mentioned price in PI. When I look at incremental margins in that business, I mean, they were very strong in the quarter. When you gave us your initial FY '17 walk at the beginning of the year, you highlighted that you expected $0.04 to $0.05 of productivity and restructuring benefits in '17 versus '16, but I think a lot of that in PI. So are you getting more EPS than you expected so far from these benefits? And what would that updated number be versus that $0.04 to $0.05 that you talked about at the beginning of the year? Charles McLaughlin : Andy, it's Chuck. So no, I don't think we're getting more than what we expected out of restructuring. We're getting exactly what we thought we would. I think what you're seeing, especially in PI, is the core growth has been trending up since maybe Jim talked about those comments and at the [ DCMs ] that we -- the incremental margins we generate out of that business. That's really what's going to [ hit the WIP ]. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, that's fine. And then you guys have continued to sort of outperform expectations in Western Europe, high single digits, again, which I think is above most of the peers that have reported this quarter. We know you've been doing well in share growth. But how sustainable do you think this kind of growth is moving forward? And where would you say it's mostly coming from? James Lico : No. I think I've been proven wrong a couple of different times. I keep telling our Europe team that they keep making a liar out of me with the work they're doing. But I think the reality is, is that we probably see that moderating a little bit. We have some key project wins that we're driving accelerated performance here over the last quarter or 2. We mentioned in prepared remarks, particularly in Kollmorgen and Gilbarco. So we have seen that, but I think this moderates probably in the second half to mid-single digits. Some of that is just not -- maybe a little bit tougher comps because we're comping now. We're off of high single-digit growth in the second half of last year. So there's a little bit of comp in there and then I think just a little bit of what I would say is a slight slowdown in a couple of places just in the core business, just the base business [ if you will ]. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim, just following up on that, Kollmorgen, I think you said it was up below teens this quarter, and I think it was [ up ] in mid-single digits last quarter. So is that business actually accelerating based on the robotics offering that you have? Or how's that business doing? James Lico : Yes, it is. We're really -- the Kollmorgen team's done a great job. It's really been work we've been working on. As you know, we have to get the project wins from a few years that happened maybe a year or 2 ago and start to get some traction. We're seeing that. It's also a little bit of better North American and just based core industrial market. I think one of the places I mentioned a few minutes ago, when we start to see a little bit -- we're seeing a little bit of tailwind now in North America in the industrial business, and we're probably seeing that more in -- at Kollmorgen and Fluke maybe than in other places. So we think that's sustainable from what we see in point of sale at this point, so -- but we do -- but -- so some of it -- to bring it back to the specific question on Kollmorgen, it's really a combination of both share gain but also a little bit of lift in North America. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Like to go back to the ISC deal with the question of why gas detection. This is a fairly crowded space. Honeywell's got a big presence there with Zellweger and First Technology. And then that -- it's not -- I guess, it's not a coincidence, but Danaher tried to buy First Technology in gas detection and got into a bidding war with Honeywell like 10 years ago. So has this been on your wish list all this time? And so what is it about gas detection that makes sense now? James Lico : Well, I would say, first, if we go back 10 years, I'd prefer to not to do that, although I was probably the one involved. I think it's... Deane Dray : I think you were. James Lico : It's -- it really has to do with the fact that we really -- we see this convergence of technology. There's clearly large-scale safety players. You mentioned Honeywell. Obviously, people like MSA and 3M are in those markets as well. But what we really see is this core advantage around the safety-as-a-service pioneer that they've really put in. We really think it's that business model, the core relationship that they have with the workflow and what we can do with the combination of our other field solutions businesses, gives us a unique and differentiated position. And in many cases, they'll probably have multiple players in one facility. But we think we have a very sustainable position based on the strength of the business that they've really built as well as the huge strength that we have with Fluke. Deane Dray : So just on that point, Jim, on the idea you're going to run this business as a third leg, but might you consider migrating some of the subscription-based model into your other instrument businesses? James Lico : Yes. I think there is certainly an opportunity. We -- the team there at ISC is really thoughtful and has done a lot of great things. They're really, as I mentioned, the pioneer in thinking through this kind of business model. We obviously have some skill sets from our SaaS-based businesses at telematics and at Insite360. But we really bring a core industrial recurring revenue expertise at ISC that, quite frankly, is applicable across all of our industrial businesses. So yes, the answer to -- the quick answer to that question is we think it's an opportunity to leverage. And also their presence in Pittsburgh, they have a great relationship with Carnegie Mellon. And obviously, Carnegie Mellon is really, really great at artificial intelligence, robotics and just broadly in software. So they bring a whole bunch of expertise and relationships, quite frankly, that we haven't had as well. So we're ecstatic about the opportunity to have them join the team, and we think this is great for us for a long period of time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton with Stifel. Patrick Newton : I guess I'll lay off the ISC questions. I think we've hit most of the key points there. I wanted to pivot back to GVR. You talked about some strength in the quarter and that 3Q orders for EMV are better than expected. I'm just wondering if you could comment on whether the recent announcement from Exxon that it's incentivizing upgrades across its branded stations contributed to the EMV order flow and then maybe how these incentives could impact trends through the duration of 2017. James Lico : Yes. So we -- obviously, we announced our position with Exxon, great relationship with them. We didn't see much impact to that in the second quarter, and we don't think there's a tremendous impact in the third. It solidifies things a little bit but still to be determined. We just think more broadly with some -- we really saw a little bit of strength with specifically with 2 large retailers that we have a great relationship with. They bought a little earlier than we thought and a little bit more than we thought, which solidifies the third quarter. And that's why we think the full -- the first -- the second half is going to be better than we originally thought. But we still think there's probably -- there's still the potential of an air pocket out there in the fourth or the first quarter. So I still think, at some point in time, people will take a little bit of a pause, but we just had a couple. The strength of Gilbarco in general in the quarter has much to do with outside of the U.S. as it did anything, but we did get a little bit more business in North America than we originally planned. Patrick Newton : Okay. And then, I guess, shifting gears to Keithley. You again mentioned 3D sensing. I think Pat Byrne, at your Analyst Day, highlighted 3D sensing being a more than $20 million opportunity. We've seen several suppliers in this market provide pretty darn aggressive guidance for the September quarter. So could you comment on how that business is faring beyond your prepared remarks? And then pertaining to the $20 million market opportunity comment from your Analyst Day, can you help us understand the time frame to recognize that opportunity? James Lico : Yes. So our -- I think our opportunity -- as you noted, there's a lot of folks talking about 3D sensing certainly on the sensor side and a number of places where it's a huge opportunity for them. I think, for us, we're still trying to gauge the overall broad opportunity for us. We've challenged Pat and the team to really help us think through that in this year's strategic plan. What we really saw at Keithley first was very good performance even outside of 3D sensing. If you take 3D sensing out, they still had mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. So the Keithley team continues to execute very well. I think we're -- what we really saw, we saw most of that $20 million in the second quarter, probably saw all of it in the first half, and that was really a specific couple of customers in Korea and China that bought. So at this point, that opportunity likely is broader, but we haven't seen that yet. So we executed against the opportunities that were available to us, and we'll evaluate how big an opportunity that is for us over a longer period of time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Peng Yao Wu : This is actually Patrick Wu standing in for Charley. Just wanted to touch on the very last question that you guys had with 3D sensing. Obviously, the $20 million opportunity, can you size for us that market just in terms of what the addressable market possibly could be out there? James Lico : It will be tough for us to do at this point. I think that's probably something we'll gauge here by the end of the year. As I mentioned, we, Chuck and I, will start here shortly after this call, in fact, next week, going through strategic plans with some of the businesses. That'll carry throughout the third quarter in August and September. So we'll get a sense of when the tech team walks us through that, what that looks like, but at this point, we don't really have a gauge. So we had specific market opportunity with some customers and some design wins that we got that are very centered on the Keithley technology that's really flexible for manufacturing lines. So they really took advantage of the flexibility of that technology. But I think more broadly, how our whole offering really pertains to 3D sensing is still work to be done for us. Peng Yao Wu : Okay. And as we look at the robustness of your M&A pipeline, I mean, what should -- what is the management team thinking about in terms of a focus, maybe even region? Can you help us sort of -- can you give us a little more color on your thoughts around where you guys are looking at next, both regionally and as well as a product category? James Lico : Well, I think, yes, maybe looking back 12 months helps us look forward into the future. And I think what you've seen from us over the last 12 months, as Chuck articulated, is roughly $1 billion of spend. A number of those deals are really focused on accelerating our digital strategies, taking advantage of software, buying businesses that are deeply embedded in the workflow where we can extend solutions over time, leveraging our current business structure in most cases. We focus mostly on field solutions and transportation technology. It's the 2 platforms that are our largest 2 platforms and probably have the most serve-to-market opportunities. So certainly, I think we'll continue to do that and build on the strength of presence and strength of market positions we have in those businesses. And those businesses are almost 2/3 of the company. So that is certainly something we will continue to do. We will continue to look globally. We think that there are opportunities outside the U.S. Obviously, the Orpak acquisition is headquartered in Israel. It's a great example of how we're trying to globalize the business, build on technology capability in other parts of the world. You'll see us continue to do that. And then I suspect, as we noted in our Investor Day, that we'll continue to look for new platforms where there's opportunity. And we've highlighted a few places and secular trends that we'd like to think about going forward to do that, and we'll continue to think about those. I think we're now gaining more expertise into how to buy and integrate the software businesses, and quite frankly, I think that'll be part of it. And I think this quarter's example of being able to do that and create a lot the value and hit our return hurdles has been demonstrated. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing remarks. James Lico : Well, thanks, everybody, for taking the call on what is a rainy day here in Seattle, unusual in the summertime. We -- we're exceptionally excited to start our second year here at Fortive. We feel really good about our start. A lot of the strategic opportunities and the operational targets that we set for ourselves, we feel really good about the progress we made. And I think Chuck and I and the rest of the leadership team really look forward to seeing even more opportunity as we turn the clock on 12 months and start our second year here. We look forward to seeing you all soon. And if we don't have a chance to talk to you before the end of the summer, have a great summer, and we'll certainly -- Lisa's available and the team to answer any questions if you have them. Thanks, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's Fortive Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter results as our teams continue to execute well and deliver substantial core revenue growth with very strong adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow generation. The financial performance this quarter demonstrates the strength of our market positions, industry-leading innovation and the diversity of our portfolio amidst improving global end markets. We also took meaningful steps to strategically position Fortive for enhanced long-term growth through M&A. As we will discuss, in addition to the strong financial performance in the quarter, we were excited to close on $1.6 billion of acquisitions, including Orpak, ISC and Landauer that will contribute key product technologies and strengthen our recurring revenue profile. We believe these strategic portfolio additions and the power of the Fortive Business System will accelerate our growth trajectory and continue to deliver superior returns. Before getting into the earnings results, I\u2019ll briefly update you on this year\u2019s CEO kaizen event, which we held earlier this month. As we did in 2016, we brought together our top leaders across the company and spent the week utilizing FBS tools to focus on our key growth initiatives. The CEO kaizen provides an opportunity to celebrate our core values and to recognize our culture of continuous improvement. This year, more than 20 kaizen teams advanced to actions across our platform that will deliver accelerated innovation and market share in 2018 and beyond. With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s turn to the details of the third quarter. Our adjusted net earnings of $271.5 million were up 16% over the prior year, representing the third consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.77 with an effective tax rate of 24.4% for the quarter. Sales grew 7.5% to $1.7 billion, including a core revenue increase of 4.8%. Revenue growth was broad-based as all six strategic platforms grew core sales and four of six grew core sales mid-single digits or better. This performance reflected the success of multiple product introductions, favorable price, continued performance in high-growth markets and improving industrial end markets in North America. The favorable impact from acquisitions substantially accelerated to 180 basis points of growth, given the success of our capital deployment and strong business performance in strategic markets. Geographically, high-growth markets grew \u2013 core revenue grew double-digits with continued strength across Asia and improved growth in Latin America. Mid-teens growth in China was led by business wins at Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Tektronix, Fluke and Kollmorgen. Developed markets core revenue grew low-single digits driven by continued strength in Western Europe and improved performance in North America at Tektronix and in our automation businesses. We posted a record gross margin of 49.8%, an increase of 50 basis points over last year. Operating profit margin was 21.1% in the quarter, with favorable incrementals driving core operating margin expansion of 150 basis points or 90 basis points, excluding the benefit from lower amortization. The widespread application of FBS delivered core operating margin expansion in five of our six platforms. During the third quarter, we generated $287 million of free cash flow and delivered a strong conversion ratio of 107%. Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 8.7% with core revenue growth of 5.3%. Acquisitions contributed 270 basis points and favorable currency 70 basis points. Core operating margins expanded 240 basis points, which reported operating margins of 22.7%. Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue increased mid-single digits during the quarter, led by high-single-digit growth in high-growth markets. Field Solutions core revenue was up mid-single digits in the quarter with both Fluke and Qualitrol posting strong core revenue growth. As I mentioned previously, we\u2019re very excited that we have closed the acquisition of Industrial Scientific and Landauer, which together create a meaningful safety-as-a-service footprint that accelerates our connected device strategy. ISC, a leading provider of portable gas detection equipment and services, is off to a great start and was very quick to adopt our FBS culture. Landauer, which just closed last week, is expected to bring strong recurring sales growth given the strength of its technology and subscription-based radiation exposure services focused in the medical end market. Fluke\u2019s mid-single-digit growth included solid growth across all regions, particularly high-growth markets. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of improving core growth despite more challenging comparisons. Performance was led by Fluke Networks and Fluke Digital Systems, which includes the key components of the Accelix reliability platform. The Accelix pilots we announced last quarter are advancing with several large customers. As an example, utilizing the Fluke Accelix platform, a Fortune 100 healthcare company will deploy our condition monitoring solution, which includes power quality, ultrasound vibration and thermal imaging tools. This customer\u2019s facilities are now capable of providing real-time critical alerts to maintenance technicians, allowing full access to their enterprise asset management data via mobile technology. While implementation is still in the initial phase, all the pilots are demonstrating that our comprehensive solution delivers real measurable value through asset reliability and increased uptime. In addition to these large-scale condition monitoring pilots and the growth of the funnel, we also saw strong double-digit revenue growth at eMaint during the quarter. Fluke maintains its leading market position through innovation, and in the third quarter, Fluke launched a non-contact voltage products we previewed at Investor Day. This T6 family of electrical testers with field sense technology makes work safer by enabling technicians to measure voltage without making metal-to-metal contact. Fluke has already received two innovation awards for this product from distinguished industry associations and sales are well ahead of plan. Qualitrol delivered high-single digit growth led by further penetration of condition-based monitoring solutions for Europe and Chinese OEMs as well as Middle East utilities. The China market continues to benefit from ongoing investment in high voltage transmission, while offset by the Middle East, where a political instability is delaying budget approvals. Moving to product realization. Platform core revenues were up mid-single digits for the quarter led by growth at Tektronix. Tektronix high-single digits core revenue growth continues to be driven by high-growth markets with double-digit growth in Asia. This performance reflects strong sales growth in the semiconductor and Mil/Gov end markets and high demand for Tektronix\u2019s groundbreaking new product introductions. Sales performance of the Tektronix five series mixed-signal oscilloscope has exceeded our expectations. Using FBS tools, we executed against our go-to-market action plan to accelerate end user demand. As we previously noted, this new platform will have a more meaningful impact starting in 2018, we are very encouraged by the strong start. Our Sensing Technologies platform delivered high-single digit core revenue growth in the quarter led by double-digit growth in high-growth markets. While market share gains and global industrial stabilization impacted worldwide growth, a key business win in the semiconductor upcycle led growth in North America. One of our new technologies is the Setra Flex environmental monitor, which just recently won the 2018 air-conditioning, heating and refrigeration innovation award in the building automation category. Setra Flex is used to ensure safe and energy efficient indoor environmental and ventilation control conditions in all types of pressurized critical spaces, including operating rooms, biosafety labs and clean rooms. Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenue grew 6.5% with core revenue growth of 4.4% and sales from acquisitions contributing 100 basis points. Core operating margin expanded 50 basis points with reported operating margin of 21.8%. Our Transportation Technologies platform posted low single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter, reflecting solid sales growth across the platform. Low single-digit core revenue growth at Gilbarco Veeder-Root came in as expected as demand for EMV in North America slowed versus very strong prior-year double-digit comparisons. Global dispenser sales were up mid-single digits, reflecting continued outperformance in Europe and EMV-related sales growth in the U.S. High-growth markets core revenue grew double digits, driven by strong demand for dispensers, submersible pumps and automatic tank hinges. Integral to our high-growth market strategy, we closed the previously announced acquisition of Orpak during the third quarter. In August, Orpak was named the winner and a large fuel automation tender issued by IOCL, which is the largest oil company in India. Orpak will deploy its foresight fuel station management automation technology in up to 10,000 stations. We are very pleased with Orpak\u2019s performance and happy to have the team as part of the Fortive family. Separately, our thoughts are with many of those that are affected by the devastating September hurricanes across the U.S. As gasoline demand spike in supply was disrupted, our Insite360 fuel the logistics team was able to prevent or significantly reduced our customers\u2019 fuel runout rate across the affected areas. Telematics posted core revenue growth of mid single-digits in the quarter led by strong SaaS sales growth and increased installed base growth. The success of our new Director platform and the strong adoption of electronic logging devices especially in the small to medium business segment has helped performance in the U.S. as core sales in North America improved sequentially by greater than 400 basis points. Given this positive trend, we continue to see North America performance accelerate and expect telematics to exit the year at high single-digit growth rate. Automation and specialty grew core sales high single-digits driven by continued double-digit in high-growth markets and robotics. Jacobs Vehicle Systems delivered high single-digit core revenue growth. Kollmorgen once again posted double-digit core revenue growth, reflecting strong demand across its global industrial automation product line, which is driven by general industrial stabilization and continued robotic strength in Europe, China and Japan. Kollmorgen released the newest servomotor of products, AKM 2G, at PAC Expo in Las Vegas and also launched its latest mobile NDCA 3.0. Thompson delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth driven by double-digit growth in high-growth markets and strong North American distributor growth. Thompson released the newest addition to their smart actuator family that incorporates a synchronization feature for applications where multiple actuators are used in tandem to move the same load. Innovation across the automation businesses is driving new project wins to help position the business for future growth. Franchise distribution core sales were slightly up versus last year. Matco core sales were flat as growth in diagnostics was offset by continued softness in tool storage and a challenging hardline tools sales comparison. To wrap up, we are very pleased with the execution in the third quarter. We have made continued progress towards increasing growth and greater recurring revenue to enhance our portfolio. We\u2019re building a great industrial growth company and we\u2019re doing that with the Fortive Business System. The strength of our cash flow generation and balance sheet positions us well for continued capital deployment towards acquisitions as we leverage the Fortive formula to continue to deliver strong earnings growth. We are raising our full year 2017 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance range to $2.82 to $2.86, which includes our core revenue growth expectation of mid single-digit and an effective tax rate of 25%. We continue to anticipate core margin expansion of more than 50 basis points for the year and free cash flow conversion of approximately 105%. We are also initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.74 to $0.78, which includes assumptions of low single-digit core revenue growth and an effective tax rate of 24%. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Lisa. Lisa Curran : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Kirsten, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi, guys, good afternoon. Jim Lico : Hey, Scott. Good to hear you. Scott Davis : Thank you. Thank you for making easy quarter on us and the last thing \u2013 I needed to know it was GE type quarter. So thank you for given that\u2019s a clean number and good cash. But I\u2019m kidding aside, I think I missed some of the service out when you did Industrial, Scientific and Land \u2013 Landauer, I guess, it is. How do they \u2013 are there synergies with the Fluke business and Qualitrol? Or are there \u2013 they\u2019re both kind of software-as-a-service businesses. I mean, they\u2019re \u2013 and detection. Is there a way to bring these things together and get kind of extra synergies if you will? Jim Lico : Yes. Exactly, maybe a little bit. ISC, first and foremost, will be a separate operating company for us but will clearly have some synergy with the Fluke team. Rest in the team have really seen some opportunities to really combine this sort of what we view \u2013 what we deem is the term safetenance, which is to really take the maintenance professionals, it\u2019s really a core part of the Fluke business and make sure that they have all the safety equipment that\u2019s just core to the technologies at iNet, at ISC. So there\u2019s certainly a nice synergy there that the team\u2019s working on. And with Landauer, they\u2019re real positioned in the hospital with radiation services, really goes well with a number of product technologies that we have in the Fluke biomet business, probably more directly synergistic with that business. So certainly, some synergies there. So great business, it\u2019s independent, really but we also make sure we take advantage of a number of the synergies. We\u2019re off to a great start at ISC as I said in the prepared remarks. Just closed Landauer, but we\u2019re really excited to have them on the team as well. Scott Davis : And then these \u2013 are these fragmented businesses where you\u2019ve got an opportunity over number of years to roll them off? How does the structure than industry stand right now? Jim Lico : Probably a little bit different. We like to \u2013 this portion of the gap, as you know, several of our peer companies have rolled up several safety companies, but we really see ISC as very different gas detection play, really focus more on their recurring revenue model and how they really go-to-market really is directed at specific kind of customer that really marries well with the Fluke customers. So probably less of a roll up strategy directly within the product technology. But some opportunities to sort of build on the software and data analytics capability that we have within the portfolio today or might add to the portfolio down the road. And same will be true for Landauer as well. Scott Davis : Yes, that sounds interesting. Well, thank you for that. And I\u2019ll pass it on. Good luck guys. Jim Lico : All right. Thanks, Scott. Good to talk to you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good afternoon. Just a question firstly around transportation tech. So it looks as if that business maybe down or GVR specifically maybe down slightly in the fourth quarter. So maybe just discuss, I guess, if that\u2019s the case and how long you think that type of softness persist thereafter? And maybe give a little bit more color as well on dispensers, specifically, because I think one of your competitors have talked about a pickup recently in orders there, but the 10-Q commentary suggests not in your case. Jim Lico : So yes, first, maybe more broadly around where we\u2019re at with Gilbarco Veeder-Root. We had a good quarter. They did the sell-off double-digit growth. And as you know, Julian, we\u2019ve had double-digit growth in that particular part of the market for number of years here. So little bit of slowing in North America, but we think that probably accelerates a little bit into the fourth and into the first quarter. So break down, low single-digits in the fourth and maybe slightly worse than that. But that probably persist into the first quarter, and then we\u2019ll sequentially get better through the year. We still think Gilbarco can grow in 2018. So still an opportunity for margin expansion in the business with that sort of growth profile. And they\u2019ve obviously done an exceptional job thus far. So that we had a great quarter into Spencers around the world, one of our best quarters I think that we\u2019ve ever had. So a very strong quarter for us and as we see globally, I think, I never take stock into what\u2019s happened in the first couple of weeks or anything like that. So I think we\u2019ll see a little bit of flowing here for a little bit, but as we look at the market, we have \u2013 this is one of those things where because we have such connections with the top 300 customers. We have a pretty good sense of what they\u2019re going to be doing here. So as we look at things, we certainly see a little bit of an air pocket here for the next couple of quarters, but we\u2019re still pretty confident on the rollout as we look out over the next two years or three years. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. And then just my follow-up would be I think gross margins had a nice expansion in Q3 having been flat in Q2. Is that really all about pricing? That seemed to get stronger in both businesses in the third quarter. Chuck McLaughlin : Julian, this is Chuck. Yes, we\u2019re happy to see our third quarter gross margins expand as we expected across the business. We saw really across the portfolio strong performance. Our prices as we mentioned as a piece of that with 50 basis points. But when you mention back in Q2, when we didn\u2019t see as much, that was coming off of a really tough compare. And when you look year-to-date, we still felt confident about getting the kind of gross margin expansion that we saw and expected into Q3 and expected to continue into Q4. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Julian. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Hi guys, good afternoon. Jim Lico : Hi, Andrew. Chuck McLaughlin : Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just some questions on product realization. Looking at the queue, it seems that it\u2019s slow down sequentially, but then your commentary on Tektronix was quite positive. It\u2019s been a nice boost to growth this year. Can you just give us color what happened in the quarter and how does the growth rate look into the year-end? Thank you. Jim Lico : Yes. Yes, sure. Product realization really makes up, really two big businesses, Tek and EMC. The Tek, as you mentioned, had a very strong quarter on the back of both good market work, but also the product introductions and innovations that they\u2019ve launched in the quarter. So we think they\u2019ll continue to see strength. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, North America picked up a little bit for Tek as well, which was good to see on the back of some of this innovation. EMC had a little bit of a tougher \u2013 they had a very tough compare. We had talked about a bunch of backlog, last year had moved from the second quarter and the third quarter given them exceptionally strong third quarter last year. So they were banking against the big comp. But their book-to-bill is very strong and we feel very good about their growth for the year. So I think when you take that stock at that, I think product realization, we\u2019ll have a good fourth quarter. Andrew Obin : And just to follow-up on Landauer, now that you own the business, what are the most obvious sort of targets for cost synergies or just sort of cost takeout, how does that look now that you own it versus when you bought it? Jim Lico : Well, we\u2019ve owned it for a very short period of time, but nonetheless, I think we certainly feel that the public company costs will come out. That certainly is, I would say, probably easy to do. We certainly think there\u2019s FBS opportunities even in the early days. The management there has been excited about those opportunities. Obviously, the Wes Pringle and the leadership of Field Solutions are very good at FBS, and so their ability to apply that will give us some opportunities. There\u2019s some global go-to-market synergies as well. We\u2019ll be able to leverage the sales force that we have there in the Fluke business, particularly in the bio \u2013 what we called the biomed business. So both cost synergies indirectly some FBS opportunities plus some synergies maybe not necessarily cost takeout, but to really leverage scale that we\u2019ve already invested in Fluke. Andrew Obin : Terrific. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks and great day. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Hi, good afternoon. Jim Lico : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Hey guys, how is going? So just wanted to dig in, just want to make sure, I heard that low-single digit growth in 4Q, I think that\u2019s what you said, Jim. So just wondering, trying to kind of, I think, the impact of Transportation Technologies within that? And then maybe just any color you can give us in terms of how that PI and industrial. Jim Lico : Yes. I think \u2013 PI will be good in the fourth quarter. A lot of the things we talked about in the prepared remarks in places like Fluke and Tek, which are some big part we\u2019ll continue to see. Sensing we\u2019ll continue to do pretty well. So I think we feel good about where PI is. As we mentioned in the remarks, we are seeing a little bit of an industrial North \u2013 particularly North America, a little bit of pickup in the industrial markets. Certainly saw that with peer companies as well as some of our customers like Granger and West Coast. So I think we feel good about the trajectory of the business, not just from a market perspective, but also from a lot of innovation we have. So PI should be \u2013 should have a good quarter. Really, the move down in, we\u2019re also banking against the little bit tougher comp in the fourth unlike a lot of folks, we had very good fourth quarter growth rate that we\u2019re comping against. So when you look across the portfolio with the exception of Matco probably still slow, Gilbarco down a little bit. But other than that, the rest of the portfolio should be in pretty good shape. Nigel Coe : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And the comps I think gets up at the in 4Q. You definitely a little bit earlier to launch in the recovery. And then maybe a question for Chuck, on the free cash flow, the guidance is 105 for the full year? But I think you\u2019re in the maybe high 80s year-to-date. Maybe just give us some color in terms of what\u2019s being taxing free cash flow year-to-date in the conversion and what changed them in 4Q? Chuck McLaughlin : Hi, sure, Nigel. First of all, 88% year-to-date is about where we would normally expect to be. And because the first half of the year especially the first quarter, we have a little bit lower revenue and then we pay out there\u2019s some onetime payments, ICP and whatnot goes off in Q1. And then we finished much stronger more like 130-plus percent in Q4. That\u2019s just normal. So we really think we\u2019re at a good spot here and tracking right to 105. Nigel Coe : Right. Thanks, guys. Jim Lico : Thanks, Nigel. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Richard Eastman : Yes. Good afternoon. Jim Lico : Hi, Rich. Richard Eastman : Maybe I\u2019ll just quickly address this to Chuck. Just from the standpoint of when you look at Landauer and maybe also with ISC, those two business models have a pretty high recurring revenue kind of subscription oriented model. How \u2013 can you give us some help as to how they come into Fortive\u2019s P&L either accretion or just it\u2019s a big chunk of the revenue of either of those businesses have to be deferred? Chuck McLaughlin : No. I think that next year \u2013 when we get into next year after that normal step up of just in terms of the acquisition after the first few months. No, it will come in pretty much as you\u2019ve seen them in standalone in 2018. And so we\u2019re going to see that revenue. And as you mentioned, Landauer has got over 80% of recurring revenue that may be pushing 90%. And ISC is an evolving and they are in the 40s but grow increasing that percentage. So both of those things are going to be trends that help us going forward. Richard Eastman : Okay. And just from the standpoint of adjusted EPS, again, maybe math suggest that certainly with Landauer that with first year synergies that maybe can both of ISC and Landauer each contribute something high-single digit $0.01 per share, call it $0.08 or $0.09 per share each. Chuck McLaughlin : Each? No. I think when we look at the three-year rightly, we like the returns on both of those deals. That sounds a little bit rich in the first year, but both are going to be accretive and be a driver for us next year in 2018. We\u2019re going to give more color when we give our Q4 results in terms of what guidance next year. But both of those expect to be accretive next year. Richard Eastman : Okay, I understand. And then just Jim, in the industrial tech segment, when you look at the automation specialty business, some of that, Kollmorgen, Thomson, some of that \u2013 much of that goes through distribution and with the pressure on these industrial distributors, certainly in North America given, it can be Amazon effect. Are you seeing anything, any push down on pricing to Kollmorgen, to Thomson from that channel? Jim Lico : We\u2019re not. No, we aren\u2019t, Rich and I think there\u2019s a couple of reasons for that. We\u2019re a little bit more on the specialty channels here as when you think about Kollmorgen\u2019s motor businesses as an example, it\u2019s really not maybe more \u2013 it\u2019s more custom applications with OEM, even if we bring that through distributors. It tends to be more \u2013 we\u2019ve got more content from a customization perspective. And so we tend to not see \u2013 we don\u2019t really play in a commodity market. And I call it commodity, but really it\u2019s sort of general space. So I think it would not be unusual for us to not see that sort of price compression that existed with those channel partners. So as we mentioned, 50 bps of price in the quarter and it was pretty good across the portfolio. So from that standpoint, we continue to believe that we can get a little bit of price. We mentioned a couple of innovations in the prepared remarks, both at Kollmorgen and Thomson, which is the two biggest piece of automation and that really helps obviously give us better gross margins in the portfolio because a big part of the FBS is making sure that our innovations have better gross margins than the products that they replace. Richard Eastman : Understand. Okay, great. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks, have a good day. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good day, everyone. Just a couple of quick ones. Jim, can you just elaborate a little bit more on how to think about kind of the rollout of new products at Tektronix? You alluded to a stronger performance next year. Are you talking kind of simply than annualization of what\u2019s happening in the back half of this year? Or is there another wave of SKU count coming, et cetera? Or maybe what type of growth contribution you\u2019re looking for there? Jim Lico : Yes. So we launched of the five series at the tail end of the second quarter. That\u2019s really part of the largest contributor to what we saw in the third. That\u2019s our new midrange oscilloscope. As we mentioned, that\u2019s a start of the platform product that we\u2019ll have a number of other new generation products. So there\u2019ll be another version that coming out roughly next year around the same time. We\u2019ve got a couple of other products that are a little bit lower volume that contribute to it as well in a couple of different \u2013 maybe high rent categories, what we call the bit error rate tester or BERTScope as well as our arbitrary waveform generator. So two other products that are more higher end defense, mil gov, advance research, or in a data center or in it. So a number of those will also be launched. So when we think about where tech is, it\u2019s probably still little early to see whether they\u2019re going to pan out for the year next year. But we continue to see strength there. We talked about China. We\u2019re starting to see some of the developed markets get a little bit better on the back of some of these innovations. So certainly, the annualization will be an impact next year, particularly in the first half. But we\u2019ve got another wave of product that should keep it in growing throughout every quarter next year. Jeff Sprague : Right. And then thank you. I guess, speaking of waves, a little M&A wave starting here. What\u2019s the pipeline look like? Should we expect anything else before year-end perhaps? Or maybe give us a little color on the final? Jim Lico : Well, yes. It\u2019s always hard to say, but we feel really good about what we did in the third quarter. And quite frankly, what we\u2019ve done since the start. When you think about the traction we\u2019re getting in deals like eMaint and GTT that we did around this time last year as well as the bigger deals that we transformed or transacted, excuse me, in the third quarter. There is still \u2013 the funnel still is really good. We\u2019re as busy as we\u2019ve ever been. So we continue to be busy with opportunities. And we feel good about where we\u2019re at. You never know if we get something done or not, we\u2019re always working on things, but you never know. So we feel good about where we\u2019re at and where we\u2019ll be. I think the other thing may be expecting another question is certainly, things are \u2013 there are things that are expenses. You certainly see that certainly as the market goes up, but I think what we\u2019ve been able to find is opportunities for good returns. You certainly see that with a portfolio of things we\u2019ve done. So while pricing obviously has moved up a little bit as the market has gone up particularly in public stock, we clearly have seen opportunities to still have those kinds of returns that are important to the company. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Yes. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Jim Lico : Hey, Steve. Steve Tusa : Just a quick housekeeping items. Is the 20% tax rate, is that kind of the sustainable rate going forward now? Or is that \u2013 is there something kind of unique about this year? Chuck McLaughlin : Steve, great question. No, I think that 25%, where with the average for the year is probably is what I\u2019ll guide you to next year. The one thing that\u2019s happening this year is the accounting change with the option, the benefit from option exercises. I think we believe that\u2019s uniquely impacting this year. We\u2019ve also done a great job. The tax team has done a great job getting the tax rate down into the 25%, a little ahead of schedule. But I think, 24% is probably \u2013 we\u2019ll get there someday, but not next year. Steve Tusa : Okay. So 25% next year. Chuck McLaughlin : Yes. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just on the acquisition pipeline, can you maybe provide a little bit of color on if there are any big fish swimming around out there? Or pretty steady state? What\u2019s your appetite for deals here over the next, call it, I don\u2019t know, nine to 12 months? Jim Lico : Well. I think, we really are \u2013 I know we maybe sound like a broken record, I apologize for that a little bit. But we really do have a good balance though. Certainly, a couple of bigger things came out with Landauer and ISC, but we\u2019ve got a number of \u2013 the funnel it\u2019s pretty balance around large things, certainly from things, that would be great bolt-ons to some of the businesses as well, so a good balance of those things. We certainly have the capacity to do a number of things, so it\u2019s not \u2013 we\u2019re not in any way inhibited by what we just done. I think the free cash flow generation, the strong profitability, we\u2019re going to have double-digit earnings. We\u2019ve obviously had it for three quarters in a row. We expect it for the next several quarters and certainly all of next year. So I think that certainly gives us the ability to do a number of things. I think one of the best things about where we\u2019re at right now is a number of degrees of freedom that we have. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. And sorry, one last one. I jumped in a little late. I\u2019m not sure if anybody asked about semiconductor \u2013 the kind of sustainability, what\u2019s going on in China semis. If somebody already asked about it, then don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll read the transcript. But I just want to get your take on how sustainable that is and what kind of visibility you have in the next year. Jim Lico : So no, one asked it. So I think we\u2019ll have a great year in and particularly, probably the biggest aspect of that is in China where we\u2019ve been benefiting from that with Tektronix. We saw a number of other parts and semiconductor improve in some of our smaller businesses like sensors, et cetera, and other places, which doesn\u2019t necessarily move the needle necessarily for the overall company, but certainly gives us a sense that things are actually getting even a little bit better, so and the little bit more broadly. So we feel good about what that market will look like into 2018. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thanks, good afternoon, everyone. Just go back to price for a moment. You said 50 basis points in the quarter. If you kind of go across the portfolio, what are you getting the most price? And where are you finding it tough? Or do you actually have negative price in areas in the portfolio? Chuck McLaughlin : Hey, Deane, actually, it\u2019s very balanced across most of our companies. There\u2019s a few point places where I think maybe this would have a bit \u2013 a little bit where we didn\u2019t get as much at tech. They brought us a new product that are actually seeing good margin lift and they really have got a mix thing going at I believe with China and the rest of the world. But we don\u2019t see it there as much. And also, I think in probably telematics is down a little bit as well. But that\u2019s the competitive market and that\u2019s not unusual. Although we\u2019ve seen some good price realization, coming up as we go forward as the ELD has been rolled out. So even there, we\u2019re seeing improvement, but it\u2019s really strong across the portfolio. Jim Lico : Yes. Maybe just to add on, Deane. A lot of folks have talked about price cost and we\u2019ve been a really good shape relative to cost. So the price aspect of this is the incremental have been really good. So as Chuck mentioned, it\u2019s good to see across the portfolio. And with the fact that our procurement supply chain teams are doing such good on the cost side, that\u2019s why you see the continued confidence in our gross margin improvements. Deane Dray : Sure. And then just as a follow-up, since it is such an important bellwether, the Fluke business, how it look on the sell in versus sell-through across our distributors? Jim Lico : Yes. We get the best data in North America and Europe even though we didn\u2019t around the world. But North America look pretty good. Sell in, sellout was relatively close. We didn\u2019t see any inventory build whatsoever, so I think if we look \u2013 if I look more broadly in North America around places where we get channel sellout on balance, all pretty good number. So I think sustainable for at least in the \u2013 these are all short-cycle businesses, but at least within the year, we think things stay pretty good. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard. So I think on balance, Europe is \u2013 Western Europe is kind of the same way. Pretty good. So we do get pretty good inventory levels from distributors in Europe as well and we haven\u2019t seen any inventory building \u2013 build up as well. So sell in, sellout is looking pretty good right now. Deane Dray : Good to hear. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, guys. Jim Lico : Hi, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : So Qualitrol had high-single-digit growth again decent for the penetration of [indiscernible] you talk about that in Europe and China. Can you talk about the business is doing there to achieve that kind of growth? Because when I look at competitors, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re growing at that piece. And they seem to be suggesting that, it\u2019s a little more choppy than you guys are seeing, so it seems like you guys are taking share or [indiscernible] different parts of the market than they are. Jim Lico : Yes, a couple of things. One, we\u2019re pretty local in China. So it\u2019s an example, so we really have a good business not only with \u2013 also with the Chinese OEMs. So we really have a broader, probably a broader business than a lot of others that maybe sometimes you hear about. We have a little bit of maybe advantage of loss small numbers, too. But I think, I\u2019m balanced, our team is executing exceptionally well. And so we continue to think that the way the investments are going in China will continue to do well at Qualitrol into 2018, at least we expect that. I mentioned you didn\u2019t ask it a little bit. We did note that we are seeing a little sluggishness in the Middle East, particularly in places like Saudi Arabia. So we\u2019ve seen the balance just as we look out in the near term. We think a strong China certainly overwhelms that. But we are seeing pockets of things where we are seeing a little bit of budgetary constraints. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. Jim I want to ask about Jacobs Vehicle Systems, then down and then flat, now would actually turn to high-single digit growth. So can you talk about the outlook for that business? Is it going to be with a heavy truck market coming back here, high single-digit growth business going forward, what are you seeing in that business? Jim Lico : Well, I think you\u2019re exactly right. We\u2019ve had a just an outstanding strong business there in China over the last couple of years. We really built a great business there. But as you know, the North American market was sort of offsetting that until recently. So North American market getting better, probably next year still not at peak levels, but probably certainly better than this year. We\u2019ve got a little bit of mix with Europe where we are losing some business in Europe that will probably slow the business down a little bit that\u2019s maybe going to take a little bit of the growth rates. But we would anticipate at least for sure North America and China growing next year. And overall, the business will grow. Andrew Kaplowitz : All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch : Thank you. Hey, Jim, the low single-digit growth, did you call out any of the businesses? I couldn\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t remember from your answer. Did you call out any of the businesses in the fourth quarter that you\u2019re expecting to perhaps slow sequentially? Jim Lico : Yes. I\u2019ll give them back here. We would see \u2013 we would expect Gilbarco to probably sequentially be down in the fourth. They were not down in the third, so that\u2019s probably the biggest change of really trajectory sequentially. John Inch : Okay. That makes sense. Was the deal cost, Chuck, in the quarter that kind of kept the PI margins a little bit lower in terms of the sequential down? Chuck McLaughlin : I\u2019m taking through the answer in the sequential margins that, that deal \u2013 certainly, deal cost in the quarter. We look through them for \u2013 from the earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share. So they are not really hurting our OP margins at all. John Inch : I was just thinking, PI margins were over 24 in the second quarter and they were down, but obviously, I\u2019m just wondering if deal costs played a significant role in that. That\u2019s all. Chuck McLaughlin : So let me come back to you on specifically. I know we had it. I\u2019m just wondering on that on the margin expansion that you\u2019re talking about, how that rolled in there, but it likely did. John Inch : Okay. Landauer fits, obviously set depending on how you look at it, right? It looks pretty pricey. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to get the benefits out of it over time. Your other \u2013 the rest of your pipeline, I\u2019m sure, we\u2019d be expecting because \u2013 it was a little bit of headline, Chuck. Should we be expecting similar types of multiple revenue types of deals coming forth? I was just kind of the priciest of the ones that just happened to hit? Chuck McLaughlin : Well, we did three deals in the quarter. All have different profiles. All had similar return profiles. So as you know, we tend to focus on returns, so that\u2019s \u2013 I certainly think that there will be times when a great asset becomes available and we will really \u2013 if we can get the right returns, we will take the opportunity. That doesn\u2019t mean that there is a new trend here. As I mentioned before, prices are higher for some things. But we\u2019ve been pretty disciplined. I think we found a number of things, what we paid for Orpak as an example was, I think, was very good. So if you look over time and you look over what we\u2019ve got, and certainly think you\u2019re going to see a mix of prices as you look at multiples of revenue or multiples of EBITDA. But I think on balance, you\u2019ll see us still maintain a discipline around returns and, on occasion, you\u2019ll see those situations where the opportunity is so good for our transformational like thing that will take advantage of it. John Inch : But you have to admit that Landauer will be screening that toward the high end of what the\u2026 Chuck McLaughlin : Yes, I would say Landauer is going to typically be at the high end of that. That\u2019s for sure. John Inch : Okay. Jim Lico : John, sorry, to interrupt you. I just have the answer back on the transaction costs are about 140 bps impacting Q3 of this year in PI. John Inch : Okay. So that kind of helps to explain the sequential trend. Jim Lico : On a sequential, yes. We\u2019re still up year-over-year. John Inch : You are. You just actually had a really good quarter in PI last quarter. So we just made the sequential compare tough. Let me ask then just lastly here. We\u2019re obviously, once we get over this air pocket going to roll into some pretty nice growth rates at EMV. Probably going to go on for two or three years. Then there\u2019s a this whole notional kind of concept of the cliff, and I\u2019m just curious, Jim and Chuck, how are you thinking about that now? Is it so far or it doesn\u2019t really matter? Or do you actually think about beginning to manage around that so that could be adding to the diversity of the GVR business or it could be actually potentially divesting it before hand or \u2013 is it just \u2013 how would you respond to that kind of concept today? Jim Lico : Well, I think it is a transformational like situation. But I think what we try to do is do a couple of things. And it isn\u2019t too far off for us be thinking about it, so that\u2019s maybe the first question. As you know, we have a broad discussion around strategy for a long period of time amongst all our business, not only amongst with Chuck and I, but also with the board around what are the degrees of freedom. I think there\u2019s a couple of things that we\u2019re really watching. One, we\u2019re building our transportation technologies with a number of opportunities to really make sure that we are taking advantage of all the kinds of disruptive technologies that are going on and that certainly will be something that we\u2019ll mute some of the things were talking about. We\u2019re building a global business at Gilbarco Veeder-Root so the acquisition we just did with Orpak is helping us build out our high-growth infrastructure. You see some of those things with some of the successes we\u2019ve had for instance on global dispenser that we described in the prepared remarks. So we\u2019re certainly taking \u2013 making sure that we\u2019re looking through this. And then other thing we\u2019re trying to do is build more recurring revenue models. So that \u2013 yes, we might see it dip, but we won\u2019t necessarily see the dip in margins. So our Insite360 strategy is really bringing on all of the number of sites to make sure that we\u2019ve got recurring revenue with those sites, adding to that with more software over time. And it\u2019s a number of those strategies that are going to work to mitigate that while at the same time, trying to determine how we can best take on that business in a way that will be \u2013 will mitigate any potential bubble out there. So we\u2019re certainly working on it. I think it\u2019s a little early to be very specific about what we\u2019re actually doing, but we have a number of things going on right now that are working to \u2013 and we talked a lot about things like Insite360. And some of the payment things we\u2019re trying to do as well to build this business for the long-term, which ultimately keeps maybe it has a little bit of a downturn in that revenue. It\u2019s specifically at Gilbarco North America, but on balance is offset in the number of other parts of the portfolio. John Inch : Yes, and you\u2019ve got time to work it through. Okay, thank you guys. Appreciate it. Jim Lico : Thanks, John. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Evelyn Chow : Hi, everyone. This is Evelyn Chow on for Joe. Maybe stating with Matco for a second. I know last quarter you had some softness in the storage area. It seems like overall, trends are moving in the right direction. As you think about this business and what you\u2019re hearing from your dealers and your customer surveys, at what point do you kind of feel this can get back to you that low to mid single-digit type grower. Jim Lico : Yes, I think, what we highlighted in the prepared remarks, was a tool storage was still weak, so we\u2019ve continue to see sort of the high ticket items, Evelyn, sort of still be more challenged in the portfolio. We think that\u2019s pretty well tied to mechanics hours and what\u2019s going on there. We see less hours with mechanics, less dollars on their pocket, less likely to buy the high ticket items. We did see some of our diagnostic lines have really good growth. So \u2013 and in some of the day-to-day stuff is still doing pretty well. So we expect that some of those challenges will continue to happen through likely the first part of next year. That\u2019s when you start to see the vehicle production that happened in 2010 start to take on. We think about vehicles that are seven or eight years old as a big part and so what we\u2019re seeing right now is that 2008, 2009 dip in vehicles coming into that age where they need the most maintenance. So as the 2010 and 2011 vehicle production numbers come in, you\u2019ll start to see those mechanics hours bump up. And that\u2019s roughly around the summertime of next year. Evelyn Chow : That\u2019s very helpful. And maybe revisiting something from last quarter. I know you had a great quarter in 3D sensing. I think at the time, you were kind of still gauging the broad opportunities of your business. Just wondering how that thinking has evolved? Jim Lico : Yes, we probably we\u2019ll see anything right now there\u2019s \u2013 as we look at our type of solution and the kinds of applications that exist, I know everybody thinks that all 3D sensing opportunities are alike, but they\u2019re not. And so we do think that there will be opportunities in 2018 and 2019 for 3D sensing. We would expect to see some revenue from that, but that\u2019s a customer-by-customer story and not as broad-based as maybe the overall theme is going. So we feel good about what\u2019s going on in Tektronix and Keithley. We feel like we have a great opportunity to take advantage of a number of opportunities. One of them to be 3D sensing, but it\u2019s not necessarily the massive trend for us and sometimes you read about when you think more broadly about that technology. Evelyn Chow : Thanks everyone. Have a great night. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joe Giordano : Hey guys, how are you? Jim Lico : Hi, Joe. Joe Giordano : Maybe just, most of my stuff has been answered. Just a question on Landauer. So can you talk us through what the growth, organic growth has been there for the last couple of years? And how do you guys \u2013 is most of the \u2013 your philosophy to grow that business more leveraging your existing businesses, like can you talk about Fluke, IC?? Or do you have like what\u2019s your strategy to grow that business on its own outside of potential revenue synergies with those stuff? Jim Lico : So I think they were flat for a couple of years. They\u2019ve been growing this year, but they were flat for a couple of years based on a number of things, one of which was a challenged ERP implementation that was really hurting them from a resource perspective. We think they\u2019re on a better trajectory right now. As I mentioned before, we think being able to utilize some synergy that we have with our global footprint, leveraging the bigger business will essentially double the size of our healthcare biomedical business with the addition of Landauer. And the combination of that will really create, we think, a number of growth opportunities, growth initiatives to bring some solutions \u2013 new solutions, but also to leverage the global go-to-market in ways that quite frankly Landauer couldn\u2019t necessarily leverage with their size. So that\u2019s really where the opportunity and we think we can turn it into a grower year. They\u2019ve been growing last couple of quarters, so we think it will continue to be able to manage that growth over the next several years. But it will take a little while to get some of that work done. Some of that is not stuff that happens in the quarter or two, but in order to get the return, we feel we can get a really good return there. It\u2019s a combination of some obviously, the opportunities to bring out peers to the organization, but also to deliver accelerated growth in the business as well. Joe Giordano : Is it more of a new product introduction upgrade kind of call there? And just remind me what the recurring element is. I know it\u2019s high, but I\u2019m forgetting exactly how? Jim Lico : The recurring is close to 90, I think it\u2019s a little bit above 85, so it\u2019s a very good recurring revenue model. And it will be \u2013 they have some good technology, so we feel good about the technology. We\u2019ll obviously continue to invest in innovation. That\u2019s one of the things that, I think, a hallmark of our business, so we\u2019ll continue to do that. And I suspect that will create some new opportunities, but I think we\u2019ll get good some of the growth will certainly come from this geographic expansion of their current product portfolio. Joe Giordano : Okay, thanks guys. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Patrick Newton : Yes, good afternoon Jim and Chuck, thank you for taking my questions. Most have been asked and answered so I have somewhat of a nuanced question on Tektronix. I believe that this business is number one in services within the targeted markets and we\u2019ve seen a major initiative from key side to focus its business on both servicing its own equipment and also third party equipment. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing any changes in the services market giving this competitive initiative? Jim Lico : Well, yes, I think obviously everybody \u2013 the first initiative that everybody tries to do is to service their own equipment. That\u2019s \u2013 I think it generally has an advantage in doing that. And then as you said, the multi-vendor services opportunity. We had a very good quarter and services to attack this quarter. So we feel like we\u2019re actually getting a little bit of the tailwind in the business from some of the work we\u2019ve done and feel good about it. So it\u2019s big market, there is a lot of third party people. It would be more than the right assumption to think that both us and Quayside could clearly grow in the market together as we \u2013 because there are \u2013 the market is mostly third-party labs and calibration to do that work around the world. So the opportunity for OEMs to do this is still pretty big even if they\u2019re not necessarily competing. Patrick Newton : Great. And I guess just shifting gears back to an earlier question you had on 3D sensing, you kind of set that for a market for Fortive that is perhaps not as big or as broad as some of the 3D sensing applications. And I\u2019m curious why that is? Because I believe that your initial initiative that Keithley gain traction and actually was the very widely known consumer electronics release with the iPhone X and facial recognition. And perhaps I\u2019m wrong, but why is that test application not widely applicable to similar consumer electronics types of applications? Or perhaps I missing something within your prior answer? Jim Lico : Well, first, I would never comment on the customer of ours, given our inability to comment on what customers we have there. I think first and foremost, there are specific applications where we do pretty well. I think it has something to do with the level of quality and how you approach of testing. So not every consumer electronics customer approach of testing that way. There\u2019s a couple of different ways to get them in today and, if you will, from a testing compliance capability and certain companies don\u2019t go this intervention as others. So we\u2019ve latched on to a certain technique, if you will, that really bodes well for how we do it in our technology. That isn\u2019t necessarily everybody will do things like facial recognition. But that said, we do think there\u2019s a broader opportunity here and we are building out some capability from a applications perspective to be able to build solutions for some of the product applications that might exist. We just \u2013 that\u2019s very, very early days and it will be premature to comment on the success or failure of that at this point. Patrick Newton : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck. Jim Lico : Thanks Patrick. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today\u2019s call. I will now hand it back over to Lisa for any additional or closing remarks. Jim Lico : Thanks Christina. Thanks, everybody, for being on the call today. We\u2019re exceptionally excited about the third quarter, so I\u2019m setting kind of our one year anniversary of doing the call on our own and we\u2019re really excited about what we\u2019ve got going here in the fourth quarter and into 2018. We\u2019ll see many of you here shortly as we\u2019re out and about, and we\u2019ll look forward to seeing you then and giving you our guidance in February. Obviously, Lisa and Josh are available for any questions or follow-ups and we look forward to seeing you soon. Thanks, and have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us for Fortive Corpration\u2019s third quarter 2017 earnings results call. Thank you. You may now disconnect. And then have wonderful night.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Fortive Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Lisa Curran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Curran, you may begin your conference. Lisa Curran : Thank you, Ian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. With me today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today\u2019s call. Information required by SEC Regulation G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.fortive.com, under the heading Financial Information. A replay of the webcast will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call until Friday, February 23, 2018. Instructions rather for accessing this replay are included in our fourth quarter 2017 earnings press release. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. All references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The tax reform among other things reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transaction tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2017 we have not completed the accounting for the tax effects of tax reform. However pursuant to the guidance by the SEC, we have made a reasonable estimate as the effect of tax reform on our financial results for the period ended December 31, 2017. These estimated amounts are provisional and are subject to adjustment. In addition, certain of our historical non-GAAP financial measures for 2017 including adjusted EPS and free cash flow conversion ratio excludes the estimated provisional impact of the tax reform. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. The fourth quarter closed out a defining year with continued outperformance and strong execution by our team and positions us well for long-term success. The Fortive Business System continued to enhance our competitive advantage driving market share gains, strong core margin expansion, and robust free cash flow generation. 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $2.89 grew 15% driven by 4.5% core revenue growth and 110 basis points of core operating margin expansion or 55 points excluding the benefit from lower amortization. As a reminder, in early 2017 we outlined our strategic prior and I'm pleased to report that we have met or exceeded all of them. In addition to delivering double-digit earnings growth, accelerated core growth we delivered free cash flow conversion of 107% for the year. We launched game-changing technologies across the company including the Tektronix 5 Series mixed-signal oscilloscope and the Fluke T6 non-contact voltage electrical tester. We made important strides advancing Fluke and Salix, Gilbarco Veeder-Root Insite360 and telematics digital strategies. We grew market share at many of our businesses including Fluke, IFC, Tektronix, Qualitrol, Setra, Kollmorgen and Gilbarco Veeder-Root. We increased high-growth market sales as a percentage of total revenue by 150 basis points and delivered strong double-digit growth in the year. Lastly, we deployed $1.6 billion towards strategic acquisitions and we made successful strides towards enhancing our portfolio to having more recurring revenue, less cyclicality and higher exposure to quality end market and secular growth drivers. These important outcomes demonstrate that we're realizing our vision at Fortive as a diversified industrial growth company and that we remain focused on building a better stronger Fortive aligned with our portfolio goals. The Fortive formula is clearly delivering differentiated performance and we are well positioned to continue to post strong results in 2018 and beyond. With that as a backdrop, let's turn to the details of the fourth quarter. Our adjusted net earnings of $288.6 million were up 21% over the prior year representing the fourth consecutive quarter digit earnings growth. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.82 which excludes among other item of $70.3 million net after tax gain reflecting the effects of tax reform. Effective tax rate in the quarter was 21%. Sales grew 11% to $1.8 billion including a core revenue increase of 3%. The contribution from acquisitions substantially accelerated to 590 basis points of growth reflecting the success of our capital deployment and positions us well for future organic growth. These strong results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio, industry leading technology, continued performance and high growth markets and further growth acceleration in industrial and markets in North America. The breadth of growth across the portfolio was very strong with two-thirds of our operating companies growing mid single digits or better. Geographically high growth markets core revenue grew mid single digits with continued strength across Asia and growth in Latin America. Double digit growth in China was led by business wins at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Kollmorgen, Fluke and sensing technologies. Developed markets core revenue grew low single digits driven by Western Europe and improved performance in North America led by high single digit growth at Tektronix and Fluke reflecting new product innovations, strong commercial execution through the Fortive business system and an improved industrial economy. We posted a record gross margin of 50.4%, an increase of 140 basis points over last year, as we applied FBS fundamentals, drove strong PBV and price performance. Five out of our six strategic platforms delivered positive pricing for a net contribution of 70 basis points. Operating profit margin was 19.7% in the quarter with core operating margin expansion of 50 basis points. During the fourth quarter, we generated a record $450 million of free cash flow and delivered a seasonally strong conversion ratio of 156%. Turning to our segments, professional instrumentation posted sales growth of 17.5% with core revenue growth of 5.6%. Acquisitions contributed 960 basis points and favorable currency 230 basis points, core operating margin expanded 120 basis points with reported operating margin of 21.5%. Advanced instrumentation and solutions core revenue increased mid-single digits during the quarter lead by market share gains at Fluke and Tektronix. Field Solutions core revenue was up mid single digits with similar growth in both developed and high growth markets and led by high single digit growth at Fluke. Fluke's high single digit core growth reflected continued high growth market performance and accelerated growth in developed markets. Core growth was broad based across businesses driven by market share gains and new technology penetration. Fluke launched last quarter of the T6 family of Electrical Testers with field sense technology that substantially exceeded our expectations and continues to be recognized with several industry awards, including top honors at the International Air Conditioning Heating Refrigerating Exposition 2018 Innovation Awards. The T6 testers are the first tool to eliminate the need to make contact with electrical conductors which reduces the potential for earth clash and significantly increases electrician safety. Our growth investments and capital deployed into executing the Field Solution strategy has accelerated our connected devices initiatives and technology leadership and enabled us to enter targeted adjacent markets like healthcare. On that note, I am very pleased with the early integration process with Landauer as we leverage their channel to market and expand our health solutions footprint. Going forward we will refer to the combination of foot biomedical and Landauer as Fluke health solutions. IFC delivered double digit in the first full quarter within the field solutions portfolio. This performance was driven by strong iNet growth, channel expansion and high growth markets and multiple new product introductions including the radius hazardous gas area monitor. Radius can detect up to 7 gases at the largest display of any area monitor on the market and utilizes dual sense technology to increase worker safety by using two sensors to detect the same gas. Cultural core growth declining low single digits as double digit growth in North America was more than offset by declines in Europe and the Middle East and prior year project timing in China. As we shared with you last quarter, challenges in the Middle East continued to delay budget approvals also impacting Europe OEMs. We expect this softness in the Middle East to continue into the first quarter of 2018 which should be more than offset by strong backlog. Moving to product realization, platform core revenues were up mid single digits for the quarter, led by growth of Tektronix. Tektronix\u2019s high single digit core revenue growth was led by double digit growth and oscilloscopes primarily driven by Tektronix 4 Series, MSO penetration and multiple business wins and target segments including the data center in [indiscernible]. Sales performance of the Tektronix 5 Series mixed signal oscilloscope has continue to exceed our expectations and win multiple industry awards including product of the year by Electronics Product Magazine. We also won several million dollar video order - several million order with a like TV streaming service provider to support expansion of OTT or Over-The-Top television services across North America. And as we announced earlier today, we are excited for another consecutive Olympics where we were selected by NBC Olympics to provide audio and video casting quality monitoring for the production of the Olympic Winter Games.  Our Sensing technology platform delivered high single digit core revenue growth in the quarter led by share gains and target vertical and double digit growth and high growth markets. Stature continues to innovate and expand product offerings with particle counting and humidity. Bundling these new modalities with our flex and legacy pressure products positions us well in critical care environments. We're also pleased with Anderson-Negele's large project wins in Pharma and Pet foods as we target other growth verticals outside of their core dairy market. Moving to our industrial technology segment, revenue grew 5.6% with core revenue growth of 0.9% and sales from acquisitions contributing 270 basis points. Reported operating margin of 20.3% includes core operating margin expansion of 10 basis points. A transportation technology platform core revenue declined low single digits in the quarter, reflecting mid-single digit growth at Telematics offset by mid single digit decline in Gilbarco Veeder-Root. At Gilbarco Veeder-Root, EMV continues to play out as we expected, as dispenser revenue declined reflecting a pause in the FB upgrades due to the delay in the liability shift to 2020. It's worth noting that the fourth quarter last year was the highest quarter for dispenser growth in company history. High growth markets core revenue grew low single digits led by double digit growth in China, reflecting continued demand at Veeder-Root for submersible pumps and automatic tank gauges related to double wall tank upgrades. Partially offset by tender timing in India. During the quarter we won a 400 site point of sale bid with Matco, one of the largest independent chains in North America and overall point of sale core revenue growth improve sequentially reflecting share gains. We're also encouraged by expectations of customer CapEx investment solidifying in the second half of 2018. Telematics posted core revenue growth of mid single digits led by strong SaaS sales growth continued increased installed base and improved performance in North America. The results are driven by the continued success of our new director platform utilizing FBS growth tools and digital marketing. We improved our mobile lead generation conversion rate by greater than 80% and reduced our ELD campaign cost per click by greater than 30%. Sales growth also benefited from the strong adoption of electronic logging devices coinciding with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration mandate that went into effect December 18. While enforcement of the mandate doesn't go into full effect until April 1, and compliance requirements are still evolving, we continue to expect the see ELD as an opportunity to gain share and enter 2018 at a high single digit growth rate. Automation and specialty grew core sales high single digits driven by continued double digit growth and high growth markets in robotic. Jacobs Vehicle Systems delivered mid teens core revenue growth driven by increased Class A truck production in the U.S. Kollmorgen posted high single digit core growth reflecting strong demand in its industrial automation product line which was driven by continued robotic strength in Europe and China. I'm excited to report that the recent launch of Kollmorgen latest mobile robotic system software, NCA 3.0 is driving strong double digit sales. This technology lowers labor costs and increased productivity through vehicle automation used primarily in warehousing. Thompson delivered mid single digit core revenue growth, led by double digit growth in China in Western Europe and industrial linear actuary sales. Franchise distribution core revenue grew low single digits, Matco core sales were flat as double digit growth and diagnostics was offset by continued softness in tool storage and a challenging hard line tool sales comparison. We see encouraging signs with improving distributor inventory levels and headcount. Before turning to guidance, let me extend my personal thanks and gratitude to our Fortive colleagues around the world for their commitment to continuous improvement and living our shared purpose of delivering essential technology for the people who accelerate progress. It is our people who make Fortive and create our enduring culture that will continue to be the foundation of our success. It\u2019s our extraordinary teams that give us the confidence in our ability to build a great industrial growth company. We are pleased with the meaningful progress we\u2019ve made in the last year advancing a number of our strategies around building a growth company from an organic and inorganic perspective. The M&A flywheel you heard me talk about many times, we're beginning to show itself with strong revenue growth and increased earnings. We remain focused on building a better stronger Fortive by utilizing our strong balance sheet to continue to execute our portfolio enhancement strategy. With that said, we are raising our capital deployment today by announcing $5 billion of available acquisition capacity. As always it hard to predict the exact timing of deployment and resulting portfolio changes but I have more confidence today than ever that we\u2019re on a path for substantial smart capital allocation. We're initiating our full year 2018 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance range of $3.35 to $3.45 which includes our core revenue growth expectation of 3% to 4% and an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 20%. We anticipate core margin expansion of 50 basis points for the year and cash flow conversion of approximately 110%. We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.72 to $0.76 which includes assumptions of low single digit core revenue growth and an estimated effective tax rate of 20%. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Lisa. Lisa Curran : Ian, we're ready now for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : So just on kind of the way that first half should trend in transportation tech, can you just give us a little bit of an update on how you expect that will come through? Jim Lico : As we said in the prepared remarks the fourth came in around - how we\u2019ve been predicting it. We see the first quarter of 2018 similar to the fourth quarter. So we think that will play out and then as we progressively get through the year we\u2019ll continue to improve. We would expect growth in the second half. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks we think CapEx will start to solidify at that point. I think we feel good about that right now and we\u2019ll see where things go as obviously as the year plays out. Steve Tusa : And I guess you guys said $5 billion in acquisition kick capacity. Can you - is that something you can like to do immediately or is that just a commentary around what you feel like you have over the next three years? Chuck McLaughlin : Steve that\u2019s probably a max capacity if we want to do everything this year. Obviously there\u2019re several assumptions built into that and you know that still with the assumption that we have a strong commitment to keep investment grade. So we just want to frame where we\u2019re at and what we felt we could do. Steve Tusa : And then just lastly an update on the again sorry I didn\u2019t hear this in prepared remarks, an update on kind of the outlook for your business its related to semi CapEx, any signs of weakness there? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes, well I think the price of most exposure that would be tech and particularly strong, a strong year - that really affect their China business the most. And we quite see a little bit of slowdown after three years of double-digit growth. We probably see a high single-digit like growth and China for them next year, but we still think 2018 will be a good year for tax relative to the exposure they have in semi which again is mostly in China. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : I just want to clarify couple of things, when you said price was up 70 bps, was that net of cost or just that price of 70 and then your costs were up something comparable or how do you reconcile that? Jim Lico : So 70 I would say we have very minimal inflation so we look at price cost pretty closely in every business and we're really are not seeing much inflation here. We've been able to mitigate almost all of it. So it might be a couple of points off that Scott I\u2019m not exactly sure what the number would be but it\u2019s minimal compared to 70 that we got. Scott Davis : And how do you guys think about this EMV getting pushed out to 2020 I mean but we also have full 100% depreciation if guys spend the money now. Is there any chance if this stuff ends up getting pulled forward just because you guys can spend money now and our cash rich et cetera or does not matters as much in that market? Jim Lico : The tax rate does help a lot in that industry. So I suspect that as individual businesses start to think about what their tax rate will be and the opportunities available to them. I think that will - we really haven't heard that yet in customer conversations but I suspect that still a conversation we had. I don't think it will be a massive pull forward, but I suspect what it does do and why we said it is that it will solidify the second half of 2018. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : The question goes to $5 billion in capacity, how do you guys think about your cost of capital in this environment where there are concerns about inflation. How do you think about what is your cost of capital in this environment and how will you adjust it over the year if we get inflation always going up. Jim Lico : Well Andrew the way we look at as we think about returns first and we liked it - we always talked about getting for bolt-ons 10% return on capital, return on invested capital and maybe taking five years for maybe a little bigger deployment. As far as the cost of capital the cost of debts going up, it doesn\u2019t really change ever still in that 8 range of cost of capital. We didn\u2019t change hurdle rates as interest rates went down and we\u2019re not really going to look in many different ways they go up. Andrew Obin : And just a follow up on China, you touched on semiconductor equipment. Can you also talk about the truck market in China particularly if it relates to Jacobs because I think that's the key growth component there as well? Jim Lico : I think it will be a little slow - it will certainly be slower in 2018 than it was in 2017 we had just a bang up year in 2017 for JVS. So it will slow a little bit for the business itself it will start to get made up by the U.S. so net-net it will still continue to be a good year for Jacobs. But yes China will slow a little bit for them. They\u2019ll also grow in China in 2018 but they won't have the really high double-digit growth that they've had it will mute a little bit. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Dean Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Dean Dray : Maybe start with Chuck. Where there any surprises in the tax reform application, Lisa made that emphasis that this was provisional. Was there anything unique to Fortive that you would highlight? Chuck McLaughlin : No, we have the option the SEC gave us an unprecedented option to build or make it provisional and with the sheer complexity and volume of this it's just good sense to put up a provisional estimate. Having said that, we've done extensive work and we think we\u2019ve got very good number - a number her but by putting up a provisional it keeps means that we could make minor adjustments. Dean Dray : And then just on tax reform as the potential second derivative changes. Do you have any sense that companies will be willing to divest non-core businesses now that tax leakage is less and so potential acquisitions for Fortive, but also within your own portfolio? Jim Lico : I think certainly that would be speculation because it's pretty early obviously as people start to start to think through these things Dean. I would say that on balance, generally divestitures whether it's us or someone else tend to always be related to more strategic \u2013 decisions. Certainly, with the tax rate being lower, it does make the financials look a little bit better. So I suspect on balance as we go through the year, we'll see others do that. And that will probably provide some additional opportunities. I think for us though \u2013 it's really about strategy, it's about our ability to grow the business long-term and what we can do with it. And those are really the real reasons for doing things, it\u2019s not because we could get a little bit more money on the sale. It's really about what's the long-term potential for success in the business over time. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Steve Winoker from UBS. Steve Winoker : Could you maybe breakout that 3% to 4% core growth a bit across the businesses in terms of not just cadence, you talked that a little bit but between PI and IT, a little more detail? Jim Lico : I think you'll see PI in the mid-single digit range you\u2019ll probably see IT in the low single-digit range. As far as the quarter, that'll probably even out more as we get longer through the year as Gilbarco turns to growth in the back half of year. But I just thought we\u2019ll see a little bit better growth out of PI. As we've said in the prepared remarks in the quarter, Fluke did very well and maybe more broadly but the industrial macro economy in North America has improved. We've seen better point-of-sale in a number of our businesses that are more industrial related like Fluke and our sensors businesses and some of our automation businesses. So I suspect we'll see that certainly in the first part of the year which \u2013 we have a little bit of visibility to. So that gives you some sense. And as far as geographically, we think North America will be pretty good. If we take ex-Gilbarco and all the businesses in North America will be pretty good . And as I mentioned, we still think China is going to be good. It may not necessarily tip the double-digit range every quarter this year, but we think China will continue to be good. We think India will be good for the year. Latin America has done a nice improvement here over the last couple of quarters. And while it's a really small base, we think that might be. So I gave you a geography view too, but maybe too much information, but hopefully it gives some perspective how \u2013 we think the year will play out at least kind of early days. Steve Winoker : Jim, never too much information for us, that's great. And by the way, on that seasonality Q4 to Q1, if I \u2013 back out kind of the tax impact in Q4 and Q1, it does seem like a little bit less of a drop than we've seen in some prior years. Is that how you guys are thinking about it too, or are you looking for about the same? Jim Lico : You're talking about the VCM? Steve Winoker : Yes. Jim Lico : A little bit. I think we're looking for it will be a little bit stronger versus Q4 in Q1. That's how we have models as well. Steve Winoker : And then just lastly Jim as I'm staring at this $5 billion available M&A capacity, and I'm also thinking about the EMV air pocket that you're talking about and the kind of longer term, retail fueling opportunity and challenge. Is your thought that that M&A flywheel might mean like, and that $6.5 billion company today, that retail fueling if you kind of fast forward through that become moves from less than a quarter the revenue base to something significantly lower? Jim Lico : Well, I don't know significant lower I think we've seen good, really good positions in the high growth markets. And so \u2013 a lot of talk about EVs we're seeing some of the largest tenders in the history of the company in places like India and other parts of Southeast Asia. So we're still seeing a lot of high growth market tender activity despite the conversations around electric vehicle. So I think high-growth market will be a bigger part of Gilbarco Veeder Root. Over time, I think the transportation technologies will continue to look for and take advantage of opportunities that exist in the secular growth drivers that are beyond just retail fueling, like telematics, like smart cities and smart transportation, lot of money going into logistics and supply chain and warehousing. We're certainly taking advantage of some of those kind of trend at telematics. So I think as a business is a platform, there will be changes going on \u2013 and I suspect we'll continue to look at opportunities to take advantages of some of those longer-term drivers as well. And so I feel really good about the platform in general. North America might be a little bit less in a pure dispenser perspective, but payment challenges will still be out there. I'm sure we're not going to get rid of credit card fraud anytime soon. Point-of-sale opportunities, those are still going to exist. So when you look around the portfolio, I think the revenue will probably change by product line and geography, but ultimately we still think there's opportunities there. And more broadly, as we look at EV and AV for the company, we think there's as many opportunities for the company as anything. So with the changes that are required for the grid, for all the challenges of putting some \u2013 that sort of high power into opportunities for fast charging, those are going to provide opportunities for Fluke and Qualitrol and a number of our other businesses as well. So on balance, we see more opportunities and threat both with the combination of EV and AV and EMV trends that are going on in the market. Operator : And our next question is from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank. John Inch : Were there any gains in this quarter? I'm trying to bridge the $0.82 versus the way we had modeled it, and not quite getting there. I'm just curious were there any kind of gains in the quarter to any degree? Jim Lico : None in the adjusted earnings, you're talking about one-time gains? John Inch : Yes I don't know if you had a business sale or anything like that that might be\u2026 Jim Lico : In the GAAP numbers, yeah, we've had on the interest. And other line, there's a $8 million gain on the sale of the building related to the Cons unit that was part of the NetScout sale if you go back again in time. So that's in there, but not in the adjusted numbers. John Inch : It's not in the adjusted, okay. I'll pick it up offline. The PI core margins look pretty good, right the 120. The 10 basis points on the industrial technologies pressed a little wide, even though you did a percent of core growth. Was there anything else going on in that segment with respect to perhaps mix or something else? And where do you sort of see those VCMs trending, I guess, in the IT over the course of 2018? Chuck McLaughlin : So in Q4, IT was lighter than normal, mostly because of the topline. And there's a little bit of timing. You can look back to last year where they had a tough compare. But to your fundamental question about what should we expect with the VCM going forward, 30 to 35 is a good number. If you just back up and look at their whole year, that's right where they're trending and that's what we'd expect going forward. John Inch : For both segments, Chuck? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes. John Inch : Can I ask was there an FX impact on margins that you would call out that's noteworthy specific to say the fourth quarter that maybe run rates in a different cadence over the course of 2018? Chuck McLaughlin : I think, no not really and there was a slight favorable, but it wasn't material I think you'll see in our bridge in the first half of 2018 that we'll see a couple of cents a quarter in Q1 and Q2. And then it tapers off. John Inch : Just lastly, your software as a service, where did we end the year with respect to part of the revenue mix, and where you see it in 2018? Where would you like to end it based on new targets you had presented before? Jim Lico : We've said we'd be in 20 to 25 range which I think is where we were through the year. I think we ended closer to 25 at the end of the year. I would expect that probably ticks up 200 or 300 basis points as we go through the year. John Inch : Organically it ticks up like that? Jim Lico : Yes, well, just because you get the full year fact of all the businesses we bought, plus the growth and things like inside 360 and some of those businesses. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi Group. Andrew Kaplowitz : And so high growth markets have been growing double-digits for you over the last several quarters, but I think you mentioned it\u2019s a bit low to mid single-digit. Some of the issue is, I'm sure, more difficult comparisons going to happen. Good to see China still growing double-digits. But was it just the Middle East that slowed down significantly in Q4? And do you think the high growth markets grow mid-single digits or higher in 2018? Jim Lico : So in the fourth quarter, you're exactly right. The Middle East was probably the big one. India too in the fourth was a little lower too because just some timing, tender timing that happens all the time. And so that we\u2019ll look past that we'll have a good year in India in 2018 that will \u2013 it moves around a little bit by quarter there. But, overall we're confident a good year in 2018. So I think that's where in stand, I think the year will look as I said we\u2019ll slow a little bit in China probably to high single digits but by enlarge I think we\u2019ll continue to see good China, good India, Latin America will be good of a small base. So those - and I think Middle East as we noted in the prepared remarks a little bit at Qualitrol level we\u2019ll move through some of their challenges with some backlog, but - we\u2019ll be still slow in the Middle East I think in the first half. Andrew Kaplowitz : You did mention strong backlog there in Qualitrol, does that help slip that business back to growth in the Middle East as you go in 2018? Jim Lico : Yes, I think by the end of the year it does I\u2019m just thinking right now as they get through the year with some - obviously they are working off projected business that they have line of site too and right now that looks like they would be able to do that and be back to growth by the end of year. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then last year you guys had I think $0.04 to $0.05 of productivity gains in your forecast for 2017 and obviously you don't have that in 2018, you have 30% to 35% of incremental. Is that because you just haven't done discrete restructuring here in 2017 and or could productivity gains actually be upside to your forecast or else equal? Chuck McLaughlin : So no, we definitely continue to expect productivity gains we just didn\u2019t call it out on to the bridge and we kind of lump in to the other with interest and share price its actually it\u2019s a productivity gain it just got - because that was getting too many bars on that graph. Operator : And our next question is from line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Group. Jeff Sprague : Just one question on business related items and then just a couple financial things. Just Jim your optimism or signs of optimism that you\u2019re seeing in Matco in the tool business, can you elaborate a little bit on precisely what you're talking about, is it something in particular going or new products something? Jim Lico : Well I think we saw something in the fourth quarter that led us to believe that things might be starting to get better. I wouldn\u2019t try to highlight that things are going to turn over right in the first quarter anything like that. We start Expo here in a couple days which is our large franchisee event every year. We've got good attendance this year which is good to see, but we still think some of the data points that we typically look at around predicting the business are starting to get a little bit better and will get better into the summer. What we did see in the fourth was we saw some order growth which was good, we saw something strengthening with in terms of our franchisee headcount. So a lot of those forward-looking things are starting to get better. I wouldn't call them really good yet, but we have a little bit more optimism obviously the team is doing a great job executing as I mentioned in the prepared remarks in diagnostics and in places where they have opportunity. They've done a very good job and we think a lot of that effort plus a little bit better market we\u2019ll start to happen as we progress through the year. I think they\u2019ll be in the growth mode probably this quarter, but I think that number will get better through the year. Jeff Sprague : Then I just want to clarify on the acquisition related cost that you disclosed in your bridge, I think it was 11 million in the quarter. Those were running through your segment operating profit numbers as they reported right, more than just pick them out the bottom of the bridge is that correct? Jim Lico : Yes that\u2019s correct. Jeff Sprague : And then finally on tax Chuck I think 20% might be the lowest number I've seen except for the Irish domicile firms that I cover. Are you confident that\u2019s a long-term number, is there something shorter-term that - you burn off say in a year or two and you drift higher or can we think about that as a pretty solid long-term rate? Chuck McLaughlin : We've spent a lot of time it\u2019s likely maybe we\u2019ll run more as there is more pronounces coming up. But we feel very good about the 20%. We don't think that's going to drift higher unless there some change in the code going forward and we're very pleased with the work our tech team has done and there's been some incremental spend to get there. But we\u2019re pretty happy with all the work and I think you can use that going forward. Jeff Sprague : Indeed I'm jealous congrats good luck. Chuck McLaughlin : Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks Jeff. And our hardest working tech team in Fortive in the last 30 days is probably been our tech team, so they do a great job. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Scott Graham : I too have a question similar to Jeff but maybe we'll take it offline if you want on the PI margin and how the transaction costs are being taken out. I'll just say it in brief maybe you can help me out if not after we can talk out offline. The transaction costs have been taken out of the adjusted EPS yet here they are in this margin. Can you kind of walk-through and we shouldn\u2019t then essentially the adjusted margin be shown here as 120 basis points higher or am I misunderstanding? Jim Lico : No, I think if we adjusted the margins for transaction costs out that's correct, but we just adjusted out one place on the EPS, but you\u2019re not wrong about that. Scott Graham : The other question is the dilution from the acquisitions looks like a ton of that was due to the kick up in amortization. Where do we go from here on those acquisitions in terms of kicking out cost to eliminate that margin dilution. And on a go forward basis should we see this type of amortization kick up on future acquisitions? Jim Lico : But I think what we try to focus on is the core segment margins which I had pointed to for just that kind of reason until we get to a year. But that's a multilayered question - I rather when we take it offline and we\u2019ll walk you through each one of those things, but that's the reason we try to focus on the core and give you that on the presentation. Scott Graham : But this is something that did run through the margin on an adjusted basis this quarter, and I guess what I'm saying is on go forward basis, is this something that you're comfortable with this type of hit to margin? Jim Lico : We think that it helps grow earnings per share and so yes we are. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : So maybe just touching on tech for a second the growth rates all year we\u2019re really impressive clearly the products and introductions are working. I guess maybe talk a little bit about the go forward around what you're doing from a product perspective. And then how you guys are thinking about this business from a longer-term growth rate perspective. Jim Lico : So as you said they had a very strong year really a number of things that they have done exceptionally well from an execution standpoint. I think we highlighted last year we had a large order from a large mobile phone manufacturer in the first part of the year that helped and in the second half of the year we really did - a really strong, really great job with the new product introduction of the 5 Series that we talked about in the prepared remarks. That 5 Series is the first generation of a new platform of product that will continue to come out in a series of things over the next several years. So not only will the product itself have some runway in the next year, but the platform itself will also deliver some runway. We've always said that tech is somewhere in the low single-digit grower over a long period of time and during when things are a little bit better they\u2019ll popup above that that\u2019s around a little bit better than market growth they tend to perform better than market growth. So that's how we think about it and what we\u2019ve been trying to do with the business is continue to build less cyclicality out of it with extending our service business which is a pretty substitute part of Tektronix now. So those are things we\u2019re doing long-term to not only solidify the growth rate but also make it less cyclical and the number of our actions have been working and you saw that cloud in 2017 and you\u2019ll see that cloud in 2018. Joe Ritchie : And maybe my follow on here just touching base, you had some pretty positive comments on IFC, I think I heard growing double digits. Just can you give us a little bit more of an update on Landauer I think you said integration was going well but just curious to see how that that business is growing? Jim Lico : So we had just maybe a little bit we were with the ISC team last week, we\u2019re really impressed with the work that they've done to take the Fortive business system and really do a lot with it. They were already had a pretty strong continuous improvement culture and have really done a great job with it. Landauer a little bit later into the process because obviously we closed and then after the IFC deal, we\u2019ll see them in about a month and have an opportunity to see their progress. We did a short review with the team here last week and really, really happy with the progress they have made on a number of action that they need to get after. I mentioned in the prepared remarks about we\u2019re using their channel now. We've rebranded the entirety of the portfolio Fluke health solutions. And we've been seeing some real good synergy on the revenue side. So we feel good early days - it's still very early days but it\u2019s good to be in a good place in the early days then in alternative to that. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Brian Drab : So I was just - as I'm listening here and thinking about the comments that you made on the 5 billion. Are you - I was looking back at the notes that I have the most recent comments that you made were 5 billion to 7 billion through 2021 I think. And I'm just wondering if you\u2019re warming us up to the idea of - larger acquisitions coming sooner versus more of a bolt-ons with the potential for a large one. There is obviously a lot of M&A activity expected post clarity on the tax policy so that just what I'm thinking, are you warming us up to the idea of maybe a larger acquisition here in the near-term? Jim Lico : Well Brian I think we've always tried to clear about two things. One is that we would look for strategic opportunities to accelerate our businesses. And two we try to give you sense of what our spending capacity could be at a point in time. Sometimes we give you a longer cycle that, I think what we'll try to do this time is to be really transparent about the opportunities we have in front of us. I'm not trying to telegraph anything. The funnel we have today is very good, the breadth of the funnel and the strength of the funnel meaning good businesses, the breadth of the funnel meaning across platforms and geographies. So we feel good that there's opportunity to deploy that. We never know how to predict those things, but we feel good about it and we didn't want it - we're really not trying to warm anybody up but rather just be very transparent and give you real sense of what kind of opportunities we could take advantage of should they avail themselves to us. Brian Drab : And I just have one follow up and by one I don\u2019t mean four, is there anything in the pipeline that is larger than say 2 billion or 3 billion? Jim Lico : Well I think it\u2019s hard to call anything - there are lot of things in the pipeline from a variety of sizes even some things we probably couldn\u2019t do today but would love to do down the road. So I think that\u2019s the way we think about it and that\u2019s why the breadth of the things are the things we could do today and things we can do tomorrow. I think our success has always been about making sure that we don't just have an eye on the thing - on the next bank book to drop but rather have a real strategic vision of what we can do and cultivate the funnel that way. And so there is a great breadth of opportunity for us and hopefully with the work we do we\u2019ll make some of those reality over time. Operator : And at this time, I\u2019m showing that we have no further questions. Presenters, I turn it back to you. Jim Lico : Thanks everybody. As I said in the prepared remarks, we're really proud of the year we had. We really wanted to thank our employees around the world but we also want to thank all of you who spent the time with us, who really allowed us to give you a sense of our vision for the company and for the strength of the feedback you've given us. We\u2019re incredibly proud of 2017, but even more excited about 2018. So we'll look forward seeing you all soon in a number of conferences and things like that. Lisa and the team are around for questions and follow-up and we\u2019ll see you real soon. Have a great night. Thank you.

Before we move to Jim's prepared remarks, I'd like to take this opportunity to announce that Fortive will host its 2018 Investor Day on June 12 at Industrial Scientific in Pittsburgh. Today we'll focus on Field Solutions operating companies and also provide you further insight into our newly acquired Landauer and IFC businesses. Additionally, we'll make available Field Solutions technology demonstrations and ensure of IFC operations. Further details on registration information can be found in our investor website under Events and Presentations. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased by our strong start to 2018. The strength of our portfolio and focused execution by our teams using the Fortive Business System drove double-digit growth in both earnings and revenue, as well as strong expansion in the gross margins and core operating margin. We have continued to enhance our competitive position and drive growth allowing us to make high impact investments and product innovation in sales marketing. As a result four of our six strategic platforms, Field Solutions, Product Realization, Sensing technologies and Automation and Specialty grew core revenue at mid-single digit rate or better in the quarter. We were also encouraged by the progress of our recent acquisitions including eMaint, Orpak, Industrial Scientific and Landauer, collectively these businesses are growing sales at a double-digit rate. FBS and our integration process have had a meaningful impact on our ability to instill our culture of continuous improvement and deliver on synergy commitment. With that, I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings of $277.5 million were up 32.5% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.78, based on an adjusted effective tax rate of 17.9% for the quarter. Sales grew 13.4% to $1.7 billion, reflecting the core revenue increase of 2.6% as five of our six platforms posted core growth. The success of our recently acquired businesses boosted our performance and contributed 730 basis points to topline growth demonstrating the strength of our capital allocation model. Geographically high growth markets core revenue grew mid-single digits with continued strength in Asia and good growth in Latin America. High single digit growth in China was led by Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Fluke and Sensing Technologies. Developed markets core revenue grew low single digits, reflecting continued strength in Western Europe and North America. Core revenue growth in North America was mid-single digit excluding Gilbarco Veeder-Root and was driven by strong performance at Fluke, Tektronix, Qualitrol, Jacobs Vehicle Systems and across the automation businesses. We delivered strong gross margin of 50% reflecting 150 basis points of expansion over the prior year with five out of our six platforms expanding gross margin. FBS continues to drive strong PBV and productivity. Through the vitality of our brands and product innovation all six platforms delivered positive price for a net contribution of 70 basis points. Operating profit margin was 19.4% with core operating margin expansion of 100 basis points driven by professional instrumentation volume and favorable fall-through. We believe our strong margin expansion in this inflationary environment reflects the strength of our portfolio, leading technology and the power of FBS. During the first quarter, we generated $140 million of free cash flow, an increase of 15% and delivered a conversion ratio of 54%. For the full year we continue to expect that our free cash flow ratio will be approximately 110%. Turning to our segments. Professional instrumentation posted sales growth of 21.7% including core revenue growth of 5.5%. Acquisitions contributed 12.2% and favorable currency up 4%. Reported operating margin of 23.7% reflecting core margin expansion of 310 basis points, partially offset by a 150 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions. Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue increased mid-single digits during the quarter with growth led by continued market share gains at Fluke and Tektronix. Field Solutions core revenue grew high single digits in the quarter, reflecting strong growth across all regions, led by high single digit growth in China and the United States. Fluid delivered high single digit core growth and posted the seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. Growth was broad based around the world and across product lines, including high single digit growth at Fluke Industrial, as well as strong growth at Fluke Networks. I'm confident in our trajectory given leading indicators to sustain growth at Fluke, including accelerating point of sale data and increasing demand for new products such as the T6 family of Electrical Testers with field sense technology. We are seeing continued strong double-digit core revenue growth from eMaint and while early we are pleased with Landauer performance as well. It is a great addition to Fluke Health Solutions where FBS is driving go-to-market synergies ahead of plan and strong operating margin expansion. Industrial Scientific delivered high single digit revenue growth driven by strong double-digit growth in the iNet business and high growth markets. The radius gas area monitor launch that I referenced last quarter is performing ahead of plan and we received several key orders for iNet now and Safety Net Solutions. iNet Now live monitoring software provides real time text and e-mail alerts for gas hazards, panic and maintenance-down situations, allowing customers to see and respond to incidents as they happen. I'm very pleased with ISCs performance and integration success today, which includes the March announcement to expand ISCs Rentals business to include a range of Fluke instruments available for weekly and monthly rentals. Qualitrol core sales decline low single digits, as double-digit growth in North America was more than offset by declines in Europe and the Middle East. We expect this softness in the Middle East to continue through the year. Helping to offset Middle East market conditions or share gains in the Americas and Asia Pacific and new product launches. For example the new Transformer Bushing Monitoring System provides additional functionality to help electric utility save millions by avoiding power transformer loss and unplanned outages. As Lisa mentioned, we're excited to showcase our Field Solutions businesses and leaders at IFC this June. We look forward to seeing you in Pittsburgh. Moving back to the quarter and product realization. The platform core revenues grew mid-single digits for the quarter led by mid-single digit growth at Tektronix. Growth at Tektronix was led by mid-single digit growth in developed markets and double-digit growth in oscilloscopes, driven by continued penetration of the Tektronix 5 Series, MSO and Wideband Solutions. As a reminder, we will lap the launch of the Tek 5 series next quarter in addition to the large 3D sensing when we highlighted in second quarter 2017. While we expect core revenue growth will moderate in the second quarter, we believe this is more of a comparison issue, as overall business conditions remain positive and several new product introductions, including our new arbitrary waveform generator, AWG5200 continue to drive increased customer demand and market share gains. Lastly, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the tech [ph] team for achieving important milestone as they sold their 1 million value oscilloscope, further demonstrating our enduring market leadership. While PacSci EMC core growth was down low single digits for the quarter. Historically high levels of backlog support our expectation of mid to high single digit growth for the year. We're excited about PacSci's maps or Modular Architecture Propulsion System Technology, which is resonating well with customers in New Space Applications. Our sensing technologies platform delivered high single digit core revenue growth in the quarter led by strong double-digit growth in high growth markets and et cetera, as well its high single digit growth at Gems Sensors. Developed markets grew low single digits, as strength in Europe was partially offset by headwinds from prior year large NAVC [ph] orders in North America. We continue to realize market share gains and target vertical, including critical care environment and launched two new products focused on the non-dairy food and beverage market. Moving to our Industrial Technology segment, revenue grew [Technical Difficulty] core revenue performance, acquisition's contributed 300 basis points of growth and currency 310 basis points, reported operating margin of 18.2%, including core operating margin expansion of 20 basis points. Our Transportation Technologies platform core revenue declined high single digits, as double-digit growth in Teletrac Navman, our telematics business and GPT was more than offset by low double digit decline and Gilbarco Veeder-Root. EMV continues to play out at Gilbarco Veeder-Root as we expected for the first half, while shipment timing for some large dispenser orders shifted out for the second quarter. Strong double-digit core growth in China was led by continued demand at Veeder-Root for submersible pumps automatic tank hinges related to double wall tank upgrades. GVR channel energies are driving substantial high growth market performance at Orpak and in addition to several automation tenders that Orpak won in India GVR secured several large European multiyear orders and signed a master agreement with a major African retailer for Payment Systems. I'm also pleased to announce today our competitive win with Chevron where we are partnering to offer an exclusive program to Chevron and Texaco retailers to drive EMV compliance. These core business wins improved bookings in high growth market automation success give us confidence in our expectation for GVR to grow core revenue mid-single digits next quarter and for the remainder of the year. Teletrac Navman delivered a low double-digit core growth, led by double-digit fast sales growth in Australia, New Zealand and Mexico and continued installed base growth globally. Our director platform is the first and only product to achieve FedRAMP Ready Status from the Federal Risk and Authorization program. Despite this milestone, the industry continues to struggle with integration and support issues associated with the electronic logging devices mandate in the United States. We believe this could present cost to ensure headwinds into the next quarter or two, as the mandate takes hold. Automation and Specialty posted low double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter, driven by strong automation growth in Europe and Jacobs Vehicle Systems growth in North America. JVS delivered mid-teens core revenue growth, driven by increased Class A truck production in the United States. Kollmorgen posted double-digit core revenue growth reflecting strong demand in its industrial automation product line, which was driven by continued robotic strength in Europe and China. Kollmorgen received its first order in China for our new platform servo motor product, AKM2G for use in a packaging and bottling application. AKM2G allows customers to decrease the size, footprint and complexity of the machine, while still getting the power and performance they need in up to 20% less space Thomson delivered moderated core revenue growth, led by mid-single digit growth in North America, reflecting strong distribution in point of sale growth. The NF business combination with ultra as previously announced in March is advancing according to plan and we continue to expect closing by the end of the year. Moving to franchise distribution. The platform grew core revenue slightly. Matco core sales were flattish, as double-digit growth and hard line tool and market share gains were offset by continued softness in tool storage. Distributor sentiment coming out of our annual Expo is positive. We recorded our second highest order results in Expo history and we continue - and we expect to continue to outperform the market. To wrap up. We had a strong start to the year with double-digit sales and adjusted earnings growth and outsized growth and operating margin expansion. The team's strong execution using the Fortive business system continue to drive relative outperformance and enhance our competitive position. We're confident that our substantial M&A capacity coupled with our focus on enhancing our portfolio and pursuing high impact growth opportunities will help us continue to build a better stronger Fortive in 2018 and the years to come. At this point, I thought it would be helpful to provide you additional transparency surrounding the recently announced tariffs. With respect to Section 232 given the small amount we import, we expect the growth impact would be less than $1 million and is reflected in our guide. We expect additional impact from the second and third tiers of our supply chain and we are actively mitigating this risk. Regarding Section 301, our focus has been to frame the exposure and stay close to suppliers and customers to understand the impact. We will continue to monitor this dynamic situation between the U.S. and China. As the situation plays out, the strength of our brand combined with the Fortive business system gives us the tool to identify appropriate countermeasures. Turning to the guide, we are raising our full year 2018 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $3.40 to $3.50, which includes our expectation of 3% to 4% core revenue growth or mid-single digit core growth for the rest of the year. We anticipate core margin expansion of 50 to 75 basis points and free cash flow conversion of 110% and we are lowering our expected effective tax rate from 20% to a rate of 19% for the year. We are also initiating our second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.86 to $0.90, which includes assumptions on mid-single digit core revenue growth and an effective tax rate of 19%. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Lisa. Lisa Curran : Thank you, Ian. You can open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is line of Steven Winoker from UBS. Steven Winoker : Hey, good morning. Sorry, Good afternoon, actually I should say, I'm used to these morning calls, right. So listen, the first question on that GVR rollout shift to the second quarter. Can you just give us a little more confidence that you know, this isn't something that we're just kind of keep seeing thing and if quarter shifts, what gives you high conviction that you actually going to see this come through in the second quarter? Jim Lico : Yeah. Thanks, Steve. I think first and foremost, this is really kind of the first time we've talked about a shift like this. I think if the quarter played out what really happened was we just saw the order rate move a little bit more to the back end. So our book to bill was actually over one quarter. So we really got some the orders that was just - we really just didn't get them out and we saw that backlog shift in the second quarter. So we feel really confident about what's there. We also implemented ERP system conversion at Gilbarco, we wanted to do that given we see the rest of the year so strong, that we did that in January as well. I mean, we have a little - a few shipping days in January. And so the combination of those two things really puts a few things into the second quarter. So as we said, we'll be mid-single digits in the second quarter and we're confident about that. And as we get into the rest of the year, I think the combination of our customer conversations, as well some of the things we've actually seen, like as we mentioned in a number of the positive things we mentioned in the prepared remarks, give a strong confidence in Gilbarco for the rest of the year. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then you talk about 50 to 70 basis points of core operating margin expansion for the year. You did 100 basis points in the quarter of core. So how should we think about sort of what's driving the pressures in the rest of the year? Chuck McLaughlin : Steve, this is Chuck. And so the pressures in the rest of the year, we normally were looking for 50 basis points in a normal quarter. So Q1 was strong. No doubt we're really happy with that and a lot of broad based delivery through with FBS. In our pricing, I think we had 70 basis points there. A good material cost savings. And we also had favorable mix. We could see it come back a little bit as IT starts growing a little faster, but 70 - anything over 50 is a really good number for us and we're really happy with that. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good evening or afternoon\u2026 Jim Lico : Good evening. Steve Tusa : On Tektronix, what are you guys seeing out of kind of the technology channel there, I guess both in Tektronix, as well as on the robotic side promotion, you know, there is - obviously that part of the world that's has been growing really fast. So just curious as to what your outlook is there for the next several quarters? Jim Lico : Yeah, relative to Tek, we're certainly seeing strong - we saw a good quarter impact. I think we are mid-single digit in China where we probably have a little bit more of electronic exposure, so off a very strong comp from a year ago. So we sort of feel like continued strength there will happen. We're also obviously building that business to be broadened beyond just semiconductor in China for Tek as well, Steven. North America was good for Tek. I think on balance we feel good about how Tek will play out in the year, the number of new product introductions that we discussed in the in the prepared remarks. Relative to Kollmorgen, really are our main robotic exposure is really at Kollmorgen. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks with really strong growth in the quarter and we think we'll see continued strength there. The new product that I referenced in the prepared remarks is really a strong application for robotics and we've got a number of pilots going out around the world with that technology. So we feel good about where we'll be. We'll probably moderate on the core a little bit in the second half at Kollmorgen just because of the comps, but the business will still remain strong for the year. Steve Tusa : So I mean, I'm sure you know, well, you associates can do the math, I am not a math guy, but I'm sure we can all do the math. But maybe just some senses to what the mix is like, what acquisition do you have running today, what growth you're running at. And then obviously you've got this kind of high single digit growth at automation, the automation business you're getting out of, if you kind of net those two out and assume the acquisitions go organic and then that automation business comes out. Are they essentially like - do they add up to kind of the same organic for this year? Jim Lico : I think if you look\u2026 Steve Tusa : The exact question, make any sense what sort of pro forma\u2026 Jim Lico : I think, I know what you're trying to get at. Let me a shot Chuck and clean it up because all the numbers were up 10% [ph]. But I think what we're seeing - first of all we had a very good quarter for organic growth and the acquisitions, obviously we're not in the organic number, but as we look at organically and as we mentioned really good performance that - it's really those acquisitions that we name. There are things like eMaint, [indiscernible] so they are in the Fluke core number now. But as we think about that two principally or the three big ones we did last year Orpak, Landauer or IFC they'll go core through the second half mostly in the fourth quarter really and they'll be helpful to core right now certainly in the - but they're still small. When you look at that relative to - separate question around, what is automation do? If we look through the year, the in or out of automation on our core is about the same. So it really - it's within - really within around Europe [ph] been almost the exact same number. Chuck McLaughlin : I think, that's exactly right. And I think if you look over multiple years, the only thing I would add is the recent acquisitions or probably or more single-digit or the long-term gap, probably is going to be not high, most years probably beat that where we're giving up there. Operator : And our next question is the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good evening. Just a question\u2026 Jim Lico : Hi. Julian Mitchell : Hi. You spoke about the margin sort of mix impact for may be industrial tech rebounding. But I guess, just within Professional Instrumentation and extremely strong core margin performance in the first quarter, was there anything within that sort of onetime or may fade quickly as we go through the balance of the year? Chuck McLaughlin : Julian, this is Chuck. No, nothing unique in Professional Instrumentation. It's got some really higher gross margins in that, and when we pop a strong growth like we did, and you can sometimes see that. Now we'll be evaluating is how much we maybe invest later in the year, but there is nothing anomalous about within the PI - gross margin or operating margin expansion. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thank you. And then, I guess, within franchise distribution, you talked a little bit about Matco and what's going on there. There is been a lot of other industrial companies talking about pre-muted trends around the automotive and so forth. Just wonder if you can give an update on your outlook for Matco? And how you think overall franchise trends the balance of the year? Jim Lico : Yes. It's - I think, we really - we say a good performance from Matco in the quarter. I think, as we look relative to peer company they clearly outperformed the industry. On the backs of really a good expo and things like our tools and diagnostics category. I think those categories, Julian, tools that our customers need right away to do the work they're doing. So I think that speaks to that tool storage, which has been slower. It's typically something that a customer could put off for a quarter or two, if they wanted to. So I think that's what you're seeing. Quite frankly new car sales slowing is actually in the short run tend to be a little bit better because cars being older tend to need more repair. And as most - three quarters of our sales are into car repair shops as opposed to dealers. So most of our sales are not related to the dealer network, they are mostly related to repair shops around the country. So we think - I think, we have said this a few times that as the mechanic hours and dollars start to accumulate with the '08, '09 downturn, we think we'll start to see some improved economics with mechanics in the second half. And we think that tends to correlate pretty well with tool storage. So we think tool storage will start to improve in the second half and hence Matco will start to improve. But we're very focused on - we're really not tied to new car sales in the short run. Now as we mentioned, 10 years from now, new car sales go down then it might have put a little bit dent in the market then, but I think right now for how we see the year, we think Matco continues to strengthen through the year. Operator : And our next question is the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Jim Lico : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : For a couple of questions on Fluke. The first is could you take us through the economics, you said that you are offering Fluke on a rental basis? And what kind of fleet utilization you use that analogy, do you need versus question, does it cannibalize any sales? Jim Lico : Yes. First, yes, Deane, you have a second part there? Deane Dray : I do. And then the second part of the question is just you touched on accelerating point of sale, I'm always interested in the sell-in versus sell-through at Fluke from the channel? Jim Lico : Yes. Got it. So the economics are pretty good. What we found when bought IFC was this rental market, which, quite frankly is pretty unknown to what the Fluke tends to be around facility upgrades, where we're taking down the site for the part of two or three months. And we saw this rental program as an opportunity to really accelerate the use of tools. And what we found is that it really is a new market that very often people are not - they are utilizing the once will they have as opposed to maybe needing two or three tools. So we think for maybe two or three months. So we think the use of the rental program is going to be - is really upside for us. We did a lot of work on cannibalization now just to understand that. And the payback is really within a year. We can basically rate it a little bit less than twice, and it's a pretty good payback. So we feel pretty good about what the economics will look like. Relative to point-of-sale, we saw accelerated POS here over the last several months. It does move around a little bit month-to-month, but we feel good about point-of-sale Fluke in North America. We also saw improved point-of-sale at Thomson, as we mentioned her prepared remarks, as well as Kollmorgen in North America. So those are sort our three well weathers where we get pretty good point-of-sale data, and we look at those three things to see if the trajectory is pretty good. And I think right now that would suggest that things are going to continue to be pretty good. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. And then follow-up question, when you're hitting the 50 basis on gross margin, that was a big threshold for Danaher, and they work towards it and they got there and it was a focus for them to be for M&A that they wanted to be above that. How sustainable is this for Fortive, is it drive much of your M&A focus in terms of the economics or potential targets? Jim Lico : Well, it certainly an important - let me answer the second part first. We always look at gross margin trends and businesses when we acquire, that's an important dynamic in terms of ability to assess market position, pricing power, level of - quality of innovation. So it's always an important metric. Relative to how we think about things, as we think about the kinds of businesses we're looking at that have more recurring revenue [Technical Difficulty] those tend to be higher gross margin. So the financial intention is somewhat, but the more important aspect of it is the strategic intent of trying to accelerate some of these kinds of business models into our portfolio. So that by nature will improve gross margins. I speak to the first question, Dan, 50% gross margin in a quarter that's usually one of our lower gross margin quarters. The Professional Instrumentation gross margin were really good and felt good about industrial technology to be able to grow their gross margins despite flattish sales. So I think when you look throughout the portfolio, we're incredibly proud of the work of our teams did in the quarter around FDS to drive gross margin. That's not only business model innovation, it's also work we do. I think it speaks to our confidence in the year. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, guys. I just a follow-up on two question, I think you mentioned sales have been strong, either you're bucking the trend of some of your peers who had some shorter cycle weakness crop up. I think you mentioned Fluke was up high single-digits, including industrial business is also up high single-digits. Are you just hitting share in your markets there, would you say that there is any difference between maybe your energy focused businesses within versus your industrial businesses? Jim Lico : So I think when we look at our channels, we would probably tend to think that it's hard for us to differentiate pure industrial from maybe what getting some benefit from oil and gas. So I will just maybe speak to the first of all. But if I take Fluke, we're - our core point-of-sale is out as faster than our sale in. So that feels good. I think probably some of it is market share, we're doing a really good job on innovation. So that's certainly part of it, but so I would feel good about it. But we have strong partnerships with a lot of our industrial distributors and having that also will be able to make. Some of this is our market because Fluke has pretty high market share. So some of the things have to do is really to make their market. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. That's helpful. May be related question, several of peers some weakness in Western Europe this quarter, I'm not sure if it's Easter or may be slightly weaker Matco. But it doesn't seem like saw the weakness maybe you can elaborate on that region? And then whether you will see any improvement in the Middle East as prices have begun to respond here? Jim Lico : Yes. I think, maybe, I wanted to just come up POS answer too. We will - while we're seeing really strong POS right now, we will start to get some tougher comp in the second half. So we'll see history strong POS. We expect strong POS in the second half, but probably the numbers might be a little less just because we will be working off good comps in the second half. Relative to Western Europe, we had a good quarter. We got a couple of secular things where they transact some of their business with the Middle East through European OEMs. So that us a little bit. But in places like Fluke and Kollmorgen, number of our bigger businesses, we saw good business in Europe. We continue to say, and I think I joked about this on the call in the year call in January that we continue to think will Europe will and then it ends up being pretty good. And they had to do with, I think, the execution that regard across number of our businesses to really do a good job in our innovation and some of the trends like robotics and things like that are driving the business as well. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Most of the business questions, I think, maybe just one related on tax. Obviously, you guys have spending a lot of resources there. What are your views on entitlement tax rate? Is there more opportunity there? Chuck McLaughlin : Jeff, I do think tax that is part of the business too when we're really happy and proud about the results. But I think that we lowered the tax rate to 19% for the year. Part of it was the Q1 coming in lower as really just option exercises were higher than we had model. And then looking forward, its coming down the rest of the year a little bit as we got a better idea about the mix of our earnings likely to be this year outside of the U.S. and that planning. There is a lot of - I wouldn't say, we have and but I would say that our tax team changes opportunity for them and certainly there has been a lot of change with tax reform. And also then when you put acquisitions on top of that, you can see lot of options for things to do. I wouldn't say that we would - we're entitled to do anything, but we're always looking to see what else we can do here. Jim Lico : Jeff, I would just add. I think, Chuck wouldn't say this, but I think at the end of the day, it's pretty easy to - for people to look at the tax rate improvements we've had in less than two years and say it's kind of Trump Administration, but the reality is our tax team has done an outstanding job at really looking for opportunities. They applied continuous improvement in the same way that we do everywhere else in the company. Jeff Sprague : Should we expect cash taxes to be nearing this GAAP tax rate or plus or minus relative to that? Chuck McLaughlin : We actually now got our tax cash rate under our effective tax rate. So it will for the foreseeable future is going to be less than the 19% we got model Operator : And our next question is from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Richard Eastman : I noticed in the, again, guide kind of picks up the core growth by a point or so for the full year now, are we talking about mid-single digits for the first three or four. Where is the extra point of core growth coming for? Where is your confidence? Is that or... Jim Lico : So first of all, the guide for the year was always three to four, and we always saw in the first quarter being low-single and the rest of the year being mid-single. We really don't seem much as change share. There is a little bit of timing as we talked about Gilbarco going from Q1 to Q2, but really we don't see that as a change. We do see, as we've been talking about and Jim mentioned earlier that Gilbarco will start to - will turn to growth now with in Q2. But in the second half, we've already that as we get closer to that be deadline. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then again the adjusted guide for the full year went up by mid-point? And we're above $0.04 above the midpoint in Q1, I think if the tax rate comes down 19%, that's another nickel perhaps just a little bit curious here. I mean, do we still have a little cushion in there? Or is there some slippage on mix or anything like that? Jim Lico : First of all, we took the guide at the low and high-end of the nickel, and that's $0.04 on the tax rate coming down and another penny there for FX. We really like the fundamentals of the company going forward in mid-single digit growth for the rest of the year is really good, and that's going to drive above or normal 50 basis points of And that's not different. We are aware though that we're sitting in Q1, and there is a lot of the year to play. So we went with in Q1 and then taking up tax in FX. Chuck McLaughlin : I'd just add to that. We're focused on our performance here. And I think what we demonstrated in Q1 is when you look around the portfolio, professional instrumentation is a great example, a very strong performance, we took market share and so the markets better, I think, we will outperform still early days, as Chuck mentioned, but we are focused on outperformance and certainly, it's early. But if the markets continue strong then probably to have upside in some areas, but we're very much focused right now on what we can see. As Chuck mentioned, there's also some risky things there that we want to make sure we can take care of. And the last thing is we want to make sure we continue to invest in the business. It's one thing for us to have a number of good quarters, but as you know, having followed us for a long time, we're very focused on '19, '20, '21 and so we're always going to work making sure that we're investing in the future as well. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Sawyer Rice from Morgan Stanley. Sawyer Rice : Just maybe a question here again most of the question on the quarter and here, but maybe stepping out a bit looking at the M&A channel and pipeline here, you will obviously have some extended capacity for us. Any sense of the multiples you guys are seeing and maybe the size of assets in the pipeline and then maybe I'll just talk my follow-up in here, but any urgency to bring on may be another platform size of acquisition post-Altra? Jim Lico : Yes. I think, first, as we talked for each quarter from M&A is episodic, I think, a year ago, we were talking about that and then within a quarter-or-so, we had number of transactions completed. So we do - we're working hard. We're very busy. There is a number of things that we're obviously very involved in and feel confident in saying that we will get M&A done here in the future. Relative to, I think, there is a little bit of a difference in right now. So probably seen a little bit of shorter maybe this week. Expectations on sellers are being a little higher I think, that's one of the reasons why you haven't seen a lot of M&A done in the last six months amongst a lot of our peer group as well, particularly the big stuff. So I think there is certainly opportunity, but I think expectations may be a little higher. So that's one thing. I think relative to how we think about new platform, two years ago, when we went out and said, probably within five years, we would probably add a new platform. And now, we're two years into it with three years left. So I guess, the probably of doing a new platform is more likely. But we really like the $30 billion of served market than we have within the current portfolio today. You're going to hear on Investor Conference how the things about that with our field solutions platform and the opportunity there as well. I think that's a perfect example of how our platform leaders think about growing their platforms, and we always done that. You see that results in the first quarter where I think field solutions is up over 20% - professional instrumentation is up over 20% and revenue between core and non-core because of the way we've built out those platforms. So you see in that kind of success and you'll hear about that. So we don't necessarily feel obligated to create a new platform, but there are certainly opportunities to improve their portfolio, talked a lot about that and kinds of things we are looking for to add new portfolio. If there is an opportunity to do that, we certainly would - we'd love to do it. Operator : And our next question is from the Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Scott Graham : Just a couple of questions. First in field solutions. The conversion to Accelix, I think, spoke with there were up sort of 60 tools, I guess, that was sort of made last summer, which represented sort of about 5% sort of connectivity tools of the portfolio of the conventional's. Where are you on that number of tools curve and percentage of conversion at this point? Jim Lico : Well, I think, probably was alluding to about 5% of the market is probably has those tools. We probably have a bigger percentage of our portfolio than five. So it's probably a higher range of that. I'm not sure exactly what it is. But if you look at some of the key categories, we've got a number of tools now that are out there. I think the best to say about the quarter is the acceleration of core growth at Fluke is getting a number of those connected tools out. I'm not sure what the exact penetration is or we certainly get back on that, but we're certainly continue to accelerate that. We talked in the prepared remarks about technology and T6 family those are some places where we will have connection as well. So we certainly think that we're continuing to accelerate that. I think as we think about more broadly around we felt really good about the quarter. We mentioned eMaint doing a great job, that's really a core part of our software portfolio. The connected tools and as well as just our overall tool sales have been good to be able to put tools in the hands that they can utilize what they want to do. Our share of business is doing well. The one point maybe a little bit slower is on the condition monitoring aspect of this, and while we think we feel very good about the solution is just taking longer for customers to convert pilots. So we said that for a couple of quarters year and remains to selling cycle we're learning just a little bit longer, but we feel good about where that's at. And we certainly detailed that in a great level - we'll get a greater level of detail of that in our Investor Conference when we focus on field solutions. Scott Graham : Do the rentals help the conversion speed or hinder it? Jim Lico : I don't think, they hinder it, but I don't they really help it. I think the rental program will typically be more of a part-time thing. It won't be a high-volume thing. It's really more a niche of when customers at the end of the day need more tools and have reluctantly bought more than likely they just try to get more out of the tools that they have. And I think it's just an opportunity for us to be more pervasive. It's still early days. I think it will take us a little while now really helps our forward strategy or not. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Brian Drab of William Blair. Brian Drab : Just a couple of questions left here. Business cut - at least as up mid-single digits, excluding the large orders. Can you talk a little bit about how regularly you see large orders in that business? And is the land acquisition, in general, going as expected? And any thoughts on accretion in that business? Jim Lico : Yes. I think typically what we see, Brian, is that that business doesn't have a lot of large orders. It's typically government related, I think, when occasionally and we see that in our current Fluke Biomedical businesses, which really make up the other part of Fluke Health Solutions. Throughout the business, the only time we really see large orders is when a government agency will buy at one end of time. And that happens maybe once every other year or something like that. So that's the frequency of that. We feel really good about the progress we made on the margin side. Chuck and I were with the team earlier in the year for their 100-day strategic plan, and I was just struck by how broadly the organization was telling us, how the business tools are really applying to them as they try to fix a lot of the things that they wanted to fix for a long period of time. So right now, the businesses is a little bit better from a core perspective than we anticipated. That's good to see. We're seeing pretty good fall through there on the margin side. But it's still early. So I think we'll certainly believe strongly that we will continue to do make the business better, but I think it's still early days and it's going to be a good deal for us, and we're confident in the long-term returns here both the short-term and the long-term returns are coming in as planned. Brian Drab : Okay. Great. And then one more quick one on the organic revenue growth, mid-single digits for the balance of the year. Is this comp looks like it's coming in the fourth quarter, can you give us any additional granularity in terms of, which quarters would have slightly better or worse organic revenue growth? Jim Lico : Well, it's pretty fourth quarter - fourth quarter seems like a long way but the reality is probably the end up being one of the better quarters, but we always going to be relative consistency for the next couple of quarters. And obviously, we will see how things play out, but we feel right now that all quarters will be pretty close. And so I think that's the way I think about it. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Joe Giordano : Got two for you. One is, as you kind of progress with this portfolio transformation strategy that has very clear characteristics of the company you are looking for in terms of cyclicality and things, how does that translate into like may be moral some of the companies in your current portfolio who may not have those characteristics? No one wants to be someone else's cost synergies. So what are you doing to maybe get ahead of some of that? Jim Lico : Yes, I think more people - I would say that the excitement coming out of this operation to continues, our employee engagement has never been higher. So we feel good about all of our businesses and how people feel about the portfolio. I think all of our businesses that will be remaining in Fortive have and some of the business model transformation that we've been talking about, may be a slightly different aspect to that, whether it's maybe more services and on business, some other businesses might have a little bit software. But the ability to improve recurring revenue, the ability to reduce cyclicality something that all of the businesses and have been working on even the business is going to Altra had done a great job in that regard. So I think it's really zero issue with moral, and I think we have really high expectations about what our businesses can do. And I think our businesses are up to that and so that's what we talk about. And our conversations are always about making businesses better, and that's a consistent theme to our history. So I don't think this is really different than what we had and pretty close to the organization. So I feel pretty confident that our ability to sort of drive continuous improvement in the portfolio, make our businesses better as we everybody understands and believes in. Joe Giordano : Okay. And then, Chuck, if you can just report, what was core growth this quarter if you just take out the ANS segment? And if you businesses that are effectively sold? And how is that like in our internal model for the mid-single digit for the rest of the year, how much do you have in your model of those businesses contributing to that? Chuck McLaughlin : We'll take the second question first. We have the business built into the business model progress through the year. So that's not going to change until we have - until the deal gets closed, which we have said will be at the end of the year. I think the important thing is, if we take the businesses out of it and really look at the business without GB is the same 5.5 mid-single-digit growth. But without the ANS businesses, its low single-digit just like it is for the quarter. Operator : And our next question is a follow-up from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Just expanding a bit on the acquisition questions. How are you kind of handle on this thing is going to close at year-end, you obviously don't want to impress on deals just to kind of bridge the gap from a bit loss from these divestitures? So or will you kind of - or do you have that aim to get something that you can get done and closed by the time kind of next year comes around? Or how you kind of handle that guidance for next year when the times comes out bridge the gap? Jim Lico : Steve, I'll go first and then Jim can chime in. We're just looking at it. Those are two things that we are working on very hard. We're very pleased with the progress we're making towards - with Altra deal, and we are on track with that, and we'll get that done by the end of the year. And then separately, we're working very hard to do M&A as we have always been. But as you know, the timing of that is - you really can't control that. So I understand what you're saying, but realized we're working hard to do both of those things and the will fall in but we're optimistic about what we're seeing out there. Chuck McLaughlin : I couldn't answer any better. So I'm going to just say hi. Operator : And our next question is a follow-up from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Scott Graham : I want to ask a question on EMV. The lower tax rate structure we're facing here increase the $500 million plus market opportunity? Jim Lico : No, I don't think so. I think the number - we wondered if you could accelerate some things. We don't see that thus far. I suspect because the mix of customers we have from large-scale retailers so small mom-and-pop shops, probably tech strategies different But what we - so we don't think it really changes the market. I think the compliance-driven situation. So the idea that people would do less is probably not going to happen. They obviously want to be complaint. So the regulatory environment is really the driver here, and we suspect of that that's the real driver. As I mentioned, we thought maybe that tax might accelerate some things haven't seen that yet. But we do, as we mentioned in a couple of different situations, we now think the business is going to be in growth mode for the remainder of the year. And we said that a year ago as we thought we will have an air pocket in Q4 and Q1 and then we would move to growth in Q2 and quite frankly that's what's out. Scott Graham : Yes. You did say that Second one is easy one, Chuck, makes positive in both segments? Chuck McLaughlin : Was mix positive in both segments? No, I think well the mix I've talked about was between the segments. So that with PI growing faster and IT that drove a little bit more we see a fall through. When you look in within the segments, I think, that I can say years because I think they are both showing margin expansion on both of those segments. So I guess, the answer would be yes. Operator : And we have a question from the line of Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Charley Brady : May be a bigger picture kind of longer-term question for GVR. When we get through the deadline here, we effectively replaced a good chunk of the installed base in the U.S. I'm sure you thought about it. But what happens? How do you maintain at least some growth or you will mitigate don't think that's going to come at GVR. Is there a function of just trying to get more recurring revenue on that product stream? Or what's your thoughts around that kind of longer-term broad basis? Jim Lico : Yes. We'll certainly have probably a year, where we are coming back from that depending on the revenue plays out. I think what we said was the move from 2020 from 2017 to 2020 helps that and sort of mitigate the drop, if you will. And what we're really focused on, Charlie, has been about the recurring revenue model growing the business organically in high-growth markets building a larger base a lot of the OPEC acquisition that we did last year was really focused on that. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are off to a very, very strong start there building a great business in places like India, which are making massive investments in their network. So those are going to be kinds of things that we can do and of course, we'll obviously a working to mitigate the earnings at the level as well. So we're probably have some time at Gilbarco negative a little bit, but between building the recurring revenue model some of the things we're doing from acquisition, where we feel good about the size and scale in that network. And what we can do because the technology upgrade that will come will allow of us for to a number of things with data analytics and supply chain logistics with customers that will build into our current revenue model. And with will fall 360 by the way, so I need to get in there. Operator : And at this time, I'm showing that we have no further audio questions. Presenters, I turn it back to you. Jim Lico : Well, thanks, Ian, and thanks, everyone for taking the time for - to spend with us today. I know you're all busy - a busy week for all of you and a busy couple of weeks for you. We feel very good about the quarter. We couldn't be more pleased with what we saw from Fortive Business System perspective and the quality of work that our teams did throughout the quarter to make the quarter possible. And quite frankly, we are really excited about how the year will play out at this point forward. We're very excited to see you in June in Pittsburgh. We hope all of you can make it. I think, you will see the quality of how we built the platform. And more importantly, you will see the quality of the team that we have, the players that we put on the field every day to make the business so successful. So we look forward to seeing you soon. And Lisa and Chuck team are available for calls. We look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for joining us for the Fortive Corporation's first quarter 2018 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

Jim Lico : Thanks, Lisa and good afternoon, everyone. Today we reported another quarter of double digit adjusted earnings and sales growth. This strong performance reflects the vitality of our portfolio and the momentum created from our acquisition flywheel and with our strong free cash flow generation and balance sheet, we are well-positioned to continue deploying capital towards M&A. We are significantly advancing our portfolio enhancement work to accelerate growth and reduce cyclicality. Since last quarter we announced two acquisitions, the Advanced Sterilization Products business from Johnson & Johnson for $2.7 billion and Gordian for $775 million. Both acquisitions provide a meaningful entry into quality markets. ASP is clearly aligned with Fortive's strategy to help customers drive better safety compliance and productivity, and Gordian exemplifies our focus on investing in software enabled workflows. We also issued 5% mandatory convertible preferred stock with net proceeds from the sale of the shares of $1.34 billion. With substantial M&A capacity our funnel remains strong with a range of targeted sizes to address strategic growth priorities. Before I provide quarterly results, I'd like to share that we published our first CSR or corporate social responsibility report in June. I'm excited about the path we've chosen and the progress we have made on the issues that matter most to our employees, customers, communities and investors. While I'm proud of the direction we have established I'm aware that our work is evolving and so we welcome your feedback to inform our CSR related strategies and goals in the coming years. With that I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings of $321.7 million were up 28.7% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.91 based on an adjusted effective tax rate of 17.7% for the quarter. Sales grew 13.9% to $1.9 billion reflecting a core revenue increase of 5.3% as all of our six platforms posted core growth and four out of our six platforms grew mid single-digits or better. The continued success of acquisitions contributed 700 basis points of top line growth. We're excited to review with you today several examples of how FBS growth tools and industry leading innovation are continuing to drive top line performance. Geographically high-growth markets core revenue grew mid single-digits with continued strength in Asia and Latin America. Low double-digit growth in China was led by Gilbarco Veeder Root Sensing Technologies and Automation & Specialty businesses. Developed markets core revenue grew mid single-digits reflecting continued strength in North America. Core revenue growth in North America was mid single-digits and was driven by strong performances at Tektronix Gilbarco Veeder Root Fluke and Jacobs Vehicle Systems. We delivered a third consecutive quarter of gross margins at or above 50%. In the second quarter, we posted a strong gross margin of 50.6% reflecting 120 basis points of expansion over the prior year. Five of our six platforms delivered positive price for a net contribution of 50 basis points. Operating profit margin was 20.6% with core operating margin expansion of 50 basis points driven by Professional Instrumentation favorable incrementals. During the second quarter we generated $315 million of free cash flow and a conversion ratio of 107%. For the full year we are tracking well to deliver our expected free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 110%. Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 17.1% including core revenue growth of 3.4%. Acquisitions contributed 11.9% and favorable currency 1.8%. Reported operating margin of 24.7% reflected core margin expansion of 180 basis points as FBS drove strong price, innovation and supply chain benefits. Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue increased low single-digits during the quarter driven by market outperformance at Fluke. Field Solutions core revenue grew mid single-digits in the quarter reflecting mid single-digit growth in both developed and high growth markets. Fluke delivered high single-digit core growth led by double digit growth at Fluke Digital Systems Fluke Networks and our thermal imaging business within Fluke Industrial. At eMaint net new customer growth was 15% and recurring revenue grew greater than 25%. The combination of hardware and software coupled with the safety and productivity value proposition offered by Fluke products continues to resonate with customers and drive market share gains. Increased growth investments in sales and marketing are clearly paying off as Fluke further outperforms its markets reflected by accelerated point of sale growth. Industrial Scientific Corporation delivered mid teens revenue growth led by double digit growth in the INET and rental businesses. For those of you that attended our recent Investor Day last month at ISC you were able to see firsthand the strength of the ISC team and their enthusiasm for adopting the Fortive Business System to drive revenue growth and margin expansion while advancing ISC's digital strategy and continuous improvement culture. Qualitrol core sales declined low double digit as high-single digit growth in North America was more than offset by declines in China, Europe and the Middle East. The market softness is consistent with what we messaged last quarter and we are actively working to improve what we expect to be declining sales for the remainder of the year. Product Realization platform core revenues grew slightly for the quarter led by low single digit growth at Tektronix. Excluding the large 3D sensing win we highlighted in the second quarter 2017 Tektronix core revenue growth was high-single digits. Results were driven by double digit growth in developed markets and in industrial and automotive end markets reflecting the success of multiple new product introductions and our target market strategy. I'm excited to announce that Tek launched its 6 Series Mixed Signal Oscilloscope last week. Based on the same breakthrough platform as the popular 5 Series MSO the 6 Series MSO is an industry first for this class of oscilloscope and provides higher performance up to eight gigahertz to target the substantial growth in applications that handle a vast amount of data. It also measures devices at the lowest noise level of any product in the market, a critical feature for power devices, IoT and connected car applications and leverages the ease of use and software of the 5 Series. With the 6 Series MSO we're delivering a compelling combination of best-in-class performance and usability that will boost productivity and shorten time to market for our customers. Our sensing technologies platform delivered mid single digit core revenue growth in the quarter led by double digit growth in China. New product introductions continue to deliver market share gains across the platform and our digital strategy is fueling progress towards launching additional IoT offerings. One of the most recent examples of this is Acumen [ph] Inventory Management. This technology enables customers to manage inventory remotely through a centralized and/or mobile user interface. By using a variety of sensing technologies Acumen can continuously measure solid material and help customers manage inventory and rate of consumption trends in a number of applications. Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenue grew 11.2% including core revenue growth of 6.9%. Acquisitions contributed 280 basis points of growth and currency 150 basis points. Reported operating margin of 20.8% including core operating margin expansion of 30 basis points offset by 40 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions. Our Transportation Technologies platform core revenue grew high single digits led by strong double-digit growth in high growth markets. Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivered high-single digit core revenue growth reflecting a strong rebound in North America driven by backlog reduction and increased demand for EMV solutions. Strong double digit core growth in China was led by continued demand at Veeder-Root for submersible pumps and automatic tank gauges related to double wall tank upgrades. We are pleased with the success of our previously announced exclusive programs with Chevron, Texaco and Valero retailers to drive EMV compliance as sales across these programs are up double-digits. Additionally, we are seeing a strong pick up in EMV sales with mid-tier accounts and single site owners. These improved bookings along with key business wins continue to give us confidence in our expectation for GVR to grow core revenue mid single digits for the remainder of the year. TeletracNavman delivered mid-single digit core growth led by double-digit sales growth in Asia Pacific and high-single digit SaaS sales growth. As we noted last quarter, the industry was challenged with integration and support issues associated with the electronic logging device mandate. We now see these issues beginning to stabilize and expect moderated growth rates for the balance of the year in the U.S. Automation & Specialty posted another quarter of low double-digit core revenue growth led by high-teens growth in Asia. JVS delivered mid-teens core revenue growth, driven by increased Class A truck production in the U.S. and market share gains in China. Growth in our automation businesses was led by Kollmorgen where low double-digit core revenue growth reflected continued robotic strength in Europe and China. The strong performance was also driven by automations focused on target verticals including medical and food and beverage end markets as well as new product innovations. Kollmorgen introduced barcode navigation technology for mobile robotics application in smart warehouses and Portescap launched additions to the Ultra 22ECT Motor platform to provide higher torque capacity in the smallest footprint allowing further miniaturization of customer applications including industrial and surgical power tools. A&S business combination with Altra, as previously announced in March, is advancing nicely and we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Moving to Franchise Distribution. The platform grew core revenue low single-digits. Matco core revenue grew low single-digits reflecting double digit growth in diagnostics software subscription sales and high single-digit growth in specialty tools driven by new product launches and market share gains. We believe market fundamentals are healthy, given a variety of metrics, including positive sell-in to sell-out ratio and a strong franchisee applicant funnel. To wrap up, our team executed well during the second quarter, driving double digit sales and adjusted earnings per share growth, 50 basis points of core operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow performance. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect our core growth rate to accelerate versus the first half, driven by improving order trends and as the acquisitions of Orpak, ISC and Landauer become part of our core revenue. The power of the Fortive Business System the vitality of our portfolio and the momentum created from our acquisition flywheel position us well for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. Turning to the guide. We are updating our full year 2018 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $3.42 to $3.50, which includes improved assumptions of 4% to 5% core revenue growth, core margin \u2013 core operating margin expansion of approximately 75 basis points, an effective tax rate of 18% and free cash flow conversion of 110% for the year. The updated adjusted diluted net EPS guidance also reflects the dilutive impact from the mandatory convertible preferred stock offering which we expect to offset with operational improvements. We are also initiating our third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.83 to $0.87, which includes assumptions of mid single digit core revenue growth, core operating margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points and an effective tax rate of 18%. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Lisa. Lisa Curran : Thanks Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Philip, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Steve Winoker of UBS. Steve Winoker : I wanted to just dive into some of the moving parts. First, Jim, on tariffs the $0.06 headwind that you called out, can you may be give us a sense of what's baked into that? You said it\u2019s enacted. Is it the cost structure? Do you have any pricing? Also that 50 basis points, is any of that pulling through there yet? Is there any demand impact in that? Jim Lico : First I'll take the demand question. We don't think there's a demand impact on the tariffs side. So that one's fairly - I think - obviously we raised the core growth for the second half, so we feel good about the revenue profile. Relative to the cost infrastructure and some of the things that are going on Steve, first and foremost, I think the 232 stuff that we have pretty good clarity of has been fully counter-measured. It's ratable across most of the businesses and our team's done a nice job at offsetting it. On the 301 things, where it's really been a mix of cost pricing first, so establishing more price in the businesses. Second is supply chain strategies. As you can imagine a number of things we can do to offset that and then some manufacturing changes in strategy. We have some situations where we can - we have choices of where we produce product and so we're making some of those decisions as well. So that's only the sum total. It probably - it's really kind of a - probably number one is on the price side. Steve Winoker : And then the second thing is, we're seeing all these prior M&A flywheel starting - acquisitions now starting to move to core growth and core operating margin expansion. And you mentioned that it was going to help in terms of core growth acceleration. And on my simple math on the operating margin as I go out to Q4 given 30 or 50 in Q3 and 50 and 2 and 100 in Q1, I think it's around 110 or so or 100, 110 in Q4. Can you maybe talk about some of those dynamics? Is most of this now starting to come from the new acquisitions as well or that are anniversaring? Jim Lico : Yes it's still a smaller percent. Our guide is mostly I would say in terms of increasing the guide and the strength in the second half is still coming from the core business. Obviously core Tek, Landauer and ISC all fall into different order there. And I didn't even do the order right. It's really Orpak ISC Landauer I think. But we think about 20 basis points in the second half growth rate is probably with those deals. So they're growing well and as we - they're still a small part of the portfolio but they're all doing exceptionally well and will start to add to the core growth rate here as we go forward. Steve Winoker : And the OMX contribution from those, is it similar also in the fourth quarter as part of that 100 plus? Chuck McLaughlin : Well I think it's not different than what we had been assuming. And I think that it's - yes there's a little bit of tailwinds from the acquisitions. But as Jim said, they're not the biggest piece. But us raising our guide is really about our business strengthening because the - as well as these acquisitions are performing they're really in line with what we've been seeing all year long. Steve Winoker : And if I could just sneak one more in at Qualitrol, is that decline still all just end market based on condition launching for the utility side? Or is there something else going on there? Jim Lico : We definitely think its market. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the North American business is very good. Where it's really been - it's mostly focused in China and in the Middle East. Now some of the Middle East business gets transacted through Europe so we called out as Europe, Middle East and China, but it's really the European slowdown is really with OEMs we're servicing the Middle Eastern economy. So we definitely - it's a longer cycle business so the short cycle part of the business is doing okay. It's the project based business that's longer cycle. And that's why we have while we're doing a lot to change the direction of the business the team's doing a good job to protect margins. But we think it's probably slow the rest of the year and slightly into the first quarter probably until we start to see things pop up. The good thing is the Field Solutions is doing so well. As we mentioned Fluke's doing very well, ISC is doing very well. So it's - the platform itself is in a good place right now. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : You announced a couple interesting deals here. You did the J&J deal in June and then Gordian in July and financed with the convert. But is there a point where you have to slow down the M&A pace a little bit just more than anything else not because of financing on limitations. That's seems to be less of an issue now, but people issues. You don't have a huge corporate office. You have to integrate systems, and all kinds of back office stuff that I assume takes a fair amount of time. And then I would imagine you plant a fair amount of your own people in those organizations some juncture to help drive culture too. So are there some challenges that just require you to slow down the pace of it in that regard? Jim Lico : I think, yes. So I think number one is, the good thing about it is that we normally resource the integrations and the ability to sort of bring the acquisitions along with the platforms they're in. And so in the case of both of these we've got separate platform leaders who are leading those integrations. So we feel good. We're always building capacity for the deals from a talent perspective. So number one first and foremost, when we talk about FBS we always talk about growth lean and leadership. And the leadership aspect of that is really about building the talent funnel to be able to take on these sorts of opportunities. So first and foremost, we've got the FBS capability. Barb in person and their teams are ready to go and assist those management teams. We're getting really good management teams in both the case of ASP and Gordian. So we think they're excited to be a part of Fortive. So I think we got a deserving organization that is doing a good job, they'll take FBS, our platform leaders. We'll obviously have to fill some jobs there for sure more on the ASP side than on the Gordian side because Johnson will be obviously it's a carve out so that will require some more talent. But we feel very good about where we're at relative to that. And quite frankly, feel like we got more capacity to do. We -- in fact we'll review our leadership with our board here shortly. Our leadership funnel and our message to our board is going to be we've got great capacity to continue to do things for the right kind of transactions that will continue to build the portfolio. So we're not just going to do deals to do deals, but to the extent that we can continue to build great businesses in, we've got the capacity to take it on. Scott Davis : And now that you just brought up Art's job, which is only one of hers and there\u2019s a lots of these companies you're buying so. How long does it take to teach someone FBS? I mean, how long do you -- how long does it take to get to some sort of level where you're acceptable that they're a fully functioning part of the Fortive culture as opposed to whatever culture they you were buying? Jim Lico : Well, 22 years and I'm still learning, so I'm still trying to figure it out. But I think at the end of the day it - that the point at around, it takes a couple of years for the business to sort of - our sort of plan will be to sit down with the business leadership. We'll do our 100 day strategic plan. That will define kind of where the big opportunities are or maybe the gaps are in performance that we want to improve. And then from there that sort of leads us to what are the FBS tools that you want to use. And we really use the successes of those tools to build the culture. And as the organization sees those wins, ultimately the adoption rate becomes pretty fast. You saw that at ISC with our - at Investor Day. We're one year in and the leadership team is really using the tools, understands the culture. And while they would admit I think that they've got a lot to learn they're certainly very proficient. So in a year they can make good progress. In a couple of years they'll make substantive progress and obviously we'll be with them for that whole journey. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : So on China what's going on there? Maybe talk about what you're seeing and how this plays out in the second half. I know you guys have a bit of electronics exposure there, but it's different than perhaps some of the foreign players that sell into kind of directly into smartphones. Just curious as to what you guys are seeing in China as a start. Jim Lico : Yes. So we - at the beginning of the year we said we thought China was low to high single-digit. We obviously just said that we'd be low double-digits in the second quarter. So we're a little ahead of where we thought we would be. So that's good. I would say we're seeing as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we're not only seeing obviously the Gilbarco Veeder-Root business, but we're seeing even sell through in a short cycle business like Fluke we're seeing mid single-digit sellout at our distributor level in the quarter. So we're still seeing pretty good growth. We feel good about China for the remainder of the year. We're obviously watching for things. We read the headlines and obviously trying to understand to the extent that there's things that might change that. But in real discussions with real customers they continue to have demand. And in Tek's performance if you take out the onetime 3D sensing situation there that we mentioned from a year ago it actually had a pretty good quarter in China. So relatively broadbased. So I think we're still seeing good growth there. And as I said we always anticipated it would moderate a little bit from the really strong performance we've had the last two years and we've sort of been a little bit above that. So I feel pretty good about it of where we are right now. Steve Tusa : Where do you expect China to grow in the second half? Jim Lico : We'll be somewhere - I think we'll be somewhere in the -- between low double digit and high single probably is where we'll end up. Somewhere -- so not a lot of moderation. Steve Tusa : And then when you think about kind of all the moves that you guys had done the preferred ANS. ASP. Gordian I don't know what other anagrams I'm missing here. But when you think kind of all the things you've done over the last call it four to five months if you will, what is all kind of -- what do you think is kind of all the net accretion for next year from all this stuff? Chuck McLaughlin : Steve this is Chuck. So the way I think about that before we put FBS to work and drive business just the net of all these moving parts is slightly accretive into next year maybe less than $0.05. And then on top of that, you're going to see us do a normal earnings growth type of running FBS, our volume and OMX growth on top of that, and then whatever happens in the second half. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a first question around the core margin expansion at industrial tech, there wasn't much in Q1 because of a tough comp on the margin. Q2, I guess the core margin growth wasn't that substantial either. So, just wondered if you could give a bit more color as to why that's the case and how you see that core OMX playing out in industrial tech in the second half. Jim Lico : Julian, it's Jim. We obviously have had good growth in the quarter and we had pretty good incrementals on that. We had a couple of situations given the strength of the business we've had. We have a couple of one-time things at Gilbarco relative to a customer in India and some -- we mentioned some of the churn situations in OMX, and so we had a couple of one-time things there that if we sort of looked through those, we see almost 100 basis points of margin expansion so in the segment. And so we see -- we have a good line of sight to -- in that 50 to 75 basis points kind of margin expansion. We have pretty good line of sight to the second half being in that zone. Julian Mitchell : And my second question just around the Product Realization sales softness. What do you see as the growth rate, the core growth rate for that business in the second half? And any big sort of moving parts in terms of regional mix, if you focus specifically on consumer electronics and also the energetic materials business that you called out? Chuck McLaughlin : So Julian this is Chuck. As Jim mentioned, we had the 3D sensing order last year. But if we take that out, what that would indicate for the second half is mid-single-digit growth for them, and that's what we expect. That's I think where they're going to end up at the end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Maybe start with Chuck. Just on the convert, we don't see a lot of this structure at least in our sector. But what's unique about Fortive's capital structure and financing needs in the situation that a convert made sense? Chuck McLaughlin : Well, a great question. I think that given our appetite for M&A and our desire to keep a strong balance sheet, and the attractive rates that we looked around and looked at all the things that were available to us. We really felt like this was a great time to go with the convert. And also, as we talked about -- we've got this ultra field where we're going to end up retiring shares. And to actually get the value out of the separation we needed to replace those shares and while -- and this gets pretty close to doing that. Deane Dray : And then, optically there are times where the buyers of these converts will short the common just as a way of hedging, and I haven't seen the latest update in short interest. But are you expecting to see this and people just have to understand it's related to hedging not a bet against the stock? Chuck McLaughlin : I think, we don't expect that to be a big number. I mean, we didn't \u2013 it's not that big of a relative to our market cap that I expect that's going to be a big thing. But there'll be a little bit of that for sure. Deane Dray : What's the share's assumption and the dilution? Chuck McLaughlin : Well, I think, the dilution is about $0.04 a quarter. And the shares is somewhere around 14 million to 18 million, depending on what the stock price does. If stock price goes up the dilution comes down. Deane Dray : And then just as a follow up, Jim, in the prepared remarks, five out of six businesses got price. Just the ranking of the pricing power on the portfolio today. And if push comes to shove and there's going to be more pricing \u2013 price increases, what room do you have? Jim Lico : Well, I think, we've had \u2013 as you know, we have good pricing power in most of the portfolio. Where we saw \u2013 where we historically have seen good price is probably been in \u2013 more in Professional Instrumentation we tend to sell and the go-to-market there is not as much OEM, so it's a little easier to get price. The 301 stuff hits Professional Instrumentation a little bit more than it does industrial tech. So the idea of tariffs and some of those kinds of things line up well with where we typically get price. So we feel good about the countermeasures we got in place Deane. There's a little bit of the effect where we'll get all of it in the fourth quarter. We'll get a little bit of \u2013 some of the \u2013 we don't have complete coverage in the third as some of the pricing actions take place. But we feel really good about our ability to countermeasure what we have, what we've seen thus far and if other things were to come out there, we feel good about our ability to countermeasure. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So just from the - just, I think on the tariff here. So I mean, I've done some basic divestments around this and so hovering right here. But it looks like about $500 million of - approach to this subject has - would be like an analyzed number. Is that about right Chuck? I mean, is my math correct there? Chuck McLaughlin : Did you say $500 million? Nigel Coe : Yes. Chuck McLaughlin : For the tariffs? Is that... Nigel Coe : No. About the growth purchases subject to tax. I mean just the $50 million of tax rate divided by share count is about $0.12. So that's how I did the math. I mean, would that be right? Chuck McLaughlin : I think that's \u2013 no, I think that's overweight quite a bit. We can get you - I think it's - for us we're seeing about $0.03 a quarter of gross headwind. And that's for our business. Nigel Coe : Maybe just a bit more color in terms of, I mean, Jim you alluded to the fact that some of the businesses impacted by the tariffs are where you think got better pricing power so there's almost like a hedge there. But maybe just talk about which businesses are most impacted. Any color in terms of what you're sourcing and producing in China, you bring into the U.S. would be helpful. And then in terms of the 3Q guidance, it looks like you're assuming $0.02 to $0.03 impact to offsets in 4Q. Is that sort of the right lay-up? Jim Lico : Well, we are protecting this a little bit. So we think about the two sets of tariffs the, 232 stuff is sort of ratable across, as I mentioned. Everybody buys a little bit of steel. A little bit more like in toolbox, obviously, versus something. But, by and large, that number is a little smaller and more ratable across. But it's a smaller number. 301 is much more focused on electronics, so you can imagine where we have electronics content. And where we tend to be more global so places like -- for example are going to be where we might see more of the tariffs. The good news there is we have global supply chain. We have global manufacturing capability. So our ability to countermeasure with some of those kinds of activities is actually greater as well and those are the actions we're taking. And I think just to follow-on is we expect to be able to countermeasure the impact of the tariffs in the year. There might be a slight impact in Q3 for us just -- but we'll get it all out through the year. Nigel Coe : And then just a following question. Obviously lots of moving parts on - this quarter you said - growth in second half of the year. Some of the forecast for next year - calling for semiconductor CapEx to be down next year in 2019, do you think you can still grow in that kind of mid-single digit zone if semiconductor CapEx is down next year? Jim Lico : I think - well yes and I think one, we're going to have mid-single digit number as against really, really strong comps in the second half last year. So that very good performance. We continue to see opportunities. It's probably still a little too early to tell how much the CapEx overall number will necessarily impact as our overall business. As you know Nigel, Tek is mostly in the -- almost exclusively in the R&D side of things and not around manufacturing CapEx. And as the manufacturing CapEx is really the big swing in that number. So some of the -- have nothing to do with whether or not Tek sells -- in many cases. So we continue to have conversations with customers. The six Series also the scope that we just announced is in a number of applications that we think will have tremendous opportunity next year. Automotive which is principally autonomous vehicles data centers low noise, low signal, low power applications and IoT. So I don't think those applications are necessarily going to be things that are less next year. So we've re-pivoted the business towards a number of those kinds of applications. So it's a little early to predict what 2019 will look like but we still think there's plenty of opportunity in 2019. Operator : And your next question comes from Sawyer Rice of Morgan Stanley. Sawyer Rice : Maybe just a two part here on DVR. Any sense of what the mix between -- kits was in the quarter and maybe the impact there on margin as a result? And then just kind of looking forward are you guys expecting this business to start to ramp into the back half and into next year as we start to approach the MP deadline here in the U.S.? Jim Lico : Well I think minimal margin impact on kits versus dispensers. We'll follow-up with you what the exact number is. But I think it was sort of the way we came in. When you look at the mix of business it was a good mix of business as we said. The exclusive partnerships that we've got with people like Valero was up double digits as we said in the prepared remarks. I think what we really like was the single retailer what we call the single network owner. That business coming back it's a pretty good margin business as well. So I think all of the trends for the second half -- all the trends we saw in the quarter would suggest that the second half is pretty good. Is that helpful? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Can you give us a little more color on Gordian? Cyclically resistant, but obviously the underlying end market is building construction. We know it's high in recurring revenue and software, software it seems like underlying end markets would be cyclical though. So can you talk about the historical performance, especially during slowdown? And is there anything else that gives you confidence of the business is really cyclically resilient? Jim Lico : Yes. So the business primarily - the core customer here is the public sector asset owner. So think of the VP facility at a public university and some contractors and architects as well. So that's first and foremost kind of who they sell into. State and local government, healthcare, universities are the principal customers. These are not for big CapEx projects. They're mostly used whether it's job order contracting or RS means or even sidelined, they're mostly used \u2013 they're mostly used for things like small projects that tend to not have \u2013 still be done in times of slowdowns and things like that. So I think that's first and foremost. I think we the business performed pretty well 08, 09 so we think it'll be fine In the sort of end market capital project it's nearly not tied to commercial real estate in the sense of new \u2013 so much in commercial real estate tends to be in things that are big building related. This is much more tied to the maintenance of buildings which tends to be pretty stable. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then can you give us a little bit more color on Franchise Distribution and Matco in particular? You mentioned a little better growth here in Q2 and high single-digit growth in your tools business. So have you turned the corner here and now you have a better visibility to growth moving forward? Jim Lico : Yes. So we were - I think versus the market they outperformed, when we look at the growth rate. As we said in the prepared remarks, I think on a small base but the subscription revenue was up, which is good to see building more of a recurring revenue set. And the health metrics were good. That's probably the thing we felt good about maybe a little bit more optimism here is that the heath metrics we're seeing more the franchisee applicant funnel, which is a good predictor of business down the road is getting - is becoming more full. So those are good things. We have still not seen the toolbox business come back. So I think we've \u2013 I would say I would call Matco right now stable. And I wouldn't necessarily suggest we've seen an inflection point yet. But I think we're in growth mode and we're in a stable growth mode. And so we'll continue to watch the metrics to see when that sort of moves the growth rate up, but I think right now I would say stability is really the right word to describe it the business. Andrew Kaplowitz : Chuck just a quick one for you. Our tax rate keeps stretching down, which you have to commend your team on. But I guess at some point there's a low point to where it could go. 18% is pretty low already. So do you have more room there or is that kind of what we should expect going forward? Chuck McLaughlin : Well I think - take the second question. I think 18% is a good number for \u2013 at this point in time and I'd probably use that into next year as well. How well can it go? It really just depends on how the world keeps changing. There's tax reform that happens outside the U.S. And then as we come to learn the correct interpretations of the U.S. Tax Reform it creates opportunities. And when you put all that together with our M&A -- I don't know how much or goes. It depends on what the is but it -- right now 18% is a good number. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Wondering if we could just circle back to the guidance one more time. I guess, slide 8 would seem to suggest you're bluffing the top end of the range. I don't know if that's correct or not. But I guess whether that is correct or not what needs to happen to get you to the upper end that kind of - half of that is speared, I think of maybe one of the first questions that the implicit operating margins in the fourth quarter do need to step up very nicely. So is there something in cost structure or mix or something that you have visibility on that makes that fourth quarter come together? Jim Lico : No, I think that there's a little bit of some investments that we made in the fourth quarter of last year that makes probably the margin expansion a little better. But there's not a step function in terms of the VCMs that we would expect to see from Q3 to Q4 to make that - getting to the high end. Although I would emphasize that we do have a range and even though in a rising market to the high end it's not -- we just wanted to give that the way we give that reconciliation out there at the high end was meant so you could see the moving pieces really clearly. Jeff Sprague : And then a quick modeling question. Corporate was a little bit higher than I was expecting. Is there some business development going on there or what and what should we expect for the year? Chuck McLaughlin : I think that this is where we're seeing some of these deal related expenses show up for the Altra deal and the ASP deal are some are some -- and there's also some external spend around the tax deal. So that's what's mostly driving the step up in corporate. Jeff Sprague : Is that a run rate now this Q2 number or is that elevated? Chuck McLaughlin : I think it's going to be elevated from here in Q3 and in Q4. But then coming into next year it'll drop back down into the low 20s. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman of Baird. Richard Eastman : Thanks Jim. And Chuck and Lisa for the question. Jim just a question around reckoning out a little bit Fluke Health Solutions -- with Landauer now coming into core later this year. You got Fluke Biomedical, J&J, ASP deal gets done. I mean, I think, we can calculate this out at over $1 billion in revenue on the health solutions side. What's the strategy for those three businesses? Do they ultimately get -- is that the makings of kind of a new platform here? How will you kind of integrate those and manage them? Or will they kind of stay separate businesses? Jim Lico : Yes, I think what we will do here not to push the question off a little bit but what we're trying to do -- what we will do with Altra and with Altra going out and our automation business going to Altra and with our work in health with ASP will ultimately come back to everybody with how this is all going to look from a platform perspective. It's suffice to say that there are opportunities for synergies with some of the businesses. You're right in your numbers we will have over $1 billion worth of health care between the businesses Fluke Biomedical, Landauer and with ASP. So that's obviously a meaningful amount of revenue with good growth and great margin expansion opportunities. We're thinking through a variety of things that will make sense on a couple of different angles. So more to come on that, but I think the idea that we're building this capability around safety, productivity and quality assurance in medical applications is been the reigning strategy for all of those additions to the portfolio. So what we do is really I think exciting to be able to offer these sorts of solutions to customers. So there are synergies between the two. We don't always have to structure things differently in order to get after those synergies. That's always been the culture of us. So we'll determine if they're appropriate. We are in the process of determining the appropriate organizational structure and more to come once we -- once we're landed on all of the puts and takes going on in the portfolio. Richard Eastman : So it would seem that greater than $1 billion maybe $1.2 billion or something like that would have probably some of your best FBS opportunity? I would think with.. Jim Lico : Well definitely - for sure revenue is 12 months old right? Landauer, we just bought a year ago. ASP will come into the fold. So without a doubt just by nature of them just joining us -- joining the team they will have more opportunities to be able to take advantage of productivity safety quality all of the things that - and growth. I think as we said when we announced ASP deal we thought the innovation and growth tools will be a big help to the ASP business as well. Richard Eastman : And then just a quick one for Chuck. What's the FBS for number that you're using for third quarter guide? Chuck McLaughlin : I'm sorry. Richard Eastman : The fully diluted share count that you're calculating using third quarter guide. Chuck McLaughlin : I got it right here. Richard Eastman : Because that will capture the convert correct? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes say 3.73. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Scott Graham : I have two questions, one on pricing, one on GVR. I was actually a little surprised that the pricing was only up 50 basis points. Will we see that higher in the second half of the year? Are there anything -- is there anything you netted against that? Because we're seeing little higher elsewhere? Chuck McLaughlin : Well most of it is because when you think about some of the things related to tariffs and inflation it really hasn't impacted us until mid-July. So it's - the 232 stuff that a lot of other companies saw it early was a reason to go in and go into the marketplace with price. Because we had so little impact from 232, it's a little difficult to do from a marketplace. So when you look at the 50 bips that we had in the second quarter that's kind of our typical pure strength of the portfolio, strength of market position kind of price. And then the second half we'll see that accelerate as a number of our countermeasures start to play out. Scott Graham : And then along those same lines when we talk about inflation of the cost 232 less so 301 more so, when you say that you're throwing a lot of things under tariffs, but obviously there was inflation before the tariffs. And my sense here is that with the minimal impact on 232, you're essentially saying I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you're essentially saying that you weren't seeing a lot of inflation in front of the tariffs. That was just pure commodities inflation that we saw second half of last year for example? Jim Lico : Yes we have - we get a lot of what we - purchase price variance PPD. We have a really high quality supply chain organization that's really does a fantastic job. So we've been pretty good at mitigating some of the kinds of things that have occurred over -- that we've already seen. We\u2019ve seen some stuff on fuel surcharges and stuff like that as oil prices went up. But by and large those have been things that we just mitigate as normal course of action. So we've been very good and that's why we've been able to when you look at the gross margin expansion as an example that we've seen over the last several quarters it's been really strong despite you might say a little bit more of an inflationary environment in the quarters before that. Scott Graham : My GVR question is you've given us some information here for I think the first time that this midtier shrank double digit and you called those sort of I think smaller I don't know how many stations per owner type thing. How much of the market for EMV is that? Let's say a potential $500 million yes? Jim Lico : The single site owner is probably 70 plus percent of the stations. But at the 80 :20 right so at 70% of the stations but only maybe 30% of the -- it's pretty close to 80 :20. So it's -- they don't spend as much money as the big retailers. But they do convert. And so we've seen a lot of visibility from the larger retailers over time as they get ahead of this. As I think we've said pretty consistently is that one of the reasons why the single site owners or the single network owners, a lot of them know their customers maybe they're in a smaller town or something like that. So they are the majority of the stations, but not necessarily majority of the dollars, but seeing them from on board. Now the multi-site owners, the other part of that\u2019s kind of mid tier of the market and that\u2019s kind of a bit of a sweet spot in the market. And it's -- I don't have the exact numbers of percentages but, it's 30% probably the market in some way shape or form probably for dollar. So it's a good chunk of the market to start to see them doing their capital planning and starting to implement is a good sign for EMV. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Joe Giordano : Thanks for taking my questions here. I'm curious on Tek. How much - given the margin profile there like how sensitive would that would that segment be to movements there? Is that would that be one of the more like principal drivers on a given percentage move of margin in that business? Does that make sense? Chuck McLaughlin : You mean across the whole company right? Joe Giordano : Well I like ordering just PR. Like does have the biggest move on a given percentage change of revenue change in FBI? Chuck McLaughlin : No, I think full price is the biggest piece of that on PI side. But Tek's got great margins and so when it goes up it does lift and it's great fall through well over 50%. So yes, it's impactful but it just really depends on the size of the impact. Jim Lico : And as maybe just an add which is really good to see in the quarter Joe is even though Tek didn't have the growth rate that they had a year ago because of the comp this year they did an exceptional job on the gross margin side. And it really is on the back of their innovation. We talked about the five Series being a very strong margin product. They've done an exceptional job of really bringing out these new products with more software and a better value proposition which is obviously even in a lower growth environment is allowing for them to really deliver better gross margins. Joe Giordano : And then on the tariff side I know you guys are pretty niche in your business so maybe this isn't really applicable. But are you seeing any like competitors non-U.S. competitors being like opportunistically competitive, is that having any impact in those specific businesses that you operate? Jim Lico : Not yet. Every business is different because kind of depends on where the competitors are. We're certainly looking to watch some of that. And quite frankly we're looking to do some of that as well. So we'll see where those opportunities are available to us but they'll be on a case by case basis. I think the biggest thing it's really early right now. When you really think about most of these things really went live for sure just in the last few weeks it's pretty early to really tell if anything is - if there's a trend on anything yet. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Yes, thanks. Well, I missed a couple go quarter. So I'm catching up here. So just a quick clarification actually Chuck. You mentioned $0.05 net impact from M&A/Altra. I think that's what you gave in your response to Steve's question. Would that include the dilution from converts or is that separate? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes. Actually what I was trying to say is all the things that we've done this year with Altra ASP the mandatory convert and you net all that stuff out what - where will it land with after share retirement and ASP closing. So I think it's $0.05 accretive next year. And then on top of that will be our normal earnings growth that we get from the businesses and then whatever we do in the second half of the year. Operator : And we have no further questions in queue at this time. Jim Lico : Well Philip thank you and thanks everybody for taking the time this evening. We couldn't be more excited about the performance in the second quarter. We're really - as we turn - as we close out the first half of the year and start it in July we celebrated our second anniversary of being out. And we've gotten a lot done. We're really proud of the work we've done, the capital we've deployed, the ability to bring in great businesses, to take the opportunity to do the portfolio transformation. Two years has gone exceptionally fast and those of you know us you know that we're never satisfied and the highest expectations that we have are those of ourselves. So we're really excited. We appreciate the time and energy you put into learning more about us. Thanks for a great start last two years. We look forward to telling you more about what's going on. Lisa and team are available for follow-ups. So we'll look forward to talking to you all soon and have a great evening. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

Jim Lico : Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. Today, we reported strong high teens adjusted earnings growth for the third quarter reflecting the underlying strength of our core portfolio, the power of the Fortive business system and the increasing momentum of our M&A flywheel. Given our strong free cash flow generation and a healthy balance sheet, we are in an advantaged position to continue driving organic growth while pursuing acquisitions to accelerate the achievement of our strategy. During the third quarter, we closed the $775 million acquisition of Gordian and the $2 billion acquisition of Accruent. Through the application of FPS, we were also able to close the divestiture of the automation and specialty businesses to Altra, well ahead of schedule on October 1. In total, we have now announced $8.2 billion of transactions in 2018, $5.5 billion of which have already been closed. We have done so while maintaining our commitment to a strong balance sheet based on our consistent free cash flow performance as well as the successful execution of our mandatory convertible preferred stock offering in the second quarter. Taken together, these transactions significantly advance our portfolio enhancement efforts aimed at increasing growth and reducing cyclicality across the portfolio. The Gordian and Accruent acquisitions provide entry into attractive markets characterized by strong long-term growth trends and limited cyclicality. They also represent the continued execution of our digital strategy to address a range of critical software-enabled workflows for our customers through the acquisition of quality software assets with high margins and significant recurring revenue. During the quarter, we also continue to make progress toward the closing of the previously announced acquisition of Advanced Sterilization Products. Based on close collaboration with our partners at Johnson & Johnson and our continued application of FPS, we successfully completed the requisite European Works Council consultations and cleared key regulatory hurdles paving the way for the formal acceptance of our binding offer on September 20. We continue to expect to close the transaction in early 2019. The third quarter represented the opportunity to demonstrate all that is special about the Fortive team as we responded to Hurricane Florence and other recent natural disasters around the world and showed our commitment to our local communities through our annual day of caring. Over the past two weeks, our employees participated in hundreds of events including working with food banks, improving children shelters, and building houses for the low income and homeless. Coming together to support our communities as never been more important for the long-term success of our company and the communities in which we work.  With that I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings of $321.1 million were up 18.2% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.86 based on an adjusted effective tax rate a 17.2% for the quarter. Sales grew 9.2% to 1.8 billion reflecting a core revenue increase of 3.2% driven by strong growth across industrial technologies as well as Fluke, Industrial Scientific, and Gems. Acquisitions including Gordian and Accruent contributed 720 basis points of top-line growth. Geographically, high growth markets core revenue grew mid-single digits with continued strength in Asia and Latin America. This growth was led by Gilbarco Veeder Root, Sensing Technologies and Automation. Despite certain parts of the China market that are becoming more challenging, we performed well generating high-single digit growth for the quarter. Developed markets core revenue grew low-single digits reflecting continued strength in North America. Core revenue growth in North America was mid-single digits and was driven by strong performance of Fluke, Matco, Industrial Scientific, and Jacobs Vehicle Systems. Western Europe declined low-single digits as high-single digit growth at Tektronix was offset by continued weakness at Qualitrol and JVS. In the third quarter, we posted a gross margin of 50.2% reflecting 40 basis points of expansion over the prior year based on the strong contribution from our recent acquisitions which was partially offset by anticipated impact of tariffs and inflationary pressures. The third quarter represented our fourth consecutive quarter of gross margins at or above 50%. Pricing contributed 60 basis points with four of our six platforms delivering positive price during the quarter. Operating profit margin was 17.5% with core operating margin decreasing 25 basis points as strong PPV in productivity were more than offset by costs associated with loss production days at Gilbarco Veeder Root due to the Hurricane Florence as well as unfavorable mix dynamics within the portfolio. During the third quarter, we generated $351.8 million of free cash flow representing a 23% year over year increase and a free cash flow conversion ratio of 143%. For the full year, we are on track to deliver a free cash flow conversion ratio of greater than 110%. Turning to our segments, professional instrumentation posted sales growth of 13.6% including core revenue growth of 1.4%. Acquisitions contributed 1,320 basis points while unfavorable currency reduced growth by 100 basis points. Reported operating margin of 20.1% reflected 270 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions and transaction expenses. Core margins were flat due to the impact of tariffs at Fluke and Tektronix, inflationary pressures, and customer-related delays at EMC. Advanced instrumentation and solutions core revenue increased low-single digits during the quarter, driven by continued outperformance at Fluke and Industrial Scientific. Field Solutions core revenue grew low-single digits reflecting mid-single digit growth in developed markets offset by some slowing and high growth markets which were slightly up in the quarter. Fluke delivered mid-single digit core growth led by double-digit growth at Fluke Digital Systems and Fluke Health Solutions and high-single digit growth in the Fluke Industrial Group and Fluke Calibration. We are pleased with the progress we made in the quarter to counteract the impact of tariffs through FBS and supply chain strategy and expect to be fully countermeasure by the first quarter of 2019. At Fluke Digital Systems, we recently released the Fluke, the new Fluke 3561 vibration sensor which has generated a very positive response from the market based on the pace of orders thus far driving continued customer expansion including a large order from [indiscernible]. Annual recurring revenue from eMaint grew greater than 20% as growth investments in sales and marketing in the compelling value proposition of Flukes combined hardware and software product offering continued to drive outperformance in market share gains. Industrial Scientific delivered mid-teens revenue growth led by continued double-digit growth for INA [ph]. The ISC team's ongoing implementation of the Fortive business system has continued to highlight opportunities to drive significant revenue growth and margin expansion in the coming quarters. ISC recently launched the RGX gateway, a ruggedized gateway device that transmits worker location, gas reading, and real-time alerts from connected devices to INA Now platform, simplifying the process of delivering live monitoring data to the cloud for a variety of critical industrial applications. Qualitrol core sales declined high teens reflecting lower sales in China, Europe and the Middle East. This represents a continuation of the market softness that we messaged in prior quarters and which we expect to remain a headwind into 2019. Product realization platform core revenues declined slightly for the quarter led by a low single digit decline at Tektronix. EMC registered mid-single digit growth despite customer related delays in North America which we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter. The product realization platform registered a book to bill ratio greater than one for the quarter reflecting solid order momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Turning to Tektronix, excluding the large 3D and sensor order we highlighted previously, core revenue growth was low-single digits. Results were driven by strong growth in Western Europe and China offset by a decline in North America primarily reflecting delays with U.S. defense contractors. Tech industrial and automotive end markets continue to deliver double-digit growth reflecting the strong momentum created by the 5 Series and the recently introduced 6 Series mixed-signal oscilloscope. We were encouraged by positive order growth in the quarter including a strong double digit increase in orders for the 5 Series and key new customer wins for the 6 Series from Smith and Nephew and a Fortune 100 Internet technology company. Our sensing technologies platform is up slightly in the quarter led by high single digit core revenue growth at Gems, which included a large order from a leading manufacturer of heavy duty buses in the US. Core revenue declined low single digits in North America reflecting headwinds due to Hurricane Florence and difficult comparables related to a large project for the naval sea systems command from the prior year. Double digit core revenue growth in China more than offset the results in North America. Moving to our industrial technology segment, revenue grew 5.3% including core revenue growth of 4.8%. Acquisitions contributed 200 basis points of growth while unfavorable currency movements reduced growth by 150 basis points. Reported operating margin of 21.1% reflecting a core operating margin decline of 40 basis points driven by increased material costs due to inflationary pressure in tariffs as well as 40 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with Orpak acquisition. Our transportation technologies platform core revenue grew mid-single digits led by strong double-digit growth and high growth markets. Gilbarco Veeder Root delivered low single digit core revenue growth driven by mid teens increase in high growth markets. GVR generated low-single digit growth in North America reflecting the negative impact from Hurricane Florence. Continued strong double-digit core growth in China was led by demand at Veeder Root for submersible pumps and automatic tank gauges related to double wall tank upgrades. As anticipated we continue to see a pickup in EMV sales at Gilbarco, particularly with mid-tier counts and single-site owners and expect this trend to accelerate in the fourth quarter reflecting a strong North American order book. During the third quarter, GVR also made a minority investment at Tritium, a leading manufacturing of fast charging solutions for electric vehicles, providing an early entry into the EV market. GVR had a very successful showing at the recent MAX conference highlighted by a positive reception to the Tritium announcement as well as a number of new product launches such as GVR\u2019s new passport edge tablet based point of sale solution. Teletrac Navman grew mid-single digits lead by double-digit core growth at Asia Pacific and mid-single digits in Western Europe. In North America, we've continued to experience ELD implementation challenges causing accelerated customer churn. Due to the recurring revenue nature of the business, changes to the North American installed base will continue to have an unfavorable impact on Teletrac Navman\u2019s performance into 2019. Automation and specialty posted high-single digit core revenue growth for the quarter led by high-single digit increases in both North America and Western Europe. JVS delivered mid- single digit core revenue growth driven by increased class A truck production in the U.S. Results in our automation business were led by [indiscernible] where high-single digit core revenue growth continued to be driven by strong double-digit growth in robotics. The strong performance was also driven by automation\u2019s focus on high growth markets led by double-digit growth in China. We wish our entire A&S team all the best as they join the Altra team in the fourth quarter Moving to franchise distribution, the platform grew core revenue mid-single digits, Matco returned to mid-single digit growth reflecting mid-teens growth in hard line and high-single digit growth in both tool storage and power tools driven by new product launches and market share gain. Matco recently launched Maximus 3.0, a unique full featured diagnostic scan tool which automatically links to vehicle make, model, and year information and provides diagnostic reporting to a proprietary subscription-based automotive repair database called Maximus Fix. Maximus 3.0 is expected to be a key growth driver in the coming quarters while Maximus Fix provides the diagnostic platform with a meaningful new recurring revenue opportunity. To wrap up, during the third quarter, we delivered double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow despite some headwinds associated with Hurricane Florence and tariffs. We also made significant progress in our long-term portfolio transformation efforts, positioning Fortive and markets with faster top-line growth, reduced cyclicality, and enhanced opportunities to grow recurring revenue. Throughout the year, we have continued to generate strong core operating results consistent with the Fortive formula driving year to date adjusted earnings growth of 23% and a 29% increase in free cash flow, while also implementing a number of complex capital allocation strategies. With the power of the Fortive business system and the demonstrated momentum of our acquisition flywheel, we'll continue to enhance all aspects of our portfolio and our drive to deliver sustained top quality earnings growth. Turning to the guide. We are updating our full-year 2018 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $2.98 to $3.02 on a continuing operations basis, which excludes the 2018 results of the divested A&S business. The guide assumes approximately 4% core revenue growth, core operating margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points, and effective tax rate of 17.2% and a free cash flow conversion ratio of greater than 110% for the year excluding the impact of the gain from the divestiture of the A&S business. The updated adjusted diluted net EPS guidance also reflects the dilutive impact from the preferred stock offering on an if converted basis. We are also initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.83 to $0.87 which includes assumptions of 5% to 6% core revenue growth, core operating margin expansion of 75 to 100 basis points and an effective tax rate of 17.5%. Before moving to questions, we want to provide an early view on 2019 given the extensive portfolio transformation and complex capital transactions which we successfully executed in 2018. We expect closed acquisitions to collectively contribute $0.20 to $0.25 of earnings per share reflecting the addition of high margin high growth software assets. Our enhanced portfolio profile of greater than 30% recurring revenue should generate strong annuity free cash flows with gross margins exceeding 50%. The fundamentals of our core portfolio remains strong particularly in North America, with the EMV continuing to ramp, while we monitor conditions in China and packets of Europe and the Middle East. Through solid execution and the application of the Fortive business system, we expect to fully offset the unfavorable impact from announced tariffs. Assuming a stable macro environment, our remaining preliminary modelling assumptions include approximately fifty basis points of core operating margin expansion, free cash flow conversion ratio of greater than 115% and an effective tax rate in the high teens. We anticipate deleveraging quickly after the closing of ASP enabling us to maintain our investment grade rating. And lastly, we plan to offset A&S stranded cost of $0.01 to $0.02 of earnings per share with the savings generated by our 2018 restructuring efforts. In summary, it is our expectation to deliver a another year of double-digit adjusted earnings growth in 2019. And with that I\u2019d like to turn it over to Lisa. Lisa Curran : Thank you, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Brandon, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe if you could just start by helping us understand why the core sales growth accelerates quickly in Q4, I think you said 5% to 6% after just doing around 3%. So what are the biggest two or three moving pieces that get you there. Jim Lico : It is Jim, thanks. Well. I think first and foremost we as you know from few months ago, we said we thought that we'd be in the sort of 4% range for the second half -- mid-single digit range in the second half. And really this is just playing out with a slightly different cadence, some of the backlog that we talked about with the hurricane pushed into the fourth quarter, so we built backlog, it flew not only at Gilbarco, we also built backlog at Tech and Fluke. So we're walking into a good backlog situation. We talked about some of the orders at EMC as well that moved into the fourth. So we've got a movement, but it's really no change really to how we sort of see the macro or see the revenue, it's just the slightly different cadence between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Julian Mitchell : And then my second question would just be around the earnings sort of base and coupling that $3 base you gave for 2018 with the initial comments on 2019. So just to be clear, is the right way to think about it, you have the $3 base high-single digit core EBIT growth from that $0.20, $0.25 from closed deals, $0.30 for ASP. And so, if you round all of that together, we get up to sort of $3.80 or something for the next year, is that a good sort of template? Chuck McLaughlin : Hey Julian, this is Chuck. That's directly corrected, the one thing that obviously isn't closed is ASP but I think that\u2019s consistent with what we've said before, so it depends a little bit on the timing of that, but everything else I agree with. Operator : And your next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : So just to let a bit more color on what happened in Tektronix, I know you highlighted key fleet but maybe give a sense of what's happening by geography outside of Q3, we've been getting a lot of questions on Chinese semis, that seems to be okay, but whatever color you can give within Tektronix would be greatly appreciated. Jim Lico : So, as we said, if we've sort of sun-setted this 3D sensing discussion with the end of the third quarter but that had a little bit of obvious impact in it. Really as we said in the prepared remarks, Western Europe was pretty good for Tek, in particular, one of the highlights in Europe for all of Fortive and China remained good in the mid-single digit range, so we -- really the semiconductor side of that was pretty good. So we felt pretty good about the quarter in that realm. Really the -- if you will the decline -- a little of the decline in the quarter was really due to North America that was some little bit of slowness combined with some orders that moved into the fourth. So, we think we\u2019ll improve that, we know we\u2019ll improve that number in the fourth quarter and right now from what we're seeing, the headline -- look away from the headlines, but what we're actually seeing in China from an order\u2019s perspective is the continuation of the business in China with growth at Tektronix. And we're certainly watching all the things that you all watched to see if the headlines become reality, but at this point right now, the order book looks pretty good for the fourth quarter for China for Tektronix. Andrew Obin : And I just to follow up you sort of highlight Fluke Digital doing well, it seems to have accelerated recently. You did bring up some new products, but in a big picture, what has changed to accelerate growth in that business? Jim Lico : It\u2019s a great question. First I think, we're starting to see some of the hardware sales that took a little bit longer, we talked about that, the vibe sensor that we launched this quarter really a great product, a three-year life, really ease of use, really gets to a real core modality of challenge for condition monitoring. So, the killer hardware solution comes out with -- as we said, eMaint\u2019s been a good double-digit grower for -- really since we bought the business. So we're getting scale in that regard as well. So it's not -- I think we added 131 customers in the quarter as well, so the addition of new customers plus up selling to current customers and with the hardware come along, it is starting to create just some really nice tailwinds for the business. Operator : And your next question comes from Steven Winoker of UBS Steven Winoker : Hey Jim, I know you hit it a couple of times but just in good kind of FDS fashion, could you maybe give us a better sense on the why behind that simple comment you had around backlog getting pushed sequentially to Q4. When you dig into all the little pieces of what is driving this. I know you're saying it's not macro-related, but what are kind of the whys behind some of that to give us confidence like we would worry with some other companies that they may not actually see that push or get another quarter after that. Jim Lico : Clearly, one of the things you saw with cadence at GVR was that it was slightly back-end loaded quarter and then the hurricane kind of came at a time when a lot of our employees had to deal with the issues at home and things like that. And so, we lost a number of production days, which not only pushed revenue into the fourth quarter but also cost us on the cost side as well, so it was a headwind from a cost side as we put in premium freight, some of those things in order to protect the customers we could. But it was really maybe a less linear quarter than we thought, a lot of our small net -- the nice thing about the small network owners was a number of them showed up in the quarter, maybe the downside of that is they showed up later in the quarter. So that really pushes the big chunk of the backlog into the -- that we saw in the fourth quarter. The other places where we build backlog really were just large orders, some of them were customer situations, everyone has its story, but I think as we went -- as Chuck and I went through all the forecasts, we felt pretty good about -- a lot of it wasn't necessarily past due backlog but rather backlog that was just going to be due. So combination of some orders getting delayed, some customers pushing things out was really the answer. Now we're almost done with the quarter -- the month right now for us and most of those orders have already revenued. So, we feel good about the fact that those are now you know some of the improvements that we\u2019ve had. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of these government orders were really, really just took longer than we thought. And like I said, some of them have already been revenued. Steven Winoker : And then, I'd like to just shift gears to Tritium, that investment on, that you announced, I think, October 8 and mentioned just earlier in this call that seems to me like it could be a rather significant move for Gilbarco Veeder Root over time, could you maybe just expand a little bit on that in terms of how that sort of affects your thinking about the footprint and utilizing the footprint over the long term. Jim Lico : We're really excited about it, it\u2019s a prudent way to make an investment here that allows for us to sort of have the technology we need. We've got a great footprint as you know around the world with gas station owners. And we'll really you know as we're starting to talk to large scale network owners, they're wanting to -- they're starting to think about an EV solution that needs to be fast charging obviously because in a gas station it\u2019s not going to be something slow. So this faster charging technology that we've got that\u2019s IP protected is really a great advantage for us and we can globalize that business with a partner like Tritium. So, in the U.S. that's going to be mostly large network owners, in Europe, it's going to be a little bit different, it will be some of the oil and gas folks, it will be some utility. And so we'll have some slightly different partners as well to expand the business. So I think we're really excited about what we can do to help them globalize the business with that technology. We do have a right to purchase the company as well, so if things play out the way hopefully we all think and depending on timing and I think that's what I mean by prudent, we don't know necessarily the timing of electric vehicles and how long it will take for there to be meaningful investment with some of our customers, but we're getting to work as I mentioned at the National Association of Convenience Stores trade show we had a few weeks ago, we launched -- this is where we made the announcement and we had a lot of large scale customers were pretty excited about the offering. Operator : And your next question comes from Scott Davis From Melius Research. Scott Davis : Trying to get my arms around a couple of things, it\u2019s quarters when you have these big spin offs are always a little hard. When I look at kind of the color of the call, I\u2019m trying to get some granularity on if your price was up 60 basis points, are you now caught up to price cost or are you still a little behind? Chuck McLaughlin : Hey Scott, this is Chuck. So I think that we're ahead of price cost because the great work they our procurement team does and the pricing, but I think inherent in your question here is what we see is that we should accelerate from here. Scott Davis : Be at least neutral to the rising prices that are coming or costs that are coming? Chuck McLaughlin : I think rather than 60 basis points, what I'm saying is, I'd expected to be greater than that going forward. As tariffs happened to not all but some of our countermeasures are supply chain in nature but some of them are priced, but they haven't even hit yet really. So that\u2019s going to be tailwind. And we think we're in inflation -- we know we're an inflationary environment and we think that we expect to get more price than normal but then historic. Jim Lico : Scott, maybe just one thought. We'll see it accelerate in the fourth quarter as Chuck said. So, a lot of our countermeasures early in the third quarter were an attempt to kind of, what I call short term in nature and as Chuck mentioned, the supply chain and pricing things are really going to carry the water in the fourth quarter and into 2019. And we've been pretty deep into this trying to make sure that we're appropriately covered and we feel pretty good about that. The fact that we expanded gross margins in part because of the business model change in the quarter, I think also reflects that we started to get some traction in some of those efforts relative to how we go into the fourth quarter. Scott Davis : Okay, that's fair enough. And then, just back up a little bit, Gordian and Accruent. How long you think it takes to get the margin structure of businesses like that up to your segment average. Jim Lico : Gordian is pretty close already, so we -- I think by probably you know relatively quickly in both businesses, really, I think we're probably in the range of that by 2019 and into 2020. So maybe the second half of 2019 and into 2020 will be in the zone. And they are great businesses. One of the caveats of that though is as we get into it and we do 100-day strategic plans, I think the question we're going to ask ourselves is can we accelerate the growth rate. So some of that might require additional investment and we've seen that benefit at eMaint, to take it back to the question we had before, we're starting to see some of that accelerated growth at eMaint because we didn't necessarily put all the money to the bottom line early at eMaint, we decided to invest in sales and marketing. So we haven't necessarily done that yet we'll wait to sort of go through the 100-day strategic plan, but we certainly are going to look for opportunities to accelerate the growth rate with the kind of gross margins that are in those businesses and the recurring revenue, we think that would be a prudent thing to do. Scott Davis : And just really quick, I've never asked three questions and I'm going to this time because I\u2019m just trying to figure out. When you have a hurricane impact like you had, say it knocks your point of the top line or something on industrial technologies. Can you measure with any precision what kind of a margin impact that has? Jim Lico : Yeah, I think the margin impact on volume we calculate the fall through of greater than 50%. So, yeah, we\u2019ve got a pretty good idea, but the margin in terms of -- operating margin that we're talking about in PI is also the fact that with the increasing volume at Gilbarco, we're also ramping up and we are less efficient than we would normally be due to really just increase in volume we're seeing. But we\u2019ll expect IT to deliver 50 basis points of OMX I'm in the whole business for the whole year. We\u2019re going to be okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Tusa from JPMorgan. Steven Tusa : Can you talk about, you said you're watching China, what exactly specifically are you watching in China for 2019, what kind of makes you most cautious I guess, not that you are cautious, but what worries you the most out of China specifically for your business? Jim Lico : I think what we saw, we said in the prepared remarks that there were some challenging parts and what we meant by that is really the utilities, we saw where we have utilities sales principally at Qualitrol and a small part of Fluke. We clearly saw some investment going down in those parts of the business. Now they don't have the -- we still grew high-single digits, so it didn't have a huge impact. But we're watching for the particular verticals to see if there's trends. We look at our point of sale at Fluke which remains strong, but we want to continue to watch that. That\u2019s one of a good view of just the sort of day to day economy. And of course we're going to continue to watch semiconductor and electronics markets in China because of the impact that has on Tektronix. So those are probably some places that sort of move the needle if you will relative to our business. And obviously the gas station business, the GVR Veeder Root business has been secularly growing because of the investment in double walled tank and that's a trend right now that's going very well for us and so there are certain secular trends within the GVR business that we\u2019ll watch as well. Steven Tusa : And just on the tariff stuff, can you give us some color as to how you went about coming to that number, almost all of our companies are kind of coming up with some reasonably sizable numbers and they're simple way to look at it which is amount sourced from China and then applying like anywhere from 10% to 25% on that, maybe give us some color on how you came to the math that you're getting to or you think you can offset it entirely with price on a tariff side and what are you including in that you know which tariffs are you including? Jim Lico : Steve, a couple of things, first of all, price is one lever we\u2019re using, but it's not the entire lever. We're also using -- going after supply chain where we're sourcing and in some cases moving where we're going to be producing our products. But all those things come together to offset the tariffs that we see from all you know 232 and the 301, it was one, two, three, all three of those lists. We actually have -- we've got \u2013 our teams work on it and the duty team is -- sizes that very specifically and there's -- it's really pretty prescriptive and we feel like we have a rather exact amount, I mean, we ship more and there will be more duties, but we have a good handle on exactly what it is and therefore, we've been matched up to countermeasures. There's generally a lag. We are seeing a lag of when a new tariff. I\u2019m not saying that we more new tariffs, but new tariff goes in, where it takes us probably better part of the quarter or at least a couple months to get them in. It takes us a quarter to fully offset that in a run rate. And so since we last talked, there's been new list put out and so that's why it's giving us a little bit of -- a little more hit in the back end, but as I say, we've got it handled and offset in 2019. Steven Tusa : So what's the total number, year-over-year cost that you have to overcome? Chuck McLaughlin : In the range of 50 million to 70 million. Operator : And your next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : I want to go back to the price question again and if I heard it correctly, you said you had 4 out of 6 businesses had positive price. So who didn't get price and any kind of calibration in terms of the ranges of price you're getting, any pushback from customers and what more you can do there? Jim Lico : Yeah. I think part of -- first and foremost, I think as we look at the price metric, as we said 60 bps, in every quarter, we'll have a few businesses that maybe don't hit that number. I think product realization, we didn't hit it, in part, because we've got some contract in the third quarter with some new US military folks that carry price reductions as an example. But, on balance, we're really looking at the full year. And as we look into -- I suspect we\u2019ll be in a good position as we get to the sort of second half price, we\u2019ll find that most of the platforms will have gotten price at that point. So, that's really how we think about it and as Chuck mentioned on the previous question, we're going to see an acceleration of price. Most of the price increases are in, so the gross price is in. So, from that perspective, I think we're going to be -- we're going to be in good shape to continue to offset any price inflation, any cost inflation that we have, whether it be tariffs or anything else, plus gain some of that price as the margin expansion opportunity as well in \u201919. Deane Dray : And then just separate topic, with the welcoming of Gordian and Accruent, it just becomes increasingly obvious that your current segmentation doesn't quite fit the new look for Fortive. So what kind of thought have you given to re-segmenting and what might that look like? Jim Lico : Well, I think that we\u2019ve notice similar things as we\u2019re really excited with Gordian and Accruent and our acquisitions to come on board, but our current thinking is that we\u2019ll wait till we get to the other side of the ASP business. And then that sets the timing, that will make sense, probably looking at a platform level, of course, that's what's going to make the most sense and it will be after that. That's what I'd expect. Operator : And your next question comes from Michael Coe from Wolfe. Nigel Coe : This is Nigel Coe for Michael Coe. So, you\u2019re making us work pretty hard late at night here. So, maybe a little bit of help on the 5% to 6% for 4Q. I guess, would you expect both segments to be in that range or are we seeing IT about that range with the GVR ramp up and maybe PI is still seeing some of these headwinds. Any color there, in particular on some of the three or four major businesses will be helpful? Jim Lico : I think, well, we should see pretty evenly distributed. So, I suspect around those numbers, so probably in the -- it will be in the range of each other probably. I don't think we'll see an enormous delta between the two to be honest with you, Nigel. And I think you'll see the continuation of businesses, like Fluke to see the continuations, you see some acceleration at Gilbarco, you will see good acceleration at Tektronix as examples. It's kind of hard for us to not move the needle up in the whole business without the big businesses going up. So I think you'll start to see that, some of that will be backlog related and some of that will be just demand that we see. So that's sort of our assumptions that, regionally, we sort of think the US will continue to be pretty good. As we mentioned, Western Europe, Europe broadly defined, well, we think of EMEA, maybe a little weakening. So parts of western Europe, but also Russia and the Middle East, Russia and the Middle East have been weaker and we would see that continuing and continue to see China and Asia be pretty good. So, I think that's kind of how we think about it regionally and maybe give you a -- but we think the big businesses for the most part, Fluke hanging in there, Midco hanging, Gilbarco and Tek probably being a little bit better. Nigel Coe : And then looking at the IT segment ex-automation, I think the number are working, it is about a 20% margin for the new segments. You mentioned China costs, are all the China costs from the automation divestment in that segment and how does that look? And then as you start to weigh those China cost, any qualification on the cost would be helpful? Chuck McLaughlin : Yeah. They're not really that big a cost, but you\u2019re right, they\u2019re in the IT segment and we'll get after them in the fourth quarter. We've got some opportunity here with some acquisitions to redeploy these people. So it's not necessarily needing that much restructuring dollars to get them out, though there could be some, but we'll get after that and it is in the IT section. Nigel Coe : And then just quickly on ASP and I understand that China not quite for that deal. Is that because the -- it doesn't meet the threshold for China sales? Jim Lico : Yeah, essentially yeah, that\u2019s the easiest way to think about it. I think as we think about all the regulatory hurdles we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that we got through the European Works Council, consultations, which was a good step and we don't really see any issues with China, principally because it's not -- there's really no anti-trust work at all. So, it's really focused on setting up subsidiaries and things like that, which are much simpler -- much hard to do, but much simpler than things like -- waiting for anti-trust approval. Operator : And your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. John Inch : So the core margin decline in the quarter of 25 basis points. Jim, you had thought -- you and Chuck had thought the margins will be up 30 to 50. Is the Delta the lost production days, the lower volume, is there some way to just sort of parse that out in terms of what accounted for that difference. Jim Lico : Yeah. John, there is two things. One is evenly split between the production and volume we would have got flowing through it, greater than 50% margin and the other, as we mentioned, we are accelerating into our Gilbarco business and we saw some maybe growing pains and increase in the volume there, and we will -- we expect to do better coming in to Q4, but those are the two things that really drive us down from where we thought we would be on our core OMX in Q3. John Inch : Does this stuff kind of play out Jim toward the end of the quarter in terms of say September, the weaker volumes and stuff or was this kind of a trend that you noticed that was relatively consistent? Jim Lico : Well, I think there were two things. There's the EMB wave that came in that was maybe towards the end, but there's other things that happened during the quarter that got pushed down, that really are unrelated to that. And some one time customer pushouts that just moved things into October. John Inch : Field solutions, I think, it was up to low single versus mid-single last quarter and the compares looked about the same. It does sounded pretty upbeat on Fluke basement commentary. Was it all qualified that drove that lower realized growth rate or was Fluke also a little bit softer? Jim Lico : I think Fluke was a little softer, maybe 100 bps or something like that, but it's the big delta there is Qualitrol. We have been working with the business, try to work in a tough market and they just had a tougher quarter than -- really around the world as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. So, ISC did great, Fluke did great, so it's really and we think that will continue and we're continuing to work on countermeasures at Qualitrol. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we think that's going to \u2013 luckily, that's one of our smaller businesses, but it is going to probably continue into 2019 year is what we can tell at this point. John Inch : I mean, Jim, how confident are you -- I mean, the big businesses like Fluke, Tektronix, given what's going on in the global economy, you\u2019ve outperformed in China and Europe, it looks like a little bit, but not every company is. I'm just -- you've lived through these sort of periods before. I mean, how do you respond? Like, are you guys doubling down various efforts, are you thinking about other kind of measures for possible global softening, I mean what\u2019s sort of the playbook? Jim Lico : Yeah. Well, unfortunately, I have been through this kind of thing too many times, but I think at the end of the day, what Chuck and I really have done is we will go through the budget cycle with the businesses here in the coming weeks here and we'll really sit down on an individual by individual basis to understand where they think their revenue is going to be and it is really going to be -- certain businesses are going to probably have opportunities. I think right now, it's still a little early. We're trying to manage, trying to understand the headlines versus the reality, as I mentioned in China, I think there's -- we have seen, as I mentioned, some places where demand has moved, but in other places, we haven't really seen anything any change and so we're going to maintain a realistic view while we continue to see how things go and I think this idea that globally I mean I think we're already having listened to a lot of peers talk about this already and certainly others and having talked with several CEOs as well, I think we definitely know that this globally tuned growth is probably not happening now and so it's going to be more important to make our bets correctly and we know how to do that. And while at the same time, making sure we take advantage of opportunities like we mentioned, North America EMV. We think is going to be a tailwind for us next year and so we want to make sure we take advantage of those opportunities. Operator : And your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Currency in this quarter I think has been a fair amount of [indiscernible] transactional cost headwind, how should we think about currency going forward for you guys. Look, just in a few emerging markets that you saw where currency really moved, and was the impact really containing the Q3, could you see any in Q4 and beyond? Chuck McLaughlin : Andy, it\u2019s Chuck. We saw little FX movements and it costs us about probably a penny in the quarter, but we don't, if you're asking about hedging, we don't hedge for that. We just think that currencies move and we need to deal with those things and in general, if they move enough, then we have to adjust our cost structure, but we're not seeing huge dollars for us in our businesses right -- in the third quarter at all. Jim Lico : Andy, we do spend a lot of time with our teams on street price within each country. So where we've seen currency movement, we want to make sure that our street prices are impacted, we're taking prices up or dealing with that. So that's a pretty common piece of work that our operating company leaders do on a regular basis. Andrew Kaplowitz : Can you mention the strong order book, given in North America and obviously there was a hurricane impact in the quarter. I think you said these are good low single digits in North America. What would it have grown it? And then as you look into next year, have you gotten good visibility toward that acceleration that you've been talking about? Jim Lico : Yeah. A few months ago, we said that we thought that, GBR would probably be mid-single digit in the second half and we still view that. It's just going to be probably a little -- slightly higher mid-single digits in the fourth quarter and obviously low single digits in the third. So, the cadence of it changes a little bit, because of the movement of shipments, but I think our view of the world and the business is pretty close to the same. We would like to see the, I think, we'll start to see some of the larger customers come into the order book here in the fourth quarter and we're obviously looking for that, but we feel good about what they've got for a forecast at this point given the order book. Operator : And your next question is from Richard Eastman from Baird. Richard Eastman : I want to just return to EMEA for a minute. Again, kind of this low single digit growth rate, we talked a little bit about Qualitrol. I think you said JVS was weak, but is the trend at all kind of disturbing here, as we kind of head into -- again head into \u201819. Do you see some of these businesses and maybe you could give a little bit more color on Western Europe versus Middle East in that low single digit growth rate, but just kind of talk about maybe an inflection point, here in that region. Jim Lico : Yeah. Well, I think, for sure, we don't have a huge business in Russia. So, it doesn't necessarily move the needle for us, but a lot of folks talk about EMEA and they're talking about this kind of the way they run the business, right, which is a leader usually runs all those places and really we think about Western Europe. Fluke point of sale is an example and Western Europe was actually pretty good. So that gives us some sense of optimism that some things are there, but then we've got a pretty decent sized business in Italy, as an example of GVR. That was obviously -- that was hindered. We mentioned the Qualitrol situation as well. I think at this point, it's hard -- it's too early to tell what Europe might look like for \u201919, but I think as we think about Western Europe, we've had really three really strong years in Western Europe and I think that the mid-single digit growth that we saw in the last several years is definitely moving to low single digit and we certainly heard the decline in this quarter, so I'm not sure I would call it a decline next year, but we're certainly seeing a slowing broadly defined. Richard Eastman : And then just a very quick question on -- you just mentioned Fluke health solutions and kind of in passing, so this is this basically, you said it was plus double digits, that is still primarily Fluke biomedical. How did Landauer perform in the quarter and what are the prospects there? Jim Lico : Yeah. They were mid-single digit in the quarter. Fluke Health had a very good quarter. In fact, we were with the team yesterday for their strategic plan, really excited about how they're bringing the integration together, how they're really thinking more broadly about a broader set of solutions now that they've got all these different customer set. So, they certainly outperformed in the quarter for sure, but we\u2019re ahead of where we wanted to be with Landauer at this point and now the team is really working on some strategies to stay ahead and I think we're very excited about what that team is doing. Operator : And your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Two things for me. First, just on EMV. Can you give us a sense of now what you're actually expecting in 2019 as a growth rate of this modestly rebased 2018? Jim Lico : I think, we think right now is probably looking, I mean, it's crystal ball would say probably mid-single digit for next year. Jeffrey Sprague : And then secondarily just trying to sort through actually the margins and kind of the deal accounting noise. Just a little confused on the transaction costs, kind of the 90 bps or so that's in PI, that\u2019s only roughly 8 million So, Chuck, is rest of that 56 million that we see in the bridge, is that just in other? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes. That's in other because you don't really have ASP in one of those segments appropriately and ANS is not going to be there going forward. Jeffrey Sprague : And then other looks like it's then kind of inherently low if we pull that out, is there something else going on there? Jim Lico : No. I don't think so. I didn't think he\u2019d picked that was well, we've got normal corporate cost in that as well. Jeffrey Sprague : This 58 million, if I take out, close to 50 million, it seems like a low number, but I\u2019ll follow up. Jim Lico : Yeah. We can follow that, but I think of the total amount there's some of it's in to the businesses, Gordian and Accruent did get in there. So you're missing about 18 million I think relative to the deal cost, social security, but we can follow up on that. Operator : And your next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital. Scott Graham : Just I'm looking at the slide 9, the bridge, the initial thinking on 2019. And the closed acquisitions, when we throw ASP in there, we consider ANS, it looks kind of like largely a push, correct me if I'm wrong, and I'm sure when you transact in the amount that you have and still will with ASP that I guess that's kind of not what you're thinking that you would want sort of net accretion there. So how does the pipeline look right now and could you give us an idea of what your capacity is at this moment and do the acquisitions that have closed and with ASP coming, is that going to slow you down a bit Jim Lico : So we'll tag team this one. I think the funnel looks good right now. I think as we've talked, over the last couple of years, we continue to see opportunities available to us. The Gordian and the Accruent deals bring new parts of the funnel. That's the nice thing about those acquisitions. They come with new market opportunities, new serve market opportunities in which we can look at and they -- because they were PE, they were pretty active on the M&A front, and so they come really with funnels already in hand. And so we've got some opportunities there. ASP does as well but obviously we will wait to close that deal. So I think first and foremost we like the funnel, we like the situation we\u2019re in, we've been pretty busy over the last 90 days, that's for sure, but we don't necessarily slow the market work down, the cultivation work down and so the opportunities are still there. So, the current market situation is going on, so over the last couple weeks, obviously the consternation and that kind of thing probably shakes the trees on some other things but we haven't seen those yet. Chuck McLaughlin : And then Scott to your other questions, I just simply say we have 2 billion, 2.5 billion of room that maintains investment grade in 2019 and then with our strong cash flow, as we said, we keep to de-lever, work to de-lever going forward. In terms of slide 9 I think if you're saying a push, if you mean a push from this year, I think you need to add in what's not in there is -- and we can work with the offline on this is the organic margin expansion or the ASP, you might, you\u2019re probably missing that. Scott Graham : Actually what I meant was on the acquisitions that looks like the closed acquisitions plus ASP minus ANS is roughly a push, is that a fair estimate. Chuck McLaughlin : No. It\u2019s complicated and it\u2019s easier to come pass line, but you're missing the retired shares that comes with the ultra-deal, which is understandable and how the mentor convert plays into that. So let's walk you through that, but I think that there is not an exact push track. Scott Graham : The other question is along this same page is, I didn't hear you talk about organic at all, but and I know that at the investor meeting, I think you were kind of being pushed to move up your long term target of GDP, GDP plus, but with things a little bit weaker in Europe and some concerns in China, but then you add in a little faster growth acquisitions, can we still stay at that GDP, GDP plus level for organic for next year. Jim Lico : I think we try to give you early color even before our budget. So I think I\u2019d stay away from any specific numbers at this point till we see how the quarter played out. See how we end, that has some influence in it is well, but we certainly think that that's in the range of options for sure. So I think -- we'll certainly as we get closer to it, provide some deeper level of insight as to that goes. What we tried to do with the 2019 early view is really just to try to give you a little bit of how we're thinking about this, given all the puts and takes that have occurred as you and Chuck were just talking about. We wanted to make sure, you at least had some view of how we're thinking about it and as we get more details, we'll obviously share them with you. Operator : And your next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Tristan Margo : Yeah. This is Tristan in for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick quiet here, what's the share count that you\u2019re using for your 4Q guide. Chuck McLaughlin : I guess 356 million. Operator : And there are no more questions in queue. Jim Lico : Okay. Well, thanks everybody for the time this evening on the East Coast. We really appreciate all the time and energy you put into really help and really listen to our discussion. We're exceptionally excited, I think, the third quarter to use the word transformational would be an understatement with everything we were able to accomplish in the quarter. We're incredibly pleased with where we sit today and we're even more excited about what we can do with these businesses here in the coming months and in years. So thanks for your time, we'll look forward to seeing many of you in various places here throughout the fall, but thanks for your time and certainly Lisa and the IR team are available for questions and follow up. Thanks everybody. Have a great night. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Our performance in the fourth quarter provided a strong finish to 2018, capping off another transformational year for Fortive. Looking at the full year, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $3.06 on a continuing operations basis, a 25% increase year-over-year, driven by 4.1% core revenue growth and 35 basis points of core operating margin expansion. The strong top line performance of our core portfolio reflected solid execution against a range of ongoing growth initiatives as we drove product innovation and invested in our market-leading brands in order to continue to enhance our competitive advantage, take market share and position Fortive for sustained outperformance over the long term. Over the course of 2018, our team significantly accelerated the portfolio transformation process that we have pursued since our spin. During the year, we announced several strategically significant transactions, including the acquisitions of Gordian and Accruent, the divestiture of the A&S business to Altra and the pending acquisition of Johnson & Johnson Advanced Sterilization Products business. These transactions greatly advance our stated strategy to reposition the portfolio in higher growth, less cyclical markets. Taken together, the total acquisitions announced since the spin represent $1.7 billion in total revenue on an annualized basis, growing at a high single-digit rate. These acquisitions, which average 70% recurring revenue, greatly enhance the recurring revenue profile of the Fortive portfolio. The acquisitions of Gordian and Accruent advance the execution of Fortive's digital strategy which is focused on addressing a range of critical software-enabled workflows for our customers. Both Gordian and Accruent are off to a good start, demonstrating growth momentum through the end of the year. Turning to ASP. We made significant progress during the fourth quarter employing the Fortive Business System to prepare for a successful transition of the business to the Fortive family. Consistent with what Johnson & Johnson recently announced, we now expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2019. We're very excited about the contribution ASP will make once it's integrated into Fortive, and we look forward to discussing the company and the opportunities ahead when the transaction closes. With that, I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $325.1 million, up 30% over the prior year, and adjusted diluted net earnings-per-share were $0.91. Sales grew 11.4% to $1.8 billion, reflecting a core revenue increase of 7.4%. All platforms posted core revenue growth highlighted by Transportation Technologies, product realization and sensing technologies as well as very strong performance of Fluke and Industrial Scientific. Acquisitions, including Gordian and Accruent, contributed 580 basis points of top line growth, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 180 basis points. Geographically, high-growth markets core revenue grew high single digits with continued strength in Asia and Latin America. This growth was led by Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Tektronix and Fluke. China, in particular, posted a strong quarter with low double-digit growth. While we remain cautious about certain parts of the China market, we are pleased with the continued outperformance in the fourth quarter and our strengthening competitive position. Developed markets' core revenue grew high single digits, reflecting continued strength in North America. Core revenue growth in North America was high single digits, led by strong performances at GVR, Fluke, EMC and Industrial Scientific. Western Europe grew low single digits, led by high single digit growth at GVR and Sensing Technologies and mid-single-digit growth at Tektronix. In the fourth quarter, we posted a gross margin of 51.1%, our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margins at or above 50%. Pricing accelerated to 80 basis points with four platforms delivering positive price during the quarter. Operating profit margin was 16.8% with core operating margins increasing 40 basis points as strong PPV and productivity were partially offset by the dilutive impact of tariffs in unfavorable mix during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we generated $387 million of free cash flow, representing a seasonally strong conversion ratio of 166%. We generated free cash flow for the full year of $1.1 billion, an increase of $180 million or 20% on a year-on-year basis. We were also pleased to see our annual free cash flow conversion increase to 120%, an 800 basis points increase from the prior year. Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 14%, including core revenue growth of 5.2%. Acquisitions contributed 1,020 basis points, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 140 basis points. Reported operating margin of 16.1% reflected 545 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions and transaction expenses. Core margins were flat, reflecting the dilutive impact of tariffs at Fluke and Tektronix and some one-time warranty-related expenses in the quarter. Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue increased mid-single digits during the quarter, driven by continued outperformance at Fluke and ISC and strong growth at Tektronix. Field solutions core revenue grew low single digits, highlighted by mid-single-digit growth in developed markets, including strong performance for Fluke and ISC in North America. This growth was partially offset by a slight decline in high-growth markets due to continued weakness at Qualitrol. China, however, posted a strong quarter with low double-digit-core growth. Fluke delivered mid-single-digit core growth, led by midteens growth at Fluke Calibration, and mid-single-digit growth at Fluke Industrial. Fluke had a strong finish to the year in China, highlighted by the increasing momentum behind Fluke's e-commerce efforts, which saw strong point of sale increases and continued share gains for its handheld products. Fluke Health Solutions saw a strong contribution from Landauer, which performed ahead of our expectations in its first full year within Fortive. The team leveraged FBS both commercially and in the factory, finishing with mid-single-digit growth and 270 basis points of gross margin expansion for the year and positioning the business to deliver strong returns in 2019 and beyond. We're excited about the progress we continue to see at Fluke Digital Systems. The eMaint CMMS offering continues to deliver strong growth, up greater than 20% for the quarter and full year. Fluke's innovative sensor offerings were a key element of its digital strategy needed to generate a strong positive response from customers, including the Fluke 3561 Vibration Sensor, which was recently named a 2018 Breakthrough Product by Processing Magazine. Industrial Scientific delivered low double-digit growth, led by North America and Asia. iNet saw greater than 20% growth for the quarter, while rental revenue increased high single digits. During the quarter, ISC completed the transition of the iNet offering to a fully cloud-based solution, enabling the delivery of better speed and uptime to our customers. ISC's commitment to FBS continues to yield strong operational improvements, including a significant decrease in working capital and related increase in free cash flow over the course of the year. Qualitrol's core revenue declined high teens during the quarter, in line with our expectations, reflecting continued softness across its core geographic markets. We continue to expect the soft market conditions that challenge Qualitrol throughout the year to remain a headwind well into 2019. Product realization core revenue increased high single digits for the quarter, led by high single-digit growth at Tektronix and midteens growth in EMC. EMC posted a record quarter for revenue as it delivered against the backlog it carried into the quarter, including the volume that had been subject to customer-related delays, as mentioned last quarter. Given strong order flow, EMC finished the year with record backlog, setting up well for continued growth in 2019. Growth at Tektronix was broad-based across both developed and high-growth markets. Developed markets saw mid-single-digit growth, driven by Japan, North America and Western Europe. We are pleased to see another quarter of double-digit growth for Tek in China driven by strong performance at Keithley. Tek continues to benefit from momentum it has generated from its targeted higher growth end markets. New product introductions remain a key driver of Tek's growth, reflecting the continued momentum behind the 5 and 6 Series oscilloscopes, which saw key customer wins in both the automotive and power end markets during the quarter. Our sensing technologies platform increased high single digits in the quarter. All of the platforms' major regions saw strong growth, including high single-digit growth in Western Europe and mid-single-digit growth in North America and China. The strong performance in the quarter was driven by industrial and medical end markets as well as revenue shifted from the previous quarter due to hurricane-related delays. We are excited about the number of new product initiatives across the sensing platform that launched in the fourth quarter, including the Setra next-generation industrial pressure transducer, the AXD, which is well positioned to gain market share based on superior range of features and functionality. Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenue grew 8.1%, including core revenue growth of 10.3%. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduce growth by 230 basis points. Reported operating margin of 20.5% reflected a core operating margin increase of 95 basis points, driven by the incrementals on the strong volume in the quarter. Our Transportation Technologies platform core revenue grew low double digits, led by greater than 20% growth in high-growth markets and low double-digit growth in developed markets. Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivered midteens core revenue growth, driven by midteens increase in developed markets and a greater than 20% increase in high-growth markets. Developed markets were led by North America, reflecting strong EMV sales. As expected, Gilbarco continue to see an acceleration in EMV sales, including a major customer win at Murphy's USA and the continued strength of our programs with Shell and Chevron. China saw midteens core growth driven by continued demand at Veeder-Root for submersible pumps and automatic tank gauges related to ongoing double-walled tank upgrades. GVR's performance in high-growth markets also included significant growth in India and synergies from the combined Gilbarco and Orpak product offering continue to drive share gains to enhance GVR's strong position in that market. Orpak continues to perform well globally, exceeding expectations and generating greater than 50% of revenue from software to enhance GVR's recurring revenue profile. TeletracNavman declined low single digits as low double-digit core growth in Asia Pacific was more than offset by high teens decline in North America. TeletracNavman continues to perform well in Asia Pacific where the fourth quarter represented the 11th quarter out of 12 with double-digit core revenue growth. In North America, we have continued to experience a high level of customer churn which remains a headwind for the business in 2019. Moving to franchise distribution. The platform grew core revenue low single digits. Matco delivered low single-digit growth, reflecting strong performance from diagnostic and specialty tools. Tool storage grew low single digits during the fourth quarter, and we are pleased with that -- with how that category performed over the second half of 2018, particularly within our premium tool storage product line. Matco's Maximus 3.0 diagnostic scan tool platform continues to perform well, driving improving growth in diagnostics category and accelerating recurring revenue opportunities from the sale of MaximusFix, Matco's proprietary subscription-based automotive repair database. The Max 3.0 is expected to be a consistent growth driver in the coming quarters as Matco continues to roll out additional features and enhancements in the platform. To wrap up, we ended the year with a significantly enhanced portfolio with exposure to better end markets tied to attractive secular drivers, reduced cyclicality, a growing share of recurring revenue and consistently robust free cash flow. This enhanced portfolio has us well positioned to continue to drive organic growth and innovation while also deploying our growing free cash flow into acquisitions that will accelerate our strategy and enhance our long-term competitive advantage. Alongside this portfolio of transformation, we continue to generate strong core operating results consistent with the Fortive formula, driving full year adjusted earnings growth of 25% and increasing free cash flow conversion to 120%. This year, once again, demonstrated the power of the Fortive Business System, enabling our team to execute a series of complex capital allocation strategies to transform our portfolio while driving innovation to better meet our customer need and delivering sustained top quartile earnings growth for our shareholders. Turning to the guide. We are initiating our full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $3.40 to $3.50, representing year-over-year growth of 11% to 14% on a continuing operations basis. This does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of ASP. The guide also assumes 3% to 5% core revenue growth, core operating margin expansion of 50 basis points, an effective tax rate of 17% and free cash flow conversion ratio of greater than 120% for the year. The adjusted diluted net EPS guidance also reflects the dilutive impact from the mandatory convertible preferred stock on an if-converted basis. The fundamentals across our enhanced portfolio remain strong, and we once again expect to outdeliver -- outperform and deliver sustainable double-digit earnings growth in the year ahead. We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.64 to $0.68, which includes an assumption of 3% to 4% core revenue growth, core operating margin expansion of 25 to 50 basis points and an effective tax rate of 17%. In closing, I'd like to extend my personal thanks and appreciation to our Fortive teammates across the world for their continued dedication to our shared purpose of delivering essential technology for the people who accelerate progress. It is the commitment of our team which provides the foundation for our enduring culture of continuous improvement and it enables us to consistently deliver value for our customers and top quartile returns for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Griffin. Griffin Whitney : Thanks, Jim. Before we move into questions, I'd like to take this opportunity to announce that Fortive will host its Annual Investor and Analyst Day on May 16, 2019, in New York City. Further details will be circulated soon. That concludes our formal comments, and we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : I wanted to reconcile a little bit -- guys, and I know you don't have all the answers in the world, none of us do on China, but you said cautious on China, but all your numbers looked really pretty strong across the board. Is there anything in your forward order book or anything more tangible other than kind of what we all read in the newspaper? James Lico : Well, I think there's a couple of things, Scott. One, yes, you're right, we had another very strong year of performance in China. We finished strong. I suspect some of that had to do with maybe a little bit of business that maybe got pulled in as people were maybe avoiding price increases and stuff, but unbalanced, a very strong quarter fourth quarter for China as you identified. I think we are basing this on a couple of things. One, we're going to sunset some slower -- the -- like the double-walled tank upgrade at Gilbarco, as an example, that's going to slow down a little bit in the back half of the year. So that's one thing that we kind of know. We certainly think that we've seen some -- we believe there will be some slowing of some of the business at Tektronix, and we've seen that a little bit in the order book, still good growth, mid-single-digit growth, but probably a little slowing up as double digits that we've been in. So those are couple of examples. We continue to believe we're outperforming, and certainly it's early days. You've heard me say this a few times that January and February don't tell you a lot in China. You really have to get to March before you have a sense for that. And so I think we'll -- as we turn the corner in the first quarter, we'll have a better sense if that number has some upside to it. Scott Davis : Okay. Fair enough. And then, I'm normally not nitpicky like this but I'll say it anyways. So your 50 basis point margin guide -- I mean, you lost about 50 bps in a year to acquisitions, I think, on the gross margin line at least, and I would think getting those businesses kind of back to some sort of level of fully integrated and normal could be a nice tailwind. I guess what I'm asking is, how much of that 50 bps is fixing what you bought versus what you're going to get naturally out of your 4% core revenue growth midpoint number? Charles McLaughlin : So the 50 bps for the year, we've always got things that happened during the year and every year. So there's got some pluses and minuses. And so yes, the -- we will fix some of those things at the end of the year and they won't repeat. There could be other things that come in, but that -- we might have upside to that number for the year. But we are having to overcome the impacts of tariffs. And while we've offset them at the EPS level, when you take price to offset the tariffs, that falls through at zero OMX, zero OPs, so it gives you a little bit of an optical headwind there. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Just a first question maybe on the first quarter guidance. So you have core growth guided pretty similar for Q1 as for the year. EPS, though, is starting out kind of flattish year-on-year with the total year up low double digit. So maybe just help us understand the bridge there. Is it all about a lot of FX headwinds in the quarter? And then the margins, it's the tariff issue and some cost inflation? Maybe just any color on that. Charles McLaughlin : Yes, thanks, Julian. A couple of things. As you noted, there's FX, we're got $0.04 of FX headwind in the year. Half of that is sitting in Q1. So there's a couple pennies there. Our tax rate is up year-over-year. We had -- it's 17%, still really good. Those are the -- those are probably three big things they caught. And while I think we're guiding nominally lower in Q1 at 3% to 4% rather than 3% to 5% for the year, and that's reflecting maybe a little stronger finish in Q4. I think those are the main puts and takes there. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And then my second question, when we're thinking about professional instruments, specifically, what kind of core incremental margins should we expect for 2019 in terms of expansion? And maybe how quickly do we see that? Or do you anticipate Q1 you still have a bunch of these maybe warranty issues and inflation to get over? I guess I'm trying to ask how back-end loaded you think the core margin expansion is at PI this year. Charles McLaughlin : No, so the warranty impact is a one-time that we booked in Q4, and so that's not going to be a drag going forward. Normally, I think what we would expect probably 30% to 40% in VCM's incrementals falling through in the quarter and in the year. And just on the back-end loaded, I think we're pretty level loaded after Q1. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Charles Tusa : You mentioned the price-offsetting tariffs. What is the level of price you have embedded in that 3% to 5%? Charles McLaughlin : Probably, well, we did 80 bps of price in Q4, and now we expect it to trend up from there as it has done all year. It might -- it probably would get all the way to 100 bps, 1%. Charles Tusa : Okay. And then on the -- on GVR for the year, what are you assuming for growth in GVR? And how much of that is a function of -- I guess you mentioned there was the other regulation dropping off, but obviously the EMV stuff is rolling in here. So maybe just talk about how fast GVR can grow and then what you're expecting on kind of headwinds and tailwinds from these various regulatory drivers. James Lico : Yes, so Steve, it's Jim. So I think we're sort of looking at mid-single digit with -- at Gilbarco right now for the year. They finished stronger than we expected so some of that overage in the fourth quarter was certainly Gilbarco with double-digit growth in the quarter. So we think they're -- well, they're going to continue to be strong through the year. And while the double wall had some impact on our overall China number, in the big -- in the bigger business that we have at Gilbarco, it's not going to be a tremendous headwind. So they've continued to do well in other high-growth markets like India. So we think on balance, their high-growth business will be pretty good this year. Those markets are a little lumpy, so it can move around from quarter-to-quarter, but we think the high-growth markets from Gilbarco will be good this year. And then back to EMV, we feel -- we saw good business, we saw strength, and customers clearly are starting to think about the trends going forward and some of the things that they need to do to be in compliance by the end of 2020. So I think, as we said in July, we saw -- I think Gilbarco played out slightly stronger than we thought where we were when we were in July. Charles Tusa : Why wouldn't Gilbarco be better than mid-singles than -- if that's the case? Don't you have really easy comps here in the first half of the year? I mean -- or you're just being conservative on this front? James Lico : I think, like anything else, we -- the year, there's certainly probably potential upside, but I think at the end of the day, we did finish very strong. So the fourth quarter does impact the full year number. It will probably be a little bit better in the first half than that number, and then -- but then obviously were going to have a really tough comp off the double-digit number that we just posted in the fourth quarter. So yes, we'll probably -- you'll probably see some higher growth rates probably as an example in the first quarter. If you remember, we had some ERP issues last year in the first quarter, so we will see probably higher than that mid-single-digit number in the first quarter for sure. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim, could you talk about Western Europe actually? I mean, it was up low single digits which is better than last quarter, I think you were down low single digits. And as you know, there are concerns about growth over there. So what actually improved in the quarter? And what's embedded in your growth forecast for 2019 in that region? Charles McLaughlin : You're -- Andy, you're talking about Western Europe, right? Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes, correct. James Lico : Yes, so we were a little better -- still low single digit in the quarter, in the fourth, Andy, than -- so that came in around where we thought it was going to come in, and we've been a little down in, I think, in the third quarter. So even though the fourth quarter was a little better than the third, we still think Europe is probably low to low single kind of environment, maybe until -- maybe touches mid-single, but I think we still are conservative on the European forecast right now based on a lot of the things we've seen, and we all know about and just things we've seen as an example on a point of sale. We had -- one of the drivers in the quarter was Gilbarco. We've had a pretty good mid-single-digit quarter in the fourth, and we don't expect necessarily that to continue through in Europe for the whole year, so -- of 2019, so I think a low single-digit kind of view of Western Europe is kind of where we're at right now. Andrew Kaplowitz : And I was intrigued by your comments on China in the -- to the extent that you said that your competitive position continues to strengthen there. So maybe you can elaborate that on a bit -- elaborate on that a bit. I think you mentioned e-commerce at Fluke, obviously you're doing well in GVR. So could you materially beat in terms of market share in 2019 and as you go forward versus the market in China? James Lico : Yes. I think the Fluke performance for the quarter was very good, and obviously we've got a long history there of building products for that market, building and having both production and design capability over there to really build product -- really beat China for the China market. And so I think we just continue to build the business. Ironically, and I think a great example of our benchmark, a lot of e-commerce efforts that we've put in over there really came from Tektronix, and they started that. So I think it's a great example of learning from each other in those businesses. So I think certainly, we have pretty good sense that we're doing pretty well in the places you just mentioned. And our Tek performance is good. It's always hard to gauge against others there from a share position. Things kind of move around, but I think we'll now have had three years in a row of double-digit growth in China, so those numbers feel pretty good. So those are our three biggest businesses, and that's the basis for kind of our belief that we're outperforming, if you will, and I think we can continue to outperform as well. Andrew Kaplowitz : And you're thinking mid-single-digit growth for China in 2019 based on what you have noted up? James Lico : That's right. That's where we're at right now. I think as I mentioned before, having been in China a lot over the course of 20 years, January and February don't because the Chinese New Year don't give you a lot of color. You really got to get into March. So our best view right now with what we've seen from a point of sale perspective and what customers are telling us is mid-single digit. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Just two things for me. Just first, on J&J, closed maybe a little bit later than you hoped, but relative to your expectation, should we still be thinking about kind of roughly $0.30 on an annualized full year run-rate basis for the first full year of ownership? Charles McLaughlin : Yes, I think nothing's changed from the first four quarters moving forward. I think that's -- I think we said $0.30 to $0.35 last quarter and nothing's changed from that. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay, great. And then with respect to the EMV question, maybe a little bit to Steve's point, I just thought '19 would be a little bit stronger, too, to avoid maybe kind of a big fire drill in 2020 on the compliance deadline. Do you see a situation lining up where 2020 is kind of a big scramble? Or do you expect kind of a smooth acceleration into that compliance deadline? James Lico : I think what we've seen -- first of all, we had a stronger finish in '18. So that has some -- as I mentioned before. So we still think '19, with the numbers we're seeing, are going to be -- they're going to be good numbers. Jeff, I think at this point, we're starting to think more of the other way, that things are going to move and stretch into 2021 a little bit more. So no one's got a perfect crystal ball here right now, but as we talked to folks, we think people are going to make decisions based on their liabilities, so some of the larger customers are looking at where they're -- where they've had liability thus far, and we'll make some intelligent decisions about their upgrades based on that. So our crystal ball right now probably says things are -- continue to be good, but they probably push into 2021 right now. Operator : And our next question is from the line of John Inch from Gordon Haskett. John Inch : I think, Jim, you said Tek in China is going to go from double digit to mid-single in 2019. What -- based on the guidance, what actually happens to Fluke and Tek in -- based on your guidance 2019? And what do they do in 2018, if you could remind us? Charles McLaughlin : Corporate? You mean for China or... John Inch : No, no, no, I was getting to China data point. I didn't hear what you'd -- if you had said anything about Tek overall. So just what's the Fluke and Tek in 2018 versus 2019 core growth roughly based on your assumptions? James Lico : Yes, I think Fluke's mid-single '18, mid-single '19. Tek is mid-single, and I think they had a stronger finish in '18. So I think they got them to mid-single, and they're probably closer to low single -- low to mid in 2019. So hopefully, that's helpful. John Inch : Yes -- no, that's right. That makes sense. The 3% to 5% guide, what about the deals that we've done -- like how much of -- the recently acquired acquisitions, how much do they contribute in the collective 3% to 5%? I think you said -- Chuck, you said pricing's a percent, what about the other businesses that we've done recently? Charles McLaughlin : Look, so the only thing -- that 3% to 5% is a core growth, so that only include -- it only -- it includes the Landauer and ISC and Orpak. And so I think I calculated it, that was like 30 basis points. The more recent ones, they won't turn core until the fourth quarter of next year. John Inch : Okay. So still pretty small, all right? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. John Inch : And then, Jim, if you were not to read the newspapers but simply just think about your businesses, what are you most concerned about in 2019? So again, not macro stuff because we're also concerned about that, but just if you think about the businesses, how they lined up, what do you -- where do you want to apply the most pressure as CEO in an operations basis? Where do you feel like you've got to kind of focus the most attention if there's an issue at all in 2019? James Lico : Yes, it's a great question, and probably I could give you -- I could go for a half hour on it. But I would say as we think about -- maybe start with how we think about risk. Certainly, we're -- we -- I think, and it's impossible, not only reading the paper, but also seeing in our own business, and I mentioned this before, Western Europe continues to be a watchful eye. It's not our biggest geography, but certainly some of the things we've seen out of Germany, as an example, would have us watching out to make sure that we're prudent in what we're doing over there. China could go up or down. It's probably a risk and an opportunity regionally. I think operationally, as we think about it from a business perspective, we certainly want to make sure we take advantage of the opportunities that are in front of us relative to GVR and the EMV opportunity. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, as an example, the Murphy's USA order that we got, that was a big win for. We want to continue to have those big wins and to continue to convert those into revenue opportunities and increase our installed base over time. So I would say GVR. And then more broadly, we're always -- John, we're always working to accelerate innovation. We've put a big effort into digital analytics and IoT in a number of our businesses. You see -- you've heard us talk about some of those successes like Fluke Digital. Certainly, Gordian or Accruent are going to -- we're learning a lot from them as well, how to accelerate some things. So that's probably all that -- we're going to have leadership conference here in a few weeks, and those would be -- a number of the things we're going to be talking about and focused on as we talk to our top leaders in the business. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Richard Eastman : Could we just -- can you just give us kind of a quick update on Gordian and Accruent? Just trying to get kind of year-over-year growth rates there. I mean, even though they're not core, I'm just curious, are they pacing out at the growth that you expected and just kind of what the demand and order rate look like? James Lico : Yes, I think we had a high single-digit growth rate in -- for Accruent last year, and we delivered ahead of where we thought we'd be, although, as we said, only a few months of our own ownership, so we won't take any credit there. Gordian, probably a little bit better from a growth rate, more closer to double digits. And again, they did a nice job as well. So we -- so far, they've gotten out of the gate well. We were with the Accruent team in -- a few weeks ago for their 100-day strategic plan, and the energy and enthusiasm about what they can do and what we can do together is still -- I think is really -- really makes for -- I think both are going to be -- it's going to be great businesses for us going forward. I think you'll start to see those growth rates I just mentioned are probably the growth rates for '19 as we look at things and -- but we'll continue to look. We're certainly looking as we finish their 100-day strategic plans, Rick, as you know, because you know us well. We'll look for opportunities to invest into more growth opportunities to accelerate some of those growth rates and those things -- because of the softer nature of the business, some of those probably won't start to really take an impact until the latter half of '19 and into '20. Richard Eastman : And do you spend any time at all trying to look and correlate the ABI with Gordian's demand? Could you... James Lico : Say a little bit more on that. Correlate their demand with? Richard Eastman : With the ABI Index Construction... James Lico : Yes. Richard Eastman : There's a lot of concern around that but... James Lico : Right, right -- no, sorry, I didn't catch -- I didn't hear the A part of that. The -- no, I -- we haven't found a lot of correlation there yet I think because it's -- in their case, it's such an underpenetrated market that, that's actually happening from projects versus just the ability to grow the business just by increasing the penetration of their offering. It's such an opportunity that it doesn't necessarily correlate as well as one might think. Richard Eastman : Fair enough. And just a last question, around the PI Sensing businesses, it's kind of your -- maybe your fourth-largest maybe set of businesses, and one would think there's some cyclical sensitivity to those businesses around automation, perhaps around China. But they finished the year strong. Is there anything in the order rate that might give you pause in that -- in those kinds of sets of businesses, Gems and... James Lico : They're likely to decel a little bit in '19. So they were most -- as a platform, they were a stronger mid-single-digit grower. And in '19, they might slow a little bit too low to mid-single. So I think it's still early to tell but there will be a little bit of slowing that's possible. But I think we still see a lot of opportunities. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that Setra had some nice introductions in technology. We've also seen -- we've taken the businesses into what I would call maybe a little bit less cyclical markets like food and beverage and some critical environment applications. So I think the teams have done a really nice job of trying to reposition the businesses under verticals that maybe are less -- in the less cyclical markets like some of them that you just mentioned. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : I'd like to stick with Accruent and Gordian, if we could. And could you remind us of their deferred revenue profiles and what the cash flow contribution, the free cash flow contribution, were this quarter? Charles McLaughlin : And so Deane, I think if you're comparing to maybe some other companies about a big prepayment and getting a deferred revenue, that's really not how they're set up. And so I don't think that there's much there and especially moving the needle on free cash flow. Deane Dray : Just if you gave us a profile of what you expect even if it's not 100%, but what would the free cash flow profile or free cash flow yield for the businesses be? Charles McLaughlin : I think it will be similar to what the rest of Fortive would be. I just -- I think that it's going to have great margins, but as the -- as that free cash flow percentage of earnings, I think you look at it around the 120% that the rest of the company is. I think that would be great. But when you get that deferred revenue, you can sometimes see it -- you jump off up beyond there. Deane Dray : Good. And then just still on these two, when you acquired them, you referenced some significant adjacencies for more M&A in this space and how you're feeling about that, and does it make sense to have them in the field solutions piece and might you be breaking these out at some point? James Lico : Yes, I wouldn't necessarily speculate on breaking it out at any point in time. I certainly think they're -- they fit the mandate of what less is trying to do within the platform at this point in time. Relative to M&A, yes, we have a solid funnel there. As you can imagine, both of them being private equity backed. They had a funnel already working. They -- Accruent had closed some deals right around the time we closed the deal, so they had already brought in a couple of businesses that they were working on. So yes, we like the funnel of both businesses, and we're continuing to look for both small and even larger opportunities where available to bring into the business. And both management teams have good experience in integrating acquisitions. So not only do we have -- obviously we have the capital to do this, but we've got the management capacity in both of those businesses to accelerate growth. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Robert Graham : I want to kind of asking this same question as Deane but maybe a little bit different way. Portfolios, the segment's a little bit lopsided right now. Could we be, a year from today, looking at a three segment portfolio? Does that seem to make more sense? Charles McLaughlin : Well, I think that lopsided in terms of what we have on board, I'm not sure I agree with that. But I suspect your meaning when we get to the other side with ASP. I think once that we get that on board, we'll take a look and see what makes the most sense. It -- but right now, I think we're thinking about ASP coming on and it will become its own platform. And we'll wait to -- wait until we get to probably till the end of the year before we take up segments. Robert Graham : Okay. Fair enough. Then the follow-up is simply, again, not to beat the horse dead here, but 3% to 5% organic, just -- as I look at what's coming into the organic in '19, the 17 acquisitions and then we have some also faster growth acquisitions coming in late this year into the core, it seems like 3% organic would be something that you can do in your sleep. I'm just wondering what is the -- what gets you down to a 3% at the low end? What are the things that you're concerned about that you would put a plus 3% after, particularly if you remember also we talked about this at the Investor Day where GDP, GDP plus, I think that there was some thinking about possibly going to numbers and something a little bit higher than GDP. Can you just weigh in on the 3% in particular? Charles McLaughlin : Well, look, Scott, we agree with you. We're really excited about the businesses that we brought on. The main thing is the Gordian, Accruent and ASP. They -- Gordian and Accruent return into that core number only in the fourth quarter really, and ASP won't turn -- won't be in it at all. So a big -- so I think when you get to 2020, I think a fair comment, but that's the main point. Robert Graham : But if you could maybe finish that, Chuck, if you don't mind, the 3%, what are the things out there that get you to the 3%? What would have to happen there? James Lico : I think -- Scott, it's Jim. I think it would really be two things. One, probably, a little bit slower in Western Europe, and maybe China not coming back in that. We called it mid-single digit. There's a range of numbers within mid-single digit. They're probably on the lower end of that mid-singles. Probably the two things that -- I think North America's solid. You never -- it's -- in February, I'm never going to call a year I found that, that's not necessarily a great thing to do with not having an economics degree, but I think the brutal reality is what you we should be doing. What -- we're doing what we need to be doing for a market environment that looks like low to mid-single-digit growth depending on the business. And I think if North America's good, Western Europe holds in there, China continues to be pretty good, the rest of the markets are relatively small, then you start to see the high end of that. And if any of those, I think North America's probably the most likely to stay pretty good and the other two weighing would be where you start to get into the lower end of that guide. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Yes, just to keep on with 1Q, I know -- to go back to we are probably beating the horse pretty dead at this point, but just pulling out the price comment from earlier about the point of price in the first quarter, the comp gets easier, you mentioned GVR feels a little bit better. I guess, Jim, you made a comment about some pull forward maybe in China, is there anything else that got pulled forward elsewhere as best you can tell? Or anything kind of wonky in the backlog? Otherwise, you would think that having January behind you at this point, that the -- that it'd be easier to bridge that out? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. James Lico : Yes, I think one is, we think we -- there's probably about 70 to 100 basis points of growth in the fourth quarter that probably is equated to probably was first quarter business. So if you look at our guide, you're -- part of that is probably 70 to 100 that happened. So part of our overage in Q4 is -- and it really comes down to a few things. One, certainly there was a -- there was some business at Gilbarco that -- where people looked at year-end money and decided to spend it and wanted to take those orders in revenue in the quarter. That's one place. EMC had customers that wanted to get content in business, and that went out as well. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, they had their biggest quarter in the history of the company. And then some pull forward of some of the pricing actions that we've got around tariffs that happened at Fluke and Tek. And so those things combined equal to about 70 to 100. And so we go in with, I think, some optimism around North America and China based on how we finished, but we also know that some of what we saw was probably business that would have transacted in the first quarter. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just to stick with that same line of thought, is there anything on the margin side that we should think about in a 4Q to 1Q bridge? I know there's a lot of moving pieces with the deals and obviously with ASP if it closes in the quarter, that will move it around further still, but anything sequentially that adds on, drops off kind of beyond a volume input? Charles McLaughlin : No, I think that's the main thing, difference there from Q4 to Q1, especially when you look at what normally happens between these quarters, it's a significant step down, but nothing that comes to mind that's abnormal. Operator : And our next question is from the line of John Walsh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : So a lot of ground covered, but wanted just to get a little more specific. Can you actually give us the ballpark of where EMV revenue ended for 2018 so we just know the jumping off base for that piece of the business? James Lico : Are you talking about the -- well, we're about 40% through the cycle, a little over 40% through the cycle as we sunset 2018. So that's about where we thought we'd be, maybe a little bit ahead. But we also see, as I mentioned before, that we think it extends out farther. So the remaining, call it 60%, we'll never go to 100%, so -- but the remaining percentage will probably be -- we said -- we've been saying, as you know, John, 85% roughly by the end of 2020. And we think that number's actually pushing out some of -- I don't want to get too specific because it's a little bit a false precision at this point, but we do think that not -- more than 4 or 5 points probably is at least pushing into 2021 at this point. John Walsh : Okay. And then maybe just to get after the core growth question a little differently, as we think about Q1 and the full year, and I look at your kind of large buckets, whether it's field solutions, product utilization, sensing, right, transportation, you've already kind of talked about some ranges on where you think the core growth is. But are any of those main platforms negative or down in either Q1 or in the full year construct? Or is there growth across all those major platforms in both Q1 and for the full year? James Lico : All the platforms have growth, John. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the two places where individual businesses might be negative for a few quarters, one at telematics and the other, Qualitrol. So those individual businesses, Qualitrol sits in field solutions, telematics in Transportation Tech, but they're obviously not even close to the biggest businesses in those platforms. So the platforms will continue to grow, but those individual businesses are probably the businesses we're working the hardest to make sure we can turn them around, if you will. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just on Professional Instrumentation, as I think about Pacific Scientific, Tektronix, a, how did the federal-related revenues do in the quarter? And any impact from shutdown on the ability to collect the book business in the first quarter? James Lico : Yes, interestingly enough, very little. We had the business booked. We were a little worried about EMC because they do have some resources that come in to approve the products before they ship, but the team did a great job in getting ahead of that. So we really had -- we had a little bit of impact at Gordian, but on balance, probably within the weeds of a company of our size and scale. So thus far, no direct impact. You might say maybe -- and I think it's too early to tell if there's any second or third derivative impact. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So I hate to really beat the horse to death 2 or 3 times here, but, Chuck, I'm really struggling what the 1Q math and I know a lot of folks out there are as well, so maybe we just explore that again. It seems to me that your organic and FX is basically worked the way outside the top line in 1Q. Could you tell us the expense of M&A roll forward from external and Gordian estimates during 1Q year-over-year? And my math has it -- the effect is down in the third quarter, so I'm really struggling to understand why your midpoint guidance is only $0.01 above the prior year. So maybe some help there, it would be good. Charles McLaughlin : So one thing I think our tax rate is up in Q1, not down. You said our Q1 tax rate is down. Nigel Coe : Q1. Okay. Charles McLaughlin : Yes, our tax rate is going to be 17% in Q1, and I think it was around 15.3% and thereabouts in the prior year. Nigel Coe : Okay, so nothing else? Nothing smaller? So okay, we'll take it off-line and go... Charles McLaughlin : So I talked about the -- reiterating as long as we're beating dead horses. FX, $0.02 in the quarter. There's also headwinds, as I mentioned from tax. And we've got more shares this year, it's also given us a little bit of a headwind. Nigel Coe : Okay, we'll go through this more off-line. And then on the PI margin, again, we've touched on this as well. I think, Jim, you talked about mix, some negative mix I think in PI. I think you're referring to PI. Am I to understand that just Fluke and Tektronix were very strong in the quarter? So was that negative mix in PI, is that a factor why marking the flow? And then how does that -- maybe then, Chuck, if you could just maybe quantify this more because I'm not roughly set up in the -- for February. Charles McLaughlin : So I don't think there was a mixed impact in PI. I think we had -- there's two things going on in PI, that's -- there's -- tariff is primarily hits, not entirely, but the biggest places it hits is in Fluke and Tek. So that probably gives us 60 basis points of headwind on our OMX. And the warranty is about $6 million, and that's another 40 basis points. As for the company, but so it's a little bit probably 60 -- another 60 basis points on the warranty. So when you weigh those two, those are the two headwinds why we're flat on our OMX, otherwise we'd be at triple digits. James Lico : And Nigel, I think as we -- it might have been in the prepared remarks, we talked a little bit about mix, but that was overall. That was just a little bit more IT than PI. So that's what we're talking about there. So just a little bit of mix there. That's overall at Fortive. And as Chuck mentioned, the -- he obviously answered all the questions within Professional Instrumentation. So we actually feel pretty good about the margins in PI in the fourth quarter. I mean, obviously we don't love a one-time charge for our warranty issue. But at the end of the day, if you sort of pushed through that, that and combined with the work that the teams did to negate some pretty considerable tariffs, we think we did -- we're really pleased with where that ended up. And I think it put -- kind of put us in a good shape as we get through the year in 2019. Nigel Coe : That's pretty helpful, Jim. So just to underline the point, Q1 PI, you think core margin's up in Q1? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. James Lico : Yes. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Joseph Giordano : Just the M&A impact from acquisitions on PI really stepped up quite a bit from third quarter. I know you have more of the -- more time of Gordian and Accruent in there, but it was a little bit larger than what we're thinking. I'm just curious to see how you think about that bleeding off into '19 like on a cadence basis. Charles McLaughlin : Are you talking about the step up around the amortization or the step up on the deal cost? Joseph Giordano : Not the transaction cost, the minus 375 for acquisitions, yes. Charles McLaughlin : Okay. James Lico : On the revenue side, yes, I think, well, they clearly, we got full credit for both deals in the fourth quarter. So -- and so I think that number's probably -- obviously, it's going to end -- it will -- it's a -- it will go core at -- in the fourth quarter of next year. So we should see -- the fourth quarter's always seasonally big for those businesses. So there's -- I wouldn't necessarily multiply that number by four. Joseph Giordano : No, no, no, sorry, sorry. I mean, on the margin side, like the -- on the PI. On the operating margin, you had acquisitions minus 375 basis points. Just curious how that kind of... James Lico : Yes, they'll absolutely get better through the year. They're -- there's -- we had very little impact on the margins in the quarter given where we closed. And for sure, they will -- they'll continue to improve through the year. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And then a question on ASP. I mean, obviously, sterilization, a big thing out in hospital. So I'm curious how the trend towards like single-use, how like that -- does that have any impact on ASP? Or how does that -- the pull on that two kind of opposite trends? James Lico : It doesn't because of the products that are used, they typically -- there are products that are not necessarily not going to fall into the single-use category. We've been tracking some technologies where those might be opportunities. But I think when we look at the exposure that our technologies and our products and the products that we sterilize to single-use, there's very little impact. And still a lot of underpenetration around the world. So the U.S. and Europe, obviously, standards and regulations are fairly developed. But when you look around the world -- we were in China a few -- about 1.5 months ago visiting our ASP team, and clearly a lot of opportunity for unpenetrated market there in all forms of hospitals there. So I think it's unbalanced. Yes, some -- there's very little exposure to single-use. And certainly, when you look at the underpenetrated side of the market, lots of growth opportunities. Interestingly enough, I was with a number of the sales leaders, they're here this week. And we're -- we were with them as we roll out some of the Fortive Business System tools with them and stuff, and they're incredibly excited about the opportunity that's available to us. So I think across all fronts, as we get more and more into the business, Joe, we see a growth opportunity. Operator : And at this time, I'm showing that we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Jim Lico for closing remarks. James Lico : Thanks, Ian, and thanks, everybody, for taking the time this evening. It's cold and snowy in Seattle. That's a pretty rare thing for us. But I think despite the weather, we are incredibly excited about what's ahead of us in 2019. We obviously had a very strong finish to the quarter with over 7% core growth, our best core growth quarter in the history of the company, 30% earnings growth. We think that's great, but it -- on the other hand, we know our best days are still yet to come given the great portfolio transformation work that we did in the year. So thanks for your support, and obviously, Griffin and team are available for questions and clarification tonight and through -- and tomorrow. Thanks, everybody. Have a great night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Today we reported first quarter results that reflected the solid start to 2019 setting us off to deliver another year of strong double-digit earnings growth. Our first quarter adjusted earnings per share was in line with our expectations, as the performance of Industrial Technologies, led by strong growth from Gilbarco Veeder-Root was partially offset by near-term headwinds within Professional Instrumentation.  We also generated strong free cash flow growth of greater than 30% in the quarter, reflecting the vitality of our businesses as we continue to invest in organic innovation and pursue acquisitions that will accelerate our strategy. On April 1st, we closed the acquisition of the Advanced Sterilization Products business from Johnson & Johnson welcoming the business and its employees to the Fortive family. We're very pleased that we closed this complex carve out on schedule in just under 10 months. The $2.7 billion transaction represents our largest acquisition to-date and provides Fortive with a strong position in the attractive $4 billion mid-single-digit growth medical sterilization and disinfection market.  With a strong global installed base and leading brand, ASP brings growth, high recurring revenue and significant earnings potential to the Fortive portfolio. While ASP is our most recent acquisition, we are excited about the progress being made by the other acquisitions closed over the past couple of years. Gordian and Accruent have continued their early momentum, generating strong growth through the first quarter of 2019.  Likewise, ISC, Landauer and Orpak are performing well as they embrace the Fortive business system in order to deliver enhanced go-to-market execution, innovation and improvements in free cash flow. The growth of these businesses continues to drive the evolution of the Fortive portfolio toward a higher growth less cyclical profile.  We look forward to sharing more detail about our progress when we're together at our Investor Conference in May. With that, I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $245.6 million, up 6.7% over the prior year and adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $0.69. Sales grew 6.7% to $1.6 billion, reflecting a core revenue increase of 3.7%. Core revenue growth was highlighted by the strong performance of GVR as well as Industrial Scientific and EMC. Acquisitions, including Gordian and Accruent, contributed 580 basis points of top-line growth, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 280 basis points. Geographically, high-growth markets\u2019 core revenue grew mid-single-digits led my Asia and the Middle East. China posted another strong quarter with high single-digit growth, led by GVR, Fluke and Tektronix. Developed markets\u2019 core revenue grew low single-single-digits, reflecting continued strength in North America and strong performance in Japan. Core revenue growth in North America was mid-single-digits, led by GVR, Tektronix, EMC and Industrial Scientific. Western Europe was relatively flat as strong growth at GVR and Qualitrol was offset by slower growth at Fluke and weakness at Tektronix. In the first quarter, we posted a gross margin of 51%, including 160 basis points of pricing. Reported operating margin -- profit margin was 13.6%, reflecting 240 basis points of dilution from acquisitions and 190 basis points of dilution from deal-related costs. Core operating margins were down 70 basis points, as stronger volume at GVR was offset by lower-than-expected growth at Tektronix and Fluke and unfavorable foreign exchange rates across the company. During the first quarter, we generated $137 million of free cash flow and a seasonally strong conversion ratio of 84%. Free cash flow generated in the quarter represented a 31% increase year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of greater than 120%. Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 8.7%, including core revenue growth of 1.8%. Acquisitions contributed 950 basis points, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 260 basis points. Reported operating margin of 14.4%, reflected 740 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions and deal-related costs. Core operating margins decreased a 190 basis points, reflecting the weaker-than-expected revenue growth at Tektronix and Sensing, the impact of tariffs and unfavorable foreign exchange. Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue increased low single-digits as strong performance in Industrial Scientific and EMC was offset by lower growth for Fluke and Tektronix during the quarter. Field Solutions core revenue grew low single-digits with low single-digit growth in developed markets paced by continued strong performance of ISC. High-growth markets grew slightly as solid growth at Fluke and ISC was largely offset by continued weakness at Qualitrol. China posted another strong quarter with mid-single-digit core growth. Fluke generated low single-digit core growth, led by double-digit growth at Fluke Calibration. Fluke\u2019s industrial growth in the first quarter was impacted by slower point-of-sale trends in Western Europe and the United States and a stronger finish in 2018. We did however see improvement in point-of-sale growth in North America over the back half of the quarter. Fluke Digital Systems grew greater than 30%, led by eMaint which added more than 50 new customers and generated a greater than 20% increase in annual recurring revenue. Fluke continued its strong broad-based growth in China with point-of-sale increases reflecting the enhanced strength of Fluke's competitive position and healthy momentum as it ended the quarter. On the product front, Fluke Networks launched two new fiber testing and inspection products during the quarter, which have gotten off to a strong start. ISC delivered high-teens core growth led by North America. iNet saw another quarter of greater than 20% growth while rental had a particularly strong quarter driven by several large project wins. The ISC team is very excited about continuing to pursue the emerging revenue opportunity from bundled solutions that combine iNet with the company's rental offering in the coming quarters.  ISC delivered over 500 basis points of operating margin expansion in the first quarter as the application of FBS continues to drive consistent operational improvements. Qualitrol's core revenue declined low-double-digits during the quarter in line with our expectations. While the company has started to see some early signs of more stable conditions in certain markets, we continue to expect the headwinds from soft market conditions to remain a challenge throughout 2019. Product realization core revenue increased low-single-digits. This high-teens growth in the EMC was moderated by a flat quarter from Tektronix. EMC saw strong base business growth along with the continued progress of its product offering for commercial satellites with the first launches of satellites employing its fully networked pyrotechnical lead solutions during the quarter. Flat growth at Tektronix was a result of contrasting performance across developed and high growth markets during the quarter. Developed markets grew low-single-digits led by strong growth in North American and Japan, which was partially offset by a decrease in Western Europe.  High growth markets were down mid-single-digits as a strong quarter in China was more than offset by declines in South Korea and the rest of Asia. The Tektronix oscilloscope offering continues to drive growth benefiting from the momentum behind the 6 Series MSO which was introduced in the third quarter of 2018. As part of the ongoing effort to reshape and focus the Tektronix's portfolio, the company also recently signed an agreement to contribute its video test and monitoring business to a new entity, formed with Telestream and Genstar Capital, Telestream's private equity owner. We expect the transaction to close at the beginning of the third quarter. Core revenue for the Sensing Technologies platform decreased low-single-digits in the quarter. Sensing had a slow start to the year experiencing headwinds across certain parts of its core industrial end markets, including slower demand trends from electronics and semiconductor OEM customers.  Growth remained solid across the platform\u2019s medical and defense end markets while recent new product launches continue to drive strong growth in critical environment applications. The platform performed well in China registering high-single-digit growth and was offset by low-single-digit declines in North America and Western Europe. Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment, revenue grew 4% including core revenue growth of 6.4%. Acquisitions contributed 80 basis points, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 320 basis points.  Reporting operating margin of 16.3% reflected 20 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions. Core operating margin increased 130 basis points driven by the strong volume at GVR in the quarter. Our Transportation Technologies platform core revenue grew low-double-digits led by greater than 20% in high growth markets and high-single-digit growth in developed markets. GVR delivered mid-teens core revenue growth highlighted by low-double-digit increase in developed markets and a greater than 20% increase in high growth markets. Developed markets were led by North America reflecting a combination of accelerating EMV sales and the lapping of ERP implementation issues that affected performance in the first quarter of 2018. Gilbarco continued to generate strong growth from EMV sales, driven by programs with major oil company partners. Phillips 66 recently announced the release of outdoor EMV capability for its sites running the Gilbarco Passport point-of-sale system. Gilbarco also reached the agreement Shell to offer EMV ready Passport EDGE point-of-sale solutions to Shell\u2019s dealer network on a monthly subscription basis.  China saw greater than 30% growth, driven by the continued regulatory tailwind at Veeder-Root from ongoing double-walled tank upgrades. GVR\u2019s strong results in high-growth markets included significant growth in India as GVR's comprehensive product and service capability, including recent innovation within Orpak automation offering led to a number of large tender wins during the quarter.  As expected, TeletracNavman declined high single-digits in the first quarter as strong growth across Asia Pacific was more than offset by a decline in North America. The TeletracNavman team remains focused on stabilizing the North American business where the high-level of customer churn that emerged in 2018 remains a headwind despite some improvement during the quarter. TeletracNavman was recently awarded a FedRAMP provisional authority to operate making its Director product eligible for procurement by all federal agencies based on its security and reliability as a third-party cloud solution. Moving to franchise distribution. The platform declined low single-digits during the first quarter. Hennessy\u2019s performance was impacted by significant customer inventory reductions while Matco was up slightly. At the company's Annual Tool Expo, Matco launched an exclusive mobile AC recycler line optimized for uptime and service reliability has been well received by the market and drove shop equipment growth during the quarter. Turning to the guide. We're updating our full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $3.55 to $3.65, representing year-over-year growth of 16% to 19% on a continuing operations basis. The revised annual guide includes $0.20 for the addition of ASP and a reduction of $0.05 due to the Tektronix video transaction. The guide also assumes 3% to 5% core revenue growth, 25 to 50 basis points of core OMX and effective tax rate of 17% and free cash flow conversion of greater than 120% for the year.  We are also initiating our second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.86 to $0.90 representing year-over-year growth of 18% at the high-end. This includes assumptions of 3% to 4% core revenue growth and an effective tax rate of 17%. To wrap up, our first quarter results came in as we expected despite the near-term challenges that impacted our shorter cycle businesses as well as headwinds from tariffs and foreign exchange. For the quarter, we delivered high single-digit total revenue growth, mid-single-digit core revenue growth and greater than 30% growth in free cash flow. With the closing of ASP at beginning of second quarter, we also took another significant step forward in the ongoing transformation of the Fortive portfolio, greatly increasing our exposure to an attractive healthcare market, tied to long-term secular growth drivers and adding another source of high recurring revenue and consistently robust free cash flow. Looking ahead with a combination of a resilient core portfolio, the foundation of the Fortive Business System, and growing contribution of Gordian and Accruent and the addition of ASP, we've remained well positioned to deliver another year of top quartile earnings growth. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day in New York on May 16th, where we will give you deeper insights into the digital strategy of Fortive as well as an update on our portfolio transformation efforts.  With that, I'll turn it back to Griffin. Griffin Whitney : Thanks Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Erica, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Steve Tusa. Steve Tusa : On the revenue contribution from acquisitions for Gordian and Accruent, I think the amount I guess is something like on a pro rata basis like $100 million a quarter, the acquisition contribution in that segment was like $80 million I think or somewhat that, I mean is there seasonality to that business or I\u2019m doing the math wrong? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. No, you are not doing the math wrong. There is a seasonality to Gordian and Accruent, it's a little bit different than what our traditional or core business has been where we think maybe we get 20% and 45% in the first two quarters of the year and I think that it's going to have like maybe a 40% to 60% rate in first half to second half. Steve Tusa : Okay. And any -- on Gordian, is there any market dynamics there that are moving around relative to expectations? James Lico : No, in fact we had a good quarter at both, Steve, it\u2019s Jim. We saw good strength in the construction spend through the platform. That's the job order contracting part of the business and what we call procurement solutions. That business was up double-digits. So -- and that\u2019s roughly 60% of the business. So, no, at Gordian we saw good performance and we saw a good performance at Accruent as well. So as we said in the prepared remarks we're off to a very good start and I think one of the things we like the best about the business in addition to its secular drivers is we are really getting an outstanding team in both businesses. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one last one for you. Just from a macro perspective, and now that you kind of hand an opportunity to draw the first quarter here looking back, was there any sort of pull in or pre-buy in the fourth quarter in any of your products and maybe just touch high level on what you are seeing in the macro out there? It seems like there are a lot of different businesses moving around on you, some negative, some positive, relatively inconsistent performance I\u2019d say. Is there anything out on the macro that kind of worries you for the second half? James Lico : Yes. So maybe sort of a little bit of the geographies in context Steve. I think what we saw in -- our overall North American growth was pretty good but obviously Gilbarco drives a lot of that because of the quarter they had. I think the good news in the quarter Gilbarco was really the high growth markets, now those specific to Gilbarco, so I don\u2019t know if you get a macro read there as much, but good high growth market performance pretty much in every part of the world, a lot of that we said in the prepared remarks. What we did see is relative to you are pull in question or what we saw is we definitely -- I think we highlighted this is February that we thought there was somewhere around 70 to a 100 basis points of revenue in the fourth quarter that was probably came out of the first. We now think that number is closer to a 125 and that's a chunk of tariff avoidance and then I think the other thing is we definitely saw North America in a number of places sort of start-out slow and then get better through the quarter at point-of-sale Fluke as an example clearly got better through the quarter, Matco got better in March. So we did see some trends that were improving through the quarter, and I would say just in our distribution businesses mostly weaker in Professional Instrumentation clearly Europe was a weak point for our distribution in Europe. Operator : And your next question comes from Scott Davis. Scott Davis : Just I don't think I\u2019ve ever asked a question on Sensing Technologies business at all. But what -- does that business turn around 2019 or are we now kind of open for 2020? James Lico : No, well, it\u2019s probably going to be a little -- we always thought it was a low single-digit in the year and that changed -- that point of view doesn't really change, a little bit different number but probably the lower part of low single-digit. They were negative in the quarter, but will continue to get a little bit better as -- and their comps get a little easier in the second half as well. One of the good things about the business is they've been obviously a very profitable part of the business and they did a good job in protecting free cash flow in the quarter. So, they'll move the growth here for the rest of the year and they'll continue to contribute better from an earnings perspective as they go to through the year. Scott Davis : Okay. And if I just look at Slide 4, and you just take a look at the R&D numbers as a percent revenues, you bought a lot of businesses, spend a lot of money R&D. And Jim what's your early take on if you\u2019re getting your bank for your buck on that spend, or is there any way to get any efficiency on it or productivity and I know it's tough to scale it because they're very different companies that you own but just to look how that may be on R&D? James Lico : Yes. I think a couple of things. One, clearly the software businesses like Gordian and Accruent are going to require a little bit more R&D. Quite frankly, they were pretty tight on R&D being owned -- both being owned by private equity. We will probably add to their R&D spend as we look forward to opportunities to accelerate growth and to build out their platform of solutions. As you know, the great addition of these businesses, the continued additive features to current customers, which really delivers strong earnings potential over time. So we'll do that. But in many standpoint, the overall Fortive number may not move all that much because as we will look for productivity -- as we\u2019re always looking for productivity in other places, we're through some of the big spend at Tektronix on their new platform as an example. So, there is clearly what we often call it dynamic resource allocation where we're really moving money into places where we have the highest growth opportunities. Operator : And your next question comes from Julian Mitchell. Julian Mitchell : Just looking at slides 8 and 9, if we just look at the core revenue growth contribution to EPS, you did about $0.05 or you're expecting to do about $0.05 in the first half, the year you\u2019ve guided at about $0.25, so a big sort of step up in that contribution from first half to second half. Maybe just walk through some of the biggest moving parts in terms of that step up please? James Lico : Well. I think the bigger thing is just as we move through the quarter, our volume steps up sequentially. We normally -- I think from Q1 to Q2, our revenues are going to go up by 20%. Obviously, our expenses don't -- the fix expenses don't see that piece. So, that creates a normal step up through the year. We generally think of our earnings growth, the EPS being contributive 20 in the first quarter, 25 in the second and third and 30 in the fourth quarter. And so that -- when you do that, it gives you this profile. And so I think that that's most of it -- the other thing -- last thing I\u2019d point out is there's FX in the first half, it\u2019s particularly I think there's $0.03 in Q2 or Q1 and then $0.01 or $0.02 in Q2, and then it really flattens out in the back half. So those are some of the dynamics that\u2019s giving a little bit of a backend of a ramp through the year, but it's most of the revenue ramp. Julian Mitchell : Understood, thanks. And then my second question maybe around Professional Instruments specifically. You talked about the sensing assumptions there. Any color maybe on what you're seeing on the order intake in Fluke and Tektronix, how quickly you think those accelerate maybe in the rest of the year? And whether you thought you suffered from much destocking in the distribution facing businesses in PI in Q1? James Lico : Yes, I'll pick a last part first, Julian. We definitely think we saw destocking in some places at Fluke and Tek I would say definitely in Europe for both businesses and certainly some in the US. Tek had an interesting dynamic where their direct business was up significantly more either had like mid-single growth in the direct business, but their distribution business was down in the first quarter. So that really kind of -- we attribute a chunk of that to destocking, and a little bit of what we said before, which was kind of tariff avoidance, pricing avoidance that occurred in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned in answer a few minutes ago. So I think that provides a dynamic where we'll see that play out and improve the second quarter and through the rest of the year.  I would also point out that Tek had a book-to-bill over 1 in the first quarter. I think Fluke did as well but -- so we certainly feel like we're seeing some solid performance. And I think in both cases, we're starting to see the point-of-sale number start to improve as we move through the quarter. So I think we started off a little slower than we thought. Obviously, Professional Instrumentation at just under 2% core growth certainly reflects that Tek being flat certainly reflects that. But we think we're not really expecting a big macro improvement here to deliver what we need to deliver. It's really more just kind of working through that inventory destocking and really just kind of seeing the current rate sort of play out. Operator : And your next question comes from Deane Dray. Deane Dray : Hey. Could you take us through the Tektronix video transaction, what are the economics, what's the opportunity here? James Lico : Yes, the -- strategically Deane you know as well. So, we've always been looking from a portfolio perspective to always put our businesses in the best position for success. We also help our operating companies to do that as well. And I think that Tektronix team really came back with this understanding that by combining with the Telestream business, the video business not as core to what we do at Tek obviously. And increasingly, I think the combination of those businesses was looking better and better.  So we'll combine the businesses, we'll have a minority interest in the combined entity and we'll really benefit from the success of the synergies in the business and what Genstar is looking to do with the business over time. So we think the economics over time are going to be good because we think the synergies are strong. Deane Dray : And then on the 160 basis points of price, how does that spread across the businesses, where did you get the most pricing and was there any give-up? Charles McLaughlin : Hey, Deane, it\u2019s Chuck. So for the most part we got price across all of our company -- operating companies. A little bit more -- we were a little more successful in IT where it starts with the two rather than one and we were a little bit lighter on the Professional Instrumentation side at 80 basis points. So -- but we -- I think we were successful across most places. We struggled at one -- a couple of places where we are struggled on price for some very specific reasons. At Tek they were down 50 basis points which is not what we were expecting and we're going to work to regain that but was a little bit different and also at EMC but unrelated to -- they have some contractual things that was mostly known about coming in, everywhere else, we\u2019re really happy with 160 basis points in total, where we normally would get 40 or 50. Deane Dray : And just on Tek on the pricing, was that give up on the direct side or through distribution? Charles McLaughlin : Probably more on the direct side as those are more -- as you can imagine those are more case-by-case decisions on the business. And so I would say at least more to the direct side. A little bit in distribution but some of it was quite not realized on the distribution side because of -- to think about it this way, we expected more price with January 1 price increases but because we had more pull into the fourth quarter from distribution, and we sort of -- that we sort of avoided the price metric if you will in the first quarter, if that makes sense Deane. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Obin. Andrew Obin : Just a question on Professional Instrumentation margins, they sort of have been negative for a couple of quarters now, what would it take operationally for the margins to inflect back up? Charles McLaughlin : Great question. There is a couple of things. One is, they've been struggling for a couple quarters. Remember if tariffs are really a big impact to both Fluke and Tek. And so for Professional Instrumentation that really get's hammered there pretty well. So we will lap those tariffs that are in the majority of them in Q3. So we will start to get a lift there. Also Professional Instrumentation has high fall-through on their -- on shipments and so we need that pull in or that avoidance that maybe some of their distributors went for. We just need to get more volume out the door and get back growth. So that hurt us in Q1, so that\u2019ll start to moderate. And one other factor is FX has really hurt us a little bit more than we expected and the fall-through on those things and again we're going to start when we get into the second half we should lap those as well. So if FX stays here there is some -- there is less impact in Q2 than Q1, but when we get to Q3 most of those should go away. So I would expect that we will see -- we will be back to normal margin expansion in the second half of this year. James Lico : Andrew, the other thing that it\u2019s just maybe important to keep an eye on is we had our best in the history of the company last first quarter of '18 on margin expansion in PI, we had 300 basis points is margin in the first quarter last year. So when we look on a two year stack there, we still feel pretty good about the margin expansion in the core business. Obviously the tariffs as Chuck mentioned have some impact there. But I think when we look at sort of the core work that we typically do, we feel pretty good about that and that will get better as we work through the year. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question on growth, so Q1 core growth was 3.7 I think in the second quarter we're guiding 3 to 4. For the year, the range is still future 3 to 5. So what would it take for you guys to hit the 5% organic core growth for the year with acceleration in the second half particularly as the comps get tougher in the second half? Thanks. Charles McLaughlin : Yes. No problem. So I think first of all, we probably want to see Western Europe get better, China to continue, we were high single-digit in the month during the quarter. We've said for a while now that China was likely to be more mid-single-digit for the years. So if China held in there, may be got a little better and Western Europe got better, I think we'll more be at the high-end of the range. And also -- we also have some easier comps in some place like in Sensing and at Fluke. So if we get to the higher end of their businesses as well, there's some opportunity. So we will build the business model around that range and what we feel really good about is we're going to deliver double-digit earnings growth in the first half, 3% growth and we're going to deliver high-teens earnings growth through the year. So, even in that range of growth rates but I think the earnings growth is going to be substantial. And that\u2019s pretty much like the strong free cash flow in the quarter, despite the fact that we missed you know the PI revenue number by a little bit, the free cash flow up 31% I think was a good testament of our operational ability to continue to deliver. Operator : And your next question is from Richard Eastman. Richard Eastman : Jim or Chuck, could you just speak to the video that you\u2019re contributing -- Tek\u2019s video business that you are contributing to this venture, what revenue did it have? What kind of profits? And just, when do you expect that to be completed? James Lico : So I'll take the second part first. We expect to be completed early in the third quarter is what we're looking at and the business in terms of size is $55 million or $60 million in revenue, for us it probably around 18% to 20% operating profit. Richard Eastman : Okay. So pretty decent. And then I just have a question on the EPS guide for the second quarter. I'm a little bit curious, I would've thought so $0.86 to $0.90 I'm kind of referencing your 25%. So I guess Chuck, a 25% so I guess $0.90 kind of fits but I would think with the ASP acquisition I mean shouldn't that add approximately a nickel to the quarter? It sounds like this video business sort of come out till Q3. So what's the drag there on the EPS for the second quarter? Charles McLaughlin : Actually I think there's only two things that you might be missing, I agree with the nickel on ASP. If you look at our core business without the benefit of Gordian and Accruent ASP and FX you get a number that\u2019s around for the quarter 25% to $0.80. You've buildup of $0.05 ASP as you noted and there is I think we've got $0.06 in for Gordian and Accruent. And so that fits in. Probably one thing is there's still $0.02 to $0.02 of tailwind on FX. Richard Eastman : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Charles McLaughlin : I just want to make sure I called that headwind. Richard Eastman : The headwind, yes, yes, understood. Charles McLaughlin : All coming up 18% earnings per share growth. Operator : And your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz. Andrew Kaplowitz : For Chuck, SG&A was up 450 basis points over 30% of sales, it\u2019s not really surprising, it's a lighter quarter in sales and given the acquisition related activity you\u2019ve had but is it up simply because of that and would you expect just to come down now versus relatively and seasonally high Q1? Charles McLaughlin : So if you're just talking about the total SG&A, actually it's up quite a bit because of the amortization and also the purchase accounting related to the deals and the deal costs. That's actually the main step up there. Andrew Kaplowitz : Nothing unusual on there other than just the increased M&A activity, correct? Charles McLaughlin : There's a little bit with Gordian and Accruent where they've got really high gross margins, and so they're above the fleet average. But the first two things I talked about is 90% of them. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then Jim just focusing on China for a second, you mentioned last quarter that you're seeing some slowing in Tek order book in China, but doesn't look like you saw any real slowdown in that business. So when you focus on China, I mean you mentioned maybe it can be resilient here as a lot of that resilient in GVR, Tek actually outperformed in China and then what's going on in the rest of Asia, because you mentioned that looks up creating a little weak? James Lico : Yes. So on Tek specifically, we saw -- as you said, we saw a little bit better China than we thought. I think some of that -- we still expected that to moderate a little bit as I said, it's high-single-digits in the quarter but probably mid-single in the full year. So I think that's still going to be a good year after, I think four years in a row of either double-digit or high-single-digit growth for Tek in China.  And it's been relatively resilient as you said, I think we saw most customers in most segments of the market pretty good. And the other thing I would call and just relative to China macro is that Fluke's point-of-sale in its shops, which is a pretty good bellwether for the market was good, and Fluke's growth was pretty broad based in China as well.  So I think China is holding in there. I wouldn't -- I'm not going to be appending to say that everything's great and it's going to turn wonderful, but I think it's it was certainly solid, and our -- it was a little better than we thought it would be overall. And as you mentioned GVR\u2019s continued regulatory performance, but that'll wane a little bit in the second half. Relative to Tek in the rest of Asia, very -- a lot of our business in South Korea is 3D sensing related and it\u2019s field related, we probably have more semiconductor process if you will or manufacturing exposure in Korea. And so while that's not a big issue for Fortive, it does impact the Asia business as we sight it and so we saw that in Korea and in other parts of Asia. So, that was probably the -- one of the headwinds that we saw at Tektronix in the quarter for sure. That moderates a little bit through the year just because we have some easier comps. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague. Jeffrey Sprague : Maybe just for me on ASP. Just curious how the business performed during this carve out period, I think the 2017 revenues were $775 million or so. What\u2019s the revenue base here as it enters the Fortive empire? Charles McLaughlin : Probably about 825 million, 820 million, somewhere around there. Jeffrey Sprague : And are you -- so that sounds like net 5% growth or so, may be a little bit more than that, is that? Charles McLaughlin : Mid-single-digit in '18 so. Jeffrey Sprague : And is that basically what's implicit in the guide and for the year here or is that going to be organic obviously for you this year but did you see that type of growth continuing over the balance of \u201818? Charles McLaughlin : We\u2019d probably be in the low to mid range right now. I think we\u2019re still getting a sense of what the business can be like, there are a couple of one-time things that were last year that I would say maybe their natural growth rate over the last few years has been low single-digit in that range, kind of 3 to 4. But we think we know the market is growing mid-single-digit. So I think as we said a year ago when we announced the signing of the deal that we felt good about over a time period we could turn the business into a mid-single-digit grower. But I think it's implicit in the guide with about 12 months of TSAs Jeff and working through Johnson & Johnson and some of the revenue profile for a time period, it's probably going to be a more or like low single-digit. And so we've got every aspect of the under our ownership. Jeffrey Sprague : And I think also there was -- obviously had to do a lot of prep work to kind of accept the carve-out in the year on the price. But I think after ownership you\u2019re looking at some pretty heavy work on their metrics management structure and alike. Is that still in front of you, is that embedded in the guide or is that something that I don\u2019t know maybe gets capitalized in acquisition accounting or something? Charles McLaughlin : No I think if you're talking about and the standing up the -- the team is going to run this. I think that we've done quite a bit of that. I think the thing that's in front of us really is basically outside of the US we've got these TSAs that we're going to have to bring them under into our IT platform and that's going to go on for probably four quarters. And as we do your profitably will accelerate every time we move off of one of those. James Lico : I think everything that we we've seen thus far, we've done a lot of work in this regard Jeff is that the cost structure that led to the returns for the business is every bit in play. So we feel very good about that. We think we still believe in the opportunity to improve the gross margins as well. And then finally when you look at the -- so we -- a lot of the tenants of -- the core tenants of the value creation there and we did this at a much lower interest rate cost and at a much different tax rate and so the returns -- the return profile has improved pretty a great deal since we announced the deal 12 months ago -- 10 months ago. Operator : And your next question is from John Inch. John Inch : Can you talk to the convertible senior notes you've just issued, seems to have been done at very favorable terms. I'm not sure if that incrementally additive even by a penny or two to sort of the thought process that you have. And I was wondering about just the balance sheet in general given if you can do that with that tranche, are there other things you could perhaps be doing or thought process around the balance sheet or is pretty well locked in? James Lico : Well, I think in terms of the guide -- first thank you, we\u2019d like the deal with the convertible notes. But as we came out this year, while we didn't know the exact terms of that, we had most of that factored in when we set the original guide. So it's not accretive to the guide but we like the deal that we did. Are there other things around the balance sheet? It isn\u2019t just because on this one is a convertible note, I mean it is treated as debt not equity. And so I don't think it gives us any more debt financing for M&A around that. But are other things around the balance sheet? There is -- we're continuing to look and see what our optionality is and as we said for a while we'll consider what the best fit at the time is for financing and raising capital. John Inch : But it sounds like it\u2019s going to be tied to probably future M&A. It sort of brings up the question, Jim, how are you thinking at this stage in late April about no additional portfolio moves in 2019? And you guys have done a ton over the couple of years, probably a lot of digestion work I'm assuming but you obviously want to be opportunistic. Is there an early read in terms of how are you thinking about these opportunities today or are you intend to sort of sit back and wait? James Lico : Yes. I would rarely be described as someone who sits back and waits on anything. So I feel obligated to that as we're certainly leaning in to opportunities. John, we have been pretty busy. I think we have been as busy as we have been over a time period. So we will continue to look for opportunities. As you said, we just closed 24 days ago the largest acquisition in history of the company, and so we certainly are digesting that and spending a considerable amount of time to make sure we do that right and that's important. So, I don't want in any way shape and form suggest that that's not a first priority because it is. But we also want to make sure we just between Gordian and Accruent and also with ASP we have not bought, call it, almost $10 billion of served market opportunity and with that comes more opportunity. So, we feel good about the opportunities in front of us, but again I think we now have the -- we certainly have the ability to be disciplined like we always have been and we will return focus as well. Almost sun-setting our three year anniversary here pretty soon. As you know well, the deals have ebbed and flowed and I suspect that will continue to be true. Operator : And your next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski Joshua Pokrzywinski : So, just let me follow up on Gordian and Accruent, you had them under your belt for a while now and I think obviously some differentiated assets in the software space, but it seems like every company out there is coming out with kind of a software add on for everything they're doing and obviously the big software guys are still everywhere. When you think about your total software exposure, including those to iNet, eMaint, you\u2019re kind of putting all in one big basket, how would you characterize the competitive landscape? Are you seeing more folks show up? Do you feel like the niches are well protected and how does that make you feel about kind of more activity in those spaces? James Lico : Well, I would say that the environment hasn't changed a lot in the last several months, but certainly for the last few years it\u2019s been competitive in the sense of the two major deals that we've done were in private equity hands and private equity showing up increasingly in a lot of these transactions. So I would say I wouldn't necessarily say we want to play where we're advantaged, where we have a proprietary view of the business, where -- and certainly now with some of the additions where we have synergy. And so I think those -- we're going to play in places where I think we're more likely to win. But I think the most important part is first having a strategic view of how to build a workflow and to really understand what you can do with the business, not only with the business you have but also with additional things and building more scale. And as you point out now, with Gordian and Accruent, eMaint alone and sort of that facilities maintenance -- facilities management software space, we're almost at a $0.5 billion. That gives us a tremendous amount of scale in which to do things. And then in some of our other businesses, where we have strategic positions, we're adding on to things to make them -- just make the workflow more competitive. And that builds on the strength of the brands whether it be Gilbarco or Tektronix or whatever. So, we're continuing to do those things as well. And I would say the other thing I would say is that while maybe the follow up question might be pricing, I don't think we're -- for great assets, I don't think we're really seeing differences in pricing over the last year or two. I think the crummy assets maybe have prices decreased. And so everything in the bottom end has moved up. But I think when you look at what great growth, great margin profiles with good high recurring revenue, those really strong assets with differentiated market positions, fundamentally, that pricing really hasn't changed in the last year or two. Joshua Pokrzywinski : That\u2019s helpful Jim. And then just one, shifting gears a little bit, thinking about the second half, or even maybe beyond the second half, at some point before too long you're going to run into some pretty tough comps on GVR and I think orchestrating the handoff between that business and some of the PI stuff where it's just kind of the higher quality businesses over time are the ones that are getting more of the focus. Do you anticipate that being a smooth handoff i.e. some of the headwinds today or end market shuffling today, times itself to where it goes away by the time GVR has tougher comps? James Lico : Yes. So I think Chuck can talk in a little bit. I think, strategically we're certainly looking within Gilbarco within transportation tech and within Fortive to countermeasure these things. So, within Gilbarco, we're building out our high growth market positions. We've done two -- really almost three acquisitions over the last several years, in India as an example, to build our positions in high growth markets. We just launched a new dispenser for high growth markets. That's I think, a really great product. So build out our positions in markets where we're -- that are non-EMV, that's number one. I think number two is to continue to take advantage of opportunities, like in electric vehicles, where our Tritium investment is doing some things and we'll certainly continue to do that. So that's what we're doing within Gilbarco. And then certainly in the platform, we're looking for new opportunities. And certainly, as you mentioned, the breadth of opportunities that we have throughout Fortive to also do these things, are going to be all opportunities for us to countermeasure, if you will, the EMV shortfall, which inevitably will happen. I think, I don't think I think we've been consistent well over for at least couple of years to say that inevitably, there will be a step down at some point in time that\u2019s I would say somewhat predictable, probably not within a specific quarter but certainly within a couple of quarters we have a pretty good sense for that. Charles McLaughlin : Yes, Josh, if I could add on it, if you want to size that when you start looking at in '20, beyond 2021, 2022 and 2023 is probably $100 million to $200 million step down over a quarter period which is probably about $0.10 to $0.20 and if you think about $0.10 a year I think we can handle that in terms of an earnings power. Also worth it is noting 1.7 billion of acquired assets growing at high single-digits is also part of and given mentioned some of those in the GVR platform. Operator : And your next questing is from Scott Graham. Scott Graham : I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on what the PI impact from acquisitions, it looks like on a full-year basis it was minus 410 this quarter, what does that look like on a full year basis? James Lico : Are you talking about on the SG&A there or on the\u2026 Scott Graham : I'm talking about on your exhibit on Page 6, the operating margin on bundle. James Lico : I see. I have to think about that, and I prefer to not to just pitfall here because we got the ASP coming in here with its amortization but it's likely to be in the same size as what we just saw with Gordian and Accruent for the full-year, if you think about $2.8 billion spent on Gordian and Accruent and $2.7 billion on ASP. It's going to look about the similar impact on our total operating margins. But I think that anyways that's what is that's what I would expect to see. Scott Graham : And so when you are talking earlier about the upward inflection in the PI margin you were just talking about the core? James Lico : Yes, that's right, for sure. Scott Graham : I also notice that when you talked about OMX not only did that number come down from plus 50 to plus 25 to 50 on a full year basis, where you talked a lot about mix, I was hoping if you could tell us a little bit more maybe size that for us what is that 30, 40, is that 25 basis points of takedown, what happened with OMX both the guidance and what's going on with the mix within that? James Lico : Well most of what happened with the guide for the year is the first quarter and so our first quarter had negative 70 it didn\u2019t make the second half go up anymore and it's really not much more complicated than that. I do think that we will see sequential improvement from Q1 to probably flat, a little bit positive to back to normal because the big headwinds of that we called out in order of mix and tariffs and FX are really a first half problem and they normalize into the second half. And we\u2019re very focused on continuing to countermeasure all those things. So I think the idea that I think Chuck and I have spent a considerable amount of time making sure that we've got the actions in the businesses to go after this and that's why that even though you see a little bit of a lower OMX you see the continued strength in EPS and you see the continued strength in free cash flow. So the metric itself it's a little bit influenced by the way you measure tariffs and things like that. But at the end of the day what we don\u2019t change is you see the incredibly strong high-teens EPS growth and a continued focus on 120% free cash flow conversion. Operator : And your next question comes from Nigel Coe. Nigel Coe : So we covered a lot of ground. But I do want to go back to Gordian and Accruent and they\u2019d be rolled into core in 4Q. So may be just speak to how those performed in 1Q core on a like-for-like basis? How did they hold up in the current environment? And then the second part on that is just stripping out -- kind of to do the math on EBITDA margins, by the way the additional disclosure is great. It looks like the margin came in at about 23% to 24% for Gordian and Accruent. Is that math correct as we're working with low 30s for those two companies? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. You\u2019re talking about the EBITDA for Gordian and Accruent? This is what you said? Nigel Coe : That's right. James Lico : I think for this year, yes, it starts probably a little under that but not much and ramps through the year. So yes, that's correct. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then the like-for-like growth \u2026 James Lico : Nigel, your first question was I think around durability of Gordian and Accruent, is that? Nigel Coe : No, no. It's really more about how they performed in the quarter, Jim. James Lico : Got it. Got it. And I would also say just to that point is and may be just it's a small but important caveat we've spend a bunch of time with the businesses and we may choose to invest in the business through the year and in fact for sure we have had already approved some additional investments to accelerate the growth in the business too which may not necessary pay out in any particular quarter, but gives us a much more durable revenue stream in the years to come. So, you know us, you know from time-to-make we will make those decisions and that could impact that percentage by a few hundred basis points on when and how we do it. Nigel Coe : Okay. And the growth check, what was the growth at Gordian and Accruent? Charles McLaughlin : High single-digit in Q1 and that's what we expected, that's what we're seeing and we expect that as that comes into Q4 this year it's probably 30 point lift to our core growth. Nigel Coe : Okay. Great. And then quickly on ASP accretion. The saving of the accretion, looks like a nickle in 2Q, obviously like a $0.07 to $0.09 in 3Q, 4Q. Is that the TSA's roll off you alluded to, is that contributing to the better accretion in the back half of the year? And are we still looking at $0.30, $0.35 for the first 12 months? Charles McLaughlin : So, $0.30, $0.35 for first 12, that's still the range. And yes, for the most part and while it's stepping up as it goes through time, there is also a little bit seasonality, it\u2019s like many businesses the fourth quarters can be stronger than the first and what not. But I think those are major levers. Operator : And your next question comes from the John Walsh. John Walsh : A lot of ground covered so just a quick one here. Just looking at the language in your press release around the headwinds on Professional Instrumentation, just wanted to make sure I understood clearly, I mean, that's really a way to call out what you were talking about with the distribution channel or is there anything else that that language alludes to I guess? James Lico : No. It\u2019s really kind of in our short cycle businesses primarily it\u2019s Fluke and Tek. They\u2019d probably greater fourth quarter than we originally expected, which led to some -- and we will call most of that probably tariff avoidance. So there is a little bit of point-of-sale starting slower too in the first part of the quarter as well John. So, I think it's those two things. The destocking some of it is because of the point-of-sale, it's also some of the because of the increase in inventory that they had at the end of the year. John Walsh : Okay, great. And then I guess I'm looking at the Q you guys call out Germany as a country. Obviously, there's been a lot of concerns around Germany, given what we've seen from some of the macro data there, your sales are actually down very modestly. Maybe just help us understand really what drives your business there and maybe even broaden it out to Europe, because actually thought the European performance was a little bit better given some of the macros there? James Lico : Yes, I think, as we said, I would -- I'm still -- I still think Europe is a challenge for us. So, in the quarter Qualitrol and GVR which -- Qualitrol was one -- was a project, GVR was more secular, typically not a good read on the macro. That's a broader Europe comment, John. When you look at, Tek was down in Europe and a chunk of that was in Germany. Fluke had a weaker, but they weren't down in Europe, they were weaker than normal. So I think those are maybe a little bit more of a telltale sign of the macro. And so we don't have a big belief that that's going to significantly improve. For the rest of the year we'll sunset some easier comps, but I think we're watching. We're reading a lot of the same macro stuff. Everyone's reading. We're certainly looking through a lot of the other peer company filings to get a read on that. And I think it seems like it kind of depends.  So, the good news is like some of our software businesses have been pretty resilient. I think Accruent was up high-single-digits in Europe as an example. So the places where we have good resiliency within the business model are still doing pretty well. Operator : And your last question comes from Joe Giordano. Joseph Giordano : So Chuck could you give the specific number for Fluke, like I think you said Fluke Digital the growth was in the quarter and did you give like the legacy Fluke growth in the quarter? Charles McLaughlin : I don't believe I did. Total Fluke was low-single-digits, yes. Joseph Giordano : Low-single-digit, okay. And was there a management changes going on there this quarter? James Lico : Yes. So I think we were introducing -- but we did -- we announced a couple of changes. We put in many of our senior leaders have been sort of owner operators and businesses since our inception. We've hired somebody from the outside that was in immersion for a while, and put him -- Marc Tremblay into the Fluke job and we promoted Tami Newcombe into the Tektronix job. So those two organizational announcements have been out there and we're really excited about having two really strong leaders in the new positions also Pat and [West] obviously picked up a lot with all the new acquisitions. Pat certainly has been the lead role in ASP. So gives us the opportunity for the two of them to spend more time on building out the platforms and that kind of thing. Joseph Giordano : And then what the -- I just want to make sure on the build up here for Gordian and Accruent, if I am getting the math right. So I think it's $0.06 in 2Q with the expectations. Was it something like four in the first quarter here? Charles McLaughlin : I think we're saying $0.05. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And then, we're having that into core in 4Q right, so the incremental on top of that in your full year, that's just in from the third quarter, right? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. It\u2019s in core in the fourth quarter. James Lico : So I think that\u2019s it. Thanks, everybody, for a great interaction and the time today. Obviously a busy day for everyone and so we appreciate the time you've taken to be with us. We are really proud of the work we did in the quarter. Certainly some things affect. But as I think mentioned we\u2019re very focused on that, but at the same time the ability to sort of do what we believe is going to be a strong year. We\u2019re off to a good start. We look forward to seeing all of you in New York in May and we will give you more detail on ASP, on Gordian or Accruent. We will certainly outline our digital strategy and certainly give you a better perspective on a number of the strategies that we are utilizing to drive growth this year, but more importantly to build a better Fortive over time. Thanks and Griffin and team and Chuck are around for questions tonight, tomorrow and next week. Take care, everybody. Have a great week. Operator : Thank you.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Today we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.90 for the second quarter of 2019, representing an increase of 18% year-over-year and hitting the high-end of our guide, despite evidence of slowing in our short cycle businesses as we progress through the quarter. In the face of these headwinds, which negatively impacted core growth in our professional instrumentation segment, the Fortive team delivered high-teens total revenue growth, including continued outperformance at the Varco Bitterroot and another quarter of strong free cash flow conversion, driven by disciplined execution and the strength of the Fortive business system. Our strong earnings and cash flow performance reflected the momentum of our capital deployment strategy as acquisitions continue to enhance the growth profile and reduce the cyclicality of our portfolio. Importantly, the integration of advanced sterilization products has gotten off to a good start solid start as it delivered a greater than expected earnings contribution during our first quarter of ownership. We look forward to providing additional updates as integration progresses and we exit the majority of our transition services agreement with Johnson & Johnson through the first half of 2020.  At the same time the earlier acquisitions of ISC and Landauer continue to deliver strong results, increasing the resilience of the portfolio as they generated high single-digit core growth and 360 basis points of core OMX on a combined basis. Gordian and Accruent also continue to perform well and will be additive to core growth in the Professional Instrumentation segment when they turn core during the third quarter. Consistent with the broader, digital strategy that we highlighted during our May investor conference, we recently completed three additional acquisitions within field solutions. The acquisitions of intellect and safer systems as well as proof technique demonstrate our ability to continue to find high quality companies to accelerate our digital strategy, and bring connected workflow solutions to our customers. With that, I\u2019d like to turn to the details of the quarter, adjusted net earnings were $322.3 million, up 19.2% over the prior year and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.90. Sales grew 16.4% to $1.9 billion, reflecting a core revenue increase of 2%. Core revenue growth was highlighted by strong performance in the Varco Bitterroot, EMC and industrial scientific, which is partially offset flat quarter from fluke and a decline in Tektronix. Acquisitions, including Gordian, Accruent and ASP contributed 1,650 basis points of top-line growth, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 210 basis points. Geographically high-growth markets core revenue decreased low-single digits due to weaker market conditions in Asia and Latin America. In India strong growth in fluke was more than offset by timing on some large orders at GVR that pushed into the second half of the year. We continue to expect strong growth in India for the full year. China posted low-single digit growth with strong performances at ISC and sensing technologies, the more modest growth across Fluke, Tektronix and GVR. Developed markets core revenue grew low-single digits as strength in North America was partially offset by weakness in Western Europe. Core revenue growth in North America was mid-single digits, led by GVR, EMC and Industrial Scientific, while Western Europe decreased low-single digits with continued growth at GVR. Reported operating margin was 13.4%, reflecting 540 basis points of dilution from acquisitions, and 180 basis points of dilution for deal related costs. Core operating margins increased 30 basis points as continued strong volume at GVR and the disciplined application of FBS help offset headwinds within professional instrumentation. During the second quarter, we generated $236 million of free cash flow and a conversion ratio of 134%. While we anticipate a continuation of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we expect sustained strong free cash flow generation and conversion of greater than 125% for the full year.  Turning to our segments, Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 27.5% on relatively flat core revenue. This growth performance reflected the continued transformation of Professional Instrumentation over the past few years, with acquisitions driving growth, contributing 2,930 basis points during the quarter. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 190 basis points. Reported operating margin of 10.8% reflected 1,220 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions and deal related costs, including purchase accounting adjustments, and transaction expenses from the initial closing of ASP. Core operating margins decreased basis points, reflecting slower revenue performance, the impact of tariffs and unfavorable foreign exchange. Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue was flat as strong performance at EMC and Industrial Scientific was offset by the slowing in Fluke and Tektronix. Field Solutions core revenue was flat with developed markets growing slightly paced by the continued strong performance of ISC. High growth markets decrease low-single digits as slightly positive growth is Fluke and a strong performance from ISC in China were more than offset by the expected weakness at Qualitrol.  While not yet core we were very pleased with the continued performance of Accruent and Gordian. Accruent continues to see strong growth in North America across a variety of end markets, driven by demand for its lease management and space optimization offerings. Gordian\u2019s growth continues to be paced by its procurement platform, driven by increased construction volumes for new customers, including the Hawaii Department of Education and the City of Atlanta.  Fluke\u2019s core revenue was flat, as low-single digit growth at Fluke industrial and calibration, and mid-single digit growth and Fluke Networks was offset by declines in tomography, process instruments and Health Solutions. Fluke Digital Systems grew 30% as eMaint generated high-single digit net new customer growth, and a greater than 20% increase in annual recurring revenue. Fluke generated low-single digit growth in China and we remain watchful for more potential slowing in that market through the second half. As we highlighted at the investor conference in May Fluke recently launched a new Sonic Industrial Imager, a revolutionary product which enables maintenance teams to quickly and accurately locate air, gas and vacuum leaks, utilizing Fluke\u2019s state of the art sound site technology. Fluke also completed the bolt-on acquisition of Pruftechnik, a leader in vibration monitoring, alignment and testing equipment and services. The acquisition of Pruftechnik accelerates Fluke\u2019s asset, liability and condition monitoring strategy, which now accounts for greater than $200 million in total revenue, with a combination of industry leading measurement tools, and best in class domain expertise. ISC delivered mid-single digit core revenue growth, this was led by North America and Asia Pacific, including strong performance in China, which more than offset some slowing in Western Europe. iNet registered another strong quarter with high-teens growth, while rental generated high-single digit growth against a tough compare from the prior year. ISC delivered 290 basis points of OMX in the quarter as strong mix and PPV execution through the application of the Fortive Business System continues to drive consistent operational improvement. Industrial Scientific recently completed the acquisition of Intellects [ph], a leading provider of the HNF software, and safer systems, who's leading cloud based platform provides real time hazard analysis and risk assessment to the chemical, oil and gas and transportation sectors. These acquisitions significantly advanced ISC\u2019s safety as a service strategy to provide a comprehensive real time connection between its customers workforce and assets and the management of their environmental, health and safety related workflows. Qualitrol\u2019s core revenue declined low-double digits in line with our expectations. Qualitrol continues to see early signs of a more stable conditions in certain markets, as it generated positive bookings growth for the first time in eight quarters. While North America remains challenged due to lower retrofit project spending, the Middle East increased low-double digits, the first positive performance in the region in seven quarters, driven by the release of some previously delayed projects. Product realization core revenue was flat as strong double-digit growth at EMC was offset by weakness in Tektronix. EMC generated broad based growth across its core aerospace and defense product lines, as well as its commercial satellite offering. A record backlog at the end of the quarter as EMC well positioned for continued growth, supported by the scaling up of key customer programs and market share gains. Tektronix registered a mid-single digit decrease in core revenue, much of this weakness was driven by continued slowing at KEITHLEY. Weakness in Western Europe, and the negative impact associated with Huawei\u2019s inclusion on the U.S. restricted entity list in May. The slowing macro conditions in Western Europe led to a high-teens decrease and had a broad based impact across Tektronix\u2019s product lines. We expect headwinds at KEITHLEY and in Western Europe to persist in the coming quarters, as will challenges from Huawei status, pending any resolution of ongoing trade hostilities between the U.S. and China. Tektronix\u2019s investments are driving growth mid-range scopes, as its new offerings continue to perform well growing high-single digits and marking 10 consecutive quarters of strong growth. The successful launch of the new three and four series MSOs added to the continued success of the five and six series including several large deals with enterprise customers. Tektronix recently closed the previously announced transaction to contribute its video tasks and monitoring business to a new entity form with Telestream and Genstar Capital. Core revenue for sensing technologies increased low-single digits, the platform saw solid growth across the medical and critical environment end markets, driven by new product introductions and continued share gains. However headwinds from semiconductor equipment customers continued and sensing also saw broader slowing across its core industrial end markets towards the end of the quarter. China continue to perform well with greater than 20% growth, but was partially offset by weakness in North America and Western Europe. We're also seeing good early traction in Sensing\u2019s IoT offerings, including SBT\u2019s AccuBin platform for supply chain applications, and the oil condition monitoring system from Gems.  Turning to Advanced Sterilization products, the company got off to a solid start in the second quarter and were pleased with how the integration is progressing. ASP grew low-single digits in line with our expectations led by strong performance in China. ASP also saw improved growth in Japan, led by strong performance in Terminal Sterilization, as well as growth in high level disinfection, supported by the successful introduction of the ENDOCLENS cleanse, Neo D are new automatic endoscope re-processor product for the Japanese market. North America was slightly positive and up sequentially from the first quarter, driven by Terminal Sterilization consumables. During the quarter, ASP saw several large orders from a range of new and existing integrated delivery network customers. Moving to Industrial Technologies, revenue grew 2.6%, including core revenue growth of 4.4%, acquisitions contributed 50 basis points, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 230 basis points. Reported operating margin was 20.9% and core operating margin increased 210 basis points driven by continued strong volume at GVR and solid performance at Matco.  Our Transportation Technologies platform core revenue grew mid-single digits, led by high-single digit growth in North America. GVR delivered high single digit core revenue growth highlighted by a low-double digit increase in developed markets, strength in North America reflected the continuation of strong EMV related sales, while Western Europe reflected share gains and strong spending by BP's [indiscernible] subsidiary. Gilbarco also completed outdoor EMV capable software releases of its passport point of sale system on the Citgo and Shell Networks. Passport is now available on more than 70% of Gilbarco\u2019s install base, well ahead of other point of sale competitors. In high growth markets GVR posted a mid-single digit decline compared to greater than 30% growth in the prior year period, as the timing of tenders in China and India shifted volume into the second half of the year. GVR is up high-single digits year-to-date in high growth markets paced by momentum from Orpak\u2019s leading automation offering with strong orders and a healthy backlog that will support strong growth in the coming quarters. GVR also launched its new high growth markets dispenser platform Latitude, which has been very well received by customers thus far and is expected to drive additional growth going.  In-line with expectations TeletracNavman's core revenue decrease low-double digits in the second quarter and strong growth across Asia Pacific was more than offset by a decline in North America and Western Europe. While North America remains a significant headwind, the TeletracNavman teams continued focus on stabilizing the businesses resulted in a reduction in customer churn. We expect to see continued improvement in the coming quarters for bookings in ACV and on the backs of new product launches as well as better performance across large enterprise customers and the SMB sales channel.  Moving to franchise distribution, the platforms core revenue increased low-single digits during the second quarter. As mid-single digit growth at Matco was partially offset by a mid-single digit decline in Hennessy. Matco outperforming in the quarter paced by strong growth in diagnostics and hardline tools. High-teens growth in diagnostics was due in part two new additions to Matco's Maximus family of diagnostic products. The Maximus Flash Plus which provides OEM level live diagnostics expertise, and the Max Flex a full featured diagnostic tablet offered with a highly customizable monthly subscription plans. Turning to the guide. We are updating our full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $3.45 to $3.60 representing year-over-year growth of 13% to 18% on a continuing operations basis. The revised annual guidance has been reduced to reflect the short cycle slowing trends that emerged during the second quarter, which we expect to impact demand through the second half of the year.  The revised guidance assumes 2.5% to 3.5% core revenue growth and effective tax rate of 16.1% and free cash flow conversion of greater than 125% for the year. We are also initiating our third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.83 to $0.88, representing year-over-year growth of 19% at the high-end. This includes assumption of 2% to 4% core revenue growth, 25 basis points of core OMX, and an effective tax rate of 16.1%. To wrap up, we delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth and strong free cash flow conversion, despite some slowing across the short cycle elements of our portfolio. Disciplined execution and the application of FBS delivered 30 basis points of core OMX in the face of both the anticipated challenges from tariffs and foreign exchange, and the lower than expected volume from Fluke and Tektronix during the quarter. The strong performance of our acquisition from the past few years continues to enhance the growth and resilience of the overall portfolio, positioning us well to deliver -- continue to deliver top quartile child earnings growth. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Griffin. Griffin Whitney : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Jason, we're now ready for questions. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good afternoon. James Lico : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Maybe a first question just around some of the phasing of earnings in the second half. So just taking the midpoint of third quarter, midpoint of the full year guide. It looks like you have about a 25% EPS increase sequentially in Q4. So just wanted to check if that's roughly correct and what drives such a big up uplift? I understand last Q4, you had a big sequential increase, but there was a lot of pre-buy helping that? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. I think there's a few things when you look at the way you will get. One is there's normal seasonality between Q3 and Q4, so you get more volume there. There's also the year-on-year core growth that we got between 2% and 4%. And then there's the year-on-year whiffed of Gordian and Accruent and ASP. And I think those two things -- those three things get you to the year-on-year whiffed. The way I look at it is, when I look at it from year-on-year last year, I think we were at $0.91 at the -- I think the high-end of our guide we're talking about around 15% high-teens to 18% increase in the fourth quarter. Julian Mitchell : Understood, thank you. And then maybe just following up on the free cash flow. That was under some pressure in the second quarter, it look like the working capital for the half as a whole particularly on receivables was a bit of an outflow. So maybe talk through how quickly that free cash flow recovers. Charles McLaughlin : Certainly, so the main thing that -- first of all most the businesses are performing very well and delivering a lot of cash flow, but the big outlier here is ASP that we just recently acquired as part of the deal acquired deal that we signed. And we got no receivables NAP, so there is going to be this one-time hole as we refill that -- those receivables that can put us behind on cash flow, but except for that one time thing that will be roughly done halfway through Q3. I think that we see our ongoing free cash flow, growing roughly in line with the growth we see in adjusted earnings. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Julian. Operator : And your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. James Lico : Hi, Scott. Scott Davis : Just as a big picture observation looking at slide four and the SG&A deltas. Are there any structural reasons Jim and Chuck why the newer assets once they get fully on boarded, can have SG&A levels more traditional Fortive call 25% ballpark? Charles McLaughlin : Scott its Charles, couple of things that one, the whiffed you are seeing year-on-year is primarily about the amortization that was added as well as the deal cost that\u2019s going on. So that's pretty close to 290 basis points. James Lico : And I think relative to the businesses we\u2019re acquiring and I would look at the software businesses are having a little bit more SG&A that typically goes with a higher gross margins. And even in the G&A they tend to have a little bit more IT expense because we have IT expense related to some of the capability that you built to house the data and all those things. So probably a little bit more estimated driven by a little bit more engineering, little bit more sales cost just because of direct selling, but the higher gross margin certainly pay for that. And if you're just purely look at G&A in some of the new businesses, particularly, the software businesses you tend to see a little bit more G&A because of a little bit more IT expense. But I think in general when you look at in ASP where businesses that look a little bit more like the business we have today, you see no reason why over time they would have a similar cost structure to what we've been able to achieve in other businesses. Scott Davis : Okay, I think that answers it. And then, just trying to get a sense channel visibility, do you have particularly. I guess when you think what about ISC and Landauer I guess to a lesser extent ASP, do you have a good sense of any given time where inventory levels are versus the sell through? James Lico : We have decent visibility on ASP, so as we get the business more in line, we get off of some of these transition service agreements. We will have a better ability to see into those channels with some of the key channel partners. In the neighborhood of how we see things in other parts of the portfolio. Some of the others, ISC we\u2019re starting to achieve that as we continue to work with some of the similar channel partners that we have currently with other parts of Fortive. So ultimately we\u2019ll have a little bit more visibility than we do today, but it won't reside with the kind of visibility say that we get at Fluke where we get a pretty decent chunk of the U.S. and European distribution channel partners. Scott Davis : Okay. Super helpful, thank you guys. James Lico : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. How's it going? James Lico : Good. Steve Tusa : Just on the different deals, can you give us like the actual revenue numbers for ASP, ISC and what\u2019s the other one, ASP, Gordian and Accruent? Charles McLaughlin : So for ASP on an annualize basis, I\u2019m going to give you the end market numbers, it\u2019s a little over $800 million this year maybe call it $820 million and I think that you asked about ISC, is it\u2019s north of 200. Steve Tusa : Yes, sorry, I was asking more about the quarter the actual quarter. So how much in ASP contribute in a quarter and then Gordian and Accruent in the quarter? Charles McLaughlin : So nothing on core revenue, obviously. But I think the number -- I want to make sure you understand about the day two countries, that our distributors sets a little bit haircut from what we saw in our numbers. So I think that -- let me just get that number for you really quick now. And then I'll come right back to you. Steve Tusa : So you are saying you guys have -- the distributors have changed buying patterns something in the near-term? Charles McLaughlin : No, so outside the U.S., ASP is still being managed by J&J. And they're acting as the distributor. So therefore while you'd expect us to have a little over $200 million in this quarter, because ASP takes a haircut off of their portion of it, say maybe a third of the business. This quarter, we had $167 million hit our reported numbers. Steve Tusa : Okay. Got it. And then what about Gordian and Accruent? Charles McLaughlin : Yes they\u2019re just a little bit about -- those two are about a little over $100 million. Steve Tusa : Okay. And is there -- I guess, when it comes to the kind of shorter cycle businesses, any trends through the quarter that more notable? I mean, did you exit worse than you started? And are you seeing anything so far in July that changes your views on that at all? Charles McLaughlin : Yes, I think Steve, when we talked at EPG, we talked about North America being pretty good. And I think in total that was true. Although it was more Gilbarco and less Fluke and Tek. And we saw June sort of changed it for both Fluke and Tek. So I would say, what we really think about when we think about the second half guide for Fluke and Tek, we really sort of looked at the weeks of supply of inventory, we looked at point of sale, and really reflected that in the revenue drop. So we really think that's probably what we'll see in a second half. I think the other thing that's probably the bigger change is Europe, we -- I think I said flattish for what we probably think in Europe, we are obviously down low-single digit. And again, that was principally at Fluke and Tek, and they were down more than 2.5, or low-single digits. So what we really ended up seeing is a slower Europe until a point-of-sale in June. So it's really what we try to account for in the second half forecast is that as well. And probably the more precipitous drop between say two, three months ago for the second half, is how -- is our view in Professional Instrumentation for Europe? Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one last one third quarter operating margins, what where should that kind of range be for the segments? Because it feel like we have to hit some pretty hard to kind of get to where your guide is. Charles McLaughlin : So I\u2019d say one I don't think we have to hit them particularly hard. Are you talking about core operating margins, or you just want to\u2026 Steve Tusa : Yes, segment margins for 3Q, however you want to talk about them? Charles McLaughlin : In the 22-23 range. Steve Tusa : Yes. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hi, good afternoon. James Lico : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hi, just a follow up on Steve questions, you did highlight that Fluke and Tek is driving sort of European weakness. So what exactly is happening in Fluke and Tek, any specific industry trends that are causing the slowdown? And how does it get better and why? James Lico : Well, I'll answer the second one, how does it get better I think is much a macro question probably as any right. That's a -- we really decided to put it to be prudent and not assume that it will get better in the second half, Andrew. More specifically, to your first question, I think we saw a more precipitous drop at Tek. Definitely it was channel destocking, but we also saw demand go down. We saw -- so I think from that standpoint, it was across all the product lines, there was certainly an automotive component to that. While that's -- so that's not an enormous exposure to us, but we do sell into the R&D labs of automotive and that was slower for sure. Just as one example of what we saw.  Relative to Fluke, I think it was -- we saw June drop in point-of-sale. And, to be honest with you, that's also reflected in how we think about the second half as well. So, and it was relatively broad based as well. So I think from that standpoint, it feels more macroeconomic, end user demand, if you will, then it feels just destocking. And, so I think that's how we're going to reflect that's what's reflected and how we see everything right now and we'll look for signs for improvement.  And, Steve asked how -- and how July looks and that kind of thing, and we're seeing nothing in July at this point that would tell us any different than where we're at right now. It's very early days in July as you know particularly in the U.S. because of the holiday week. Andrew Obin : And there just sort of also margin you had good pricing in PI this quarter, I think 1.3%, PI core was down 140 bps. So how does core margin and pricing trend in the second half in PI? Charles McLaughlin : Hey Andrew, this is Chuck. So, you're right, the pricing was good, but it was a little bit more it was offset by the slowing volume. Although down 140 basis points of core OMX in Q2 has sequentially improved from Q1, I would expect that -- if we -- first of all, if we hadn't had the slowdown, we probably would have been 100 basis points better in Q2 on OMX at PI. I would expect because we're going to start lapping some of the tariffs and continued discipline in FDS [ph] and improving margins that will continue to see sequential improvements from Q2 to Q3 and then again from Q3 to Q4. But I don't think it has -- it will get positive in Q3, but in Q4, I believe that PI has a good chance too. Andrew Obin : And pricing is sustainable? Charles McLaughlin : I think I think we put in a lot of price last year. So I think we'll -- the price metric might be a little bit less first half to second half because of all the price we put in last year for the tariffs, but that'll be offset by the tariffs being in the comp. So I think you'll see, the difference between those two things probably isn't much, first half to second half. Andrew Obin : Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : And our next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. James Lico : Good evening, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey. I would assume that you all follow the same practice that was established at Danaher, that after the 100 days of an acquisition, you reevaluate there -- assess how the integration is going and maybe for ASP you could share what you've learned, positives, negatives, what's gone well, any kind of surprises along the way? And then I've got a couple of follow-ups there. James Lico : Well, a couple things. We about 100 days about 100 some days, so we haven't quite finished it. But I've been pretty close to what we've seen and what we've been doing. So I think I've either been with ASP team, either with customers or with them, pretty much every week over the last several weeks. We'll see their 100 day here shortly. But I think at the end of the day, what we've seen is, is in some of it we really felt we saw in the quarter we really like the market position, it's very clear that the Terminal Sterilization aspects of the market are really important to the hospital, and our ability to sort of expand on that I think we see some real opportunities for FBS, particularly in sales force management, funnel management. We've put in a number of those tools here recently. I think we see a lot of supply chain opportunities which is consistent with how we saw some of the value creation. So I think strategically, the growth in China was something that we saw in the quarter. And we also think we have a good opportunity in China. That's an important part of how we'll see the future. So I think when you think about it, our U.S. position is good, our Terminal Sterilization position globally is good. And the high growth markets represent some opportunities are three important strategic priorities. But also the opportunity for FBS to add value is, I think, very consistent, probably even more than we thought. Although it's really early days, we have a lot of work, as we said in the prepared remarks, Deane, around getting through some of these transitions service agreements. So that's going to take us a little while, but we're really excited about the team there and our opportunity to work together with them to really create a really great business over time. Deane Dray : That's helpful. Just can you comment on those transition services that in answering Steve's question, Chuck talked about the J&J services outside the U.S. when will that end? And then maybe I missed this in the deal closing, but the receivables were not part of the acquisition, was that reflected in the purchase price was that a post-closing adjustment? James Lico : We can tag team this one, I think the transition services agreement, we\u2019ve got a lot of work between now and the end of the year. So I would say a big number -- while a lot of little things will occur between now and the end of the year. What we will start to see is that the takeover of a lot of those countries really starting to occur more accelerating into 2020. And as we said in the prepared remarks toward the end of the first half of 2020 is kind when we get this -- get that most of those things completed. So a lot of work between now and then, we took on Canada as a country that was just recently, but I think a lot of the work from here to the end of the year is really about to doing the spadework the foundational work to be set up systems and things like that. So, it's really good to be in 2020, where you start to see a number of those things occurring. Deane Dray : About the receivables? Charles McLaughlin : Yes, that was contemplated in the deal from the 0 :37:39. So we knew about that I think everybody there were happy with the deal we struck with them that was very fair but that wasn\u2019t a port deal adjustment. Deane Dray : Got it. Why don\u2019t you do it with the payables instead? Charles McLaughlin : To be clear it was receivables then payables. So it is both of those. Deane Dray : Good to hear. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citi Bank. Andy Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, guys. James Lico : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : As we think about the walk to ago from $3.06 in 2018 to new guide of $3.45 to $3.60, the big piece of that change from last quarter\u2019s guide just the lowering of the $0.30 [ph] in core revenue growth contribution and maybe some FX. Was there any lowering of Gordian and Accruent under ASP and then how much did [indiscernible] Pruftechnik add if anything into the core EPS growth? James Lico : And so Andy, the only lowering that we done is really about the slowing in our short cycle, primarily in PI. The acquisitions are all performing at or above what we expected. And there has been no change -- we\u2019re not changing anything in our guide about that nor do we expect to. So I think that's the main point of your question. Andy Kaplowitz : Yes, it is and [indiscernible] Pruftechnik did they add anything into the EPS? James Lico : Not this year, they are -- we -- five months to go there is some deal costs associated with that, but no meaningful earnings up or down for those deals. Andy Kaplowitz : That\u2019s helpful. And then, Jim, you mentioned GVR in high growth markets slowed down a bit it looks like it\u2019s just push outs as we talked about, did you guys expecting push outs and we know there is going to be some difficult comps at some points there had to be in the growth markets. Did you see any slowing in the business other than you saw the push outs which have been happening [indiscernible] in second half of the year? James Lico : Well I think it\u2019s really two countries. And I think GVR -- the India story I think is very much one -- we won a significant number of tenders and it's just getting things through the contract process and really getting things installed and all that. So we have a very good color on the backlog and feel very good, I wouldn't read anything into the India thing and high growth markets growth year-to-date for Gilbarco is still growing. So it's really the second quarter dynamics of some things in India that are pushing. There is probably a little bit of slowing in China but that really has to do with just really substantial growth last year through the double wall tank upgrades and we\u2019re still seeing some wins that will be in the second half. So we still see growth in China for Gilbarco for the year, but again a tender or two pushed into the quarter and that\u2019s not unusual in this business quite frankly, for it happen in India and China at the same time maybe that's a little bit unusual. But we feel really confident about high-growth market growth for GVR in the year. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. James Lico : Thanks, Andy. Operator : And our next question is from John Inch of Gordon Hasket. John Inch : Hey, guys. By the way I was thinking considering recent events, you should be congratulated again on the ANF deal. So I just going to throw that out there. Hey, just in terms of the quarterly growth, organic growth forecast kind of the two to four for the second half, and I think you're assuming two to four for the third quarter and implicitly two to four for fourth quarter. Third quarter has a lot easier comparisons, if I recollect right, because fourth quarter, you had the pre-buy, you had the deferral of Gilbarco Veeder-Root from third quarter to fourth quarter. Is there any sort of assumption you're making that fourth quarter is somehow going to get better or what's really sort of baked into the assumptions here? James Lico : I think when we get to the fourth quarter, some of our acquisitions, particularly, Gordian and Accruent are going to turn core and so that does help us against a more difficult comp for sure. And I think that in the third quarter, I think that there is easier comp to last year. But, we've got a little bit wider range than we normally talked about. So I think you can figure out how that might go up from -- we expected at this point from Q3 to Q4. But we're watching what's going on here pretty intently. John Inch : So there's no presumption of any kind of natural pickup or order trends that come in or something like that. It's just -- just takeaway the way that chips fall, right? James Lico : Yes, there's a little bit there -- as I was just answering Andy's questions, where the India tenders falling, could help a little bit here and there. And so there's a little bit of where those fall. But I think as Chuck mentioned, as you said, a little bit tougher comp in the fourth quarter, but we really get a full quarter of Gordian and Accruent in the fourth quarter. So that sort of makes up for a little bit of that slightly tougher comp. But there's really no expectation regionally or by business of any big pickup within the year relative to core grow. John Inch : And those businesses are doing well Gordian and Accruent so that's just kind of make sense. James Lico : Yes, as we said in the prepared remarks, we're really happy with the take rate and things that are going on there. And, were so far so good. John Inch : In last quarter, I think you said point of sale trends kind of began to improve as the quarter progressed and into March, did that all of a sudden just kind of hit a wall and sort of drop and hold or what actually kind of happen from first quarter to second quarter, that might give us kind of a little thought processes as to how we kind of move through the rest of the year? James Lico : Yes, you have a good memory. So March, it's really the -- particularly the Fluke point-of-sale trends. The Fluke point-of-sale trends turned up in March, and that made us feel pretty good about things and even in first part of April, they were pretty good. And they held in there a little bit through May. But they did slow a little bit, particularly in the U.S., or particularly in Europe, they slowed in June for sure a big time.  And what we also saw was just a more days' supply of inventory starting to change and channel partners starting to make some decisions around slowing sell in and even in cases where we might have had consistent sales out. We still saw people -- we typically see an inventory build first quarter to second quarter. So days' supply this is in Fluke days' supply typically goes up a little bit in the second quarter. And then -- and what we saw this year was not that at all. So clearly people were managing inventory tighter and I suspect it had a lot to do with the uncertainty. So in the case of Europe, we definitely saw sales out go pretty down pretty quickly in June. And in the case of U.S., we started down a little bit, but we saw sell in go slow down and weeks of supply pop-up. So we've put all of those assumptions into the second half. John Inch : Just last detrimental margins and Fluke and Tek I think they are down in some regions globally, right that you guys have called out. What sort of detrimental are you seeing in those businesses? Again, where there is a little bit of softness today? Charles McLaughlin : Well, in the short run when it goes down as a detrimental. They're pretty consistent across around the world. There's not one margin that\u2019s really that much different than the others. But they will in the short run go down over 50%. James Lico : Yes, particularly when most of it was in June, John. Just a little bit more on that, we're really -- particularly in Fluke, we're really consistent around the world relative to margin structure. So when that stuff happens in the short run. We're obviously working very hard in June and right now to make sure that we improve those as we go through the year. John Inch : Awesome. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Richard Eastman of Baird. Richard Eastman : Yes. Thank you. Hey, Jim, could you just follow up on the question once around tech. I'm curious, I presume KEITHLEY softness is due to the semi market. But you did reference Huawei\u2019s impact there. Can you just kind of parse that out a little bit I would think there were their R&D tools at tech are probably what's a problem for the Huawei entity list? But could you just kind of parse out the growth rate? I think you said tech was down mid-single digit. And what piece was maybe KEITHLEY, and there half and half or is Huawei outweighted there over weighted. James Lico : Yeah so, what I would say first and foremost is you're right around the KEITHLEY really is, as you as you well know. KEITHLEY is very much -- has more semiconductor exposure than the tech as whole, and it has more electronics, manufacturing exposure, as well and More Asia exposure. And so I think the slowing at KEITHLEY was more broad based than just China and more than just semiconductors, but very much, I would say an Asia story. And the Asia, sort of electronics manufacturing story where we saw the slowing. And exactly right it was Huawei, it's mostly R&D tools, and mostly scope. So our check go through the math. I think the one thing we were very pleased with, as I said in the prepared remarks was the strength of scopes, particularly in the midrange. We continue to grow our sole scope platform, if you will particularly the new platform very well. Charles McLaughlin : And I think that when you will put numbers to that, I think Huawei was a little over $10 million, let\u2019s called 1.25%. And then I think that -- and roughly KEITHLEY was down about twice that. James Lico : So two thirds and three quarters of the miss is those two. And then the other rest of it is really Western Europe, kind of broadly defined. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then just a really quick question around the IT margins op margins, when I look at that the incremental was literally 100% there. And is that largely just -- is that GVR volume absorption? Is that pretty much which delivering that or? Charles McLaughlin : Well, I think there is certainly volume always helps and can concierge. But also, what's in there is there's always one timers, both good and bad last year was probably a little easier compared the ebbs and flows. Try until it get to focused on any one quarter and back it up and just say, that business when it's growing well, 50 basis points is a good OMX number, but that can do just what they did this score. You see something stronger, I just remember that when goes to zero, one quarter doesn't mean anything either. So\u2026 Richard Eastman : Okay, fair enough. James Lico : And if you look at the segment of Matco had a good quarter as well. And obviously that's a good business for us. So I think the other part of the story probably is we saw some nice -- saw some good things in Matco this quarter as well. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then just real quick, Jim, did you say Gordian accruing their core growth, I know it's not included in yours, but their core growth was high-single digits did it hold that both? James Lico : Yes. The combined number is probably high-single digits. That's right. Charles McLaughlin : And that\u2019s tracking that this year is why we're very excited. Yeah, we're encouraged it does playing out like we expected. Richard Eastman : Perfect. Okay, thank you. James Lico : Thanks, Rick. Operator : And our next question comes from John Walsh of Credit Suisse. James Lico : Hey, John. John Walsh : Hi, good afternoon and evening. Actually, following up on that question, one of the things when you got it you talked about macro uncertainly of the short cycle businesses. We always think of CapEx projects. But as you think about some of these more software businesses, Gordian and Accruent, for example. What are the factors you're tracking, whether it's leads or coding activity to have confidence that they can sustain this kind of high-single digit growth rate, when there is kind of this industrial uncertainty out there. But that's not to say you can't spill into other parts of the economy. James Lico : Yes, so I would say we look at a couple things. And Gordian and Accruent a little bit different. And maybe we'll talk about eMaint as well. And eMaint would have a little bit more industrial exposure. But as you know with these high recurring revenue businesses, they're not going to necessarily move tomorrow kind of stuff. And so, what we're really looking is the new order bookings, the new customer bookings, to see as we said on the case of eMaint, we had very significant new customer bookings. So we're really looking at new customer bookings, because that's going to move the needle down the road. We're looking at churn to see if customers are canceling. Sometimes in an economic slowdown, you might start to see people say, well, I don't need all of this, I'll maybe use less seats or whatever, for lack of a better term. So we're looking at those metrics very closely. And quite frankly the people in those businesses are looking at them every day. So when you look at those metrics, and that's why we mentioned some of the things like iNet new bookings are really good. So, we\u2019re really looking for these high recurring revenue businesses, we're really looking at those annual bookings numbers, and we're looking at the average contract value, what we call ACV, and we're looking at churn. And we look at those three metrics to really understand what is it really gives us a good view of how the business is going to be in a couple quarters. John Walsh : Okay. And then I think the capacity number as it stands right now north of $1.4 billion, maybe just kind of talk us through the pipeline, and if there's kind of anything do you expect in the near-term? James Lico : Yeah, well, I hate to comment anything in the near-term, and quite frankly, we commented on near-term, because some of the deals we were talking about, we've obviously closed in the last 30 days. We're really -- and maybe I'll use the last few as an example, we're incredibly pleased at the deals we got done. The -- this quarter, I mean, when you look at, obviously ASP is a transformational business for us in many respects. And we're really excited about that. You look at the two businesses, two years ago, we bought ISC, because we're really excited about this, the workflows around safety, and now we close two deals that one is a bolt-on safer systems. It really helps them really gives us a new set of modules to sell on top of the iNet platform and then Intellects really gives us a great new adjacent market for EH&F [ph] software.  So we\u2019re really well positioned in the workflows one with a bolt-on the other with an adjacency. And then obviously proof technique, a classic bolt-on for Fluke significantly raises our game and condition monitoring and gives us a team that's incredibly experienced at understanding condition monitoring particularly around vibration. So that's -- those are those are the kinds of deals that are still in the funnel and I think what we've done in the second quarter and early in the third is really when I talk about is a great example of when I talk about breath of the funnel John, we're really -- and that funnel continues to have good breath. Obviously very much in field solutions this quarter, in particular the last three I just mentioned, but we feel good about the funnel and the breadth of the funnel. Deane Dray : All right, thank you. James Lico : Thank you Operator : And our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolf Research. James Lico : Hey, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Good afternoon, James. Hey guys. Just want to revisit ASP, we've added that one a fair bit so far, but I do want to talk about the EBITDA contribution. I think Chuck this might be to you. I'm calculating EBITDA margin on acquisitions about 24%. That's similar to last quarter, I'm guessing Gordian and Accruent stepped up on higher revenues to maybe the upper 20s, with ASP in the teens, is that sort of the right math? And my real question is, if that's the case, given that the TSA don\u2019t really roll off until 2020, should we expect higher EBITDA from ASP through the back half of the year, or that now more of a 2020 story? James Lico : Well there\u2019ll be -- so couple of things, I'm not sure I caught the last part about the teams of ASP on EBITDA, but I think when we get to the other side, which is the nature of your question, in the starting out in the mid-20s is a good place for us to be mid to upper 20s is I think where we're going to go. I think that there\u2019ll be some accretion from TSAs in the back half of the year. I think we closed Canada, but that's not a -- they're going to start slow and then they're going to pick up speed. Fourth quarter, there'll be a little bit of whiffed and then continue to accelerate closing more of those in Q1 and Q2 of next year. So that's the day two country TSAs and then there's an IT system that stand up, and that's not a gradual, that's more of a cut over, that'll happen sometime in the first half of next year. Nigel Coe : And this is all to do with making sure that you're crossing the checking the boxes on the regulatory side to more than anything else, is that correct? James Lico : We're really carving a business right out of ASP. So with that we're recreating more than just the RA QA systems but also several of the other systems in the business, like the financial system, ERP, a lot of those things we already have, but in other places we're adding -- we're creating those things. We're re-creating what they have. So, that's a good part of it, but it's spadework we\u2019ve got to get done. Nigel Coe : Yes. And then just a quick follow on, Jim, you mentioned that trend got kind of progressing well through the quarter, I\u2019m not sure if you address whether it seem elements of stabilization in Q3. And maybe just characterize what you seen in China right now and how is the behavior from your customers in China? James Lico : I think when we look at -- as I said that the changes that we saw and really we\u2019re talking about PI here. We saw a little bit slowly in the U.S. it's probably too early to tell whether or not the first couple of weeks of July have really seen a difference. I would say we've seen consistently in Europe and what we saw in June we\u2019re still seeing so that's probably color and China probably similar story. We haven't seen anything that would tell us that the things are moving around to the good or that are getting more negative at this point. But I caveat that with July is generally the first part -- first two weeks, first three weeks of the quarter aren\u2019t always the best view of things. Certainly, as we have a few more weeks here we\u2019ll have a better sense. Nigel Coe : Thanks guys. Appreciate it. James Lico : Thanks, Nigel. Operator : And our next question comes from Jo Giordano of Cowen. Jo Giordano : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One thing I am trying to figure out is kind of reconcile commentary for like the Tektronix scope type business across some your competitors. And I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s end market variance or geographic, but it seems to be consistent like kind of different commentaries at different times for the three major players within that oscilloscope business. And curious to see your take on that and anything you\u2019d highlight as to what might be causing different trends at different times for you guys? James Lico : I would say end market exposure generally is some folks have more 5G exposures, as an example and they maybe more tied to the 5G market, but I think we were pretty consistent with our [indiscernible] business over the last two or three years at least in our case, we\u2019ve been growing. So it\u2019s been on the backs of the investments we made on the new platform and we just launched the three and four series. And so that's now I think two years of launches that we had this was our third launch we did the five series two years ago around this time, we did the sixth series about a year ago. Now the three and four. And those product lines are all growing and are continuing to deliver growth. So end market exposure will maybe push those numbers up a little bit more, certain customers that kind of things. So I don't dive into the details of what others say in this case, I can only tell you with great confidence what's happening in our business. Jo Giordano : Fair enough. There is also some news recently your main competitor on the GVR side, making a deal with ADD and EV charging and I know you guys have made some ventures into EV as well, just curious as to an update on how those two markets will melt over time and what the outlook is there for further investment into that avenue? James Lico : Yes, I think we're really happy with the tritium investment that we made. I was actually out in Europe a couple months ago with our sales team make calling on customers in Europe. We announced in May our relationship with Identity [ph] where I had met with them, which is I think a great relationship and a great partnership for fast charging. We just got a very large order in the UK to be the largest supplier of chargers in the UK to box energy over the next several years. We\u2019ve announced 2,500 charging locations over the next several years. So we\u2019re really happy with the relationship and exposure we\u2019re certainly learning the market from them, they\u2019re a great team, we\u2019re also exposing them to new customer base and at the same time, our investment is helping fund some of the operational improvements that are going to be helpful to building the business long-term.  So, we feel very good about position. I think we all know EV is probably aren\u2019t going to happen as fast as maybe we thought a few years ago, but I think the position we\u2019re in and the place were in right now, we\u2019re certainly seeing accelerated growth and accelerated position through the partnership with tritium. Jo Giordano : And then, Chuck, just real quick on the lower tax rate guide is there anything structural there or anything specific cause that and how should we think about that going forward into 2020? Charles McLaughlin : No, I think we were slightly -- I think for the year at 16% for 2019. So in 2020 16%, so probably pretty good -- is a good number to use. What's happened in the first half as some discrete items that are unique to Q1 and Q2 that drove it a little bit lower, but ongoing for a year 2020 is 16%. Jo Giordano : Okay, thanks guys. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Jo. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Lico. James Lico : Thanks, Jason. And thanks, everyone, for taking the time today. We appreciate all your support. And the time you take to understand our story. As we highlighted in May, we are incredibly proud of the work we're doing to change the portfolio. And I think we saw a lot of great transformation really play out in the quarter for us. And we're certainly excited about some of the new things we've done around the capital allocation front with several of the new companies that will join the Fortive family. We realized that the second quarter was a lower macroeconomic environment for us, I would call it a little bit of higher uncertainty, and some slowdown that we talked about. And so we've been prudent we believe in the second half to really make sure we're managing the business both for the long-term, and also continuing to deliver outstanding EPS growth and free cash flow. So we thanks -- we think we're in a very good position right now. And while we're not trying to predict the outcome of what the next couple of quarters will be from an economic standpoint, we think we're well prepared for what's out there. We'll obviously continue to have conversations around that and obviously, Griffin and Chuck and our team are available for questions after the call. Thank you and have a great rest of the summer. Thanks, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.87 for the third quarter of 2019, representing an increase of 18% year-over-year despite short-cycle slowing that intensified over the course of the quarter. While these challenges impacted growth in certain parts of our Professional Instrumentation segment, a double-digit increase in earnings and strong cash flow performance demonstrated both the contribution from our recent acquisitions and the strength of the Fortive Business System to provide resilience to our portfolio.  As we navigate the slowing in the short term, we continue to invest in our businesses to drive organic innovation, fuel further compounding and execute our capital allocation strategy to strengthen our long-term competitive advantage across the portfolio. We have completed a significant amount of deal activity over the past 3 years, and the execution of our capital allocation strategy continues. We have owned Advanced Sterilization Products for a little more than 2 quarters, and we're pleased with its performance thus far and continue to make substantial progress with its integration. In the coming weeks, we will close on China, representing a significant step forward as we bring the remainder of ASP's geographies under our direct control.  As we roll off the transition service agreements and install key elements of the Fortive Business System in the coming quarters, we will lay the groundwork for accelerating innovation and growth in the years ahead. We also continue to make progress with respect to the intended separation of NewCo, which we announced on September 4. Utilizing FBS, we have taken substantial steps forward with respect to our preparations, and we remain on track toward completing the transaction in the second half of 2020. We look forward to providing additional details on the transaction and updates on further milestones for NewCo in the coming weeks and months.  With that, I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $311 million, up 13% over the prior year, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.87. Sales grew 16.2% to $1.9 billion, reflecting a core revenue increase of 2.1% and the contribution from recent acquisitions. Core revenue growth was highlighted by strong performance at Gilbarco Veeder-Root and PacSci EMC, which was partially offset by declines in the short-cycle businesses within Professional Instrumentation, including Fluke, Tektronix and some parts of Sensing Technologies.  Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 120 basis points. Geographically, developed markets core revenue grew low single digits, reflecting the slowing macro conditions across both North America and Western Europe. Core revenue growth in North America was low single digits, led by GVR, EMC and Industrial Scientific, while Western Europe grew slightly. High-growth markets core revenue decreased low single digits due to the loss of Huawei-related revenue at Tektronix and weaker market conditions in the Middle East. China posted slightly positive growth as strong performance at Fluke and Qualitrol was largely offset by a decline in Tektronix due to the Huawei impact and flat performance at GVR. India was flat as growth at Fluke and Qualitrol was offset by timing delays for certain large project rollouts at GVR, which are now expected to start in the fourth quarter.  Adjusted operating profit margin was 21.3%, representing a year-over-year decrease of 80 basis points, including 55 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions. Core operating margins decreased 25 basis points as the continued slowing within Professional Instrumentation more than offset strength at GVR and another solid quarter of operating margin expansion in Matco.  During the third quarter, we generated $348 million of free cash flow for a sequential increase of $111 million from the second quarter. This free cash flow performance represented a conversion ratio of 168%.  Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 24.8% despite a low single-digit decrease in core revenue. The significant contribution of recent acquisitions, most notably ASP, continued to drive overall growth within Professional Instrumentation. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 110 basis points. Segment-level adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, representing a year-over-year decrease of 300 basis points, including 120 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions. Core operating margins decreased 180 basis points, reflecting a combination of slower revenue performance, the impact of tariffs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.  Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue decreased low single digits as strong performance at EMC was more than offset by continued slowing across Fluke and Tektronix. Field solutions core revenue decreased low single digits, including a low single-digit decline in developed markets driven primarily by slowing at Fluke in North America. High-growth markets increased low single digits driven by growth at Fluke and strong performance from Qualitrol in China. Fluke's core revenue declined mid-single digits due to a high single-digit decrease at Fluke Industrial. Fluke Digital Systems grew greater than 20%, led by strong growth at eMaint, which generated a 10% increase in net new customers and a greater than 20% increase in annual recurring revenue. From a geographic perspective, the slowing that emerged at the end of the second quarter became more pronounced in the third quarter, particularly in North America, which saw a high single-digit decrease in revenue with slowing point-of-sale trends.  Fluke generated mid-single-digit growth in China driven by strong performance across Fluke Industrial, process instruments and food networks. Fluke Health won a multimillion-dollar order for RadWatch, a product developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army to monitor and measure radiation dosage. The acquisition of PR\u00dcFTECHNIK closed at the beginning of the quarter and has gotten off to a solid start. We are excited about the integration of PR\u00dcFTECHNIK -- how the integration of PR\u00dcFTECHNIK enhances Fluke's offering and capabilities with respect to asset reliability and condition monitoring.  ISC delivered low single-digit core growth as decreases in Western Europe and China partially offset stronger performance in North America. ISC's lower core growth in the quarter reflected a decline in instrument sales, which tend to be more sensitive to broader macro slowing. ISC's iNET offering had another strong quarter, generating mid-teens growth as ISC continues to increase its share of subscription-based recurring revenue. ISC also recently launched the WiFi-enabled Ventis Pro5 Multi-Gas Monitor, ISC's first direct-to-cloud product and a key step forward for ISC's emerging connected worker safety initiative. The integrations of both Intelex and SAFER Systems are progressing well, positioning ISC to significantly advance its safety-as-a-service strategy aimed at providing real-time solutions for its customers' environmental, health and safety-related workflows.  Qualitrol's core revenue declined low single digits as the continued challenges in North America, Western Europe and the Middle East were partially offset by greater than 20% growth in China and greater than 30% growth in Latin America. Qualitrol saw mid-teens growth in their basic sensors product line driven by share gains and have started to see early signs of more positive bookings momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Our facilities and asset management businesses, Gordian and Accruent, both rolled core during the third quarter but had a relatively small effect on the core performance of Professional Instrumentation given the partial period. These businesses continued to perform well, generating high single-digit core growth. Gordian's procurement platform, in particular, continues to drive strong growth, paced by increased construction volume with large enterprise customers, including the New York City Department of Education. Gordian also recently closed its largest facility planning deal to date with CommonSpirit Health systems to complete a facility condition assessment across its entire network. Accruent saw slower growth in the quarter due to softer licensing revenue as it transitions customers away from certain legacy products toward its higher-growth SaaS offerings. The company continues to generate strong SaaS bookings with its sales team increasingly driving enterprise customers towards longer-term subscription-based contracts with higher total contract value. Accruent added more than 70 customers in the third quarter while significantly expanding its existing contract with Cushman & Wakefield to cover a broader range of offerings across Accruent's software platform.  Product realization core revenue decreased slightly as strong growth at both EMC and Invetech was offset by continued weakness at Tektronix. EMC generated another quarter of broad-based double-digit sales growth across both its core defense product lines and its commercial satellite offering. EMC continues to maintain a very strong backlog with large recent customer wins and increasing momentum among commercial satellite operators, providing the company with excellent revenue visibility into next year. Tektronix registered high single-digit decrease in core revenue. Tektronix continue to be negatively impacted by slowing at Keithley, broad-based weakness in Western Europe and the loss of its Huawei business due to U.S. government-imposed trade restrictions earlier this year. While Tektronix registered strong growth from its high-performance oscilloscopes driven by the 5G buildout in China, it also saw further slowing in North America, including a low double-digit decline for its core mid-range scopes. Negative point-of-sale trends present an ongoing challenge heading into the fourth quarter. Despite the macro challenges, which we expect to persist into next year, Tektronix continues to focus on business execution, driving gains in its strategic growth segments, including key data center and automotive wins during the quarter.  Core revenue for Sensing Technologies decreased low single digits as growth in North America and China was more than offset by weakness in Western Europe. Anderson-Negele had a strong quarter using FBS commercial tools to drive continued share gains in adjacent segments of the food and beverage end market. Building on the momentum in its environmental monitoring offering, Setra recently launched its Setra Lite product line, providing a simple, cost-effective and highly visible solution to address pressure monitoring requirements in hospital rooms, which has been very well-received by the market.  Turning to Advanced Sterilization Products, the company grew low single digits, in line with our expectations, as we continue to work our way through the completion of the transition service agreements. ASP's growth was led by strong performance in China and Japan, which saw continued momentum in terminal sterilization as well as strong growth in high-level disinfection tied to the recent launch of its new automatic endoscope reprocessor product line for the Japanese market.  ASP also landed some key wins in North America, expanding its footprint and overall portfolio in strategic integrated delivery networks in both Texas and Illinois. The ASP team has begun to apply the Fortive Business System to streamline its innovation efforts and accelerate the introduction of a series of new products targeted for launch in 2020. Consistent with our strategy to build strong positions in connected workflows, we recently signed an agreement to acquire Sensus, a leading provider of instrument tracking software as a key addition to our sterilization offering. Sensus provides central sterilization departments with frontline error prevention tools and analytics which help improve efficiency and productivity in sterilization workflows, optimize compliance reporting and reduce the risk of hospital-acquired infections. We expect the acquisition to close before the end of the year.  Moving to Industrial Technologies. Revenue grew 5.2%, including core revenue growth of 6.5%. Acquisitions contributed 10 basis points of growth, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 140 basis points. Segment-level adjusted operating margin was 23%, including a core operating margin increase of 190 basis points driven by the continued strong volume at GVR and solid performance at Matco. Our Transportation Technologies platform core revenue grew high single digits, led by mid-teens growth in North America. GVR delivered low double-digit core revenue growth, highlighted by a mid-teens increase in developed markets. GVR's performance in North America was paced by sustained momentum from EMV-related sales, while growth in Western Europe reflected a combination of continued share gains and significant service rollouts with Costco during the quarter. GVR posted flat growth across high-growth markets as strong performance in Latin America was offset by continued delays from automation project rollouts in India as well as a large dispenser tender for which expected delivery has been shifted into the fourth quarter. Despite these short-term dynamics, GVR continues to build on its strong position within high-growth markets. In India, in particular, the strong order momentum and a healthy backlog provide good visibility into the region's sustained growth in the coming quarters.  GVR recently launched Passport Express Lane, adding a self-checkout system optimized for convenience stores to its Passport suite of solutions. GVR also launched a new family of products for Insite360 called HALO, which provide a significant upgrade to the system's fuel logistics functionality. During the third quarter, we made a follow-on investment in Tritium as we continued to support the company's rapid growth. GVR also recently announced the integration of a credit card reader into Tritium's high-speed EV charging stations, enhancing payment functionality to include credit card, debit card and contactless payment methods. TeletracNavman performed in line with expectations, generating a low-teens core revenue decrease in the third quarter as continued strong growth across Asia Pacific was more than offset by the company's performance across North America and Western Europe. The key priority for the TeletracNavman team remains the stabilization of its business in North America as it addresses the high level of customer churn over the past 12 months and returns the company to a sustainable growth trajectory. We continue to see improvements in our customer-related metrics, including the level of customer churn.  Moving to Franchise Distribution. The platform's core revenue grew low single digits during the third quarter as low single-digit growth at Matco was partially offset by a low single-digit decline at Hennessy. Matco was led by another strong quarter of growth in hardline tools, offset by some slowing in tool storage. Matco continues to see good traction with new product introductions, highlighted by the recent launch of a new half-inch air impact wrench, with a market-leading combination of power and control in a lightweight design that makes it significantly easier for the technician to handle.  Before turning to the guide, as we look ahead to 2020, we are mindful of the challenging macroeconomic environment and are therefore planning to increase our spending on a range of strategic productivity initiatives by approximately $45 million in the fourth quarter. These initiatives will better position us to deliver sustained earnings growth while maintaining investments to drive future growth and innovation.  We are updating our full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $3.42 to $3.47, representing a year-over-year growth of 12% to 13% on a continuing operations basis. The revised annual guide reflects the headwinds faced by our Professional Instrumentation segment due to the short-cycle slowing dynamics that became more pronounced in the third quarter and which we expect to persist through the end of the year. The revised guidance assumes 1% to 2% core revenue growth and an effective tax rate of approximately 15%.  We are also initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.96 to $1.01, representing year-over-year growth of 5% to 11%. This includes assumptions of flat core revenue growth, flat core OMX and an effective tax rate of approximately 15%.  To wrap up, during the third quarter, we delivered high-teens earnings growth with strong free cash flow even as the macroeconomic backdrop became more challenging. The quarter demonstrated the powerful earnings contribution from the acquisitions we have added over the past few years, which are also increasing the resilience of our portfolio as they compound and become a larger share of our total revenue. Despite short-cycle slowing in the headwinds we expect to persist into next year, we continue to execute our capital allocation strategy to drive further portfolio transformation, build a better, stronger Fortive and create greater long-term value for employees, customers and shareholders.  With that, I'd like to turn it over to Griffin. Griffin Whitney : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Philip, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Charles Tusa : So can you just help us a little bit with parsing out the acquisition? How much of an impact on margin and then maybe easier, just like what was the negative earnings impact from stuff that ran through from the deal that you closed in the third quarter, if there was any? Charles McLaughlin : In the third quarter, the deal expenses, on our adjusted earnings side, there's nothing in there that ran through there. And there really wasn't any headwinds related to the acquisitions. And the headwinds we faced were largely about the slowing of the top line as we progressed through the quarter. Charles Tusa : Okay. And then when it comes to the deal that you were planning to contribute this year like Gordian and Accruent, I think ASP is kind of a bit of a standout. That seems to be on track. Just remind us what you said they were going to contribute at the beginning of the year. And is that still the case here that they're going to contribute the same amount? Or is the Accruent comment that you made, I think it was Accruent you made a comment around, is that slowing having an impact on what those were ultimately going to contribute? Charles McLaughlin : So I think that the ASP is -- continues to be right on track on that at $0.20. And I think the -- what we said in the beginning of the year is, I have to go back and look, but $0.24 to $0.28 for the year. And I think when we get there, they're largely intact. Keep in mind that probably 1/3 of the OP from those things are in the fourth quarter. So I think that we're -- we continued in that range. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Maybe we could start with the market conditions. And I know you picked your words carefully in the prepared remarks, but you said the short-cycle slowing intensified. And then if I heard you correctly, did you say that you expect some of the slowness to persist into next year? So take us through the cadence of the quarter and then what this means in terms of outlook for 2020. I know you're not giving specific guidance, but just in terms of how long this persists. James Lico : Yes. Sure. Thanks, Deane. So I would -- it's Jim, by the way. I would say that -- a couple of things. One, just take us back to where we're at in July. What we saw in July was mostly what we thought to be inventory correction in our point-of-sale in places like Fluke and Pac, where we have the best visibility. Point-of-sale was still holding in there pretty well in June, but our sales into those channel partners was generally slower. So we saw it as a destocking mostly.  As we progressed through the quarter, we increasingly saw the degradation of point-of-sale. And I think that's what led us to what we believe to be true now is this will continue to persist. And so our guide for the year really reflects what we've seen in terms of degradation on the point-of-sale side.  I'd also say that we're starting to see it in our direct business as well in some places. So it's not just a channel situation. And typically, and I think this is probably more a Fluke common theme because of knowing the history there is that the smaller channel partners tend to be down more than the bigger ones, too. So that's a dynamic that we typically see in maybe a more protracted slowdown than just a quarter or 2.  To your question about how does -- what's our view of next year. I think you step back and you look at we really took a significant look at where we're at, and the productivity initiatives that we announced, the $45 million, I think really have a construct in which we think a number of these things continue into next year. So I don't have a crystal ball for the full year right now nor would I want to try to provide that. I think it's fair to say that when we snapped the line on the calendar, things aren't probably likely to change all that much, and that it's least likely that the first quarter and probably into the second quarter, a number of these things continue. And that's sort of our thought process at this point. Deane Dray : Great. I appreciate that color in terms of the expectations. And could you flesh out a bit on this restructuring initiative? This is right out of the Danaher playbook. Year-end restructuring, set yourself up for a stronger, leaner, coming year. The $45 million, what, in terms of cash, might that be? How much is headcount? Is there rooftops? And just some color there would be helpful. Charles McLaughlin : Hey, Deane, this is Chuck. I think the returns we'd expect on that would be under a year on that $45 million. I think that it's -- there's a number of different places as we saw slowing in the quarter, initiatives across the businesses, primarily where we're seeing slowing. So more focus on the PI. Beyond that, given that we're just rolling those things out at the operating companies, I think we'll leave the details for another day. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a question around the sort of the Q3 performance and the Q4 guidance. So in the third quarter, you had 2% core growth and a slight decline in core margins. Q4, you're guiding for flat core sales and a flat core margin. So I just wondered, with that slowdown in the top line that you've talked about, why don't we see that core margin pressure increase in Q4? Is it something to do with mix within the 2 segments or something around the tariff timing impact a year ago? Maybe just help us understand that margin dynamic. And maybe to put a point on it, the adjusted margin in Q3 was 21.3%. Just to clarify, if you can, what's the number for Q4? Charles McLaughlin : Sure. First, I'll take the adjusted margin percentage in Q4 raises to 22.1% for the full company. I think the main thing, mix plays certainly a part of it and can give you some variations on the flat OMX. But I think when you look back to last year, in Q4, we had some onetime things that aren't repeating, and so that gets us to a little bit better than what we saw in Q3. But if you look back over Q2 to Q3, it's been flat. James Lico : Julian, I think it also reflects what you saw in the third quarter, what -- this sort of slowdown through the quarter. We're much more prepared from a fourth quarter standpoint for that slowdown. And so what you also see is us taking action and the impact of those actions actually really having more impact on the quarter. So it's what -- it's certainly the -- we've got some slightly easier comps on the tariffs too as you accurately pointed out, but it's also this ability for us to get after.  The free cash flow in the third quarter was so strong, we were certainly prepared on the working capital side. And I think we're better prepared on the P&L side in the fourth than, say, we were in the third. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And then maybe just my follow-up around capital deployment. You've announced the split will happen 9 to 12 months from now. You've also got some restructuring underway today because of the slowing top line. Given those two aspects, do you think it's plausible that you would have much M&A activity in the coming two or three quarters? Or the view is you have a lot on your plate and so maybe M&A takes a backseat for a while. James Lico : Well, I would say, first, we certainly would agree with the point that we have a focus on a number of things that are really important. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, both the ASP integration and the separation into NewCo are going well, and that certainly takes time and resources and energy. So we would certainly vehemently agree that as a prioritization, those things are top of mind and things that Chuck and I and the rest of the management team are certainly focused on and really on a daily basis.  We announced -- we've done 3, really, if you think about from the second quarter. In the second quarter, we closed ASP. We've done SAFER. We've done Intelex. We've done PR\u00dcFTECHNIK. And of course, today, we announced the Sensus deal, so 4 deals in the better part of 90 days. So we've been pretty active. And we're certainly very focused on the integration of those things.  So I think Sensus is a good example. We -- as I mentioned at a couple of the conferences recently, we'd be more likely to be focused on anything if we did something to be bolt-on-ish and -- or maybe adjacent that's within the real strategic side. And I think Sensus represents that. In many respects, it's adjacent to exactly what we do in Sterilization. It's sort of like how Intelex is akin to ISC. It's very much akin to what we do at ASP. So I think we'll be focused on those kinds of transactions. If they're right down the middle of the fairway, we would be acting on them. But we do have a focus on a number of these things. And while I wouldn't say we're not focused on M&A, I think it's safe to say that the M&A we've done is pretty considerable here recently. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : So you did highlight North American slowdown in PI. And I was just wondering what specific end markets would you attribute the slowdown to. James Lico : Yes, I would say -- well, first, in terms of location, we said it was -- I would say we certainly saw where we were -- if I think about Fluke, Fluke was -- Fluke Industrial in particular, our Fluke Networks business as well, those are 2 places in North America. So that was relatively broad-based, but you could certainly see where industrial customers were slower. We don't have a lot of automotive exposure, but we have manufacturing certainly in those numbers. And you'd see some of those places are just some examples of where you might see a little bit more end-market slowing.  Certainly, electronics would be the other place where we saw it. So whether that's anyone assembling or designing electronics, we saw a little bit slower markets. And that's a channel dynamic as much as anything. So those are some end markets. I think where we stood up, where we had innovation, we continue to do pretty well from a product perspective. The II900, the Sonic Imager, we announced last quarter at Fluke, did exceptionally well in the quarter. Our thermal imaging product line did pretty well in the quarter.  So where we have some innovation, we still saw some opportunities. So I think the key for us is to continue to find those places where there's opportunity and really utilize prioritization in what we call dynamic resource allocation to put our resources in some of those end markets. I would say that when we look at places like where we have software conversions of SaaS, things are really well. So eMaint's a great example, is while the end market might be similar to some of the places that are slowing from an instrument standpoint, we're still seeing a lot of SaaS conversion in those end markets with maintenance software. We mentioned eMaint grew over 20% for another quarter in a row, and their performance was outstanding. So where we have those SaaS conversions, Andrew, I would say, the end market almost doesn't matter. We're still doing pretty well. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question on Tektronix. There's been some headlines that we're seeing stabilization in sort of semiconductor markets specifically. Is that a -- has your view changed on that until fourth quarter next year? Are you seeing any signs of stabilization? Does it matter for Tektronix where we are right now? James Lico : I think it's still a little early for us to call stabilization. I would say, on the capital front, the onesie-twosie stuff might be something that continues. But some of the bigger projects, like our Keithley business has a decent bellwether there. We still haven't seen a big upturn or maybe even a flattening yet. So I think we're still at least a quarter -- I've heard some of the same things, but I think we're definitely not planning for any of that in the rest of the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim or Chuck, you said you had 150 basis points of price this quarter, which seems like a good deal on price. But could you talk about the trade-off between price versus cost across the company? I know you lapped tariff in Q3, but did you have positive prices for cost in Fluke and Tektronix in particular? And if you didn't, how quickly could the thing catch up with cost in those segments? And what should it look like for the company moving forward? James Lico : Yes, I think both at Fluke and at Tek in the quarter, we beat the corporate average from a price standpoint. I think we're still a little behind on the price-cost dynamic at both those places. We've got some cost reductions that have offset some of those. But from just a pure price tariff, Andy, we're still lagging a little bit relative to that.  And I think as we go into the year, that obviously tapers a little bit because we've sort of started to sunset some of the tariffs in the fourth quarter. Because even though the tariffs were announced last year in the third, they really hit in the fourth and in the first. So we'll start to see a little bit of that. That could be a better. But unfortunately, the volume reductions sort of wipe out a lot of that as well.  So on the one hand, we've got the right price-cost, but that's sort of a static metric. It doesn't really have a volume dynamic to it. If you were to kind of look at it on a volume basis, we probably lost a little bit more on the gross margin front from just the volume reduction. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim, that's helpful. And then -- sorry, go ahead. James Lico : No, I was going to say, and so if volume comes back, then we'd start to see things maybe ramp a little bit better. But right now, we're not anticipating any big volume comeback here in at least the rest of the year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. That's helpful. And then Western Europe, I think you said grew slightly, which was better than last quarter's low single-digit decline. You were watching Western Europe then carefully. So some of your peers have mentioned maybe even some stabilization in Europe as the quarter went on. Is this just GVR doing well in Europe for you guys, and we should still kind of watch the PI businesses there, the short-cycle businesses there? Or did you see any stabilization? Charles McLaughlin : Yes, Andy. I think we did see some stabilization across the businesses. It's beyond just EVR. But I think that we remain watchful of everything that's going on in Europe, and this was a slightly bigger quarter than maybe we saw it coming in. But we're still watching it pretty carefully. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Could you just remind us, Jim, on Gordian and Accruent, just because these are kind of going organic more recently? I guess specifically for Gordian on some of these larger projects, is that revenue cycle tied more toward when these projects kick off or when they ramp up? And I guess where the question's going is if some of that underlying activity slows a little bit more, is there still kind of an extensive backlog where projects wrap up and they still get paid? Or is that more of kind of the leading edge of the project cycle? James Lico : Yes. I mean there's certainly a component to it of you signed -- the way -- you got to get the cost structure going through the job order contracting mechanism. So you're right, there is a point where at the start, it's not as great as it is maybe through -- the first 1/3 probably isn't as great as the -- there is a ramp to that as more costs come through. And you'll probably get more at the end than you do at the beginning. The one thing about it though is -- and one of the interesting dynamics about the businesses is that because we don't really play in the massive construction cycle, it's really more about the rebuilds and the redos and the maintenance stuff. It doesn't really have a big component to it of large-scale construction. And in fact, when things slow a little bit, people tend to fix stuff more, and it actually is a pretty good dynamic for the business. So the combination of that and of being underpenetrated means that I think we still have a lot more opportunity in the business going forward despite what the economic cycle might look like. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Understood. And then, I guess, just a second question on GVR, obviously heading into a tougher comp here into the fourth quarter. EMV though is kind of reaching its time to shine in that whole adoption cycle. Can you help us kind of calibrate what the push and pull of those two dynamics are, the tough comp versus closer to the transition period? James Lico : Yes. Well, we had a really good third quarter there as we said. I think in North America, I would -- because of slightly -- we certainly have a tougher comp in the fourth quarter, so it's probably closer to high single digit for the -- we'd probably see India -- we mentioned in the prepared remarks that India would -- we had a number of projects push into the fourth quarter. So I suspect our high-growth market numbers will be better in the fourth quarter there, and our North America number will be a little bit different just because -- in part because of the tougher comp, but not because of the overall demand, which we see continue to be good. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : Maybe just following up on that last question. Could you actually help us with the organics you're expecting in Q4? Obviously, you gave us the total company. But there is that comp and the India dynamic. I mean maybe asked differently, I mean, can IT actually grow in Q4 '19? James Lico : Yes, IT will grow and probably in the mid single-digit ranges if we were to sort of think about that. And I think what we'll see in PI is probably still down a little bit. So pretty close, maybe because of the tougher comp, a little bit lower than what we've seen in the third quarter. John Walsh : Great. And then going back to the prepared remarks, I think for Accruent, you made this comment that you'd signed up 70 new customers in the quarter. I was wondering if you could help provide some context around that number and how to think about it. And maybe building off of Josh's question, when things slow, I think there's a penetration rate story here, particularly for both Accruent and Gordian. I mean maybe how does -- where do you see the penetration rates of those solutions in the market and then how to think about signing up 70 customers? I'm just not sure how to actually think about how to term that business. James Lico : Yes. That makes sense. John, I would say a couple of things. One, maybe talk about the Gordian thing first, just to tie that off. I think we're very -- that -- the market is very underpenetrated. Again, that's not a SaaS business. It's really more a new business model in terms of job order contracting. So there's a lot of growth. We have to invest in that growth by adding salespeople and building capability. And we've put some additional investments in the business this year in order to do that. We're seeing the business grow. I'm getting good returns off those investments. Accruent today is -- has a larger installed base and is also more of a -- has more of a license revenue model that they're converting to SaaS. So while SaaS is still a large proportion of the sales today, they still have a conversion going on. So part of the little bit of the noise in the quarter with Accruent that we don't have in some of our other software businesses is this transition to SaaS. And so the 70 new customers is a good number because it demonstrates that we're adding customers, and that's a good thing.  But I think the other thing in the prepared remarks was the average contract value going up, and that average contract value going up, or what we would call ACV, is really a demonstration that we're converting people to SaaS, and they're doing that over a longer-term contract. And so that's -- those are both positive signs for the long-term growth of the business.  Of course, when you make that conversion of SaaS in a particular quarter or with a few months left in the year, it's not going to be as beneficial as getting a big subscription -- or excuse me, getting a big license contract. But over time, it's remarkably better and certainly from a margin perspective.  So that's really the dynamics going on in the business. And overall, we're seeing good progress. And I think the 70 number, I think if there are over 50 new customers a quarter, we're feeling pretty good about that number. Now of course, as the customer base gets bigger, we'll have to raise expectations on that, but I suspect the team there will be raising it before we are. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird. Richard Eastman : Just a question. The reference has been made frequently to the PI businesses, the short-cycle, short-turns businesses. And if I try to hang a number on those, I mean, what -- how much revenue is there? I mean I'd size it. Is it close to $2 billion between Tek and Fluke Industrial? You kind of use different definitions there. I'm just curious what that looks like. And the point that you make about the POS kind of slowing here through the quarter, do you have a good read on the channel there in those two businesses? James Lico : Yes. So I think two questions there. If you took Fluke and Fluke all off, which Fluke Health, Fluke Networks, that remains there, Fluke Industrial, all of the -- Fluke Calibration, all those, you're in the -- and combine that with Tektronix, you're roughly a little over $2 billion in revenue. So that's a decent number. $2 billion, $2.1 billion, I think probably is a good number there.  Relative to -- I think we have the best visibility. We get point-of-sale data in the U.S., Europe and China for both businesses. I think we have better granularity in North America. And increasingly, as you get farther from the U.S., the numbers become less of the total sales and they come maybe a little bit more less perfect. But North America is pretty good. Fluke, we get better -- we probably get the best data because we get multiple -- we get a multiple industry look. It's often been called the \"canary in the coal mine.\" And so I think we get decent visibility. And that's why we said, in June, the point-of-sale data actually looked decent. It was really the third quarter where we progressively saw -- we saw more of a destocking activity going on in June. What we saw in the third quarter was -- we still saw some destocking, but we also saw really actual demand going down. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then just my follow-up question is around ASP. You did reference some of the investments there and some of that going into new products and product launch for 2020. But given the timing there, I don't know if you need 510(k) for any of that. Probably not. But just my question is, do you have a pipeline of new products, and given the timing, that can move the needle on growth in ASP as soon as 2020? James Lico : Well, first of all, whenever we would talk about a new product launch with ASP, we would be including the FDA approval that would be required. So when we talk about 2020, we're talking about the actual launch of products. So whether it's the FDA or the -- their -- the appropriate organization elsewhere in the world, we would always be talking about launching a product with those approvals. So we won't talk about a launch before -- we would assume that when we give you a date, that we've got those kinds of approvals already in hand. So that's first and foremost. And we have been able to accelerate some things. We started doing some work even before, not necessarily helping them with product launches, but educating them around some of our tools of new product development. But they've also had their own innovation funnel and been doing their own things, too. So we think we're accelerating some of those things, and we'll start to see those in the -- next year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : I would like to better understand the pathway to PI margin stability, I guess. Chuck, I think you called out FX and tariffs as 2 headwinds. And of course, we've got some pretty big decremental margins at Tektronix and Fluke. The tax, you mentioned that they're kind of lapping 4Q. So are these largely List 2 tariffs, List 3, as that's important? It seems like FX is starting to stabilize, right? So perhaps, there's some good news there. I'm just curious, how do we sort of bend the curve on margins at PI in the absence of any good news on volumes? And maybe kind of like what I'm trying to get at here is, is most of the restructuring you're doing centered around PI? Charles McLaughlin : Yes, I think there's a couple of quick things. There is -- keep in mind, the tariffs, they ramped through last year as they were implemented. So when -- even though we're lapping at the start of tariffs, I think the lapping starts around the first of the year when its so like-for-like come out. So that will give us some stabilization.  I agree that there's still a little bit of FX headwind in the year, but that's starting -- hopefully, that will remain stable. But I do think that some of the restructuring that -- or the -- that we're doing that we just announced is primarily focused in PI and not all because we have slowing in a number of places. But I think that's going to be helpful there. And don't forget that ASP is sitting in Professional Instrumentation as well, and that should give us some lift there as well. Nigel Coe : Okay. That brings me then into the next question, which is the TSA roll-off at ASP. Can you maybe quantify kind of to what extent that's a problem right now? And what impact is that to margin? I've got a number of maybe $15 million to $20 million per quarter in my head. Is that a good number going forward? Charles McLaughlin : I think that when we get down the road and we're entirely off the TSAs, yes, I think that, that will be a quarter number. I don't -- I wouldn't actually call it a problem in that it's playing out as we expected. But I think it's an opportunity that we expect to move forward with. And so I feel pretty good about it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. John Inch : I think you both said Tektronix and Fluke Industrial were down high single digits, and obviously, the shift has been much more at the point-of-sale. I'm not sure if you know or can kind of granularly or more granularly comment on the degree of destock, like is destock getting better. And do you guys think that Tek and Fluke have hit sort of low watermarks in terms of their core growth degradation? Or based on sort of the cadence of end markets, it seems like this is just kind of beginning to hit in North America. Are things potentially going to get worse here in the short run? James Lico : Well, I think we said, North America, Fluke Industrial was high single digits in the quarter. So that's a pretty -- you got to -- you can come up with a lot of different scenarios around what the economic situation looks like. But I think given what we saw progress through the quarter, that idea that it will progress, that it will continue for a period of time is really the basis by which we took the productivity initiatives. So I think we don't expect anything to come back and return. And the sales in is sort of equating to the sales out now. So at some point in time, we'll see some inventory lift, but we're not planning any inventory lift. And I wouldn't expect that well into next year. So I think we're prudent where we're at right now, John. Certainly, we could come up with a scenario where maybe it gets worse. But I think, right now, from everything we're seeing, having this idea that it progresses or continues and certainly into next year is, I think, is the most accurate thing.  And it seems, as we've listened to other peers, it seems similar from an end-market perspective. We're seeing some similar things. So we'll try -- we try to triangulate off of that as well. John Inch : That makes sense. And then can we also just -- could you guys maybe -- I don't know if there's any sort of an update you can give us with respect to the time line of events for separation. So I'm thinking you were going to talk about, maybe at some point, the expected capital structure of both of the companies. At some point, we're going to get a management for NewCo, et cetera, then there's a road show. What -- are there any milestones that we should be looking for coming up in the next few months? James Lico : Well, I think -- yes, I mean, it's very early days. I -- but I like -- as we meant -- said in the prepared remarks, I think we made some really good progress. I would say we filed registration statements. We've gotten commentary from the SEC. We've responded to that feedback. So at having done a few of these in my life now, the -- what I call the real work, the groundwork you got to do from a filing perspective, from a subsidiary standpoint, from a pretax work, we've made a lot of progress in the last several months. Obviously, we just announced it 5 or 6 weeks ago, but I think those comments would suggest we've been hard at work for much longer than that. And we're certainly building the management team. We're building a Board. We're doing a number of those things. And they really all need to come at one time, if you will. So I don't want to put a predictive time on that. But certainly, I wouldn't think -- I would think we'll certainly be talking about that by the end of the year, early part of next year for, I think, with pretty good specificity.  We've announced the location. We're going to put the headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina -- or Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, sorry about that. So the -- so we've got a location, and we're -- and that's something we're doing. So we've made a number of -- we've made progress on a number of fronts, and we feel good about where we're at.  And as we bring everything else along, we'll have an opportunity to continue to share things as they come out. But I think that's really probably the early part of next year where we come up with some of the -- where we can come out with -- maybe that's the next major milestone. And maybe that's tied to earnings announcement or somewhere in around there, too. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Andrew Buscaglia : Can you talk a little bit more about ASP? So it's been in your numbers for a couple of quarters now. Can you talk about where you are with regards to FBS initiatives, first off, kind of what inning you're there? And with regards to the margin contribution, can you talk to -- can you try to quantify that in -- within the quarter and then potentially how that progresses through next year? James Lico : Sure. So Andrew, we'll -- Chuck and I can tag-team that. I think we're very pleased with the work that's been done on the Fortive Business System with the team there. We've made good progress. We've done a number of things. I mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the innovation efforts we've had. We've also had a number of value-selling and funnel management workshops with them. We've taught them daily management. We've done some Kaizens in the factory as well. So we've made some nice progress with adoption of FBS in -- while -- and it's really early days. I was -- a couple of weeks ago, I was with the teams in China and in Japan. And those teams are really integrating, while we mentioned China is going to come on to our direct control here in a few weeks.  So we're making good progress, and the teams are very thirsty for adopting FBS. The work that's been done, I think, suggests that having their hands on a continuous improvement system and a set of tools has been something that they've been looking forward to. And so far, adoption is very early days. As we know, this is a multi, multiyear journey. But having done this a number of times, I think we're off to a pretty good start. Charles McLaughlin : And Andrew, this is Chuck. With the -- regards to the margins, adjusted operating margins, I think at this point, are nominally accretive. But as we were off in the TSAs, you'll see a significant lift in benefit from us over the next year from ASP for the total Fortive. Andrew Buscaglia : Right. Okay. And is there any incentive to move some of those FBS stuff forward pre-spin? James Lico : I think what you -- are you talking about the -- at ASP or just more... Andrew Buscaglia : Yes. ASP, yes, specifically. Like is there a -- yes... James Lico : I think the road maps for what we need to do in both businesses, both the separation and ASP integration, they really have independent paths. And we're working super hard and super well to get those done as quickly as possible. But the reality is they're both on separate paths. And they'll find the fact that we talk about, one, at the end of -- at the end of the first half and the other one in the second half. That's just sort of -- it just happens to be that way. We're very much running pretty hard. I don't anticipate opportunities to do much sooner on either one of those because of the work that we have ahead of us. The good news is we're making good progress along those paths now. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joseph Giordano : Do you have any color on core OMX growth by segment next quarter? Charles McLaughlin : Well, I think, in general, it's going to look an awful lot like what we saw this quarter for core OMX. I think that when you look at our adjusting operating margins, I think both PI and IT will be around 23%, with the overall company in 20%, 22%. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And then on the SaaS transition for Accruent, how long does something like that generally take? And I know it's a good development long-term, but sometimes, it's going to be a tough transition as it happens. So how long does that business take to transition over? James Lico : Yes. We'll continue to do. I think what we really built on our return model was that it would occur over a couple -- 2 to 3 years. Not every customer -- we're not forcing a transition by any stretch of imagination. There's certain value that's created, particularly as people move to the cloud and have different thoughts around how they want to handle their IT transitions in some of these markets. So it's certainly a continued 2- to 3-year transition. And I don't think there's anything that will precipitate a massive change to that. And it's certainly -- well, it might move around. The core growth rate might move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter here. But we still sit in that, the mid- to high single-digit growth rates that we'll see in those -- the combined business here, certainly through -- certainly over the next few years with having those transitions. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. James Lico : Well, thanks, everybody, and Philip, thank you. Thanks, everybody, for taking the time. I know it's an incredibly busy day. I understand there were some challenges with EDGAR even today. So -- on getting some documents. So our information is on the web, on our website, if you weren't able to do that. I'm sure that you'll all figure out what they have going.  But thanks so much for the time. We obviously feel that we've taken a number of steps. I know this is a volatile environment with a lot of change going on relative to the end markets. But we feel very good about what we've done from a free cash flow perspective and earnings perspective in the quarter and really are working hard to make sure that we can implement some of the things to not only protect our earnings for next year, but also to make sure that we do what we call dynamic resource allocation, which is to make sure we can continue to prioritize the investments that are going to have the most dramatic impact on our core growth and our margin expansion in the years to come.  So we'll look forward to continuing to talk to all of you there. Obviously, Griffin and Chuck and Ross are available for questions, will be available when needed to answer any follow-ups. Thanks for the time, and good luck in the remaining days and weeks of earnings. Thanks, everybody. Have a great night. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fortive Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Griffin Whitney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Griffin Whitney : Thank you, Angela. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. With us today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by SEC Regulation G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.fortive.com, under the heading Financial Information. We completed the divestiture of the automation and specialty business on October 1, 2018, and accordingly, have included the results of the A&S business as discontinued operations for current and historical periods. The results presented on this call are based on continuing operations. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. All references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-over-year on a continuing operations basis. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available in our SEC filings including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Our results for the fourth quarter provided a strong finish to 2019 as we delivered a 13.1% adjusted earnings growth, with strong adjusted operating margin performance and excellent free cash flow. For the full year, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 on a continuing operations basis, representing a 13.7% increase year-over-year, with 2% core revenue growth and 30 basis points of core operating margin expansion. We delivered these results in the face of slow demand dynamics across our short-cycle businesses throughout the second half of the year. At the same time, we achieved significant progress with respect to the continued transformation of our portfolio, closing nearly $4 billion worth of high-quality, strategic acquisitions that accelerate our strategy around software-enabled workflow solutions. As a key part of our portfolio transformation, we continue to make good progress with the integration of advanced sterilization products. We closed on China before the end of the fourth quarter, successfully integrating the largest of the day 2 countries and accomplishing a key milestone as we bring ASP's global operations under our full control. We remain keenly focused on closing the remaining day 2 countries and ensuring that the necessary infrastructure is in place to enable us to exit the majority of the TSAs as planned by the end of the second quarter. At the same time, we are pleased with the significant progress that we've made toward the completion of the separation of Vontier. In December, we announced key members of Vontier's senior management team, including Mark Morelli, as President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Nomura as Chief Financial Officer, and we are continuing to work toward an IPO split to effect the separation. While we have put ourselves in a position to be ready for the first step in the form of an IPO of up to 20% of Vontier by the end of the first quarter, we will continue to assess market conditions and maintain a variety of options for the eventual completion of the transaction, which is on track for the second half of this year, as previously communicated. Given that I've been challenged with the cold for the last week, Chuck will provide the details of the quarter. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For Q4, adjusted net earnings were $368 million, up 13% over the prior year, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.03. Sales grew 13.9% to $2 billion based on strong contribution from recent acquisitions and a slight increase in core revenue, which came in largely as expected. Core revenue growth was highlighted by mid-single-digit or better growth at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Gordian, Industrial Scientific and Matco, which was largely offset by declines across the short-cycle businesses within Professional Instrumentation. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 110 basis points. Geographically, core revenue in developed markets grew low single digits reflecting the continued soft macro conditions in both North America and Western Europe. Core revenue growth in North America was up low single digits, while Western Europe declined mid-single digits. High-growth market's core revenue decreased mid-single digits due to slower performance at Fluke, Tektronix and GVR. China posted a high single-digit decline as strong growth at Qualitrol and Sensing Technologies was more than offset by the headwinds associated with the winding down of the double-wall tank upgrade cycle at GVR and the Huawei-impacted Tektronix. Adjusted profit margin was 23.3%, representing a year-over-year increase of 60 basis points. Core operating margin increased 150 basis points, driven by solid execution and strong operating margin expansion across the breadth of our portfolio. More than half of our operating companies each generated greater than 100 basis points of operating margin expansion during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we generated $452 million of free cash flow representing an increase of 17% year-over-year. This strong performance resulted in free cash flow conversion ratio of 123% of adjusted net income for the quarter. Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 23.1% despite a low single-digit decrease in core revenue. The significant contribution of recent acquisitions continue to drive overall growth within professional instrumentation. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 50 basis points. Segment-level adjusted operating margins were 25.1%, including a core operating margin increase of 130 basis points, which was offset by 190 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions. Our core operating margin increase was driven by price, supply chain savings and business model execution. Field solutions core revenue increased slightly, including a low single-digit increase in developed markets as growth at ISC, Gordian and Qualitrol was partially offset by a decline at Fluke in North America. High-growth markets decreased slightly. Fluke improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, but still declined low single-digit year-over-year primarily as a result of continued softness at Fluke Industrial. In North America, Fluke declined low single digits but saw some early signs of stabilization. In China, Fluke declined high single digits as we expected, reflecting negative point-of-sale trends. Fluke Health Solutions grew mid-single digits, led by Landauer which saw strong orders from the U.S. Army for its red watch radiation monitoring device. Fluke Digital Systems grew mid-teens led by eMaint, which posted another double-digit increase in net new customers and greater than 20% increase in annual recurring revenue. PR\u00dcFTECHNIK continues to perform ahead of expectations and has greatly enhanced the broader Fluke liability offering. Fluke continues to see excellent momentum from its revolutionary II900 Sonic Imager which generated $20 million worth of revenue in 2019 following its launch at the end of April that year.  ISC delivered high single-digit core growth, driven by strong growth across North America and Western Europe. ISC's subscription-based iNet performed well, generating high single-digit growth and strong new customer bookings. The momentum at iNet reflects the growing demand for ISC's expanding set of real-time, WiFi-enabled connected worker solutions as more facilities adopt live-monitoring capabilities to improve safety performance. Intelex grew double digits in the fourth quarter as strong bookings and share gains helped deliver a record year for customer wins with a 17% increase year-over-year in total new customers. The ISC and Intelex teams also continue to make progress with the integration of the Intellex software offering with iNet in order to unlock the opportunity for future cross-selling. Qualitrol's core revenue grew mid-single digits, marking the first positive quarter for both core growth and bookings since 2017. -- delivered strong growth in North America, China and Latin America, which was partially offset by continued challenges in Western Europe and the Middle East. Turning to our facilities and asset management businesses, Gordian performed very well in the quarter, delivering greater than 20% core growth. This performance was driven by strong growth across e procurement platform with increased construction volume from large enterprise customers, including the United States Postal Service. Gordian also saw momentum across estimating and facilities planning, reflecting the initial return on strategic investments that we made in its product offering and sales force. With facilities plannings, the application of FBS sales and lead management tools, we helped Gordian end the quarter with its largest backlog in its history. Accruent saw a sequential growth in the fourth quarter but registered high single-digit decline on a year-over-year basis driven by a tough comparison given the large amount of licensing deals that hit in the fourth quarter of 2018. While the pace of SaaS bookings wasn't enough to offset the licensing revenue decline in the quarter, Accruent to drive better sales execution and productivity with a higher win rate for larger software deals and improve cross-selling. Accruent continues to see strong performance across a number of its key product lines, including its EMS 360 facility and connectivity offerings, all of which generated greater than 20% bookings growth in 2019 and carry strong momentum into 2020. Product realization core revenue decreased high single digits as PacSci EMC and Invetech was more than offset by continued weakness at Tektronix. EMC generated low single-digit sales growth versus the tough compare from the prior year led by defense electronics and commercial aerospace offerings as we saw momentum with its commercial satellite customers as well. EMC continued to see broad-based bookings momentum, allowing it to maintain strong backlog and excellent revenue visibility for the year ahead. Tektronix registered double-digit -- a low double-digit decrease in core revenue. As expected in the quarter, Tektronix saw continued pressure from many of the same headwinds that emerged earlier in 2019, including slowing at Keathley, weak demand in North America and Western Europe and the loss of business from Huawei due to U.S. trade restrictions. Tektronix saw strong performance across its mid-range oscilloscopes offering, which grew mid-single digits. The 3 and 4 series scopes were successfully introduced last June continued to perform particularly well, generating high-teens growth and significant share gains in the quarter. Core revenue for sensing technologies decreased low single digits as broad-based growth in China was more than offset by continued weakness in Western Europe and flat performance in North America. Jim's benefited from improved conditions in the semiconductor end market, which returned to growth in the fourth quarter, removing a key headwind that persisted through much of 2019. ASP grew low single digits, led by growth in consumables as well as continued strong performance from its service business. Geographically, ASP saw strong performance in China and Mexico. We continue to be encouraged by ASP's performance in Japan, which saw high single-digit growth in the second half of the year after an extended period of weaker performance prior to our ownership. At the end of October, we closed China, and we now have approximately 80% of ASP's global revenue under our direct control. The acquisition of Sensus closed early in the fourth quarter significantly enhanced our connected workflow offerings for central sterilization departments. Sensus is off to a good start with 10% growth in the quarter, and we're excited about the cross-selling opportunities with ASP as we provide more comprehensive solutions to our health care facilities. Moving to Industrial Technologies. Revenue grew 1.9%, including core revenue growth of 3.6%, which was partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange rate of 180 basis points. Segment-level adjusted operating margins was 23.8%, including core operating margin increase of 230 basis points. The strong OMX and Industrial Technologies was once again led by GVR, where applications of FBS drove strong margin performance and significantly improved working capital turns as EMV ramp throughout the year. For Transportation Technologies platform core revenue grew mid-single digits led by low double-digit growth in North America. GVR generated mid single-digit core growth, led by high single-digit increase in developed markets. As expected, GMAR delivered another quarter of strong performance in North America tied to sustained momentum from EMV-related sales as the October liability shift deadline approaches. GVR registered mid-single-digit decline across high-growth markets as strong performance in Latin America was more than offset by a slower quarter in China and India. GVR continues to see good early momentum with its Insite 360 remote 4-quart [ph] management solution, which enables customers to monitor and update fuel dispensers remotely. They also recently released a new fuel procurement and logistics solution on in site 360 called Halo, which will -- has been well received by the market. GDR recently received a large order for Trinium EV chargers from a major European oil company, the largest such order to date from a legacy GVR customer. This win, and the potential for a larger opportunity to support a broader EV charging rollout across the customer's network, highlights the opportunity for GVR to leverage the distribution and service capabilities across its existing customer base of Tridien's -- in support of Tridien's continued growth. TeletracNavman core revenue decreased mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, in line with expectations. TeletracNavman saw strong continued growth in Asia Pacific, which was more than offset by declines in North America and Western Europe. The TeletracNavman team continues to work to stabilize its North America business with overhauled customer support processes, reducing the customer churn and enhancing margin. While there is significant work ahead, the TeletracNavman team is making progress with root causes of the higher churn, laying the groundwork for improved performance ahead. Moving to franchise distribution, the platform's core revenue grew low single digits during the fourth quarter, driven by the strength at Matco. Matco's performance was led by growth across its power tools, tool storage and specialty tools category. Matco continues to benefit from strong product vitality and the success of new product introductions. The power tool category, in particular, was supported by the introduction of the cordless infineum, high-performance impact wrench and high-speed ratchet kit. Matco also induced its maximum light diagnostic scan tool in December, bringing to market the latest extension of Matco's growing diagnostics offering. With that, I'll hand it back over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Chuck. To wrap up, the fourth quarter represented a strong finish to 2019 with continued momentum from industrial technologies and solid execution from Professional Instrumentation in a challenging environment. Our performance in the quarter provided a clear demonstration of both the power of the Fortive business system, and the increasing resilience of our portfolio, enabling us to deliver 150 basis points of core operating margin expansion in the face of slow short-cycle demand that persisted throughout the quarter. In 2019, we faced a number of challenges head on from tariff-related headwinds to short-cycle slowing through the back half of the year. Despite these challenges, we delivered strong margin expansion and free cash flow and saw approximately 7% revenue growth across the software businesses we have acquired since spin. In addition, we have made significant progress toward the integration of ASP, while also moving forward with the separation of Vontier to position Fortive for the future. Clearly, there are signs out there, continued industrial slowness, and we're cautious about the macroeconomic outlook for the coming quarters. With respect to guidance, we are initiating our full year 2020 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance at $3.68 to $3.78, representing year-over-year growth of 6% to 9% on a continuing operations basis. The annual guidance assumes low single-digit core revenue growth, 50 basis points of core OMX and an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.70 to $0.74, representing year-over-year growth of 1% to 7%. This includes assumptions of low single-digit core revenue decline and an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. Our first quarter guidance also anticipates a $0.02 headwind from the disruption we have seen so far associated with the coronavirus outbreak in China. This is a very fluid situation, and we are monitoring it very closely. Obviously, first and foremost, the safety of our employees throughout China is our top priority. In closing, I want to take a minute to acknowledge the efforts of the broader Fortive team across the globe. 2019 was a truly transformational year for our team. And while it was not with a year without challenges, I'm extremely proud of how our team performed and responded. It's the dedication of our people and their relentless commitment to continuous improvement to drive the Fortive business system and enable us to deliver greater long-term value for all of our stakeholders. I look forward to the next decade ahead with our outstanding team. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Griffin. Griffin Whitney : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Angela, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just the first question around Slide 10, the 2020 EPS bridge. Looking at that piece on the left, the $0.16 of core because I guess I'm trying to understand, because I think the restructuring savings from last year give you about $0.14. And then if you put in core growth, low single digits with that 50 bps OMX, that gets you about $0.16. So I'm just trying to understand where does the restructuring savings -- or the core growth fit in that bridge. Charles McLaughlin : Well, Julian, this is Chuck. I think that what -- you're doing that roughly correct. I think that it just really depends on how much growth you're putting in there? And then maybe the one wildcard that we're -- we probably got embedded in here a little bit is how long PI stays down. We've got a negative in Q1 here, it's probably flat in the first half and as that continue into Q3. Julian Mitchell : I see, that $0.16 incorporates both the organic growth and the restructuring savings? Charles McLaughlin : That's correct. Julian Mitchell : And then my second question, just maybe help us understand the biggest moving pieces within the PI core margin. It was down a bunch in Q3, up a lot in Q4, and then it looks like it's guided to drop again in Q1. So maybe just help us understand what's swinging that around in the context of sort of steady-ish declines in organic sales. James Lico : Yes, Julian, it's Jim. First, you're right about Q4. If you sort of think about the second half and what we saw in PI in the second half, we're probably down 20 or so bps for the second half. So a number -- what we saw in Q4 was some really strong pricing. We saw -- we always get a bigger portion of our supply chain savings near the end of the year, and we certainly saw that. So those 2 plus a little bit better mix is really -- would drove the stronger margin expansion in the quarter. As we go into -- you certainly have some headwinds of things like salaries and things like that, that come into the first quarter, that will be part of the offset. But I think part of it is just -- we'll see the big businesses Fluke and Tek, be about the same relative to their contribution. But I think you do see the coronavirus here, and that's principally and that heat is going to be more in PI probably than anywhere else. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So Jim, I hope you're feeling better soon. So I just want to start on cash a couple of different things here. So there's about $500 million and change of M&A spend during the quarter, was that all in this acquisition, this Sensus acquisition? And then was a bit lower than we expected. Is that kind of better job on Capex? Or was that a push out relative to your original guidance for '19? Charles McLaughlin : I think I would take the second one first, the Capex. I think that -- I don't think that's appreciably lower or different than we than normally see. So maybe I'd go back and figure out if we gave you that impression, we shouldn't have, because I think we're pretty stable on that piece. And on the first piece you're talking about, how much of the -- are you talking about the deal cost? Nigel Coe : Yes. Is that all Sensus? Or was it 2 or 3 smaller deals in there as well? What I'm trying to figure out is what -- how big is the Sensus acquisition what should be we modeled for 2020? Charles McLaughlin : I understand. Yes. No, that's the Sensus acquisition. Nigel Coe : Okay. Any details you can give us on revenue contribution for '20? Charles McLaughlin : Relative to Sensus? Nigel Coe : Yes. James Lico : So yes, that business is, I think, roughly $50-ish million to figure, double-digit kind of growth, you're probably talking in the $10 million range for the year. That's -- it's mostly a SaaS business. So I think some -- if we think about how that will continue to grow and we think we'll probably put some additional investment in it in order to accelerate growth through the year as we work with the team there. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the combination of Sensus, along with what we've got at ASP, gives us a really strong offering in the central sterilization department. So some of our effort here to accelerate the growth, it's going to be some investment in go to market in order to make sure that we can accelerate that growth through the year. Nigel Coe : Okay. I don't want to overstay my welcome here but what kind of margin profile does Sensus have? James Lico : Pretty close, lower operating margins than what we would at the start but high gross margin. So you're talking about gross margins in the 60s. They do have a service business. So the software, obviously, is in the high 80s and 90s kind of range. But then there's a service and installation component to it that brings the margins down. We think we can continue to grow that margin profile over time. And obviously, the operating margins will start to come up. I think they're in the -- roughly the 20s now and they'll probably be in that range this year. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Steve Tusa [ph] with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Just on ASP, what are the organic revenue contributions from that business for 2020? Charles McLaughlin : It's going to be low single digit, but that probably high -- it's moving up as things -- as we get more of the revenue under our own shop. So I think that's going to be pushing three would be my guess. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, so that includes kind of that push forward of kind of the TSA impact. So we can think about the revenue base and then just grow that by 3%? Or is that kind of the organic growth, excluding the impact from whatever happened last year with the TSA? Charles McLaughlin : I think the way -- what I'm talking about is how the end customer growth is going to grow, think about that at 3%. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. So but what is the actual organic revenue contribution to the [indiscernible] you can define it anyway once. So just as a percentage of Fortive total revenues, the amount you would include as organic from that business specifically. Charles McLaughlin : Yes, it's probably going to be north of $25 million. On the organic -- just the organic growth. Now keep in mind, we didn't have Q1 in there last year. So [indiscernible] Unidentified Analyst : Yes. so it's a 9 month. Yes, so it's a 9-month mix in is what you're saying. Charles McLaughlin : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just on cash flow for the fourth quarter, some things moving around, there was a decent bump from accruals and another kind of decent drag from I think, from prepaids or something like that. Is that kind of the unwind of some of this TSA stuff that you talked about earlier in the year? Was that just organic performance, anything kind of going on there. That was kind of a big swinger year-over-year in the fourth quarter? Charles McLaughlin : Yes, I don't -- I think that there were some those things were probably related to how J&J got us the cash for that business created in the fourth quarter. But I don't think that -- I would say that, that is what you should expect us to be able to do in the fourth quarter. And that, that wasn't an unusual bump there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. So it's not like anything was kind of pulled out of 2020. That's kind of a clean base for 2020. Charles McLaughlin : Yes, it's normal seasonality for us to be really strong in the fourth quarter and later in Q1. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : So last quarter, you gave a view and that organic revenue declines will continue into first quarter and probably second quarter, you sort of reiterated that, I think, today. Do you still see the likely return to growth happening in third quarter? And more importantly, other than coronavirus, what are the 1 or 2 items that could swing that earlier or later? James Lico : Well, I think as we look at the guide, Andrew, we don't have any dramatic improvement that I would say is counting on a big economic swing our comps get a little easier in the second half. So you have a little bit of that. And we've got some product launches. So I would say if the upside if things were to get better in Europe, I think that would be some upside to us. That would be 1 thing. I think we've got North America, I think we've seen North America fairly stable. If we start to think about some of the places where we see some point of sale, as an example, we've seen some growth lately in point-of-sale. Admittedly, still kind of low single digit, but we're seeing growth. So I think the upside story would be probably China accelerates -- forget just beyond corona, but it just accelerates to a little bit better. In Western Europe comes back to growth maybe sooner. I think those are probably 2 of the embedded things. You could go OpCo by Opco, but I think geography is probably the best way to think about it. Andrew Obin : Great. And then just a follow-up question on price/cost. Could it be more favorable for you in 2020? I imagine tariff impact is slowing, and you can still command decent pricing? And how does Phase 1 trade deal sort of figure into your calculation of price cost into 2020, how does it impact you? Charles McLaughlin : So to take the second piece of that, the trade deal that they just signed wasn't going to impact us either way. And so that's no impact for us. I think that in terms of some of our actions, I think you saw our margin expand here. At the end of the year, reflecting that maybe some of our price will carry into next year. And I'd like to think that in the first half, we've got some good momentum there. I think from a cost standpoint, we don't -- it does not feel like a severely inflationary environment for us. So I think that our position's going to be pretty strong there. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : So I guess, just first question on the Vontier IPO. I guess, Jim, depending on which way it top of my head here, it seems like you might come out of this whole thing, pretty close to net debt-free on the Fortive piece. Is that a fair way to think about it and a fair way to think about kind of the acquisition firepower as we get through the transaction. James Lico : Well we'll certainly be in a good position, that's for sure. As we highlighted in the prepared remarks, about our plan here, still a lot of things to do. I'll let Chuck specifically comment about how we're thinking about the debt structure here. Charles McLaughlin : Yes, I don't think -- I think we're going to be improved, but especially given if an IPO would net some proceeds and accelerate where we get to. But we're -- both of these companies are going to have M&A firepower here. And so I don't think we get to net debt zero on Fortive. I think Vontier is going to -- we'll take some of the debt, but not a disproportionate amount. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just thinking about this $0.16 of core improvement in 2020. I guess, if the demand environment were to firm up, especially in the back half. I guess, what's the bias to reinvest some of the restructuring versus what it fall to the bottom line. I guess, maybe a different way of asking is if growth is better, is it $0.16 plus whatever growth does? Or should we expect some leakage from reinvestment that's currently being held back? Charles McLaughlin : Well, I think we'd always look for opportunities to where we could accelerate growth. But I think the reason we did the restructuring is so that we could deliver growth. And if we see the back half accelerate. I think we see us deliver our normal VCM fall through of around 35%. And maybe a little bit more. But we'll happily deal with that situation when we see it materializing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim or Chuck, can you talk about how you're thinking about GVR in 2020. You obviously still have us GMV related growth. But China slowing in India. I think it's been lumpy lately. I surmise, it's a contributor to 2020, but maybe orders are getting pushed a bit. So you can give us more color on how to think about that business overall and what you're seeing. James Lico : Yes, sure, Andy. Thanks. So I think the China thing is pretty predictable. We have a double-wall tank upgrade. We've seen tremendous benefit last year from that. And we knew inevitably that, that was going to sort of wane, and that came in fairly predictable. So I don't think China will be a big source of growth for GVR necessarily in 2020. India will, we really have seen more -- we've actually been -- most recently, we've seen some good news on some of our project rollouts. So the first quarter may be a little hit and miss. But I think as we get into the second quarter and in the back half of the year, you're going to see India be a contributor to growth for GVR as well as some of the other high-growth markets. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, Latin America was a highlight for them as well in the quarter. And then maybe the bigger story is now -- obviously, EMV is the big story. Came in really the way we thought it should come in, in the quarter. That will continue to be helpful in 2020. And I think what we saw, which was nice to see was the comments we made around starting to see some of the benefits with GVR customers in Europe with Tritium. So that's a starting point for growth as well. So a number of levers that we think can get them -- will be additive to their growth rate. But EMV still will be the big number there throughout this year. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then just asking about Accruent, it was starting to flow less quarter, you talked about the conversion to Saas. I think you mentioned high single-digit declines in Q4, given the tough comp. Do you guys think this is more of a just traditional decline, as you called it last quarter? Or is it more cyclical? And what's your outlook for Accruent here in 2020. James Lico : Yes. If we looked over -- if we sort of get away from the quarters and just look at our ownership of -- we've seen mid single-digit growth at a current since our ownership. So I think what we've seen here recently is, first of all, like we said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing good growth in some of the SaaS offerings. We mentioned connected, which is our health care offering, which did really well. As an example, our EMS offering and our 360 facility offering, which are really parts of our CMMS offering and space management offering. So we saw some good SaaS bookings growth in those businesses. We do have parts of the legacy business that were down, as we mentioned last quarter, and were down more than we thought or thought they were going to be.  Some of that is larger licensing deals that we had in the fourth quarter of over a year ago, which made for a tough comp. But I think as we sit here in 2020, we look forward with the team, we certainly see our path back to that sort of mid-single-digit and better growth. With the SaaS business, it takes a little while for that to kick in. But we're still very excited about the business. And then we think more broadly, about Gordian as well as what we've done with Fluke digital and eMaint as that sort of almost $500 million of facilities and asset management businesses, those businesses growing exceptionally good. So the market dynamics are good. Like I said, we've got a little bit of work to do at Accruent, we talked about that. I think that's consistent with what we said before. But when we look in total, what we're doing from an all Fortive perspective, I think we like where we're at, and we like the future opportunities as well. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : Maybe just following up to some of those earlier questions around the balance sheet. Can you talk a little bit about how the pipelines look like for each of the businesses as we go forward from a capital allocation standpoint and the ability to do M&A? James Lico : Yes. Well, I think we certainly are -- we completed Sensus in the fourth quarter, as we mentioned, we did intellect as well in the second half. So a couple of very good deals in the second half. In the summer, we had PR\u00dcFTECHNIK. So we had good additions and the breadth was pretty good as well. Intelex really being part of our ISC safety offering, Sensus being part of our health care offering for Tek and really in the core Fluke business. So as we look across those funnels, John, across all of our businesses, I think we're in a very good place with all of our funnels. We just reviewed our strategic plan for the next several years with our Board and highlighted the opportunities for some of our key platforms. And we really see across a number of platforms, opportunities for capital deployment. Obviously, we're pretty busy right now with some of the things we've got going. And -- but we continue to be active, and we're hopeful that we'll get some things done here in 2020 as well. John Walsh : Great. And then as we think about Vontier, I don't think we've had a chance since you've announced the management team there to kind of get your perspective just wanted to get your thoughts on both the appointment of Mark and Dave there. James Lico : Yes, we're really excited. I think Mark is a bit -- is a very much a person with who's got considerable continuous improvement experience. He's been a student of DBS and FBS for a long time and has applied it in this businesses. He certainly goes back to back to some United Technology days where they were implementing a number of Lean principles. So I think he brings public company experience, he brings business transformation experience, he's incredibly results oriented. So I think, Mark, is somebody who we're really excited about. And Dave Nomura's really coming back, right? Dave was the group CFO for us before he went to Gates. And Dave's a great financial leader. He's worked with Chuck and I for decades. And I think it's -- we're really excited. Dave knows these businesses. He's coming into the organization knowing these businesses having have some financial responsibility for these businesses before he left. So I think the combination of both external experience, both having public company experience, but also their belief in continuous improvement, I really think sets up already with a great leadership team that we already have in those businesses. We think Vontier's future is very strong with the leaders that we now have in place. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : I really appreciate that you all were brave enough to take a stab at what the coronavirus impact would be in the first quarter. We've seen really 1 other company to go through that math, Xylem did it today. So I'd be interested in hearing a bit more with any precision if you can, what's the -- how do you get that $0.02? Is it the plant shutdowns? Any assumption about the supply chain, maybe we can start there. James Lico : Yes. Thanks, Deane. It's obviously, as we said, it's an evolving situation, and our first priority is the safety and security of our people over there. And obviously, a very difficult situation for the country of China, the health crisis that it is. So I think, first and foremost, we're focused on making sure that our teams are fine. And we're doing what we can from a business perspective, to help in the situation. We have some products, as an example at Fluke that are helpful to diagnosing some things relative to some of our temperature measurement products as an example. So that's first and foremost. How we got to the $0.02 is really, I think, pretty straightforward. It's really another week of being down. So that's inactivity of not only the factories but also customers. And the fact that I think we ramped slower than normal. I've been I've been pretty -- we've talked about China and how you come out of the new year for a number of times. I have a couple of decades of experience of leading our efforts over there. And usually, you come up a little slower coming out of the new year is. And we just think that's going to be a little slower. So it's really the combination of the lost week and really not probably coming up as quickly as we typically would out of the new year.  Now I'll tell you, Deane, as you know, it's an evolving situation relative to next week. February 10 is really the starting point, which -- and we're really looking at 3 things : one is how are our customers going to come back, how is commercial transactions going to start-up and occur; the second thing is our factories and our Tier 1 and Tier 2 and even tier 3 supply chain, and how quickly they come up, we're pretty confident about our own factories. But seeing the supply chain come up; and then I think the third piece is just the freight lanes. What's going to happen. We do ship, as an example, on some commercial flights, as an example. So we'll just have to see how that happens. And really, all that's going to sort of evolve next week and in the weeks to come as we start to see things. We're -- we've got countermeasures in place on all 3 of those situations. But we have to get into it to see how things play out and how quickly. But we felt obligated with what we've known pretty much over the last maybe 2 or 3 days, we've really felt obligated to be very clear about what we think will happen thus far. Deane Dray : That's great color. We're all hoping for the best there. And then on ASP and Sensus, interesting, you were citing the opportunities from sort of cross-selling, and that's kind of the whole strategy around bolt-ons. Can you give any kind of examples of what cross-selling might be. And are the sales forces provided any incentives along those lines? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. So first, which says this is a great business, in and of itself. And so one is the team there is we're going to accelerate some investments and commercial opportunities to really take their solution forward, which we think is a really great solution for central sterilization departments. So that's first and foremost. And then as we said, we've got, in some customers, sets we probably have a stronger position in some places, like IDNs, as an example, they're very strong. So the opportunity for -- to cross-sell within those situations is certainly there, and we're certainly incentivizing the sales force. On a global basis, we probably have more opportunity to take the ASP customer set and introduce Sensus to them because obviously, ASP is such a global business. So really, both opportunities but -- to really cross-sell. But I do want to make sure we emphasize it. We bought a good business to begin with. As I said, over 10% growth in the fourth quarter. That's not in our core number yet. But we think very strongly that this is a great combination for us to go forward with. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird. Richard Eastman : Jim, could you touch a little bit -- circle around to Fluke Industrial. I think you kind of spoke to some seasonal growth there in the fourth quarter relative to the third so that would seem encouraging. How does the channel look to you at this point? And does that business start to cycle more favorably by midyear? Or what's your general feeling on Fluke Industrial? James Lico : Yes. We saw a little bit better performance in the fourth than we did in the third, and a little bit better performance than we originally thought. And I think that was principally in North America. If we think about point-of-sale trends at Fluke in the fourth quarter the U.S. grew a little bit. Western Europe and China, we're still down. China, off a tough comp. So we really -- we've got to come out, as I mentioned in a few questions ago, corona probably hasn't impacted Fluke maybe more dramatically just given the daily volume of business that goes on at Fluke. So we've got to watch that in China. We think the U.S. continues to sort of stay on track. We don't really see big inventory issues. And in Western Europe, we still think it's going to probably be flattish to down here, at least in the first half, start maybe to get a little bit better based on comp. The inventory positions within the channel are pretty good. So we don't expect any dramatic downturn in the economy from here with these industrial customers. And so you would think that most of the inventory corrections are behind us at this point. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then let me just, again, kind of stay on the short-term business here. But with Tek, I think most of the T&M companies in the electronics side, have their toughest comps with Huawei in the first and part of the second quarter. I mean, not only was business ramping, but we obviously saw the restrictions go in place in May, I think, of last year. But is that the case with Tektronix on the lost business. Is there a functionality from a T&M standpoint? The same? Did it ramp on that same time frame. So comps are very tough, pretty much through the second quarter there? [indiscernible] Charles McLaughlin : Yes, I mean, I think if the restriction certainly went in, we heard about them right at the end of May, so there's still five months of tougher compares in the first half of this year. There's a little bit in a normal year, a little bit more in the second half than the first half, but I don't think that's enough to worry about it. But it's in the first 5 months of this year and not beyond that. James Lico : I think the more dramatic number at Tek though, really, Rick, is going to be just seeing that market come back in North America and Europe. That's really that the Huawei thing is something and it's something for Tek. But if we're really think about what's really a larger piece that we usually see 3 or 4 quarters of down -- 4 to 5 quarters of downturn when this sort of turns. And I think that's kind of our current thought. Large -- as you know, while larger purchases get delayed for a little while but they can't be delayed forever. And so we think we'll start to see things start to improve as we get further into the year. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then just the last question for me. The core growth for '20, the guide there, low single digits. If I think about PI and IT, it seems to me that PI start off fairly negatively because of these short-term issues at Fluke industrial and Tek. And then perhaps from a core growth standpoint, strengthen in the second half, whereas potentially it starts off strong with some GVR backlog and maybe fades a little bit in the fourth quarter -- by the fourth quarter. Is there much difference between PI and IT as they relate to that low single-digit corporate core? Charles McLaughlin : Rick, this is Chuck. I think you roughly have PI correctly being negative, especially in the first half running into easier comps but still being low single digit. I don't quite the same way with IT as it goes through the year. I think that they have a little bit of a tough compare here earlier in Q1 versus last year. But I'd expect them in that low mid-single-digit growth in -- from -- or throughout the balance of the year, I don't think, even though the liability shift is in October. I don't think that we'll see a slowdown in this business, especially the -- I'm talking about the EMV wave, that will continue on beyond the end of 2020. So I don't think it slows down the back half of the year on anything I can see. James Lico : And a couple of things we said before, Rick, just put that in context, like we were talking about EMV, like we just talked about. As I also mentioned, India improves through the second half. So you start to see -- I think electric vehicles the EV charging business probably ramps a little bit more. So you've got a few things that are going to start to accelerate through the year that are non EMV related as well. Operator : And your next question is from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Just picking up on that IT discussion. So if IT is kind of low to mid-single-digit this year, the margins are in the first quarter are -- and I think for the year, are relatively flat. Yes, we've got some of these EMV, I'm assuming those are pretty good profit contribution benefit throughout the year. Why is the OMX now a little bit higher for it based on your guide? Charles McLaughlin : Well, one, I think IT is coming off of a pretty strong year. But I would think that IT would come through with -- I mean if you're talking about a business, it's growing 3% or 4%, 50 basis points is what you would expect to see. And I think that, that is -- that's what you're going to see with IT going through the year. John Inch : Okay. So I thought, Chuck, I thought IT was a little bit more flat in your guide in terms of the performance in the first quarter and 2020. But you're saying it's actually going to be up about 50 basis points? Or should we... Charles McLaughlin : I thought you were talking about operating margin expansion. I'm sorry, but the -- I think that IT will be up in Q1, not taking into account the coronavirus would be about, I think it's 3% and then accelerates slightly through the year. John Inch : Yes. No, I was talking about operating margin expansion. So we're talking about the same thing. Charles McLaughlin : They just had a quarter where they did 200. So I think that there's good momentum there, but then they're lapping some really tough compares. They had great margin expansion the last year. John Inch : That's fair. Just wanted to switch to Vontier for a sec. You've announced the management, what about the Board? Like are the rails going to be on the Board? You would presume they would be, but there hasn't been an announcement yet. What's the timing of that? James Lico : Well, yes, we haven't commented on the Board. I mean, we've got a lot of degrees of freedom. We've announced Karen as our chair. And so we've got to share. We're building a Board at the construct. We never want to comment on who's going to join the Board or whatever, based on, as you know, commitments and how many boards people are on. I would say that our Board recruiting has been incredibly positive. We've had a number of folks that have been interested. And we're in the process of interviewing those folks. We -- because of the structure we've talked about, we're in good shape for what we need to do for the IPO, and I think we're in very good shape to -- as we move forward with the separation, the full separation, if you will, later in the year. John Inch : And Jim, what are the next milestones, if anything, from a time line perspective? Charles McLaughlin : Well, I think we're putting ourselves in position to be able to do an IPO by the end of Q1. But there's a lot of things going on, as we've noted even on this call. So we're going to assess what the best market timing has gone -- is for us. But we'll be in position by that point. But we're really pleased with our progress. And as you mentioned, the management team is in place. And we'll see what the market conditions look like. James Lico : You'll start to see some of the milestones that would -- be prepared for that, just to be specific, John, things like our filing and those kinds of things. You'd start to see that here in the meetings and things like that in the coming weeks here. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Griffin Whitney for closing remarks. James Lico : Well, thanks, everybody, for taking the time and indulging me in my minor cold here. But we want to thank everyone for your support in 2019. We -- clearly, a transformational year as we talked about, a number of things that we feel really good about as we enter into the year, we talked about a number of those things this afternoon. It's a new decade for us and a new decade for Fortive, and we're incredibly excited about the position we put ourselves in for both Fortive and Vontier to make 2020 a strong year. We'll look forward to continued conversations around all that. And certainly, Griffin and team are available for follow-up over the next several days. So thanks, everybody, for your time today. Have a great day. And we look forward to seeing you here soon on the road. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Fortive Corporation's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Griffin Whitney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Whitney, you may begin your conference. Griffin Whitney : Thank you, Catherine. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. With us today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by SEC Regulation G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.fortive.com, under the heading Financial Information. We completed the divestiture of the automation and specialty business on October 1, 2018, and accordingly, have included the results of the A&S business as discontinued operations for historical periods. The results presented on this call are based on continuing operations. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. All references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-over-year on a continuing operations basis. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available in our SEC filings including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Today we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2020, reflecting solid performance in an operating environment that changed dramatically over the course of the quarter. Despite the unexpected headwind that impacted our topline performance, we delivered 150 basis points of core operating margin expansion, driving adjusted earnings per share to the height of our guide as well as strong free cash flow. Coming on the first quarter we're confident in the resilience of our portfolio as well as our ability to execute the playbook required to sustain strong free cash flow, protect long-term competitive advantage and overcome the macroeconomic challenges that lie ahead. When we provided our first quarter guidance back in February 06, we built in expectations for the potential impact from COVID-19 disruption on our operations in China and some potential challenges through our supply chain. Since then the scale and scope of the global public health crisis and the subsequent macroeconomic impact from efforts required to combat the spread of the virus had expanded significantly. Even as lockdown orders were put in place throughout Europe and much of the United States, we continue to operate our essential facilities and fulfill commitments to our customers across a broad range of critical industries. Along the way, our emphasis is focused squarely on our highest priority ensuring the health and safety of our teams around the globe as they continue to provide the essential technologies upon which our customers depend. I cannot be more proud of how the Fortive team has responding to the challenges we've faced over the past few months In early March, we quickly shifted two birds of our total personnel to working from home. Part of our broader effort to help ensure that our production facilities comprehend under enhanced safety guidelines. We also rolled out a range of new collaboration tools and technologies most notably -- most notably from the Fortive business system office to sustain our commitment to continuous improvement. The nimble adoption of FBS to the challenges of work from home restrictions has enabled us to assure business continuity and transition key FBS processes such as problem-solving, product development all bear rooms and visual daily management to virtual formats. Perhaps more importantly, leadership teams across our operating companies have continued to drive innovation to help support their customers and the communities in which they operate in the fight against the COVID-19 crisis. Advanced sterilization products recently received an Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration FDA for the use of its stereo system to decontaminate compatible N95 respirators, which will help alleviate critical PB shortages in the near-term. Fluke has temporarily reconstituted portion of its manufacturing capacity in Everett, Washington to produce productive facial which have been provided free of charge to healthcare workers on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19. Fluke Health Solutions and Gem Sensors are also actively working with ventilator equipment manufacturers to expedite additional ventilators supply to hospital around the country. Turning to Vontier given the lack of favorable conditions for an IPO due to the uncertain global economic and market conditions, we have decided to reevaluate the timing and structure of the separation. As a result we submitted a request to the SEC to withdraw the Vontier registration statement. We strongly believe that separating Fortive and Vontier is the right strategic decision that will enable both companies to take full advantage of their respective growth opportunities and capital allocation priorities. Mark Morelli, Dave Naemura and the rest of the Vontier team will continue to run the business within Fortive and we remain prepared to move forward with the separation when market conditions improve. With that let's turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $264.3 million up 7.1% over the prior year and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.74 meeting the high-end of our guidance. Sales grew 7.6% to $1.7 billion as growth from acquisitions more than offset the 3.8% decline in core revenue. Mid-single-digit core growth at GVR low double-digit growth in Gordian were more than offset by declines across various other operating companies due to slowing related to COVID-19. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate also reduced growth by 160 basis points. Despite the topline headwinds, core operating margin increased 150 basis points, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 20.4%. This performance reflected in part the structural cost actually took in late 2019, which gave us a running start as we turn the corner into 2020. That leader cost structure along with a full flow through of prior tariff mitigation efforts, continued strong pricing discipline cost and supply chain management helped us weather the topline deterioration across our portfolio due to COVID-19 headwinds throughout the back half of the quarter. During the first quarter we generated $158 million of free cash flow, representing an increase of 15% year-over-year. The free cash flow performance in the first quarter reflecting the underlying resilient of our free cash flow generation as well as practice shift by our operating companies to manage the cash expenditures and maximize free cash flow generation as the macroeconomic outlook deteriorated in the back after the quarter. Turning to our segments, Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 13% by the 7.2% core revenue decline. Acquisitions contributed 2,130 basis points while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 110 basis points. Core operating margin increased 130 basis points, resulting in segment level adjusted operating margin of 23.2%. Industrial Technologies posted a sales decline of 1% as core revenue growth of 1.6% was more than offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate of 230 basis points. Core operating margin increased 190 basis points resulting in segment level adjusted operating margin of 19.3%. Switching to a view of our performance across the major geographies in Q1, which we've captured on Slide 10 of the presentation, all regions were affected by the spread of COVID-19 pandemic to some extent during the quarter. Looking at Asia, core revenue declined over 20% in Q1. This was driven by declines across all major countries in the region. China was down more than 20% in the quarter. As expected we lost a week due to the extended lunar new year holiday as mandated by the Chinese government at the beginning of February. Our plants began to reopen the following week and continue to wrap up capacity utilization steadily throughout the balance of the quarter albeit more slowly than in prior years based on the extended holiday period and national virus containment measures. By the end of the quarter, each of our sites was operating at 80% plus of total capacity. Customers began to come back online in February and March with order volumes picking up into the start of the second quarter. At the same time, we saw a significant negative impact from COVID-19 on demand across the rest of Asia as well including Japan as well as India where customer investment slowed significantly later in the quarter as lockdown measures went into effect. Western Europe core revenue declined high single digits in Q1. Western Europe was our most challenging geography coming into the year prior to any COVID-19 impact with many of our operating companies also saw a significant impact on demand and customer activity in the wake of the pandemic as countries enforce broad economic lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. ASP delivered mid-single-digit growth based in part on the decontamination of respirators across the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium in March. At this point we're starting to see early steps being taken to reopen certain economies including countries such as Germany, which have fared better than some others, but it's too early to tell how these steps will affect demand dynamics which we saw deteriorate over the course of March. North America core revenue grew by low single-digits in Q1, in the United States with the exception of a few businesses including GVR, Gordian and Qualitrol we saw a significant negative impact on demand trends as well as our ability to access customers and customer site across much of the portfolio. This was particularly the case late in the quarter and into the first half of April, with potential plans for reopening on a state-by-state or regional basis still very much in the early stages it is difficult at this point to have a definitive view on how conditions will respond to any such reopening efforts during the second quarter. Finally, we saw our mid teens decline in the Middle East and a high single-digit increase in Latin America. Slowing in the Middle East was due to a combination of order delays and supply chain issues associated with COVID-19. We expect to see persistent headwinds as we look ahead. Strength in Latin America was driven by growth of more 30% in Mexico. Latin America was later than other regions in terms of the emergence of COVID-19 and it is difficult at this point to gauge the full potential effect from the pandemic on the region as we look forward. Given the unprecedented public health crisis posed by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the broad economic restrictions imposed upon the globe, forecasting the balance of the year has become more challenging. Part of the circumstances we are withdrawing our previously issued full year 2029 and will not be providing guidance for the second quarter. In an effort to give you a sense for the next few quarters, we've analyzed our portfolio to better frame expectations for the relative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across and within the various operating companies given the unprecedented global conditions we expect to face. If you turn to slide 11 in the Earnings Presentation, you will see that we've broken out operating companies as well as key portions of some operating companies into four groups based on what we would expect maybe their relative sensitivity to COVID-19 related to disruption and potential deterioration and end market demand. Group one, which represent approximately 15% of total Fortive revenue includes those companies or key product lines that we expect may continue to grow throughout the coming quarters or we believe should show substantially resilient topline performance through the balance of the year. Notably this group includes a number of our recent acquisitions, including software-focused businesses such as eMaint, Gordian, Intelex, Sensus, and the SaaS portion of Accruent, many of which we expect to benefit from a high share of recurring revenue and a focus on providing mission-critical workflow solutions to their customers. Group two which represents approximately 50% of total Fortive revenue includes a range of businesses where we expect to see a potentially significant topline impact in the near-term from lockdown measures and stay-at-home restrictions from which we then believe should bounce back relatively soon after the lockdown measures are lifted. The biggest businesses in this group are GVR and ASP. In the case at GVR, EMV related demand in North America in particular stayed strong through the end of the first quarter before moderating in April. Our customer site access issues and other COVID-related disruption will impact revenue in the near-term we expect GVR to perform better as economies around the globe begin to open back up. At ASP we saw significant drop in surgical procedure volume in China during Q1 upwards of 85% at the height of the COVID-19 response, but volume began to rebound by the end of March and continued into April. We expect the same pattern to play out in other geographies and we've seen elective procedures get delayed and we likewise expect volumes to begin to normalize as soon as hospitals get to the other side of COVID-19 peaks and can begin to address the pent-up demand for these procedures. Group three represent 10% to 15% of total Fortive revenue includes businesses where we expect to see a potentially significant topline impact from the lockdown measures and stay-at-home restrictions in the near-term and expect to see a more gradual improvement in performance after those lockdown measures are lifted. This group includes our sensing technologies portfolio, which has short cycle sensitivity and we would expect to see pressure across a number of its core industrial end markets as capital-related projects pause. There are however a number of potential offsets across healthcare, life science and food and beverage applications including Setra's room pressure indicator product line, which monitors air quality in ICUs and other critical healthcare environments. Group four, which represents 20% to 25% of total Fortive revenue includes the businesses where we expect the most significant revenue decline in the short-term and the most sensitivity to both the depth and duration of the recession expected in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis. Notably, this includes portions of the Fluke industrial business, Invetech instruments business where we've historically seen the most short cycle sensitivity including over the course of 2019. It also includes the instruments and rental businesses with ISC which have significant exposure to the oil and gas end market and would expect to be impacted by persistent dislocations in oil and gas demand. While we're not in a position to forecast the rest of the year with sufficient level of visibility using this framework, we expect to see a significant revenue decline in the second quarter. To be more specific, we believe that our total revenue will decrease 20% to 25% on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, while the fall through on a decline of that magnitude can be challenging in the short term, we expect to manage the business to decrementals of approximately 35% to 40%. We will continue to benefit from the cost actions that were taken at the end of 2019, which significantly helped our margin realization in Q1 particularly within Professional Instrumentation. Over the course of the year we expect to continue to manage decrementals to that 35% to 40% range as additional cost actions are executed across the portfolio. We also expect to deliver free cash flow conversion of greater than 100% of adjusted net income for the full year. As you would expect, we have taken immediate and decisive steps to reduce our cost base in response to the dramatic shift to macroeconomic outlook during the first quarter. These more recent cost reductions add to the significant cost actions that we took toward the end of 2019 in anticipation of continued short cycle headwinds through the first half of this year. Across the portfolio, we've aggressively executed adjustments to direct labor expense primarily through the use of furloughs to match our expectations for the near-term demand deterioration. We've likewise instituted reductions in salary compensation cost and a wide range of discretionary spending items. At the same time, we've initiated aggressive cost reductions through our supply chain including both direct and indirect spend while also reducing our facilities expense through temporary closures. In total we intend to deliver incremental savings for the balance of the year of at least $300 million across these various cost actions. We know that liquidity is critical during challenging macroeconomic conditions. We entered the first quarter with a cash balance of over $1 billion and we've continued to proactively manage our balance sheet and enhance our strong liquidity position. We recently extended the maturity of our the $1 billion term loan due this August to May 2021 and in an abundance of caution, renegotiated our net leverage covenant to provide additional headroom through the first quarter of 2022. While we expect to use our free cash flow generation to continue to delever over the course of this year, these steps provide us with additional near-term flexibility. Over the past two months, we've also reduced our reliability on the commercial paper market paying down our outstanding commercial paper exposure with a new term loan and repatriating cash. We expect to temporally exit our commercial paper exposure entirely in the coming months in turn giving us full access to our $2 million revolving credit facility, which remains otherwise undrawn at present. Before I close and as you turn to slide 14 in the deck, I want to underline for the Fortive team as well as our investors that as challenging as things appear now, this too shall pass. While we navigate the choppy waters that lie ahead of us in the short term, we will also move our businesses forward and position them for even stronger performance in the long-term. That means continuing to invest in innovation, winning in the market through product and service differentiation, enhancing the level of talent throughout the company and maintaining the discipline market work that drives our M&A process. Over the past few months, I've been extremely proud by the agility and resilience I've seen throughout the organization as we adapted on-the-fly to the reality of the current global public health crisis. With the underlying strength of our portfolio, our culture and the commitment to our shared purpose, we remain well-positioned to realize the substantial long-term value creation opportunities ahead of us. With that I'd like to turn it back over to Griffin Griffin Whitney : Thanks Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Catherine, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just the first question around the sales guys. You talked about the 20% to 25% total sales sort of placeholder for the near term, maybe help us understand any nuance across the two divisions with that guide and any color you could give us how April trended for PI and IT in terms of orders or sales please. Charles McLaughlin : For the 20% to 25% at this point I think that it's best to just think of it is about the same across the two segments, but keep in mind there's a lot of moving pieces here and while we could end up with that same 20% to 25% in total, it could end up differently. But right now that we see it actually pretty much the same by the two segments for right now. Charles McLaughlin : I would just to give you maybe a little bit of color around the businesses and what we try to do on slide 11 is give you a little bit of sense of some of that as well. I think as we saw -- we saw China come back at the end of March but we didn't see China come back for really toward pre COVID kinds of numbers and we don't really expect that to occur that much in the second quarter. So just I'll give you a regional view first. Europe was down high single digits. We think it'll be worse certainly in the second quarter and North America held up pretty decent on the back of strong Gilbarco. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks because of our inability to get equipment into the ground and particularly in North America and certainly with elective surgeries being almost nonexistent here at ASP those are a couple of big examples in North America and certainly point-of-sale and fluke attack, we would expect deterioration through the second -- in the second quarter for sure from what was in the first quarter really that whole sort of last few weeks of March really playing out throughout the quarter with no expectation of improvement through the quarter. Now in April pretty much fell in line with that. So I would say one month is not a trend make but I think we certainly felt that it was appropriate. We some decisive actions in advance of what we thought would continue and I think April by and large is played out the way we thought it would relative to that down 20% to 25%. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then my second question just around the incremental margins and the cost savings to just to confirm that $300 million in cost savings is that included in that 35% to 40% incremental margin aspiration and I guess I'm a bit curious why the incremental margin wouldn\u2019t get less severe later in the year at presumably as you get more savings booked and maybe the sales declines get a bit less intense? Charles McLaughlin : Julian I think first of all you\u2019ve got it understood correctly and the $300 million that we see coming out -- we see coming out pretty ratable at this point, we've made a lot of calls and taking the actions that we think will see them here in Q2 and that gets us that 30% to 40%. As we go through the year, we're going to learn more and there are some choices that we can make in the back half of the year but for right now we think that for -- which is also given the uncertainty in the back half that 35% to 40% is still the right place to be for right now, but you could be right as if we see a difference in the back half of the year maybe the decrementals move a little bit more but right now we're calling it at 35% to 40%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with BoA. Andrew Obin : Just a question I apologize if I missed it just pricing in IT I think in the queue turned negative. Could you just give more color on that and I apologize if I missed it in the prepared remarks? James Lico : So prices, are you talking about for Q1? Andrew Obin : Yes. James Lico : No it was I don\u2019t think it was negative. We have it as positive, and it did normally positive. Andrew Obin : Okay. Maybe I'll calculate and correct. I apologize. Just maybe you can just talk generally about sort of Fortive's pricing power in this environment? James Lico : I think I think we would continue to see -- our gross margins were up in the first quarter on a deteriorated volume, but we certainly saw I think we maintained price probably not getting as much price as we did a year ago because a lot of our tariff mitigations, the price was in the tariff mitigations Andrew, but in terms of seeing any price pressure at this point, we really haven't -- we really couldn\u2019t call any places where we see any of that. We probably are a little slightly reluctant to see anymore additional price in this environment just to want to make sure that we're not -- we're careful about volumes but in terms of just how we see things relative to albeit direct business or even with channel partners, we don't really see changes in the pricing environment here. Andrew Obin : And just a longer term question, I think you talked about doing things differently using more Zoom, less travel sort of doing Kaizen's electronically what kind of -- have you guys have to give us an answer, but have you guys considered what kind of long-term impact you can make to Fortive cost structure given the lessons -- operating lessons that you've learned in this crisis and what are the main buckets of savings? James Lico : Yeah so I think Andrew we were just talking before the call, Chuck and I are eight weeds working from home now and certainly have been as I said in the prepared remarks, I've been amazed at the quality and the level of work that our team has done to do that so quickly and from a just productivity perspective really not the -- really any impact in productivity. I think it's too early to sort of call long-term what this means, but I think for many things you could certainly see it would not be hard to suggest that with the way we've been working certainly will open ourselves to more employee flexibility, which I think gives us an opportunity for talent and I think the second thing would be that certainly it's going to foresee us to be able to reduce travel cost, over time. I don't see it any other way. But you know we're still again by evidence kind of company. We still aren\u2019t -- we're looking forward to get back and visiting customers, we're looking forward to being closer together in Kaizen and things like that. So, no that will be completely eliminated but I certainly think that the opportunity for us to think about how we can do things we're seeing a lot, we've taken a lot of notes and our FBS office has done a fabulous job of sort of clarifying a lot of these new processes so that we can replicate them into the future in all of our operating companies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : When you say getting close Kaizen is not too close right. James Lico : No, that's right. Nigel Coe : So look when you go back to '08, '09, Fluke and Tektronix were down mid 20s to drop then. So the fact that these cycle is not new news, but let me just characterize what you're seeing today versus back then and may be comparing a trust and would we expect the company profile to be similar back then? James Lico : Well I think there is a couple things. One and that's why we try to frame it in these groups because so I'll try to use that in the context. One is I think if you go back to some quarters, you can find a quarter maybe where Tek was probably down 40 in '09 and you probably find a Fluke maybe down in the 30 range. So a little bit more dramatic than your reference point, but I don\u2019t know if it's, that's just for context. I think when you look at what we've done here and I think it's just so evident in the to call it out, when you look at Group four, which is what we would say maybe one of the business more in '08 and '09, we see the Fluke core kind of Fluke industrial business and you see the Tek instruments business, but once you go to the left and you see in Group one and two, as you start to see Fluke digital you see Fluke Imaging, and so you see those additions that we've made to the Fluke business that are far more resilient as part of the revenue. You may see the Tektronix Service Solution business there as well as you see the Fluke Health Solutions. So what you can see is that's where you broke the portfolio up because up in the context of Fluke you now see three substantial additions to the portfolio that are a lot more resilient to that business and you see in the Tek business the service business which is more resilient. So we're not calling out that parts of Fluke and parts of Tek aren\u2019t cyclical to the macro, but I think what this kind of demonstrate to give some a visual picture of the kind of things we've done, which ultimately are a bit more resilient to the overall business. Nigel Coe : Are we trying to say that with these beautiful businesses these are structuring and multiyear to the flat revenue businesses? These are fixed quarter decline maybe you expecting to be back to growth like prior cycles. James Lico : You're talking group businesses in group one or two? Nigel Coe : Group four. James Lico : Group four, what you know I think depending on the, this is where I think to call particularly in light of some of the things we saw in '19, tough to call how long Fluke and Tek both parts in Group four would come back but you typically think if it never roughly track with sort of improvement in industrial production, global PMI. So both businesses maybe track a little bit closer to these metrics where I think Groups one and two you start to find secular drivers and much more resilient business model like SaaS and service models. Nigel Coe : Okay. Great and my follow-on is like nice segue there to the SaaS side because we know there have been some chatter about in this environment maybe SaaS contract getting price tool has pick up in churn. Have you seen any of that and maybe just us a flavor some of what you're seeing at Gordian accruing through April thanks. James Lico : Yeah. Well good example would be Fluke Digital. In the quarter Fluke grew double-digit and the e-may business grew I think 20%. So just to give you an example of resiliency and probably one of our more resilient businesses relative to SaaS, the Gordian business grew double digits in the quarter working through all the numbers. Intellect grew in the quarter and the SaaS part of Sensing [ph] grew in the quarter. So all those businesses actually grew pretty much on track for the quarter. What we do see is in part of those businesses where they have service, professional services or some installation services and things like that where we couldn\u2019t get on site. We see some revenue degradation there. Most of that comes back in the full year we think. So you see a little bit of headwind from the onsite staff. Bookings maybe the long-term booking maybe change a little bit because customers aren\u2019t necessarily signing all the contracts. You'll see a little bit overtime to paying on the depth of the economic impact where we'll see maybe a little bit of sea change but pricing has held up well and quite frankly when you start to think about some of the solutions whether they be in thing that save money like the Gordian [ph] where you're really saving money in activities or things like Intellect where you really are in the HS, health and safety aspects of the business where there is no greater time when Fortune 1000 companies are focused on that. I think the secular drivers here are going to hold up pretty well in those businesses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : I think you were on TV recently Jim, weren\u2019t you? James Lico : I think you were too. Steve Tusa : Anyway the decremental this kind of turning back to that if I just assume a kind of 10% type of decline just picking a round number extra $300 million in savings it looks like it would be kind of decrementing like 100% on the decrement; margin that's just simple math of taking the 35% and then subtracting the $300 million of savings. Is there some mix impact there or something like that. I'm just -- I know you sound like being conservative I guess. It's a little bit tough to kind of make those numbers reconcile. James Lico : I think it is better if you break it by quarter to do that. I think it will help make the map because I think what you just did is 10% down on the year and if we were 20% down here you're going to do some funny things there that makes that math but we're trying to say is by quarter 35% to 40% is about what you should expect on the decrementals given that we've frontend loaded some more is higher down in Q2 as we called out 20% to 25%. So our math will going forth in the follow-up call about how comes down. Steve Tusa : So you're seriously saying that like at a certain level of you're kind of assuming a certain level of revenue decline. So if for example the revenue came in less than 20%. So I guess implicit in that in the annual guide is like a 20% type of revenue decline, Is that kind of what you're saying. Charles McLaughlin : No. I think a better way to think about it is these are the types of fall throughs that we will manage through by pulling your guidance and we don't know what the second half is. There maybe we do more actions as we go through the year maybe it moderates a little bit, but we're trying to have -- we have obviously more clarity around the second quarter. In the second half, we specifically don't know that yet/ James Lico : I was just going to add that when we built a number of scenarios around what we think the second half would look like, this is not one of the things where we're going to wondering what's going to happen. We obviously Chuck and I've been through a few of these the vast amount of greater between the two would probably suggest that isn\u2019t even our second time. So I think we built scenarios, we've identified the cost reductions that we think are available to the multiple bulk scenarios and we're confident in those decrementals relative to both the actions and several scenarios and if things get worse as we said certainly in the presentation as well, we've got some additional levers we can pull up if needed if we saw things come down, but it's still such early days too early to call on anything like that just yet. Steve Tusa : And then just a follow up on along the line to the revenue declines and I know that there's a not a lot of visibility here but like most companies are kind of talking about some are saying April was down mid teens, they have kind of a worse case of down 20 this quarter and then things bounces back and start to reshape of whatever. You're 20 to 25 in the second quarter for those that have given it is relatively steep, especially in the context of all those groups of revenues you have that should be holding up. How do you kind of reconcile that? I thought that you guys have kind of pivoted the portfolio to be more defensive and the 20 to 25 while it's not out of the question certainly given the macro it just seems like it's kind of in the low in the range around versus kind of what others are saying. Are they giving just kind of under punching how bad it is out there? James Lico : Well I can't speak for others. I think that the severity of restrictions if you look at our big businesses I would think about it this way, Gilbarco one of our largest businesses can't put stuff in the ground. So while they had a very strong first quarter in North America inevitably until these restrictions got lifted they're not putting sites in the ground. So we still think the resilience is there because ultimately one quarter does not year make and we think that will come back in the year certainly with EMV we're confident that that demand is there. You take another business like Matco, where people are sheltering in place and not putting as many mouths, repair shops are closed. In many states maybe were considered nonessential and so that needs to come up and then AFP obviously with elective surgery just so dramatically. Those are really very much shelter and place impact. So I think we would -- we probably would never plan for shelter in place economic scenario when we build the portfolio given we haven\u2019t seen a pandemic in a little while. So those are very unique and that's why we put them in the category two because once these restrictive things come in play the business will come back much faster than say if it was in economic consequence if you will. Steve Tusa : Okay. one last quick one. How are orders at GVR? Are those held up or are those kind of trending down? James Lico : No they\u2019ve held up decently particularly in North America. Some issues with around the world as an example we have a national oil company and oil prices are down they may delay a tender or something like that, but I think we mentioned it in the prepared remarks around India as an example, we see a little bit of that in Chin as well, but I think if you just take North America, the orders are holding up, we're pretty confident that that will come back. Once we can put stuff in the ground, then we'll have a good when construction starts around the United States, you'll starts to see that business come back pretty quickly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : No surprise that you are delaying the timing here on Vontier. But I would be interested you also said you're delaying the timing and structure. So how might the structure change of the spend based upon what we were looking at before? James Lico : I think there is probably three things to keep in mind. One is the strategy around the separation hasn't changed at all. We said that we would be ready to go at the end of Q1, which we were with the management team to move forward and we just evaluate whether the market was ready to go. Obviously we don't think that the market is receptive for this type of separation transaction in the next few months and so what we're really looking for is for the market to become stable and for us to be able to move forward and look at that. And then like we've always said is like we're looking what that looks like we can't really tell right now, but when we get there, both split or spin options will be open to us and we'll figure out which one works best for all of our stakeholders. Deane Dray : Okay. Good. That sounds familiar with what we were looking out before and then Chuck while I have you for free cash flow, guidance saying you'd be better than 100%. What that means for CapEx I don\u2019t know if I might've missed that and then assumptions on working capital, will you be liquidating the portfolio some inventory becomes a source and what are you thinking about receivables and credit quality and so forth? Charles McLaughlin : Probably the easiest way on the true CapEx were very CapEx light, but we'll probably I'd expect our CapEx year-over-year to be down 25% probably a bit more than what we -- more when you think about what we were actually guiding for the year three months ago, but that's the simple answer on CapEx. When it comes to working capital we've got a very strong procurement team and the operating companies really focus on working capital terms as one of our core value drivers as you know and we've worked hard on that so what we'll do is as the revenue comes down we're going to make sure supplies that we don't bring on more inventory then we need. So trying to the best job that we can in terms of maintaining the inventory turns that will naturally free up some cash coming up as the Q2 slows down that'll be a source of cash rather than use of cash in the near-term. But our teams are going to strike a balance, every one of these operating companies will be a little bit different situation. We don't want to end up with too much inventory but we don't want to end up with too little when things start to recover. But that's not that different than what they have to deal with every quarter. So I think we're well-suited with 40 business system to help us do that. On receivables we're off to a good start in cash flow collections. Again it's an OpCo by OpCo story. We have a lot of daily management around this and we feel confident in how this is going to perform as we go through the year as Jim said. It's not just Jim and I, a number of the people that are OpCo's were with us in 2009 as well. So we feel confident about where we're at. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Jim, does the M&A focus for Fortive and Vontier change at all moving forward even if you stay together for a while given the increased focus from basically setting up Vontier to be on its own? Do we see more acquisition capital drift that way over the next few quarters once they recover a bit and you mentioned you would play offend with your balance sheet over the next year. So could you comment on your acquisition pipeline, your appetite to do a larger deal obviously not in the short-term but as the pandemic eases? James Lico : Yeah I think just as we always remind ourselves that we spent $4 billion last year, brought a number of good companies in this portfolio and we had always thought that 2020 might be a year more built on and maybe some strategic investments as well in technology, things that tend to be a little smaller. I think that's probably still remains our view and if we saw -- what we've always said is that Vontier will be part of Fortive until and it's spun and so if there were something that we would see that was attractive, we wouldn't necessarily preclude ourselves from doing that. I think as you point out and as we've continued to work -- during this time we focus more -- generally focus more on cultivation and more on market work in part Andy because generally during this time, seller's price expectations and buyer's price expectations aren\u2019t aligned usually right at the front end of this stuff. It takes a few quarters for those things to start to equal up. So we'll wait, we're certainly patient there. We'll focus on the things that we can control and we certainly continue to look for any opportunity but if I were to bet I would say if we were to do anything we would most likely be the bold on this year and in the next few quarters. Andy Kaplowitz : That's helpful and then Jim just kind of to ask Steve's question maybe a different way some of your peers have talked about a V-shaped recovery in China specifically and some strength at least not weakness in semiconductor and some types of electronics. Seems like you really see more of you in China. So maybe give us a little more color on that and could you comment on your electronic focused businesses? James Lico : Yeah sure. So I'd say I think we got always letters for recovery. I think at the end of the day, this is not a snapback recovery in China. If we look at our four largest businesses there, Tektronix is got electronic focus, that's pretty slow. We have a little bit of Huawei impact in the first quarter, but that's been relatively slow still and haven't seen that come back much. Fluke has seen nice demand in things like imaging. So they\u2019ve seen some strong demand there but the remaining part of it is still remains slow. So I haven\u2019t seen much recovery there. I think with Gilbarco, we've been mostly waiting to put stuff in the ground given there are still a lot of restrictions there. I mentioned that in North America but we're seeing that other places around the world. So that's probably been more slow than the other two and of course ASP I mentioned elective surgeries at their peak were down 85% in China. So they\u2019ve come back considerably, but not come back to normal yet. We would anticipate that to happen over the next 60 days. So that could come back a little bit faster. Just to give you a little bit of color. So overall what does that mean when we add it all up, I think of the end of the day China does I don\u2019t think China looks all that different in the second quarter than it does in the first quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Good evening everyone. Hope everybody is well. I just want to come around to the cost savings the $300 million to make sure fully understand the moving pieces there. So the $300 million is a annualized run rate or is it $100 million a quarter and then we had to cut it off there. Just little bit of color on really what it is, what's temporary, what's structural and how it rolls out would be helpful? James Lico : I think it's meant to be more about over the last three quarters. So think of it as $100 million a quarter maybe will give little bit more in Q2 with some of those. I think there's where we don't have an announced restructuring or anything beyond what we did in the last fourth quarter. So by their nature these things are somewhat temporary. We're trying to maintain the team that we had coming into it coming into it, coming out the other side at least as we put these actions, but in them are things like travel obviously way down there is going to be some miscellaneous spend that will slow down on the margins around maybe some marketing and really sales programs as well throughout OpEx and there is going to be some spending around the pay furloughs that will come out. Those are some of the main ones but we'll look at every bucket and to make sure that and we've got actions identifies but those are some of the bigger ones. Charles McLaughlin : Jeff, I'd just say may be to add on obviously we've historically as part of continue improvement historically kept a decent amount of temporary labor in factory. So from a productivity perspective, we're going to accelerate productivity in a down cycle that's part of the cost reductions as well and quite frankly probably a little bit more temporary than typically because of the nature of this recovery and how it might happen, I think we want to maintain as many degrees of freedom as we can for as long as we can but certainly we understand exit rates into 2021 and what's going to need to look like and we're going to continue to evaluate that bucket as well as additional buckets as we see in the demand play out. Jeff Sprague : So that brings me back around to what Steve Tusa was asking if we model sales down low 20s and kind of the mid-30s decrementals and then back out $100 million to $150 million of cost savings, it implies your underlying decremental like 60% to 70%. I guess that maybe isn't crazy relative to your gross margin with five handle, but as the year progresses and sales theoretically the declines begin to moderate if we're still holding at that 35% to 40% observed decremental the implied underlying number just doesn't really seem to make a lot of sense. Charles McLaughlin : Yeah I think keep in mind there's moving pieces that we look at but yeah and being 65% plus decrementals from the top line with our gross margins into 50s depending on where it comes in as the other places that will fall through higher than that for sure. So that's not a crazy -- that is actually right where we are at 65% to 70% where it will fall through. As we get into the second half we'll continue to evaluate that and it depends what falls through and what you can get after is a little different if we you're down 20% than if you're down 15%. So more to come on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird. Richard Eastman : Jim I noticed in the documents here that were released, a fairly substantial charge around the Telematics business and I'm just curious if there's any change of strategy there. I would've thought perhaps that business might've been one of your more resilient businesses just because it is kind of a SaaS business? Is that just an accounting true up to the price paid versus the implied value today or any change of strategy there? Charles McLaughlin : That is purely an accounting non-cash charge. We do an annual impairment value analysis of all of our business. That one was close to it, through the impacts of COVID that takes our forecast down a little bit as it just creeps it over the line and that's what drove that charge. James Lico : I would say, relative to change in strategy, no change in strategy in fact I think we've had a new leadership team in there for a little bit, Mark [ph] who we hired obviously to bring on through those Vontier role has been very involved and I think the team is actually pretty excited about some of the work they\u2019ve got going here is going to play out in the back half of the year. As we said, there is a little bit of degradation, they\u2019ve got a little bit of small business impact, you got some fleet folks who've seen some reduction in freight and so they lowered the number of trucks. So there is a little -- there is some degradation as Chuck mentioned but it's not changing there is more of an outlook kind of thing than anything else. So I think by the end of the year, it doesn't -- we can't move the needle quickly in that because it is fast, but I think as we start to see the back half of the year, I know we said that there has been a self-help project for several quarters now. I think the team is more inclined to be positive out than ever before. So we'll see where it plays out. Richard Eastman : Okay, and then just as a follow-up when did the healthcare businesses ASP, Land Hour, even Fluke Medical and Sensus, the businesses really are correlated to patient visits like you said like the procedures but as those businesses start to ramp back up and basically you lose some of this movement control orders is it leverage in those businesses, they come back at a very nice gross margin, but is there leverage from a sales perspective or do they ramp back up from a sales perspective? James Lico : No there is pretty good leverage. Picking a timing on that is obviously a little challenging, but as you say in this case this is true pent up demand. I was talking with a CEO of one of the biggest hospital networks in the country this afternoon who is talking about literally all kinds of different patient groups that they\u2019ve just not seen including elective procedures. And I think that what's going to happen here in both the clinical and financial needs are going to happen right. There is a whole bunch of pent-up demand for these type of procedures. That's the clinical need and obviously the elective procedures, elective surgeries in particular are very profitable for the hospital. So there is going to be a real need from a financial perspective to accelerate this. So we would expect to see that acceleration. difficult to predict when, given the number of states particularly in the US and the number countries in Europe the need to turn this back on how quickly things get turned on but we do think there will be leverage in those business. Land Hour grew in the first quarter as an example. So we even in some cases we saw some good performance even despite some of those challenges. The SaaS business at Sensus continue to continue to grow as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Most of my questions have been answered but one of the things I was curious about is just there was an awful lot of pretty big liquidity moves that you made likely so but is there a meaningful cost increase, interest expense or otherwise it goes along with making the moves? James Lico : There's certainly some anytime you change those, but I think the total cost of fees were in that less than a penny a year probably more like penny and a half. And then there's some changing in terms of the floors around off of LIBOR but frankly it's below -- the floor that it's negotiating in there is lower than where we're at right now. So not a huge cost for them. Scott Davis : And then just a quick follow-up the percent of facilities that you guys have up and running right now, is there a -- I know you\u2019ve a given a number for one of the businesses, but I recall seeing an aggregated number. Is there something that you have? James Lico : Yeah all of our facilities are up and running and have been. We had a couple situations where we might've been in the US and Europe where we had one facility or two facilities in the US where we were down day or so where we were working through the local situation but all of our facilities now or have been pretty much through the downturn up and running. We have furloughed a few facilities in the second quarter as we said with some demand, but we have -- we were able to run all of facilities now around the world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John inch with John Inch with Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Can you just remind us of the mix in ASP of consumables versus equipment and just sort of what sort of levels are these consumables running down today sort of dovetailing back to the point of elective some procedures and so forth, just to trying to put this into a context? James Lico : Yeah it's about 75%, 25% or if you thought of servicing consumables together it's probably 75%, 25% moves around a little bit by quarter depending on larger deals in some parts of the world, but that's a probably decent number to go with and then we get pretty good data in North America because of Sensus. The Sensus Trax software it senses really check tracks the daily amount of sterilization that go on in the US and is an example we see those down as much 60% in the United States. So that's probably a number and we don't get as good a data in Europe and as I mentioned we have decent data in China and we saw at the peak as I mentioned in the prepared remarks down about 85%. So we've seen significant reductions in those consumables John. We are decontaminating N95 respirators in US and in some countries in Europe. That brings back that volume a little bit probably but by and large, we really want to see those elective procedures come back in order to really drive the revenue. John Inch : Yeah I was going to ask you about the decontamination opportunity, is that big enough once it gets to full grow-out to rollout to move the needle let's call it in the next few quarters or whatever or is that still relatively minor business? James Lico : No it's really a temporary measure. At the end of the day the hospitals are probably going to want to utilize single use masks for the most part. This really gives them at a time when PPE has been a challenge. They can turn on the STERRAD, they're essentially not at capacity right now in their hospitals to create more opportunity. So when the decontamination was really an effort for us to help out, it's really more of an effort to help out our customers not a really big financial opportunity probably in the neighborhood of $10 plus million in the quarter, but hard to tell how many hospitals will necessarily need to use that more longer-term. John Inch : It's been pressing nonetheless. I want to ask you Jim, you guys have sizable long-term operations in China, depending on how sort of the politics of the pandemic all play out when this subsides one thing we're sort of talking about the risk of the US and China going into a cold war, we have had the economic issues, but maybe this becomes something much more extreme. How are you as CEO thinking about this in your assets there and possibly future growth trajectory M&A like it's kind of a holistic question to what could be turn for the worse in terms of our relations between the two countries? James Lico : Yeah and you know I've been pretty close to China for a long time having run it back in the Danner days for a long time and we're pretty close to those questions. I think one Jon as we deriks our supply chain considerably, once the tariff started, so we've really derisked our supply chain considerably since from where we were at even a year ago. We're going to continue to assess those things and we will continue to probably -- we mostly make or China in China. So as we look at bigger moves, we'll continue to evaluate, we don\u2019t have any big moves left. To be honest we've mentioned we have any, but we certainly are continuing to think about this continued move in places to build locally for many of our businesses. Our healthcare business almost exclusively built in the US and in Europe, so I know there's a lot more energy on the healthcare side to wonder about origin and certainly we're fine in that situation. So in case that was also I am referring that in your questions as well. So anyway I think we're in good place and we're well-positioned from I think what we've demonstrated in a tariff situation is that we can move pretty quickly if we need to do, other things we certainly are able to do that. We're monitoring all the things that you obviously described James Lico : I think that we appreciate the energy and I am not sure we got through everything today. Obviously a lot there for everyone to want to know about and we appreciate the time and energy that everybody has put into this. We're available for follow-up and certainly want to make sure we make ourselves available if anyone needs time, Griffin and team are available. Chuck and certainly and I are also available. I just want to thank everyone at a time when it's just been the word unprecedented is used so often these days is probably the most overused term in the focus on health and safety of our teams has never been more important to us than every day we wake up. But we would also want to make sure that we've give you an understanding that while there is uncertainty in the near-term, we're in a very strong position to be able to manage the business around multiple scenarios and the moves that we've made over the last three years strategically continue to be very good moves from a resiliency perspective and I am confident we'll see that play out in the weeks and months and quarters to come. So we look forward to continue dialogue to give you a better color. Hopefully we did more of this presentation to give you that color and we're certainly available to continue to give you a sense of what we're seeing and available to help in any way, shape or form. I want to wish everybody -- I hope everybody on the call is safe. I hope your family and friends are safe as well. I hope you\u2019ve been able to be productive in all this work from home stuff and in such a challenging time we look forward to the time when we can all see you at a conference or something. We look forward to those days and hopefully they're not in the not-too-distant future. Thanks everybody. Have a great evening. We'll talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks, Griffin and good afternoon, everyone. Today we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.68 for the second quarter of 2020. As we delivered better than forecasted revenue performance despite the difficult conditions created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It was a quarter that clearly reflected the power of the Fortive business system as we executed our playbook on expense, savings and working capital management, enabling us to achieve decremental margins of 33% and generate very strong free cash flow. Throughout the quarter, we continued to operate all of our essential production facilities around the world and proactively manage our supply chains, while adopting comprehensive new protocols to protect the health and safety of our employees. With a focus on maintaining continuity, despite the shift to a virtual operating environment, the Fortive team leveraged new virtual sales and marketing tools to continue to engage with customers. We also adjusted product development processes in order to continue to meet project timelines, while continuing to invest across the portfolio to emerge from this period with an enhanced competitive position. When we looked ahead on our Q1 earnings call in April, we faced a highly uncertain operating environment due to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Q2 performance demonstrated the resilience we built into the portfolio over the past four years, with an increased share of recurring revenue from our expanding set of subscription-based software solutions, services and consumables offerings. Recurring revenue accounted for more than 35% of total revenue in Q2, a new high for Fortive. Importantly, this resilience came through despite the fact that a key source of recurring revenue Advanced Sterilization Products experienced a decline in the elective surgical procedures as healthcare systems around the world weathered the early months of the pandemic. With respect on Vontier, we made additional progress in Q2 preparing for its separation from Fortive as we can continue to evaluate our options for structuring the separation either via spin or split. The Fortive and Vontier teams remain in a position to move forward an affective separation as soon as market conditions permit. Mark Morelli and Dave Naemura continue to guide the Vontier businesses through the challenging macro conditions, while also leading the build out of Vontier\u2019s organizational capacity as the team prepares for its future as an independent public company. We issued our most recent Corporate Social Responsibility Report at the end of Q2, highlighting the important progress we have made across our portfolio over the past year. Our CSR framework organizes our priorities into seven strategic pillars, which capture the full breadth of our initiatives around the Corporate Social Responsibility. Consistent with our belief in the strength that comes from building diverse teams, we have always aimed to cultivate an inclusive environment at Fortive. Over the past few months, we have acted on these values to help our teams advance an internal dialogue about addressing critical broader themes of social justice. As we look to continue living our values and fulfilling our commitment to our employees in our communities, the Fortive and Vontier teams will remain strongly committed to increase diversity, equality and inclusion as a key tenant of our culture and our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts. With that, let\u2019s turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $241.9 million, down 25% from the prior year and adjusted net \u2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.68. Total sales declined 15.7% to $1.6 billion, including a 16.8% core revenue decline, reflecting the significant negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Acquisitions contributed 270 basis points of growth, while unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 160 basis points. Gross margins held up well in Q2 at 52%, supported by the growing contribution of our high margin software businesses. Gross margins also benefited from 70 basis points of price and disciplined supply chain execution. Given the top line challenges, core operating margin decreased 220 basis points, resulting in an adjusted operating profit margin of 20.2%. This adjusted operating margin reflected total cost actions of greater than $100 million executed during the quarter in response to the widespread deterioration and macro economic conditions. During the second quarter, we generated $454 million of free cash, representing conversion of 188% of adjusted net earnings. The strong free cash flow performance reflected a proactive response taken by our operating companies using FBS to improve inventory turns and accounts receivable driving $165 million of tailwind from working capital in Q2. It also showed the increased resilience of free cash flow generation across the portfolio driven by specific portfolio transformation actions taken over the past few years. Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted a total sales decline of a 11%, including a 14.4% decline in core revenue. Acquisitions contributed 450 basis points, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by a 110 basis points. Core operating margin decreased 140 basis points, resulting in segment level adjusted operating margin of 23.1%. Industrial Technologies posted a total sales decline of 23.7%, including a 20.8% decline in core revenue. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 250 basis points. Core operating margin decreased 250 basis points, resulting in segment level adjusted operating margin of 19.6%. Looking across the major geographies. Our performance in Q2 continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 headwinds, what was broadly better than expected. The region-by-region breakdown, as shown on Slide 9 of the earnings presentation, ultimately reflected each regions relative progress in terms of economic reopening, as well as local public health dynamics, as the quarter progressed. In Asia, core revenue declined to low double-digits in Q2, representing a significant improvement from the prior quarter driven primarily by China. China was down mid single-digits in the quarter. We continue to see steady signs of progress across our China businesses as they climb back from the low point experienced back in February. All of our major businesses in China experienced significant sequential improvement in Q2, with a number of operating companies including Fluke and ASP returning to year-over-year growth. We were encouraged by the positive signs coming out of Q2, including improving point-of-sale trends at Fluke and Tektronix and elective surgery volumes for ASP back to approximately 90% of the levels that prevailed prior to the onset of the pandemic. Looking across the rest of Asia, Japan likewise saw sequential improvement in Q2, while India and Southwest \u2013 Southeast Asia remain more challenging. India, in particular, saw severe economic lockdown measures put into place for much of Q2. This significantly limited access to customers for sales and marketing activities, as well as services implementation. Western Europe core revenue declined high-teens in Q2. The quarter played out largely as expected with significant challenges through April and then sequential improvement in May and June as economies began to reopen. The resulting top line for Western Europe was a bit better than expected in Q2, particularly in light of relatively weaker trends in the region prior to the onset of the pandemic. Notably, ASP posted low single-digit growth and strong Terminal Sterilization capital sales and incremental consumable revenue from N95 respirator reprocessing helped offset a significant decline in total surgical procedure volume. Demand trends for Fluke and Tektronix, while still down significantly showed some improvement over the course of the quarter. North America core revenue also declined high-teens in Q2, similar to Western Europe, the US bottomed in April and then saw a sequential improvement across May and June, resulting in a better than expected high-teens decline in total revenue. Improvement over the back half of the quarter was driven by the widespread lifting of lockdown measures, although customer access remains limited in certain markets. North America does benefit from the resilient performance of our software businesses, many of which drive the majority of the revenue in the region and provide important stability in Q2. We believe improving trends for elective surgical procedure volumes, continued EMV related demand to GVR and early signs of POS improvement at Fluke create the possibility for further sequential top line progress in the coming quarters. That said, we continue to monitor the risks associated with rising COVID-19 infection rates and hotspots across the country and any re-imposition of lockdowns which may be required. Finally, we saw a mid-teens decline in the Middle East and a greater than 20% decline in Latin America. Weakness in the Middle East reflected the combined impact of COVID-19 and budgetary pressures across the region tied to challenging conditions in the oil and gas market.  While Latin America experienced the spread of COVID-19 a bit later than other regions, the impact became significant in Q2, with particular headwinds for our businesses in Mexico and Brazil. We anticipate that conditions will likely remain challenging throughout both these regions as we look through the end of the year. Last quarter, we laid out a framework for analyzing our portfolio found on Slide 10 of today\u2019s presentation, with businesses organized into groups based on relative sensitivity to pandemic disruption and resulting deterioration and market demand. As shown on Slide 11, the performance in Q2 across the four indicated groups played out very much in line with our expectations for the quarter. Group one, which represented approximately 14% of total revenue in Q2 showed significant resilience and posted mid single-digit growth for the quarter, despite the challenging economic conditions. The Groups\u2019 performance reflected a strong contribution from a number of our software businesses, Intelex grew mid-teens, eMaint grew high single-digits, Gordian was up slightly and the SaaS & Maintenance portion of Accruent was relatively flat. Group I also benefited from very strong demand at Fluke\u2019s Industrial Imaging business, where customer response to COVID-19 drove very strong growth in the quarter. We\u2019re excited about the continued near-term demand trends for these product lines at Fluke and the potential to accelerate a broader Industrial Imaging strategy. As expected, Group II, which represents approximately 48% of total revenue in Q2 was significantly impacted early in the quarter by lockdowns. Overall, the Group\u2019s improvement over the back half of the quarter resulted in mid-teens revenue decline, roughly 10 points better than expected. For AFP, surgical procedure volumes in both the US and Western Europe troughed at levels higher than those experienced to China in Q1, and subsequently bounced back faster than expected to drive higher consumables usage during the quarter. At GVR, where bookings increased mid single-digits in the first half of the year, the pandemic impacted our ability to convert orders to deliveries in Q2. Despite the push out of the liability decline, we continue to see strong demand for EMV upgrades in North America. Elsewhere in Group II, the recurring revenue business models of ISC\u2019S iNet and Fluke Health Solutions land our dosimetry business provided added resilience in the second quarter. Fluke Health Solutions, which grew low single-digits in Q2 also saw a strong demand for ventilator calibrators related to the fight against COVID-19. Group III, which represented approximately 15% of total revenue in Q2 performed better than we had anticipated in the second quarter with mid-teens decline. The group\u2019s performance was highlighted by Matco, which saw significant pressure early in the quarter, but then a strong recovery in orders as lockdowns began to lift. Elsewhere, the Sensing portfolio saw pressure across a number of its core industrial end markets. This was partially offset by growth in semiconductors driven by demand for datacenter upgrades and infrastructure as well as COVID related tailwinds in medical end markets. Specifically, Setra and Gems saw strong demand for critical environment products and ventilator components, respectively. Accruent\u2019s Professional Services business faced significant headwinds in the quarter, but adjusted with new safety protocols and remote delivery capabilities to help address COVID-19 related restrictions and drive better performance later in the quarter. Group IV which represented approximately 23% of total Q2 revenue, experienced the most top line pressure in the quarter as expected and posted an almost 30% decline. That said, businesses in Group four showed earlier signs of improvement than we had anticipated in April. Notably, Fluke\u2019s Core Industrial business saw improvement in point-of-sale across its major regions, with Asia POS positive in Q2, and Europe in the US improving off their early Q2 lows. The Tektronix Instruments business performed largely as expected in the second quarter with sequential improvement in China. Conditions remain challenged, but we anticipate some sequential improvement at Tek in the second half. The combination of top line resilience, strong margin execution and substantial cash flow generation enabled us to continue to enhance our liquidity position and pay down debt as expected during the second quarter. We ended the quarter with over $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet, in addition to our undrawn, $2 billion revolving credit facility. While there were plenty of immediate challenges to address in Q2, we continue to play offense across our portfolio, running our FBS playbook by using dynamic resource allocation to invest in key growth initiatives to enhance our long-term competitive position. We remain focused on driving innovation across the portfolio using the FORT, our centralized artificial intelligence and data analytics hub to bring more advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities to bear in our workflow solutions, while also expanding our use of the growth accelerator process to fund potential growth breakthrough opportunities. In May, we established a partnership with Pioneer Square Labs to help incubate industrial technology companies capable of bringing new products to market in an accelerated fashion in addition to our internal development processes. Sustained investment has enabled our operating companies to quickly address emerging opportunities, including the growing demand for critical environmental solutions, et cetera and Industrial Imaging products at Fluke driven by the response to COVID-19. The same investment has also enabled the completion of longer-term development of critical next generation products, such as Teletrac Navman, newly introduced TN360 Telematics platform, which is expected to form a core part of its offering going forward. Importantly, we\u2019re also investing to expand our commercial operations, particularly among our software businesses. We continue to expand Intelex\u2019s European sales team to help capitalize on growth opportunities outside the US and build the capability of Censis to address attractive opportunities emerging in the ambulatory surgery center market. At ASP, despite challenges reaching customers in the quarter, our continued investment in sales and service enabled the team to quickly address the near-term N95 respirator reprocessing opportunities. Despite the better trends we saw coming out of Q2, macro conditions remain challenging with the potential for future volatility. This is particularly in light of persistent challenges associated with global efforts to keep COVID-19 infection rates under control. Consistent with Q2, we are not providing a guide, but we are providing additional color on expected performance for the coming quarter. We expect that total revenue will improve sequentially in Q3, but decrease by 5% to 8% on a year-on-year basis. We will continue to calibrate any remaining cost actions based on the top line progression from here as we manage to decremental margins of approximately 35% in Q3. As we look ahead, we also expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and deliver a free cash flow conversion ratio of greater than 110% of adjusted net earnings for the full year. The second quarter of 2020 was truly an unprecedented period. As we had to quickly adjust to an unfolding global public health crisis, and a resulting deterioration of the global macroeconomic environment. We weathered the storm delivering financial performance that significantly exceeded our expectations three months ago. As such, our Q2 performance demonstrated the progress we have made with our portfolio transformation over the past four years, establishing a more resilient top line and sustained cash flow performance through the cycle. More importantly, as we leverage the foundation of FBS to sustain our performance and develop new virtual collaboration tools, we continue looking forward by making the investments in innovation and team development that will lay the groundwork for the continuation of our portfolio transformation. Finally, I am extremely proud of our team\u2019s efforts over the past three months, and while we undoubtedly face additional challenges in the coming quarters. I\u2019m confident in our ability to navigate through them as we continue to generate substantial value for our employees, customers, shareholders and our communities. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Griffin. Griffin Whitney : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Nicole, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Chuck. Thanks, Griffin. Good evening, good afternoon. Obviously the 3Q, you know, sales range of down pathways is obviously quite a bit better than you know what you\u2019re pointing towards In April and then what you realized in the quarter. So I\u2019m just curious, you know, how and I, you know, don\u2019t exactly want to blah, blah, blah here. But you know, as we went through June-July, what are you seeing, you know, not necessarily by business, but just generally, what do you see in terms of organic sales progression as we went through the quarter and into July? Jim Lico : But, thanks, Nigel. Yeah I think a couple of things relative to the trends, I think we certainly as we sort of said in the prepared remarks, progressively things got better as we got through the quarter. So, you know, I think every month got a little bit better certainly from a trend perspective. July is just in and is probably good as well, but good in the sense of giving us confidence as to the guide. So, I think the trends are certainly getting better. I think it\u2019s difficult to necessarily know how long they\u2019ll continue and hence the, you know, like through the end of the fourth quarter, but I think as we look at the near-term trend, they look pretty good. And certainly as we said, you know, we have a good sense of what EMV is going to look like in the back half. That\u2019s a driver, obviously, macro getting better is another example. So that really covers industrial tech and on the Professional Instrumentation side, elective surgery still, you know, on the right trend, the software business is staying resilient and certainly some of the POS transit Fluke starting to be a little bit better as well. Nigel Coe : Thanks, Jim. And you know, the decremental margins obviously were very encouraging, you seem to have a really good firm grip on the cost management side of it, you know, 35% decremental margin outlook for 3Q. I know you had confidence that you could, you know, kind of maintain or kind of like bring back those gross margin decrementals into that range you put out there. So should we think about, you know, your 3Q, 4Q in that sort of 35% range, you know or is there a scope for it to be to look better in 4Q if we continue to see the improvement trends into 4Q? Thanks. Chuck McLaughlin : Hey, Nigel, this is Chuck. I think what we\u2019re trying to say is that we will deliberately manage the business to 35% as we move forward. The top line is on a better trajectory. At least, that it seems at this point in time, and that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re guiding there. So, we\u2019ll strike that balance of managing our expenses and investing into the future that as we go forward. So 35% is the right number. Nigel Coe : Very clear, thank you very much. Jim Lico : Thanks, Nigel. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Scott Davis with \u2013 Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hey, good afternoon guys. Chuck McLaughlin : Hey, Scott congratulations on the book. Scott Davis : Thanks. Chuck McLaughlin : Scott, congratulations on your book. Scott Davis : Yeah, now thank you. I hope that helps many people sleep. A couple of pages in, you\u2019re out like a light, right. But now, thanks for that, Chuck. I \u2013 everything look pretty encouraging here overall and I\u2019m just trying to think it\u2019s probably fifth or sixth earnings call today so a little beating up. But Chuck, you commented on \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Jim actually commented on the 70 basis points of price and I didn\u2019t get a sense is that 70 basis point generally come in that bucket of 35% recurring revenue where, you know, you\u2019re able to get a little bit more pricing power or is there some other base level price increase that, you know, you have across the board? Jim Lico : Yeah, you know, we were really encouraged you know, we\u2019ve had good price and quite frankly, as you know, the comps on price have been pretty good too. So, you know, to get that it was mostly in Professional Instrumentation in the quarter, Scott. So, you know, I would say and certainly the software businesses were part of that. But we had good mark. You know, we had good price in some of our key hardware businesses as well like Fluke and Tek. So I think across the board as we think about our playbook, you know, certainly on the expense side, we talked about $100 million of cost reductions in the quarter, but also part of that playbook is trying to find opportunity for price. And I think the teams did an exceptional effort, you know, in the quarter to try where those opportunities exist, they took advantage of them and while you know, I think and we will continue to do that through the rest of the year. Scott Davis : Okay, encouraging. And then the Vontier profit profile look like the top line growth profile you gave the, as far as the decrementals and overall profit and cash and such, was that fairly consistent with the rest of Fortive or was there some differences there? Chuck McLaughlin : No, I think that the \u2013 there\u2019s a little bit of difference in terms when you look at actual operating profit margin by a couple hundred basis points between the two segments. But when you get to the decrementals, I don\u2019t \u2013 they don\u2019t behave all that different between the two. Scott Davis : Okay, super helpful. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Jim Lico : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good afternoon. Maybe just circling back to the revenue outlook, so you\u2019re dialing in around about a 10 point less bad year-on-year drop in the third quarter than what you saw in the second quarter. Is there any more detail you could provide around that narrowing, you know, either on a segment basis for PI versus IT, and/or on that Group I to IV basis, just to help us sort of understand what\u2019s driving that improvement? Chuck McLaughlin : Hey, Julian, think of it this way, as we look at the quarter that we just had and what\u2019s improving, IT is going to improve a little bit more than PI, both are going to improve sequentially. We\u2019ve got you know, if you think about the IT, the Vontier Group, We\u2019ve got Matco really, you know, is continuing to show some strength there. And then we\u2019ve got that EMV secular trend that\u2019s going to be helping GVR, those are \u2013 were impacted in Q2 by the lockdown. And you know, as that gets released that\u2019s really could move out to more of a low single-digit \u2013 or down low single-digit for Vontier. And when you look at Professional Instrumentation, I think that\u2019s sequentially going to improve. That\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing, you know, to these \u2013 some of these acquisitions doing really well and then again, getting a little bit of a lift from the lockdown coming off. So I\u2019d see that improving to down high single-digit in Q3. Julian Mitchell : Thank you, Chuck. And then maybe a second question around the free cash flow. There was a big working cap tailwind in Q2, generally in the first half receivables, in particular, freed up $200 million plus of cash, I think. So maybe help us understand what\u2019s happening with working capital in the second half as you\u2019re seeing this revenue outlook improve on the extent to which you\u2019re seeing an improvement in the ASP business around that free cash flow profile. Chuck McLaughlin : Yeah, let me take a shot at them and Jim will probably add a few comments. I think \u2013 we think the tailwind from working capital from Q1 to Q2 is about $165 million and because you know, when you take a look at everything in there, and I think that that was just a lot of great work by our teams getting on things early, managing inventory level appropriately, you know, it\u2019s an example of managing which can manage and that gave us a, you know, a good push. And as you saw cash flow overall was very strong at $450 million. I think that what I would expect going forward, it really depends on how steep the sequential improvement continues to be going into the second half. But I\u2019d expect a little bit of a tailwind but not at the same level. It\u2019s probably, you know, maybe a half to a third of that coming back as a tailwind. Again, it really just depends on how steep the increase quarter-over-quarter is. Jim Lico : Julian, I would just add a couple of things. You know, number one is, we\u2019re really happy with what we saw relative to free cash flow. You know, a lot of times we\u2019ll talk about those working capital tailwinds in a way that suggests that it doesn\u2019t actively have to be managed. The last time I checked customers weren\u2019t in a hurry to pay us last quarter. So the work that we did, I think we\u2019re using FBS was really profound. It\u2019s also using it to capture and keep those up those advantages once we get into, you know, a little bit of growth mode or less \u2013 you know, less, you know, less down, if you will. I would say the second thing I\u2019d add is, you know, when we look at the, you know, historically, we said we would preserve, you know, somewhere in the 80 to \u2013 80 percentage range of free cash flow, when we were in a down cycle. And we\u2019ve been talking about that for four years. And I think what you saw in the quarter, and what you\u2019re going to see in the year is better than that. Obviously, we\u2019re much better than that, in the second quarter, we think, you know, we can \u2013 we\u2019ll do better into the 90s for the full year. So I think what you\u2019re seeing is the strength of the portfolio, the higher gross margins in PI particularly around software, I think our gross margins in PII for the quarter were around 36%. So the ability to drive more free cash out of the portfolio, given the changes I think also gives us some confidence that free cash in the remaining part of the year will be good as well. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks, Julian. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical. Jim Lico : Hey, Jeff \u2013 Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone or good afternoon, I guess. Jim Lico : Good evening. Jeff Sprague : Just two for me, if I could. Just on Vontier on the timing. You know, this market obviously has been extraordinarily resilient. What is it that you\u2019re looking for or waiting for you know, to make your decision on timing here? Jim Lico : Well I think there are a couple of or there\u2019s a couple of things we\u2019re looking for. One, we thought it was important obviously to you know, get out here with our Q2 results, and then we\u2019re just looking for continued stabilization with \u2013 in the market, nice volatility. And while we think that trends are definitely going in the right direction. We probably need to see a little bit more time here, going forward to ensure that, you know, we\u2019re not looking for a week to get out where we\u2019re looking for a little bit longer time period. But we\u2019re encouraged by the direction of the markets are going right now. And also, you know, we\u2019re prepared to go, we\u2019re ready and you know, that Vontier\u2019s ready to separate. And we\u2019re still convinced that the strategy is correct. And we\u2019re committed to the execution. So we\u2019re just waiting for a little bit more time and stability. Jeff Sprague : And just thinking about investment, Jim, so, you know, to Chuck\u2019s point, you\u2019re actually managing to a decremental, right. So sales are going to come in better, that\u2019s going to free up spending. You know, you provided a couple examples here on what you\u2019re working on. Should we expect most of that delta is going into growth or I would assume there\u2019s some restoration of just kind of, you know, temporary things that you had to kind of, you know, choke down here in the second quarter? Jim Lico : Yeah, I mean, you know, Jeff, and you know, we think of playbook really is, first and foremost, as we see some of those revenue going down, if you will, we, first and foremost, think about the factory and supply chain alignment with capacity. And we\u2019re focused on managing gross margins, you saw good, really good work on the part of the teams to do that in the quarter. There\u2019s the temporary cost actions, there\u2019s the permanent set of cost actions. And then there\u2019s this fourth part about dynamic resource allocation, which is moving money around to the highest opportunities, which is, I think, where you\u2019re going at. So we\u2019re managing the decrementals relative to those things. We\u2019re making decisions about temporary and permanent cost reductions as we really understand the outlook more or less into 2021. And those decisions are probably more in the coming months. But I think the most important thing, where you\u2019re going is, we\u2019re really making sure we\u2019re funding the growth opportunities that are inevitably going to create competitive advantage over time. A good example is the FORT, where we bring data analytics projects for the businesses, our projects are up 3x from where they were a year ago. So we\u2019re doing 3 times the number of data analytics projects that we were doing a year ago. I think that\u2019s a big focus. You\u2019re hearing a lot about digital transformation around companies. And I think that\u2019s really what we do at the FORT is leading that for both our operating companies and some internal projects that we\u2019re doing for Fortive. So I think that\u2019s one example. Maybe one other example is, you know, we\u2019re continuing to accelerate all of our investments in the software businesses where, you know, a number of our software businesses are really able to take advantage of a lot of the going back to work, challenges that occur, the changes in facilities, the new safety \u2013 health and safety protocols that exist in facilities and buildings. And so a number of our \u2013 we\u2019re really pivoting our solutions and our feature sets at both the current Gordian as well as an Intelex to really take advantage of those opportunities. So a number of our you know, increases in investment are going towards some of those things where we have, I think real good secular drivers over time. Jeff Sprague : And just one quick clarification, if I could. Chuck, that revenue color I think you gave to Julian\u2019s question. Was that reported revenues or was that organic revenue? A commentary you were given? Chuck McLaughlin : It\u2019s organic, although we\u2019re wrapping most of our acquisitions here, I think that for maybe Censis, but organic was my comment. Jeff Sprague : All right, great. Thanks. Jim Lico : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes, good afternoon. Jim Lico : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question on Fluke, as we think about, you know, the business today, how much of it is sort of ex-health you know, how much of it is Core Industrial at this point, and at the Core Industrial business what was the performance in the quarter? Jim Lico : Yeah, I think when you look at the Core Industrial piece that\u2019s in that Group IV, which would be our sort of our Core Industrial Instrumentation, probably about 60 \u2013 60%-ish, I think maybe two-thirds probably in that range \u2013 Andrew Obin : And \u2013 Jim Lico : And maybe a little bit up. Andrew Obin : Got you, okay, now, okay. Okay, that makes sense. And then just a question on software just to clarify Gordian and Accruent performance. So am I correct that Gordian as a marketplace revenue model, so it\u2019s just, you know, volume gone through the platform is down. So that\u2019s what\u2019s impacting it. And Accruent, you know, anything else going on besides sort of license to SaaS transition to depress the revenue? Jim Lico : Yeah, so I think yeah you\u2019re exactly right on Gordian so you get that one first. They \u2013 and really you know that\u2019s interesting, Andrew their revenue model also is very often requires some work on-site with the customer to get started. And obviously with the stay-at-home orders, you know, we were prevented from working with customers in some cases. So, you know, there\u2019s some delays, but there\u2019s no \u2013 we often get the question about new construction, it\u2019s really not new construction, it\u2019s really changes that are going on in the facility. So we think, you know, with everything going on with COVID and facility changes required around protocols that ultimately that business will come back. And as you said, the purchasing construction dollar will start to flow back through Gordian and ultimately, the revenue will get \u2013 will be, you know, back in growth mode. They\u2019ve been, as you know, a double \u2013 a strong double-digit grower for quite some time now, we still think we\u2019ve got great opportunity there. Accruent a little bit more complex in that regard. You know, we saw some, again, we\u2019re seeing a lot of good growth in the businesses that are really tied to facilities and facilities management and really returning to work, assessment work, our high cloud opportunities are EMS business, our Connected Healthcare businesses. And in Lucernex, which is our lease management business continues to be good. So those businesses are mostly the SaaS parts of the portfolio. And again, they\u2019re doing \u2013 they\u2019re much more resilient. Where we saw the challenges that Accruent is really one on the license revenue side. And again, on the Managed Service side, got a little bit better as we said in the prepared remarks like the \u2013 some of the Managed Services got better at the end of the quarter as we were able to get more on-site and be able to do some of our work remotely. But I think that\u2019ll continue to be, you know, we continue to think the SaaS part of Accruent will be durable. And, you know, we\u2019re still getting back to getting working with customers on a regular basis. And there still work to be done through the third quarter, I\u2019m sure. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good evening guys. Chuck McLaughlin : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hope everyone\u2019s well. Just a couple of questions here for mine, I guess, you know, first on businesses that go through distribution, I guess, you know, Fluke and Tek kind of come to mind first. How do you characterize kind of sell-in versus sell-out? I think when supply chain delays and distributor restocking, we\u2019ve seen you know a bit of backlog carried in for some other short cycle guys into the second half. How do you guys think you score against that? Jim Lico : Yeah, you know, I think we saw a little bit better point-of-sale trending at Fluke than we did at Tek, I would call Tek more stable, whereas, you know, got it improved, but Fluke maybe a little bit more of an improvement, but still negative. Our inventory positions have remained pretty much, I would say, flat to down, so no real inventory built. So I think as we get into the second half, we don\u2019t anticipate any big issues relative to inventory. On the other hand, we don\u2019t expect really distributors to necessarily take on inventory. So everything embedded in what we talked about for the guy to the third sort of assumes that sort of business as usual, trends continue around point-of-sale, which means, they get a little bit better. But at the end of the day, no big dramatic increases or decreases in inventory, nor any big swings on point-of-sale. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess, you know, Jeff took my question on Vontier timing. So ask a different one. On the four buckets that you\u2019re kind of breaking down the business and is obviously, those are shifting around a little bit as the businesses are separated, but does this current environment give you any kind of thought into how to manage M&A amongst those buckets? I mean, do we just kind of \u2013 can we expect mostly, you know, buckets I and II or are there room for you know, maybe some more cyclical or, you know, choppy assets that would have been later in this current environment that they\u2019d be still attracted to Fortive? Jim Lico : Yeah, I think it\u2019s a great question. I think, you know, obviously, if using the groupings as we have them. We clearly have, I think demonstrated a propensity over the last several years to grow, you know, the lion\u2019s share of our M&A deployed into mostly Group I and Group II. So I think that would \u2013 that you know, I would say the trend is going to \u2013 that trend will continue. That said, you know, there are certain situations, I would say PRUFTECHNIK is a deal we did last year for Fluke, which had both the service and an instrument aspect to it, that was really important to our overall Fluke digital offering. So in that case and we got it at a very, very high ROIC. So, I think here what you\u2019ll find is, if we do make some of those decisions that are in Group III or group IV, they\u2019re going to tend to be ones in which we\u2019d see the return is very high. But I would say if you said, let\u2019s talk about the lion\u2019s share of our capital allocation over the next several years, it\u2019s really going to be in building in those groups that are articulated I and II. And they\u2019re focused on things like condition monitoring, facilities management, healthcare enablement and health, safety and environmental, the places where we deploy the lion\u2019s share of our capital over the last four years. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it, appreciate the color. Good luck, guys. Jim Lico : Thanks, Josh. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird. Richard Eastman : Yes, good morning, afternoon, evening. Jim Lico : Hey, Rick. Richard Eastman : Hey, just a couple of questions. First, just around the recurring, Jim, I think you mentioned you know, recurring revenue and I think you were including software and consumables and services were 35% of Fortive\u2019s revs in the quarter kind of a new high. But how did that bucket as you defined it, they\u2019re at 35% of revenue, how did that do year-over-year in the second quarter? Jim Lico : Well, I have to disaggregate it into the \u2013 you know, into the groups. But I would say, if you thought about the sort of PI related software businesses, they were up about mid single-digit. And then obviously, Telematics, the big software business that we would have on the Vontier side, you know, is down in the quarter. But, you know, as I mentioned, I think the new platform that we\u2019re launching, we\u2019re excited about the opportunity for Telematics here going forward. So that kind of gives you the software view of what the quarter look like. Services, which are mostly in Group II buckets, probably, you know, sort of down to down. You know, I think our dosimetry business at Landauer was up in the quarter, but I think Tek services as an example was down low single-digits, something like that. So I probably would say the service parts of the business, you know, at Landauer which called as Fluke Health and the Tek probably down a little bit. But still, obviously much more resilient than the other parts of the portfolio. Richard Eastman : I got you, okay. And then just a question as we managed to this 35% decremental here for, you know, for the balance of the year a question just is around, you know, as we manage into next year around what\u2019s discretionary on the cost side, what our investments are on the cost side? How do you start to think about incrementals? You know, for PI and Vontier, what do we manage to there? I mean we have more software content, we have more recurring revenues, what would be the appropriate view on an incremental margin for PI and IT or Vontier? Chuck McLaughlin : Yeah, Rick this is Chuck, I would think that a good starting place is that we\u2019d come back up the same amount that we went down, because we want to reset back to starting to growing on our 2019. So recovering that revenue if it went down at 35% and I think of it coming back at 35%. Beyond that, it really depends on where we\u2019re growing as you mentioned, some of our \u2013 some of the software business obviously have higher decrementals, you know, as you move forward in time. So kind of depends after that, but first thing is to get back. Richard Eastman : Okay, very good. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks, Rick. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joe Giordano : Hey, guys. Jim Lico : Hey, Joe. Joe Giordano : Hey, can you kind of go through the cost outs, you mentioned $100 million in this quarter. As you look to like you know for the quarter and for like the balance of the year, how would you break that out between kind of temporary things that actions that you took that come back to the business when things are more normal versus more permanent savings? Jim Lico : Are you talking about for the quarter or what you think we\u2019ve done for the year? Joe Giordano : I guess, kind of like what did you do in the quarter, how would you break out that $100 million you mentioned in the prepared remarks and how you\u2019re thinking about the split and magnitude of temporary versus permanent for the rest of the year? Chuck McLaughlin : I think the \u2013 so in the quarter, I think that let me back up. It\u2019s a little easier to talk about for the year. I think that the permanent that we paid \u2013 we\u2019re likely to take, we have taken action on, will be $50 million permanent through the year, obviously not all that in Q1 or in Q2, that $100 million is, you know, a little less than that. But as you go through the year and think of it being $50 million in permanent action, that\u2019s on top of the actions we took in Q4 of last year where we did \u2013 [technical difficulty] [60 million] [ph] [technical difficulty]. And then as \u2013 it really depends on you know, let\u2019s see how the rest of the year plays out, particularly in Q4, but I would expect the next quarter, we\u2019ll know, obviously, we\u2019ll know how the third quarter played out and have a strong view into next year and see if we need to do anything of a more permanent nature or whether we think the top line is going to recover. Jim Lico : Joe, also part of that is obviously we\u2019re getting a substantial reduction in travel. And, you know, you know, part that we\u2019re very much working through now, a number of our virtual and digital, you know, work that we\u2019re doing with customers to understand how much of our real travel expenses, quite frankly, can become permanent cost reduction, because we just don\u2019t need necessarily make the trips that we\u2019ve historically made. So I think as we think about, you know, as once we have a better sense of what we think the revenue outlook will look like in 2021, then we can certainly, as Chuck said, make that decision, but not \u2013 those decisions aren\u2019t just the typical incentives and things like that, but it\u2019s also very much things like travel and costs that are \u2013 that would historically be considered temporary, but quite frankly, I think a significant amount of them are going to be permanent as we move into next year. Joe Giordano : That\u2019s fair, though, my follow-up just wanted to talk on the elective procedure volumes you guys mentioned that was interesting. You said in North America, you\u2019re seeing 80% to 90% - 85%, 90% of pre-COVID. Some of the checks we\u2019ve did it sounds like that rate is reflective of some of the kind of specialty hospitals, but like the big hospitals were more like in the 75% range. And I\u2019m just curious how you kind of view? Is that \u2013 just is that geared toward more a specific type of facility? And how is that looking now with what\u2019s going on in Florida and some of the places that are having flare-ups again? Jim Lico : Yeah, so our prepared remarks may not have been as clear. So we see \u2013 we see the China hospitals up at around 90%. And in the US hospitals, we\u2019re getting back I think our numbers would quite frankly agree with yours at the end of the quarter in the sort of 70%, 80% range. We got pretty good data from our Censis software business [technical difficulty] sterilizations. We not only have the understanding of what the procedures are. But we have an understanding with sterilization we think that continues to get back as we get through the quarter, but we don\u2019t see it a 100% even through the end of the third quarter, I don\u2019t think, still a long way to go between now and then. But we definitely think it continue to see we really get the data by day and we are seeing continued improvement through July as well. So we think things will continue [technical difficulty]. But as you said, it is a little bit of a type of facility dependent. Joe Giordano : Thanks. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, guys. Jim Lico : Hey, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Jim, maybe can you give us a little more color into your regional sales breakdown. You mentioned your, generally sales were down to the mid single-digits into Q2. Does that turn positive in Q3 and as you think about the revenue outlook improvement in Q3 versus Q2, are all regions generally improving at the same rate or do you see for instance, LatAm or even the US lagging the other regions? Jim Lico : Yeah, I think, you know, as you said, China was measurably better in Q2 than Q1. I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 you know, and, you know, that was on the backs of ASP and Fluke. I think, you know, China\u2019s going to get better through the second half, but I don\u2019t necessarily think that China gets to any dramatic growth rate in the second half. I think it gets better. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen enough to think that things are going to, you know, get significantly better. So I think our China theory here at this point is probably better. The rest of Asia, I think is a little mixed. As we mentioned, India continues to have a lot of lockdowns. And but we think by the end of the year, our India business and money \u2013 in many respects is driven by the GVR business. And we think that there\u2019s a number of things that \u2013 but the order pattern there\u2019s been very good. So we think India might get better by the end of the year. I think as we think about the Middle East, we think about Latin America, we don\u2019t anticipate anything getting better there. So that kind of gives you the high growth market view. The US will definitely get better through the remaining part of the year. I think the \u2013 and I would anticipate, whereas I don\u2019t necessarily see Western Europe getting that much better with the rest of the year. And the difference there is, we have the EMV tailwind in the US, we have Matco getting better in the US, we have ASP getting better, which is a bigger US business than it does at European business. And Fluke\u2019s point of sale is getting better. So I would say North America tends to get better through the remaining part of the year. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Western Europe, in particular, wasn\u2019t ripened to begin with when we sort of started with COVID. And I anticipate that to be a little bit more long \u2013 longer drawn out recovery. Hope to be proven wrong there, but that would sort of be our sort of thought process as we get into the second half year. Andy Kaplowitz : Okay. Let me ask my follow-up on GVR. Specifically, you mentioned India, it does tend to be lumpy for you guys and you know you tend to see delays sometimes in orders and obviously we know what\u2019s going on there in terms of new infections, so maybe confidence level in the international GVR business doing better in the second half of the year. And then you talked about mid single-digit order growth in North America. Does that just convert in the second half of the year as stay-at-home orders have, you know, basically, I mean they haven\u2019t gone away, that they\u2019re a little better in the second half of the year, does that just convert into revenue growth in North America? Jim Lico : Yeah, I think North America orders was continued to be good in the second half. It\u2019s a little mixed around the world. As you know in the rest of the world, a number of our customers are integrated oil companies and so oil and gas prices has a little bit more impact in some parts of the world than it does in the US, where that\u2019s a disaggregated market. So I do think the second half still follows some of those patterns that I was describing relative to the economy. But I think I think India in particular will continue. I think our position in India is very good. We, you know, we\u2019ve done a number of acquisitions there, Orpak acquisition or Matco acquisition, we have a very good position, we have great relationships with customers. So I\u2019m confident, as you said, it can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but if we look year-on-year-on-year, we built a really good business there and I\u2019m confident that the team will continue to execute there. So I think, you know, some of the other markets might be a \u2013 we did a Middle East review with the team the other day for all Fortive. And I think they\u2019re executing well there and some markets are going to continue to be okay. So I think GVR, in general, will, you know, it\u2019ll depend on the market and country. But I think, you know, we\u2019ll see a little bit better order pattern likely in the second half and on the backs of a continued strong EMV market in North America. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks, Jim. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from the line of the Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Jim Lico : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, I\u2019m interested in hearing a bit more about this joint venture with Pioneer Square Labs. It sounds like you\u2019ve got your first company getting launched. Could you remind us what kind of investments that you\u2019re making in this? What kind of returns you\u2019re expecting? And this really does sound something more than just a proxy for R&D? Jim Lico : Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re really excited about it. We\u2019ve built a very good relationship with them in the team. You know, what it really is, as we agree on an idea generation process, we devote, we have a number of Fortive people that work at the lab alongside the PSL team, we generate ideas, we find an idea that we want to invest in, we invest in it, we have a couple of different milestones where we can decide if we want to bring that in or continue to invest in it. And at a certain point in time, we draw conclusion as to whether or not we want to own it or necessarily do something that you know obviously do something and take it out. And I think, you know, I think the economics are good for both parties and we feel very good about the relationship. So still very early days. They bring a lot of great entrepreneurship, fast cycle product development, lots of software experience. I think we\u2019ve been \u2013 I think they\u2019ve been very enthusiastic in the level and quality of talent that we brought to the table. But still very early days, as we said, we\u2019ve launched one team and hopefully we\u2019ll, you know, we\u2019ll continue to have, you know, a number of wins and you know, that we can put on \u2013 put up over the next few years. Deane Dray : Well these businesses be spun out, sold with other synergies within core Fortive. Just maybe kind of explain how the company benefits from this overall? Jim Lico : Yeah, I think it could be all the above, it could be a great idea that really benefits Fortive and we see a way to spin that in and we\u2019ve got economics associated with that, so that, you know, we can spin it in and bring it and make it part of Fortive. But we also have the economics if it\u2019s a great idea, but that isn\u2019t necessarily that would be something consistent with what Fortive wants to become. And ultimately, we would, you know, we would decide to do something to spin that out as well. So, there are a number of options, we \u2013 I think we\u2019ve got good flexibility as to the kinds of ideas and what is sort of in our strike zone. But also obviously, if there\u2019s ideas that have maybe utilize Fortive technology, but don\u2019t necessarily mix with what we want to do and become, then ultimately we\u2019ll try to find other ways to create value and spinning it out and building something, you know, in a different in a different structure. Deane Dray : Got it? And just as a second question, I want to go back to this structure of these four groups that you\u2019ve set up. And just, Jim a few minutes ago, you said that you\u2019re really not looking to commit capital necessarily into groups III and IV, except on those situations where you\u2019re getting higher returns. But once you start saying you\u2019re not investing further in M&A for those businesses, it kind of opens up the question that there might be some non-core businesses opportunities to exit. I know you\u2019ve got some Vontier businesses there already. And those decisions have been announced. But are there businesses in Group III and IV that might be considered non-core? Jim Lico : Well, you know, no, I think when \u2013 what I meant with that answer is, you know, one of the things that we love about that grouping is, I think it gave everybody a good perspective of how, you know, it was meant \u2013 really meant to show the sequencing of how our parts of our businesses would perform and mirror, sort of the resiliency and dynamics of COVID and the economic consequences of COVID. So it\u2019s really a framework for that, as you know, a number of our businesses are really built with portions of group I, II, III, and IV all together. So, you know, just take an example, like Fluke, as we said before, you know, a good chunk of Fluke is in Group I and II is in I and II. So and increasingly becoming a growing part of that. So I don\u2019t think it necessarily says that our individual businesses are necessarily going to be, you know, not invested in, but what we\u2019re going to find in a number of our businesses, within our businesses or within our operating companies, probably the best words is we\u2019re finding those opportunities to build more resilient, more durable, more higher growth aspects of the business and that\u2019s where, you know, we\u2019ll probably end up having more of our investments. So as Fluke is a good example. You know, we bought eMaint, we bought PRUFTECHNIK, but we also bought Landauer. So we, you know, a good chunk of that capital that we deployed into Fluke in the last few years has been to add those Is and IIs to the core Fluke business. I think we have those same opportunities for some of the parts of group III and IV, that we can also do, you know, even within Sensing Tech, some of the things we talked about that are driving the growth there and Environmental Monitoring as another example, those are places where we\u2019re investing in those businesses, because those parts of the businesses really have Group II and Group I aspects to them. Deane Dray : That was helpful. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Hi, good evening. Jim Lico : Hey, John. John Walsh : Hey. So a lot of ground covered. I guess, just thinking about the SaaS businesses. Was there any discernible change positive or negative across them as it relates to customer retention rates? I think that might be the best way to ask the question versus kind of thinking about net adds? But however you kind of want to answer it\u2019s helpful. Jim Lico : Yeah, we really \u2013 the key metric we look at John is net retention and that combined sort of not churning customers, keeping current customers and that metric is really in all of our SaaS businesses improved in that metric in the quarter. So it\u2019s a key metric we keep an eye on, we actually review those metrics with the board. And every board meeting, they\u2019re so important. So I think we feel very good about the work the team is doing on all those metrics. And there\u2019s still lots of them, you know, certainly improvement to get in some of our businesses are kind of at benchmark, some of them still have some ways to go. So we where it\u2019s a continued focus for a lot of our FBS tools as well within those businesses. John Walsh : Great, thank you. And then just maybe a point of clarification around Telematics and the new platform, has that actually launched or is that something you expect to launch here in the back half? Jim Lico : I think it\u2019ll launch now and now we\u2019re starting to get some traction. So call it, you know, in the early stages of launch. John Walsh : Great, thank you. I\u2019ll pass it along. Appreciate the color. Jim Lico : All right, thanks, John. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey, guys you know everything kind of picked over, but I have one last one that I wanted to squeeze in is, you know on your comment that you saw some strong demand for Industrial Imaging Products within the Fluke business. You know, some of your competitors kind of in that niche vertical, are seeing, you know, really strong demand and exponential growth as it relates to skin temperature cameras. Is this a \u2013 is that what you guys were referencing and, you know, can you just comment more on that, that\u2019s you know, an area that could see our outsized growth within PI? Jim Lico : Yeah, Andrew you know, our principal business there is Thermal Imaging and Temperature Measurements so it ranges from all the imaging line as - Thermal Imagers as well as literally IR guns and thermometers. So yeah that business is doing well. And it also has a number of new entrepreneurial opportunities that we\u2019re working on that do sort of fold into some of the challenges that happen in facilities relative to COVID-19. So we think this, we mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks that we\u2019re excited about a broader strategy here, we\u2019ve got some people counting business that is a part of an acquisition we had a few years ago, that we\u2019re building a solution out that we\u2019ve launched. So a number of things that we\u2019ve got going and we\u2019ll see how it goes and whether it\u2019s sort of a, you know, whether that you know, we really think the resiliency and durability that we might be able to build here is beyond just COVID-19 and we\u2019re excited to try to build on that here in the coming quarters. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay, got it. Thanks, guys. Jim Lico : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : The next question will come from the line of John Inch with Gordon. Jim Lico : Hey, John. Operator : John, your line is open \u2013 it must be muted \u2013 John Inch : Hello, can you hear me? Jim Lico : Can now. John Inch : Oh, you can hear me now. Okay, great. Sorry about that, technology, right? Hey, I was wondering, given Chuck, you inferred you\u2019ve kind of your comments about North America is getting better and so forth. Is the implication that just is the impact from COVID flaring up and surging in the southern states in California or that you are seeing, you know, impact but that other aspects of the business are superseding that, like how to think about this, because, you know, what you\u2019re describing isn\u2019t that dissimilar from other industrial companies. So I\u2019m just curious kind of what you\u2019re seeing on ground, kind of regionally and how that plays out? Jim Lico : I would say the biggest place, the two biggest places, John, where we see COVID impact relative to call it, daily stuff or maybe the three places is really in the hospitals and sterilization procedures that we described a little while ago, it\u2019s getting Matco equipment in the ground, or sorry, getting GVR equipment in the ground and really the Matco ability to call on customers every day. So I think as we look through, and those are big US businesses as well. So, you know, those are kind of COVID related. The point-of-sale, stuff at Fluke is really economic related. You want to see you know better PMI, better IP numbers so and that\u2019s probably a global point for Fluke, but so what we\u2019re really watching for is, you know, the surgery numbers, the ability to not go back into lockdown. As we mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, the lockdown really impacted Matco. April was, you know, was a really tough month. But as soon as things started to open up, it accelerated back to what we would normally call a pretty resilient business, quite frankly, historically relative to economic cycles. And I think I saw today that car \u2013 average car ownership years is that of the highest point it\u2019s ever been which is a good thing for Matco. So I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re watching for. We don\u2019t want to see hospitals close back down. We don\u2019t want to say \u2013 see cities get back into lockdown mode where they won\u2019t be \u2013 where auto repair shops aren\u2019t open or that, you know, construction can\u2019t occur and sites can\u2019t be upgraded at Gilbarco \u2013 for Gilbarco. John Inch : Yeah, now that makes sense. And then just maybe as a follow-up, Jim, how are you thinking about kind of strategically further M&A? And I ask it in the context of, is this going to be somewhat contingent on the volunteer separation and getting that dividend from volunteer to do the reload and lower the debt to cap or debt to EBITDA thresholds back again or are the two somewhat disassociated in terms of the tracks? I.e., one does not necessarily contingent on the other? Jim Lico : Well, I think first and foremost, you know, we always said this year would be a bolt-on \u2013 more likely a bolt-on year because of digesting a number of things that we did last year as well. And I think that\u2019s been our thesis, although you never can be \u2013 we\u2019ve looked at some fairly sizable things. So, you know, I think at the end of the day we\u2019ve continued to be busy. I think there continues to be a couple of things that are impacting the M&A market. I know some of our peers have talked about this. One is the bid-ask spreads are still not in alignment necessarily. It\u2019s hard to distinguish the COVID impact from things and that takes sometimes an additional quarter two that results to work through with a seller. The second piece of it, it\u2019s just harder to do due diligence, right. We can\u2019t get on site in many cases, we can\u2019t meet people. And so I think things are slower by nature of those two aspects. And then \u2013 but I think we\u2019ve been busy, we continue to think that there\u2019s opportunity, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that it\u2019s tied to the Vontier separation. But you know, because of the fact that really, we never were really tying those things together to begin with. But certainly Vontier certainly when we complete the Vontier transaction, it certainly gives us, you know, more firepower and more opportunity. John Inch : By the way, just when you say bigger, do you mean bigger bolt-on or you mean bigger than something \u2013 Jim Lico : Yeah, no, it means \u2013 it means some things that were bigger. I mean, we haven\u2019t necessarily said we\u2019re not going to do anything, because, you know, there are certain things that we\u2019ve been cultivating for several years. And we, you know, we can\u2019t say, hey, do you mind, you know, selling at a different time. So, you know, things are going to sell when they\u2019re going to sell and we have to be responsive to that. But, you know, we\u2019re obviously taking into account the economic conditions and all the things that might impact returns. So it\u2019s a complicated answer, hence, maybe too many words here. But I think at the end of the day, we\u2019re focused on making sure we can create value in a focused, prioritized way that probably ends up being more bolt-ons than not, but we are \u2013 we do have our ear to the railroad if there\u2019s other opportunities. John Inch : Appreciate it, it\u2019s complicated time. So thanks very much. Jim Lico : Yeah. Thanks, John. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Scott Graham : Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking my question on the overtime here. I just wanted to ask two questions. You told us that price was up 70 basis points was \u2013 were materially lower than that. Were you positive on the price cost side? Chuck McLaughlin : Hey, Scott. Yes is this the short answer and there\u2019s a good \u2013 we have our teams procurement professionals and they do a heck of job every year and this is no different. Scott Graham : Got you. And then the second one is the group III and group IV. So the sales on those businesses you know, a little bit heavier. And the second quarter was kind of all about lockdowns and people were doing break and fix, you know, as needed, which tends to be higher margin type of sale. So I\u2019m just wondering, was that the case for you guys in the quarter \u2013 in the second quarter sort of the as needed stuff, which maybe help enrich the mix, particularly in PI? Or was that not the case, because I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s maybe a headwind two quarters from now? Jim Lico : No, not at all. You know, I think when we look at what, you know, really, we have a very tight margin spread in our product lines. This is the power of FBS, quite frankly. So we don\u2019t necessarily distinguish that the price, the price metric is really has to do with the fact that, you know, as we said, from time, time to time that, you know, our high valued brands are critical at these times, you know, for everyone. And so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m looking across the groups right now and trying to think of where I could point to, where I could think of a margin, you know, situation that might be different from what I just commented and I can\u2019t find one. So I think you know, well, you know, more consumables is obviously higher margin, more, you know, more Matco is higher margin. So, you know, number, obviously, the software businesses are high margin, but there\u2019s some of our newer businesses, so they don\u2019t necessarily represent the highest operating profit margin. So I think, as our core businesses come back that, in some respects you might suggest is certainly a help as we look at margin expansion in the \u2013 you know, over the next year or so. Scott Graham : Understood. Nice quarter. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thank you, Scott. Chuck McLaughlin : Thank you. Jim Lico : Well, I think that concludes it, everybody thanks so much for going over time with us. We appreciate it. I know it\u2019s a challenging time for everyone. I hope that your families are safe and your \u2013 and work is going well for all of you as we all try to manage the challenges of working virtually. We certainly are incredibly proud of the work we\u2019ve done. I couldn\u2019t say enough about our 25,000 employees around the world who\u2019ve just done an incredible job that making Fortive just have a very strong quarter, but more importantly, building the business for what we envision in the years to come. So thanks for taking the time with us and we look forward to the calls. Obviously everybody\u2019s available for calls afterwards. Thanks, have a great evening. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Fortive Corporation's third quarter 2020 earnings results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Griffin Whitney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Whitney, you may begin your conference. Griffin Whitney : Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on the call. With us today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by SEC Regulation G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.fortive.com, under the heading, Financial Information. We completed the divestiture of the Automation and Specialty Business on October first, 2018 and accordingly have included the results of the A&S Business as discontinued operations for historical periods. The results presented on this call are based on continuing operations. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. All references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-over-year on a continuing operations basis. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate, will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks Griffin and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter results as strong execution across the portfolio delivered a topline performance that was significantly better than our initial guidance as well as a return to year-over-year growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share. For the quarter, we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.94, an 8% increase year-over-year. While the operating environment remained challenging in Q3, we continued to successfully navigate the near-term headwinds. By leveraging the Fortive Business System, we increased core operating margins by 160 basis points and generated another quarter of strong free cash flow while prioritizing growth investments across our portfolio to drive continued share gains. On October 9, we completed the successful spin-off of Vontier Corporation, a global industrial technology company focused on mobility infrastructure. I am extremely proud of the effort and the focus shown by our team throughout the year leading up to the separation and I am very excited about the future opportunities that lie ahead for both companies. The ability to maintain our readiness and execute this complex transaction despite the obvious challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of our people and the power of FBS. As separate companies, Fortive and Vontier are both well-positioned to execute against their strategic priorities to generate increasing value for all our stakeholders. With the spin-off of Vontier complete, Fortive is well-positioned as a provider of essential technologies for connected workflow solutions across a range of attractive end-markets. We have strong established positions with leading brands that benefit from long term secular growth drivers and have opportunities to increase recurring revenue. We have a long track record of disciplined capital allocation, significant balance sheet capacity and free cash flow and substantial opportunities for both organic investment and strategic M&A across the portfolio. Most importantly, we have the Fortive Business System, the cornerstone of our culture and an enduring source of competitive advantage that underpins our commitment to continuous improvement. Since Vontier was part of Fortive throughout the third quarter, the financial results that we will discuss today include the Vontier businesses. However, because Vontier will be reporting their third quarter results on Thursday, on today's call, we will focus our commentary on the businesses that remain with Fortive. Also, the guidance that we provide today will be for Fortive's continuing operations only. With that, let's turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $338.5 million, up 8.8% from the prior year and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.94. Total sales increased 2.3% to $1.9 billion, with core revenue essentially flat, reflecting significant sequential improvement from the prior quarter. Acquisitions contributed 220 basis points of growth and favorable foreign currency exchange rates increased growth by 20 basis points. Adjusted gross margins were 51.8% in the third quarter, increasing 50 basis points year-over-year. Gross margins benefited from 50 basis points of price, the growing contribution of our higher margin software businesses and disciplined supply chain execution. We also generated 160 basis points of core operating margin expansion, resulting in an adjusted operating profit margin of 22.7% for the quarter. Our ability to drive strong core OMX despite the significant ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic reflected the solid execution of our teams and the disciplined application of FBS. We continue to effectively manage the business through this uncertain environment, flexing cost actions as needed while also investing in our strategic product development and innovation priorities to position us well for the future. During the third quarter, we generated $455 million of free cash flow, representing conversion of 134% of adjusted net earnings and an increase of 31% year-over-year. This performance took our year-to-date free cash flow up to approximately $1.1 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 48%. Despite a challenging environment over the past few quarters, our operating companies continue to use FBS to manage their working capital effectively in the short term, increasing inventory turns and limiting the headwinds from the sequentially improving topline. Turning to our segments. Professional instrumentation posted a total revenue increase of 0.9%, despite a 3.5% decline in core revenue. Acquisitions contributed 370 basis points, while favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 70 basis points. Core operating margin increased 90 basis points, resulting in segment-level adjusted operating margin of 22.8%. Industrial technologies performed well in Q3, driven in particular by the North American businesses of both Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Matco. Total revenue increased 4.5%, including a 5.5% increase in core revenue. Core operating margin increased 290 basis points, resulting in segment-level adjusted operating margin of 25.9%. On slide nine of today's presentation, we show the region-by-region breakdown for the third quarter. Note that the growth rates shown on the slide reflect consolidated Fortive Q3 growth, which includes the results of the Vontier businesses. That said, we will focus our operating company color primarily on the businesses that remain with Fortive. In Asia, core revenue declined low single digits despite mid single digit growth in China. Strength in China was broad based, highlighted by mid-teens year-over-year growth at Fluke, double digit growth at advanced sterilization products and greater than 20% growth in Sensing. Western Europe core revenue declined mid single digits in Q3, highlighted by low double-digit growth at ASP. ASP has reported year-over-year growth in each quarter of 2020 thus far, driven by solid sales execution. Accruent also delivered a strong quarter in Western Europe led by Meridian, its engineering information management solution, reflecting the momentum the company has built in the region. While point-of-sale remained negative for both Fluke and Tektronix, the point-of-sale trend improved throughout the quarter and revenue at these businesses increased mid teens versus the prior quarter. North America core revenue grew low single digits in Q3, showing broad-based sequential improvement versus Q2. Growth in North America was led by a strong quarter for the Vontier businesses. At new Fortive, a number of the software businesses continued to perform well with growth across Intelex, eMaint and Censis. Industrial Scientific's iNet business and Qualitrol also performed well. As in Western Europe, Fluke and Tektronix saw improving point-of-sale trends, though still negative as we turn the corner into Q4. In recent quarters, we have laid out a framework for analyzing our portfolio with businesses organized into groups based on the relative sensitivity to pandemic-driven disruption and resulting deterioration in end-market demand. On slide 10 of today's presentation, we show the portfolio of groupings with an emphasis on the new Fortive portfolio. As shown on slide 11, the relative performance of these groups largely played out as expected in the quarter. Group I, which represented approximately 20% of new Fortive revenue in Q3, continued to show significant resilience, posting low single digit growth. The group's performance again reflected a solid contribution from the software businesses, highlighted by high single digit growth at Intelex, which is seeing continued robust growth in North America and is benefiting from the successful execution of the company's expansion into Western Europe. Elsewhere, Censis posted low single digit growth, underpinned by the momentum of its SaaS offerings. Accruent also benefited from the resilience of its SaaS business, which increased slightly in the quarter with continued growth in annual recurring revenue based on improving churn and increased net retention. Fluke industrial imaging had another strong quarter, although its growth moderated as some of the initial COVID-related demand began to level off. Gordian saw slowing in project work among state and local governments and higher education customers, leading to a low single digit decline for the quarter. Meanwhile, despite continued strong order flow, EMC registered a mid-teen decline due to certain COVID-related supply chain issues and some customer delays. Group II, which represented approximately 32% of new Fortive revenue in Q3, recorded a low single digit decline. ISC's iNet subscription business posted a high single digit growth, while Fluke Health Solutions showed mid single digit growth driven by ventilator tester tailwinds and support from Landauer's high recurring revenue business model. ASP reported a mid single digit decline due to a mid single digit decline in North America and pressure in Japan, which saw a resurgence of COVID cases and an associated reduction in elective procedures. However, we were very pleased to see this partially offset by strong growth in both China and Western Europe in the quarter. We now estimate that elective procedures in the U.S. are back to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels and are back to approximately 95% in both China and Europe. Group III, which represented approximately 12% of new Fortive in Q3, saw a high single digit decline in the quarter. While the Sensing portfolio declined by mid single digits, this represented sequential improvement versus the second quarter. Semiconductors and electronics continued to be a bright spot for Sensing, which also benefited from COVID-related tailwinds in medical end-markets. Elsewhere in Group III, Accruent's professional services and licenses business lines saw an ongoing negative impact from continued delays in accessing customer sites. Group IV, which represented approximately 36% of new Fortive Q3 revenue, declined by high single digits in the quarter but saw a meaningful sequential improvement and performed ahead of our forecast. Both Fluke Industrial and the Tektronix Instruments business saw broad-based sequential improvement. Fluke Industrial decreased by low single digits, paced by Fluke Calibration, which registered mid single digit growth. The performance of the Tek Instruments business was highlighted by Keithley, which recorded mid single digit year-over-year growth. The business also saw improved order activity as the quarter progressed, including initial orders for the new six and eight channel versions of the 6-series oscilloscope. While we are encouraged by what we saw at both Fluke Industrial and the Tektronix Instruments business in the third quarter, we remain watchful of key macro trends as we continue to work our way toward a return to year-over-year growth at both businesses. Since the end of the second quarter, we have continued to reduce our net debt with our strong free cash flow and the proceeds received from the Vontier separation. Including the recent proceeds from Vontier, our net debt is now approximately $2.8 billion, down from over $5.1 billion at the end of 2019. As we look ahead, we expect to continue to generate solid free cash flow, which will enable us to reduce our net debt further. We also expect to monetize our remaining 19.9% stake in Vontier in a tax-efficient manner, with timing subject to market conditions. While Q3 saw a continuation of the better operating performance that started as the economic lockdowns lifted back in the spring, we remain watchful of macro conditions in light of the continued fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q4, we expect the total revenue will increase zero to 3% on a year-over-year basis. We also expect to deliver incremental margins of approximately 35%. Finally, we are planning to execute approximately $30 million of strategic productivity initiatives before the end of the year, in line with our prior expectation that some of the temporary actions we executed early in the year would be made permanent as we turn the corner into 2021. Now that the Vontier spin-off is complete, on slide 12 of the presentation, you will see that we have organized the portfolio into three segments which we will provide the basis for our financial reporting going forward. The resegmentation highlights the strong position we have assembled to provide essential technologies for connected workflow solutions across a range of attractive end-markets. This view also helps to frame how we think about our portfolio from the perspective of both organic and inorganic opportunities. Details on the segments are as follows. The Intelligent Operating Solutions segment includes Fluke, Industrial Scientific, Intelex, Accruent and Gordian and represents approximately 40% of new Fortive total revenue. This segment provides solutions to accelerate field and facility safety, reliability and productivity as well as operating intelligence to a range of end users and addresses a total available market of greater than $15 billion. Precision Technologies segment includes Tektronix, Pacific Scientific EMC and the Sensing businesses, which will now also include Qualitrol and represent approximately 35% of new Fortive total revenue. This segment provides mission-critical technologies that enable our customers to accelerate the development of innovative products and solutions and addresses a total available market of greater than $10 billion. The Advanced Healthcare Solutions segment includes Advanced Sterilization Products, Fluke Health Solutions, Censis and Invetech and represents approximately 25% of new Fortive total revenue. This segment provides solutions that enhance patient safety, prevent hospital infections, deliver operating efficiencies and accelerate healthcare system innovation and addresses a total available market of greater than $5 billion. Importantly, we will report on this basis from the fourth quarter onward and plan to issue supplemental financial information in the coming weeks that aligns with this resegmented view of the portfolio so that you can rebase your models. Before we wrap up, I want to quickly express my appreciation to the Fortive and Vontier teams for their continued effort and strong execution in 2020. This has undoubtedly been an extremely difficult year, but our performance in the third quarter highlighted once again how our team continues to rise and meet the challenge. With the strong support of FBS, we managed to complete our final preparations for the spin-off of Vontier while also navigating the challenging macro environment to deliver improved topline performance and another quarter of strong free cash flow. While we face an uncertain environment in the near term, we will continue to benefit from the increasingly resilient portfolio that we have established through our efforts to continue to transform the portfolio over the last four years. With our consistent free cash flow, strong M&A pipeline and an expanding set of organic innovation capabilities, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the many opportunities ahead of us. With that, I would like to turn it over to Griffin. Griffin Whitney : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Erica, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Jim Lico : Good evening Jeff. Jeff Sprague : [indiscernible]. Jim Lico : Jeff, we having a tough time hearing you. Jeff Sprague : That any better? Jim Lico : Yes. Jeff Sprague : Sorry about that. Can you just help triangulate us on full year free cash flow for Fortive RemainCo? Kind of what our starting base is? And whether or not there's anything really unusual on working capital or other items that would kind of hinder our ability to grow off that base? Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks Jeff. As you probably noted, it's another strong quarter in Q3 for both companies, I think for both Vontier and Fortive. The simple answer is no, I don't think there's anything that will hinder us going forward. It's been pretty strong. Year-to-date, I think the combined company's free cash flow, I know they are up about 48%. But I think the split going forward, if you think of it, it's a bit of trailing year-to-date or trailing 12, it's about 60-40 split here and I think that's probably a good proxy going forward. Jeff Sprague : So roughly 60% of what we saw year-to-date, we can attribute to the RemainCo? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes. Yes, is the answer I am trying to say. Obviously, there's some things that are improving throughout the year, but they will be offsetting some of the deal cost and headwinds associated with the separation cost. So that's a pretty good number to use. Jeff Sprague : And then just on the productivity and restructuring actions. Are those actually restructuring charges per se? Or is this just kind of a more operational move against some costs to make permanent some of the actions you have taken earlier in the year? Chuck McLaughlin : These will be called out as a separate restructuring when we report Q4. Jim Lico : And Jeff, I would think of those as really in two buckets. One would be the, I think what we have done is, we have done an incredible job this year on digital transformation, allowing us to do a number of things. So a part of that will be sort of leases and a reconfiguration of our sort of real estate footprint around the world. And then the rest of it is sort of, what I would say, our cost actions that we are taking around the portfolio where we think things may not necessarily come back faster or in places where we want to make sure we are protecting investments for next year. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks. I will pass it on. Jim Lico : Thanks Jeff. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Your next question in queue is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good evening guys. Jim Lico : Hi Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So just a couple of questions. I guess first, just on the pace of near term activity. Obviously, buckets three and four are still under some pressure here. We have seen a lot of short-cycle industrial markets start to improve a decent amount sequentially. Obviously, some of that here as well. But how important is just kind of flipping the calendar in terms of resetting budgets or thinking about inventory positions? Just trying to think about what gets these things kind of back on the map versus where we are today? Jim Lico : Yes. Well, first I will maybe take one note that you made. I think we feel, from a standpoint of where we have channel inventory and that's probably in the three big places would be Fluke, Tektronix and to some extent, ASP. We feel good about channel inventories and where those are at. So we don't think we necessarily will see any issues relative to inventory in the channel that could be a hindrance to growing through the remaining part of the year and into next year. So that's really a small part of it. I think we are continuing to look at three things to really drive the business sequentially here through the year and certainly into next year, Josh. They really fall into this bucket. Certainly, as you pointed out, short cycle, some improvements at PMI, some improvements in industrial production to see those continue and maybe to be a little bit more broad-based globally. Secondly, elective procedures. We have seen some nice improvement from Q2 to Q3. When does that continue to improve? I think right now, we don't have a belief necessarily that those numbers that I quoted in the prepared remarks necessarily change too much in the short run. But we are certainly watching that, particularly around the world, to see how those go. And then I would say the third thing is how much of return to work, what shutdowns occur, those kinds of things, that has some impact really on how we get on to customer sites to do things, whether it be on some of our software businesses where we are doing service businesses on-site. Some of that has been slowed. Some of the customer decision-making has been slowed. So I think we are looking to some of those things to see if those start to improve. So I think those are the three big things we are probably continuing to keep an eye on. We think the business will continue to sequentially improve. But I think the inflection point, the big inflection point really happened from Q2 to Q3. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just shifting more strategically now that the Vontier separations behind, you can start thinking about future M&A with a reloaded balance sheet. I guess just with the new segmentation. The segment that sticks out on a pro forma basis looks like Precision Technologies. I mean I think in the other two, the whole workflow solutions portfolio pieces seems to come through in the various key parts, maybe not as much in that piece. How should we think about that in terms of M&A priorities? Would it be to kind of shore up some more of that end-to-end solution in that piece of the business or to continue building on the other two where you already have some good momentum going? Jim Lico : Yes. Well, obviously, we like the momentum we have created in the two, so every intention of maintaining that momentum, as you highlighted. I think as we think about Precision Technologies, we really certainly see Tektronix and what they do in a workflow around product development and innovation and we see a number of vectors and opportunities. I think the team did a wonderful job this year in their strategic plan, really highlighting some of those opportunities. So we are certainly looking in that way. And then we think about Sensing and we really have a broad view of really maybe not necessarily a huge workflow, but we can play differently in the workflow, whether it be with IoT-enabled sensors, whether it be maybe a little bit bigger part of the solution, like in Anderson-Negele where we now have a digital recorder that can really do more of the verification work. So we are certainly seeing a slightly bigger solution that we can play in, in Sensing Tech and I think that's where the opportunities will be. And then obviously, I think Tek does play in a workflow that's pretty well-defined. So I think we really believe that when we look out and you obviously heard the numbers in terms of total available market space, we really think there's a number of opportunities for us to continue to work on, quite frankly, the places where we are at today and just expand upon them, both inorganically but also organically. Josh Pokrzywinski : Perfect. Thanks for the color. Jim Lico : Thanks Josh. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Good evening guys. Jim Lico : Good evening Scott. Chuck McLaughlin : Hi Scott. Scott Davis : You seem to have snapped back pretty quickly. It's nice to see. Good work there. But I don't know if you want to take a stab at this, Jim. But do you think Fluke Industrial has a chance of actually crossing into the positive territory in 4Q? Jim Lico : Well, there is a little bit of way to get there. But certainly, we like the trends. We announced a few product launches that are going to be part of Q4. We now have a thermometer that has a clinical nature to it, which we have got EAU on, so I think that. We have got a new imager out. So I think that when we look at Fluke Industrial, we had a great quarter in China, as an example, where I would say the market is pretty good and we have just done a better job of taking advantage of that market. I would like to see the markets continue to improve in places like the U.S. I think Fluke Industrial has a good shot in the U.S. Europe may be a little bit more mixed. And high-growth markets may be a little bit more mixed. So I think overall, Fluke Industrial is going to continue to improve. I think the U.S. will look good, Scott. I think maybe some of the other markets around the world, non-China, I think there's still some questions about what the macro is going to look like in some of those parts of the world between now and the end of the year. Scott Davis : That makes sense. And another one on the topic of China. Do you have a sense, Jim, whether the recovery there is still accelerating? Or did we snap back and now we are at kind of a plateau and so the rest of the world really has to contribute for us to take another step-up? Jim Lico : Yes. We had a really. new Fortive had a very good quarter. As we said, double digit growth in ASP and Sensing was almost 20%, I think, Fluke, obviously, double digits. So that's pretty broad-based from healthcare to industrial to OEM. I suspect, Scott, that a little bit of that was a snapback from maybe what happened in the first part of the year. But we still see growth there. And I think the world, whether the next level of growth come, they are obviously stimulating that economy. I think what we are continuing to watch is, obviously, if other part of the world stimulates their economies, that maybe provides some impetus to catch up. But I think China probably still leads the pack here through the remaining part of the year. Scott Davis : Okay. Really helpful. Thanks. Good luck guys. Jim Lico : Yes. Thanks Scott. Operator : Your next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good evening. Chuck McLaughlin : Good evening Julian. Julian Mitchell : Maybe a first question on the margin outlook. So your guide on slide 14 for that 35% incremental. Just wondered if that's a good placeholder looking out beyond the fourth quarter? You are doing some cost-out measures in Q4. I wondered if you could frame how large the opportunity is for cost reduction with a sort of simpler portfolio without Vontier today? And any major puts and takes on temporary cost reversals or big fixed cost-out next year. Chuck McLaughlin : So Julian, I think we would think of it this way. First of all, we are a long way from guiding the topline, which is the biggest number here in Q2. What we are trying to signal is, the 35% incremental margins is how we are going to run the business. Of course, assuming we move into positive territory next year, that will come back at better than 35% margins. But we have got some headwinds of the temporary cost that will snap back in as well. And these productivity initiatives that we have put in place, we think, gives us the latitude under a number of scenarios to manage to the 35% incremental margins. The last piece of the equation will be, depending on what the topline does, we will be pacing our reinvestment back into the business. But we like the 35% because it lets you know this is what we are trying to manage the business to. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then maybe a follow-up just on the M&A appetite today. I think you called out that $2.8 billion as sort of real-time leverage. So maybe help us understand how quickly you want to get to work on acquisitions? And just clarify the extent to which that's contingent on monetizing the 20% Vontier stake. Jim Lico : Yes. Julian, it's Jim. I think really, we have tried to not really ever slow down our effort. I think we have tried to remain disciplined. We said at the beginning of the year that we would probably be mostly a bolt-on kind of, just pre-COVID, be a bolt-on kind of year. We obviously announced anything but I think we have been busy through the year. We have looked at a number of things. I think we have remained disciplined in that regard. I think our appetite to continue to accelerate the businesses through M&A is always something we are trying to do. I think we are very comfortable with the funnels that we have created. I think the new segment structure will really helps us understand and articulate really a vision for each one of those segments that I think is exciting for companies that are interested in maybe selling themselves. So I think we are in a very good place relative to where we are at strategically from an M&A execution standpoint in terms of readiness. And obviously, the balance sheet is in much better shape in order to give us these opportunities. And we will be in continued good shape given where we are at, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, not only with the continued free cash flow but obviously with the opportunity with the Vontier stake as well. So I think we are in a very good position right now for M&A as we look into the fourth quarter and into 2021. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Jim Lico : Hi Steve. Steve Tusa : Hi guys. How's it going? Jim Lico : Good. Steve Tusa : Just on your software businesses, do you have a kind of a look into, A, kind of how big just those standalone software businesses are now? And then could you give us an idea of what bookings as well as retention rate is and how those were kind of trending? Those two things? Jim Lico : So software revenue now is about low teens. So think of it that way in a number. And I don't know, it's going to vary a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But low teens is probably the right number. I don't have the bookings number in front of me, Steve. But if we think about SaaS bookings, they were pretty good in the quarter. I would say probably in the range of mid single digits probably. And net retention was over 100%. We had our best net retention number of the year and so through the quarter. So we feel good about net retention. It's a little harder today, if you think about the components of net retention. Things like upselling and cross-selling, take a little longer in this environment, in a COVID environment. So renewals take a little bit longer. So we are seeing some of these things move out in the funnel. So some bookings will move around a little bit more. The funnel is taking longer to close. But I think that's why we keep such a good eye on that net retention number because it's so important to us. So having a number that's the best of the year and better from a year ago and certainly better than a year ago is just, I think, a testament to how we have used the Fortive Business System around the various components of software business to continue to make sure that we are driving the business even in a really, obviously, in a challenging environment. Steve Tusa : And then what was total revenue growth for that bucket of revenue? Jim Lico : I think we were roughly, for all the software businesses, all up, we were roughly flattish. And the SaaS businesses, we are mid single digit. Steve Tusa : Okay. That's fair. Jim Lico : So what happens is, the SaaS parts are mid single digits. What's the more challenging part is the on-site services, professional services. That's the part of the business right now that's lagging. And that's just a situation of, it's just harder to get on-site to do some of it. We are significantly better than we were in Q2 because of a number of the remote site work that we have developed in order to be able to do remote turn on. But we need to continue to do that. And then it's just taking longer with some customers. Steve Tusa : And what's the split of that revenue between like, what you would consider to be kind of recurring and the more transactional? Chuck McLaughlin : Steve, I think it's two-thirds, one-third roughly. Jim Lico : Two-thirds SaaS. Right. Steve Tusa : Right. So the two-thirds up kind of low to mid singles and then the stuff that's not recurring down, given the environment? Jim Lico : Yes. I mean, in some of the businesses, obviously, we vary from business-to-business. As we called out in the prepared remarks, we have got some businesses that are able to kind of push through that because their amount of on-site support is less. So we turn on faster, that kind of thing. Accruent is a business where we have a little bit more service than professional services and managed services than we do and maybe some of the other software businesses, as an example. Steve Tusa : Got it. And one last one. On those kind of on the more transactional stuff, what is the impact on margin? Is the recurring stuff higher margin? Or is the episodic stuff higher margin? I am trying to kind of read through some of these software reports? Jim Lico : Yes. Almost without exception, the SaaS businesses are higher margin. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thank you Steve. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hi. Yes. Good afternoon. Jim Lico : Good evening Andrew. Andrew Obin : Okay. Just a question, it's a COVID question. And just thinking about, A, your commentary about elective surgery and also sort of getting site access in software. How are you seeing sort of these businesses developing given that we sort of have more news flow about rising COVID cases into the fourth quarter? What kind of visibility do you have? And maybe you can give us some color on the trends in October for both? Thank you. Jim Lico : Yes. So on elective surgeries, the numbers we highlighted in the prepared remarks are about what we saw in October. So I don't think much difference. And quite frankly, we are not planning for those numbers to improve. So we don't need necessarily an improvement in things. And I do think relative to hospitals, as we have talked to large major hospital chains, particularly in the U.S. customers, I think they are much better prepared now for COVID in order to maintain procedures, whereas at the beginning of all this, they obviously weren't as prepared. So I think the hospital network today is much more prepared to continue to do elective procedures with the increase in COVID cases than they were in the second quarter. So we feel pretty good about the number we have. Obviously, it's impossible to predict the pandemic and that kind of thing. We are not going to get into that position. But I think we feel like we understand that. And we certainly have other scenarios. But I think our scenario that we have going forward is for that not to necessarily improve the remaining part of the year. Relative to getting on-site for customers, I think we are in a mode of not expecting any more on-sites. Really, what we are trying to deal with is really, we have assumed for pretty much since the middle of the summer that our customer set was just going to continue to take longer. So our offerings had to be more digital-oriented. We had to move our services organization to try to do more remote on-site support and we continue to do that. We have no expectation necessarily of needing people to get back to work anytime soon in order to sort of fulfill where we think things are at. And that's maybe the uncertainty that continues to remain. But we would love to see people getting back into some things that are normal. But we don't suspect that as between now and the end of the year. Andrew Obin : Well, it's good to hear and it's not good to hear. But it's good to hear in regards to your guidance. And just a follow-up question on Tektronix. Could you give some color by vertical in Tektronix, federal, semis? What are you guys seeing there? Thank you. Jim Lico : Yes. In the quarter, we had good auto. We had good semi. We had good Mil/Gov. I think Mil/Govs continued to be pretty good. And we saw what we would call consumer electronics was pretty good as well. So those sectors were pretty good. I would say sort of general industrial and it was probably the place where we saw maybe things not as good. But certainly, really, semiconductor was really driven at Keithley. The Keithley comment we made in the prepared remarks was really driven by semi. So I would say auto, semiconductor and Mil/Gov were the three segments that we saw positive growth in the quarter. Andrew Obin : Good to hear. Thank you so much. Jim Lico : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Hi. Good afternoon guys. Jim Lico : Hi Andy. Chuck McLaughlin : Hi Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Jim, how much of the slowdown that you saw at Gordian, do you think, is the temporary access issues that you talked about versus the pressure that you cited from state and local governments? And would you expect to see Group I that you talked about stay around that low single digit growth moving forward at least for the next few quarters? Jim Lico : Yes. There's a couple of drivers that would have helped Group I. One is, as we noted, our EMC business, which has just a tremendous backlog and has done a great job of securing new business, has really had some supply chain challenges driven by COVID. And some customer acceptance issues they have in terms of having customers come on-site to approve things has been a challenge. So I think if they had had even normal quarter, if you will, it probably would have boosted that group a couple of percentage points, probably, a couple of basis points. Relative to Gordian, I think we continue to think that it's probably a two-third, one-third issue relative to two-thirds on-site challenged, one-third state and local government, education budget kind of situation. I think obviously, those budgets are challenged. But in many cases, as you know, Andy, we don't play in the new construction aspects or the new building kind of part of this. This is really the renovation and operations part of facilities management. So we feel that that's going to continue as we start to get some, facilities still need to get some of these things done. So there will be some pressure in that for sure. So we are not suggesting that that's perfect. But we really do start our job order contracting business but generally with an on-site assessment. So I think that's a couple of quarters probably of challenges we continue to see where the pandemic goes. We were really pleased with our RSMeans Online business, which was up, I think, high single digits in the quarter. So, part of the business continues to do well from a customer engagement perspective, but the job order contracting business is the biggest piece. We think it's got some pressure for our outlook for at least a quarter or two here. Andy Kaplowitz : That's helpful Jim. And then you mentioned to Josh about sort of Sensing Tech opportunities. One of the big topics that I always get asked about is sort of digital transformation and what it can mean for companies. Are you seeing evidence because of COVID itself for the need for more sort of automation software in general and more conversations around some of your products that could drive growth as you go into 2021 and beyond? Jim Lico : Yes. I think a lot of what we have done in Sensing Tech around digital transformation has actually been on the innovation side. They have been one of the great users, if you will, or participants in a number of our growth accelerator innovation projects. I mentioned Anderson-Negele has a digital process recorder. That is all about workflow validation and then playing a bigger role in the digital world for their customers. And so that's a good example. Setra had a play with COVID of their airborne in negative pressure situations. They have an infection monitor, if you will or air monitor that they have been able to put into workflow, all around COVID. But it\u2019s also digitally helps these isolation rooms understand where they are at. So I think our sensor businesses, through the efforts they have had over a couple of years of broadening the work they want to do, not just be a sensor, but a little bit more of a solution, that's the work we have done for a couple of years. And I would say that that's starting to accelerate. Still small numbers though. I think if we were to look at what those numbers look like, I think it's probably, we would start to see the benefit of that with some scale, probably not until 2022. But we like the trajectory that those teams have really been and the traction those teams have really been getting in the last 12 months. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks Andy. Operator : Your next question is from Richard Eastman with Baird. Richard Eastman : Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Jim, could you just speak to ASP for a minute? And when you look at that business and how it performed in the quarter, down mid single digits, what was the composition of that? Was it replacements machine or equipment replacements down big and consumables starting to ramp back up? And when does this patient procedure number start to factor into their business? Can they have an up fourth quarter at ASP? Jim Lico : Yes. So there's definitely a story around the world. I think when we look at, as I said, none of the major regions, China, Western Europe or the U.S., had elective procedures back to 100%. And yet we had strong growth in China and Western Europe. Western Europe has had a good capital opportunity. So they have sort of seen more capital placements during a time when maybe consumables were actually not growing as much, but capital has made up for it. China, a little bit of the same story. We haven't seen as much of that in the U.S. And so, we see naturally that the U.S. is a little bit maybe farther behind in that regard. But I think we feel good. We had a good full year. Our biological indicator business was very good around the world. That's a part of the business that's fairly sizable. Obviously, terminal sterilization is the biggest piece. And it's really, at this point, I think, going to be more North American return. We think we can continue, we have seen some nice placements here recently. But they have a bigger part of their business is services and consumables. So I think we still need to see that sort of come back. I am not necessarily predicting that this year. But I think in 2021, we will start to see some of that improvements and some of the impact of some of those things, the placements that we have seen here recently. So we feel good about the business. We have done a number of things to get the business on track, as you well know. And I think it's on a good trajectory at this point. Richard Eastman : And you referenced to ASP when you spoke to the channel around Fluke and Tektronix. Is the channel and any inventory that might be in the channel, is that around consumables? Or is that around the equipment? Jim Lico : It's around consumables. And it's not a big number like Fluke and Tek. Fluke and Tek, as we know, is 40%, 50%, 60% of revenue is in distribution. It's not that number. But there are some aspect of channel inventory. That's why I referenced it. Richard Eastman : And just maybe bigger picture, as well. When you think about the equipment and instrument placements versus maybe the 30% of NewCo Fortive that's recurring or services, how did the overall instrument placement or equipment placements look in the third quarter relative to that consumable number or recurring number? Jim Lico : Yes. So one is, I think new Fortive is going to be approaching almost 40% in total recurring revenues. So just so you have that number, it's just shy of 40% at this point. So I think every quarter moves a little bit. I don't have the numbers handy. But I would say in general, we tend to think of the recurring revenue part of that business is about 80% of total versus capital. And within that 80% is consumables. Probably, two-thirds of the 80% and services is maybe a third. Richard Eastman : Okay. Jim Lico : And that number doesn't change radically quarter-to-quarter. So if it does, it really is sort of one particular customer. And I think it's always better to sort of think about that on a year-to-date basis, anyway. Richard Eastman : Okay. And just if I could sneak one more in, are you going to lay the SVP structure on top of the new segmentation? Is that the plan to manage? Jim Lico : Yes. We would. Yes. So we are obviously going to continue to rollout some color around the organization. But you could think of that as an organizational view as well. So, as you think about that structure, you can think about it as an organizational view as well. Richard Eastman : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Thanks again. Jim Lico : Thanks Rick. Operator : Your next question is from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Jim Lico : Hi John. John Walsh : Hi there. Good afternoon. I wanted to revisit incrementals on the fourth quarter and just come at the question a little bit differently. I think you guys have out-kicked what you were guiding this year there in terms of incrementals. But is there anything from a mix perspective or a need to reinvest in any of the product lines? Just because 35% would be a step down from where you have been in the last two quarters. Just trying to understand if there's a specific item or we are just a little bit conservative on topline trajectory. Chuck McLaughlin : We had uncertainty, I would say, coming into the third quarter where the topline would end up and it did come in better than what we built the cost structure around. And that's what you are seeing about why the incrementals are a little bit better. I think we are talking relatively smaller dollars compared to Q2, of course, in terms of the magnitude. But in Q4, some of those expenses will come back into our expense base as the topline recovers. But we are also trying to balance what we are seeing to deliver that 35% margin and continuing to invest as much as possible to spur growth and future success for our customers and our businesses. John Walsh : Got you. No, that makes sense. And then I guess just a mechanical question here around the remaining monetization of Vontier. As you monetize that, will there be any kind of announcements triggered as you monetize that position? And then maybe, how do we think about kind of the tax implications as you do that? I am not sure kind of, if you have a dollar cost basis in the stock when it's split off or if there's anything we need to think about as you monetize the remaining 20%. Chuck McLaughlin : Well, with the remaining 20%, as it sets up right now, assuming we do it in the next 12 months in our base case or sooner, we don't really have any tax implications there. It's set up as a tax-free spin or tax-free transaction. I think that the timing is, what we needed to do is, we need to spin the company. We need to have these earning calls, file these Qs. We want to get to the other side of the election and then we are going to let market dynamics dictate what the right timing is. And we will be upfront about that. But we need to probably get another month, probably get well past the election, I would guess, at least. But I would like to get it, hope to get it done in the first half of next year or sooner. John Walsh : Okay. Thank you. Take care. Jim Lico : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good evening everyone. Jim Lico : Good evening Deane. Deane Dray : I was hoping you could clarify where you stand on addressing stranded costs at RemainCo. I might have missed this. But it did sound like some of that $30 million repositioning had some footprint reductions which sound like taking out stranded costs. But if you could just start with that, please. Chuck McLaughlin : Yes. Deane, I wouldn't say that they are really addressing stranded cost per se. I think it's more, Jim talked about the digital transformation and the opportunities we are seeing for streamlining some of our operations and also setting us up for next year. We do have a smaller revenue at this point in time. But it's not related to empty buildings due to the split. It's more on, there are some leases and buildings that we are exiting there for sure. But it has more to do with how we see a different way to run these businesses given what we are calling the digital transformation. Deane Dray : Got it. And are there any shared services with Vontier that will be in existence? And if so, for how long? Chuck McLaughlin : There very few. Most of them completed before the end of this year. There's a few, as there were when we separated from Danaher, most notably around the tax agreements where we have to file taxes from this, just can't get away from that until for a long period of time. But I would say, minimal beyond the next two months. I think Dave and Mark has done a tremendous job building their organization. Deane Dray : Excellent. Just last one. Just when you were rattling off some of the quarter dynamics, did I hear PacSci EMC, there were some supplier issues? Was that company-specific? Or was there any systemic issue, a product shortage or anything like that? Jim Lico : Yes. No, I think we have dealt, we had some supply chain issues. I think that a lot of people talked about in Q2, Deane. We have mitigated and really did a great job. The supply chain team is really proud of the work they did in the quarter. Particularly, as you know, we continue to guide revenue up through the quarter. So we continue to see revenue coming in higher as we move through the quarter. And yet our on-time delivery metrics were good, our past due backlog. So it's really an issue that's very specific to really a couple of suppliers who had challenges in their own factories with COVID and with, as I said, the customer on-site work, which is just tougher to communicate and sort of coordinate, if you will, with a bunch of customers in a business where you need on-site approval before you ship to a customer. Deane Dray : Got it. Much appreciated. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks Deane. Have a great night. Deane Dray : You too. Operator : Your next question is from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Yes. Thanks very much. Hi everyone. Jim Lico : Hi John. John Inch : So a quick question on tax. Hi guys. You have one of the lowest tax rates amongst multi-companies. And I believe when you bought ASP, you did some tax structure reorganization favorably for the shareholder benefit. I am wondering if you guys have any preliminary thoughts on the proposed Democrat tax plans. I think they obviously clearly want to raise corporate taxes for everybody. But I think they have talked about going after GILTI taxes and other aspects of this as well. I am just curious if there are other levers, prospectively, that you could pull to kind of keep things as favorable as they have been in the past. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks John. Well, I think we are watching a number of things. And there are different scenarios and things that we can do that are potential countermeasures. But before we start thinking about, will they be able to offset any taxes that may or may not happen, we need to see exactly what they are going to change and what the timing is. And then remember, overlay it with what's happening in the rest of the world. We have got not quite half of our income and revenue outside there. And they are changing their taxes too. So we have to see how all that plays. It will be well into next year before we will really be able to have an opinion there about what it will actually do. John Inch : Okay. No, that's fair. Thanks Chuck. And then just as a quick follow-up. I found it actually interesting, it's not even ironic, that healthcare now has become a reporting segment or platform, which clearly wasn't the plan envisioned when Industrial Fortive was spun out of, call it, healthcare Danaher, right? And so my question is, do you see healthcare opportunities, Jim, in today's market with valuations pretty high? Do you see these opportunities being able to sort of expand this platform to become even something that's much bigger than perhaps we even envision today? Jim Lico : Yes. And I guess also part of your question is, boy, you got ASP at quite the value. But I think at the end of the day, we have now built a $1 billion platform in healthcare. And as you said, I think we have a very good position. Our position is really and the workflow we are really talking about is really, in many respects, hospital enablement. It's about helping hospitals be more innovative, help them drive efficiencies, deal with patient safety. And I think there's a number of opportunities. We have got a wonderful amount of work that we have done around that workflow. We think the current businesses we have today have opportunities. And we do think we have a number of opportunities. I think we bought Censis last year. It's our most recent acquisition, which has been a very good deal for us. And again, I think we would continue to see, add a good value. So I think we have been able to find opportunities. And it's really about what we can do with them now. And I think now with a scalable $1 billion platform, two years ago, three years ago, four years ago, we didn't have necessarily that platform on which to build on, which you can generally get faster returns in some cases because you are buying, you now have bolt-on opportunities, right? And so the mix of capital allocation can be a mix of maybe longer term returns and some value creation opportunities. And I think now more than ever, we have that opportunity, John. So I think we are really excited about the work that we have done there. And we are excited that we are pushing through and got ASP into the family in the timeframe we said it would be a lot of work to get there. But I think now we have a launch pad on which to build off of. John Inch : Yes. And to your point, Jim, hospitals clearly need the help, right? So, thanks again. I appreciate it. Jim Lico : Yes. That challenge isn't going away. Operator : Your next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joe Giordano : Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Jim Lico : Thanks Joe. Sure Joe. Joe Giordano : Just on the healthcare side, again. Jim, I appreciate the comments earlier that hospitals are better prepared now to deal with rising cases than last time. Like how far are we in terms of patient load now versus where we were when things started to shut down? And how far, like above that level, do you think it can get before that becomes an issue? And how are you guys thinking about European business now with France talking about 30-day lockdowns and things like that? Jim Lico : Yes. So I think first, I am not sure we would necessarily, in North America, I think in Q2, we were in the 75%-ish load at its low point. That's probably a good number to sort of work from. And I think where we are at today, you never know. So there's certainly ambiguity in every one of these comments. But I think we believe that just because of our own on-site work in the last few months that the hospitals are much better prepared for what could potentially happen with caseloads going up. And obviously, the financial situation in which elective procedures are a tremendous funding mechanism for hospitals. There's a financial ramification to getting rid of elective procedures. So I think we feel that the numbers we quoted a few times on the call today, that sort of 90%-ish range in the U.S., I think that's where we think the rest of the remaining part of the year will be. And then let's see what the trend line looks like for 2021. I wouldn't begin to start to predict what those numbers would look like for next year. Western Europe, let's see. One country is not going to make a huge difference. We would need to see that pretty broad-based. Let's see where that goes. And again, I think sterilizations continue. The good thing about this is that there are a lot of elective procedures. There's still a lot of procedures that go on that are not elective as part of the business. So surgeries still happen. A lot of procedures have to happen because they are emergency-related. So as I said, I think let's see where that goes. For sure, we are prepared for a variety of scenarios. Joe Giordano : Thanks guys. Jim Lico : I think we are going to have to call it there. I apologize if we didn't get to you. Certainly, Griffin and Ross are available for follow-up conversations if we didn't get you or for anything that is needed. We obviously want to thank everyone. I want to thank everyone, it's hard to believe that 2020 is three quarters or really 10 months now finished. It's been a tough year for everyone. I know I am including everyone on this call. We appreciate all the support. We are incredibly excited about where we are at. We are excited for everything that we have going, the new segmentation. Hopefully, you see the excitement that we have in our voices as we move forward with new Fortive. And we know the Vontier team is going to do an outstanding job. They will be on the phone on Thursday. And I know they are going to do a great job. Best of luck to them as well to our friends over there. Mark and Dave are going to be great. Thanks everybody. Have a great evening. We will talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we are pleased to announce our fourth quarter 2020 results, which reflect a strong finish to the year. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.70, an increase of 19% year-over-year, as well as total revenue growth of 4.9%, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance and included a return to positive core growth, the quarter underlying the increased resilience of our portfolio and represented a continuation of the sequential improvement in topline performance that we have seen since late in Q2. Despite the continued challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, our disciplined application of the Fortive Business System helped drive more than a 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion and a 39% increase in free cash flow. The better topline performance in Q4 reflected a combination of durability across the recurring revenue portions of our portfolio and clear improvement at Fluke and Tektronix. The strength of our recurring revenue, which now accounts for approximately 39% of our total revenue, provided an important source of stability throughout 2020. In Q4, this was most notable among our SaaS offerings, which generated low-teens growth. The application of FBS customer success tools also continued to deliver improvements in net revenue retention, which climbed to greater than a 101% for the full-year. Our SaaS performance helps offset the challenges the software businesses are having with customer site access for the provision of services, as well as extended timelines for contract renewals. The fourth quarter also saw Fluke and Tektronix returned to positive growth. Both have seen steady improvements since the middle of Q2, driven by better point of sale trends across major geographies and continued successful new product launches. On January 19th, we disposed of our remaining 19.9% ownership stake in Vontier through a tax-efficient Debt-for-Equity Exchange. This transaction represents the final step in the Vontier separation. With the combination of the Vontier spin proceeds, the Debt-for-Equity Exchange and our continued strong free cash flow, we have reduced our net debt by approximately $3 billion since the beginning of Q4 with a net leverage ratio currently at approximately 1.3x. We have significant capacity to pursue key capital allocation priorities. With that, let's turn to the details of the quarter on Slide 4. Adjusted net earnings were $252.9 million up 19.3% from the prior year and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.70. Total sales increased 4.9% to $1.3 billion with core revenue up 0.7%, reflecting continued sequential improvement from the prior quarter. Acquisitions contributed 260 basis points of growth and favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by a 160 basis points. We are particularly pleased to deliver adjusted gross margins of 58.5%, representing a new high for Fortive, which highlights the significant portfolio transformation accomplished over the last few years. Gross margins also benefited from our ongoing investment in innovation, continued application of FBS growth tools and another quarter of strong pricing. Adjusted operating profit margin was 23.2% for the quarter. This reflected 130 basis points of core margin \u2013 operating margin expansion, including positive core OMX for each of the segments. This was the second consecutive quarter with greater than a 100 basis points of core OMX. The Q4 margin performance also contributed to 50 basis points of positive core OMX for the full-year 2020. During the fourth quarter, we generated $313 million of free cash flow, representing conversion of a 124% of adjusted net earnings and an increase of 39% year-over-year. Including this fourth quarter contribution, our full-year 2020 free cash flow was $902 million, representing conversion of 120% of adjusted net earnings and an increase of 44% year-over-year. Our 2020 free cash flow performance in particular showed the resilience of our portfolio and the power of the Fortive Business System to drive consistent strong increases in free cash flow. On Slide 6 of today presentation, we showed the region-by-region breakdown for the fourth quarter, in which we continue to see sequential improvement across our major regions. In Asia, core revenue increased by low-single digits, highlighted by high single-digit growth in China and mid single-digit growth in India. Continued strength in China was broad-based, led by mid-20% growth at Sensing, mid-teens growth at Fluke and high-teens growth at Advanced Sterilization Products. The strength in China and India was offset by declines in most of the rest of Asia. Western Europe core revenue increased by high-single digits in the fourth quarter with high-teens growth at Fluke Health Solutions, high single-digit growth at Tektronix and mid single-digit growth at ASP. North America core revenue was down slightly in the fourth quarter as low-teens growth at Tektronix and high single-digit growth at Censis was primarily offset by declines at ASP and Industrial Scientific. Fluke improved to flat core growth in North America, driven by strong performance at Fluke Calibration and return to growth at Fluke Industrial. Turning to our segments. Intelligent Operating Solutions posted a total revenue increase of 3.2% despite a 0.3% decline in core revenue. Acquisitions increased growth by a 170 basis points while favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by a 180 basis points. Core operating margin increased 280 basis points as price realization, improved mix and higher volumes of Fluke resulted in segment level adjusted operating margin of 28.7%. Fluke\u2019s core revenue returned to positive growth in the fourth quarter, increasing by low-single digits. Fluke saw another quarter of strong growth in China, which increased by mid-teens in addition to seeing continued improvements in North America and Western Europe, which were flat and down low single-digits, respectively. Point of sale showed improvement with North America still negative, but better sequentially, Western Europe turning positive and China continuing at a positive high single-digit rate. Fluke saw a strong performance at Fluke Calibration and Fluke Digital as well as solid growth at Fluke Industrial. Fluke Digital was led by another strong quarter from eMaint, including low double-digit SaaS growth. Fluke continues to see momentum from recent product launches, including its ii910 Sonic Imager, which was launched in November. Industrial Scientific core revenue declined by mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. iNet continued to see good growth, which was more than offset by continued oil and gas related pressure at IFCs instrumentation and rental businesses. Separately, Intelex continued to perform well with revenues increasing by low-double digits. The fourth quarter also represented a record bookings quarter for Intelex, which has seen strong traction and its expansion into Western Europe. Intelex is benefiting from the implementation of FBS, which contributed to the successful rollout of enhanced sales funnel management and digital marketing lead generation tools. In November, Intelex also completed the acquisition of ehsAI, a leading provider of artificial intelligence and machine learning for the automation of permitting and regulatory compliance management. The addition of ehsAI significantly enhances Intelex ability to deliver Applied Intelligence and Advanced Analytics to a broad range of customers. At Accruent, we also saw significant sequential improvement, driven primarily by strong growth in SaaS offerings. While Accruent declined by low-single digits for the quarter, its SaaS business increased by mid-teens. Accruent also continued to apply FBS to drive improvement in churn in the quarter, bringing net retention for the year to greater than a 100%. Despite some continued pressure from customer site access issues, Accruent is seeing good bookings for its Meridian, engineering and information management offering as we partner with customers on their digital transformations and highly regulated markets, such as life science and pharma. We also continue to bring new offerings to market to address work \u2013 returned to work requirements, including a recent win for Accruent\u2019s EMS space management software product for Cushman & Wakefield. Gordian declined by high-single digits due to headwinds associated with budget challenges and uncertainty across state and local government in higher education customers, as well as continued site access issues. Gordian\u2019s RSMeans business were low-single digits, driven by mid-teens growth for its SaaS offering, supported by the successful implementation of virtual platforms for training and onboarding. Gordian also saw signs of improvement in project activity and its job order contracting business towards the end of the quarter. Turning to our Precision Technologies segment. We posted a total revenue increase of 2.3% with 0.7% increase in core revenue. Favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by a 160 basis points. Core operating margin increased 30 basis points, resulting in segment level adjusted operating margin of 22.2%. Tektronix delivered mid single-digit core growth in the quarter with low-teens growth in North America and high single-digit growth in Western Europe. Tektronix continued to benefit from better point of sale trends in both regions with significant improvement from Q3. China saw low single-digit decline due primarily to the negative impact of the expansion of trade restrictions, partially offset by good year-over-year point of sale growth and momentum from small and medium enterprise customers. Looking across the product lines. The improved topline performance in Q4 was driven by low double-digit growth in both Keithley and the mainstream mixed-signal oscilloscope platforms. Growth in mainstream oscilloscope continues to be led by the 6 Series line of scopes, which has seen strong demand for the new six and eight-channel versions since they were introduced in Q3. Sensing Technologies declined low-single digits in the fourth quarter. Sensing performed well in China with mid-20% growth, driven by gains in critical environment applications, et cetera, and increased OEM demand for Hengstler-Dynapar\u2019s factory automation offerings. North America revenue increased slightly, while Western Europe declined low-single digits with both regions showing clear sequential improvement. Sensing\u2019s improved topline performance was primarily due to continued strength in medical and semiconductor end markets. Setra\u2019s recently launched AIIR Watch Negative Pressure machine for isolation room applications has performed well, generating strong initial orders since its launch early in the quarter with orders from a range of customers across medical offices, long-term care facilities and schools. PacSci EMC declined low-single digits as they continued to face COVID-19-related pressures across certain elements of its supply chain. The company did see clear sequential topline improvement versus the third quarter, as well as another quarter of strong bookings. EMC entered 2021 in a strong backlog position as its leading technology and innovation capabilities continue to drive strong demand. Moving to Advanced Healthcare Solutions. Total revenue increased 12% with a 2.6% increase in core revenue. Acquisitions added 830 basis points to growth, while favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 110 basis points. Core operating margin increased 50 basis points, resulting in segment level adjusted operating margin of 24.1% up significantly versus Q3 and driven by strong margin lift at ASP as we continue to exit the transition service agreements. ASP declined mid-single digits as pandemic-related pressure on elective procedure volumes remain a headwind. Elective procedure volumes averaged approximately 93% of pre-COVID levels across the company's major markets, but were lower than anticipated and did see slowing toward the end of the quarter. ASP continued to perform well in Western Europe with mid single-digit growth in addition to high-teens growth in China.  In the U.S., ASP declined low-single digits as growth and capital placements from improved sales execution and funnel management, partially offset the weakness in consumables revenue. ASP service business continues to perform well with the ongoing deployment of FBS tools, helping to drive service sales and optimize service delivery processes. With additional day-two closings in Q4 and early 2021, approximately 99% of ASPs global revenue is now fully under our control and off of transition service agreements. Censis grew by high-single digits in the quarter, site access of hospitals improved early in the quarter only to then reverse as the quarter progressed. Censis topline performance was led by its SaaS-based Censis track offering, which grew low-double digits driven by a combination of new customer acquisitions and successful upselling of existing customers. This growth was partially offset by high single-digit decline in professional services revenue tied directly to the ongoing challenges with customer site access. Fluke Health Solutions generated mid-single digits growth in Q4. FHS grew slightly in North America against a challenging comparison. This growth was led by strong performance across both Fluke Biomed and the Landauer radiation monitoring business. FHS continues to seek good initial momentum across the two software platforms introduced over the past 12 months. 1QA which enhances workflow efficiency and test automation for biomedical customers and optimize, which provides tracking and optimization of radiation dose management for radiology departments. Both platforms reflect FHS is focused on bringing forward software and AI-enabled revenue models to build on its strong existing recurring revenue base. Invetech had another strong quarter with greater than 50% growth. The company saw significant sales and order momentum throughout the year, including a strong finish in December. This growth was led by Invetech\u2019s design and engineering offering, which more than doubled on a year-over-year basis in Q4. The company saw strong growth in the diagnostics market driven by near-term projects to develop rapid testing capabilities for COVID-19 as well as strong demand from the cell therapy market tied to the production from next-generation therapeutics. On Slide 11, we highlight the progress made in 2020 with respect to our corporate social responsibility efforts, which is one of our key strategic initiatives. Throughout the year, we enhanced the rigor and integrity of our data collection by transitioning our EH&S sustainability and risk assessment processes to the Intelex platform. Our enhanced data analytics, improve insights to accelerate our sustainability efforts and give greater transparency to key stakeholders. To support inclusion and diversity, our employee and friends resource groups focused on improving employee connections across the organization, while utilizing FBS to enhance their impact. We also expanded our commitment to the CEO in Action Pledge by participating in the 2021 Racial Equity Fellowship aimed at promoting corporate best practices to address systemic racism and social injustice. We are using FBS tools to develop standard work for greenhouse gas accounting and reporting and scaling Energy Kaizen efforts more broadly across the portfolio. This has resulted in making substantial progress toward our greenhouse gas reduction goals, which we expect to achieve ahead of schedule. Finally, Fortive employees around the world continue to support our local communities through our efforts in our annual Day of Caring with over 35,000 hours of service in 60 worldwide communities. We are living our values to achieve our CSR goals, and we are excited to continue driving progress in the years ahead. Turning to guidance on Slide 12. We are instituting formal earnings guidance for the full-year and the first quarter of 2021. For the full-year, we expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.40 to $2.55, representing year-over-year growth of 15% to 22% on a continuing operations basis. The annual guidance assumes core revenue growth of 4% to 7% and an adjusted operating profit margin of 22% to 23%, and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. We also expect free cash conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income. We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.60, representing year-over-year growth of 22% to 30%. This includes assumptions of 5% to 8% core revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin of 21.5% to 22.5%, and an effective tax rate of 14%. We also expect free cash conversion to be approximately 75% of adjusted net income. Before we wrap up, I'd like to thank the Fortive team for their efforts in 2020. I'm tremendously proud of how our teams rose to meet the many challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. With a focus on keeping our employees safe, helping frontline workers combat the virus and continuing to provide our customers with our essential technologies. Despite these challenges, we made substantial progress across a range of strategic imperatives over the course of the year. The focus and dedication of our team around the world enabled us to significantly transform the portfolio, while transitioning to a work-from-home environment and ensuring continued execution across the portfolio to deliver strong margin performance and consistent free cash flow growth. As a result of that hard work and a significant progress that enabled, we are in a strong position as we turn our focus to 2021, while navigating some of the continued challenges in the near-term. With a portfolio comprised of leading businesses that are well positioned in attractive markets, considerable opportunity to accelerate our growth through continued investments in organic innovation and acquisitions and the support of a strong culture rooted in the Fortive Business System, we are very excited about the road ahead. With that, I'd like to turn it back to Griffin. Griffin Whitney : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Jason, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, good afternoon. [Indiscernible] in the books. So maybe for Chuck, the margin framework looks reasonable, obviously based on execution in 4Q, [indiscernible] in terms of what we should expect through the year. We still sort of added back costs in a gradual way to manage to incremental margin of 35% or I'll be pushing them to the higher earning incrementals. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Nigel. We're still thinking for the year 35%, but maybe if I help you to understand it. We're really thinking about some of our temporary costs coming, spring back more impactfully in Q2. So that'll probably be in 25, but if you look at the other quarters, likely to be 40% in Qs, one, three, and four, and maybe that's a better margin profile for us going forward. Does that helpful for what you're looking for? Nigel Coe : Absolutely. That's great, Chuck. And then just hone in on the AHS, [36%] in both 1Q and 2021, I\u2019d have thought that maybe the growth rate might accelerate beyond 1Q, especially as ASP maybe normalizes the [NCG] comp. So just to be curious on [indiscernible] maybe Invetech sounds like that's got some real life sciences and biopharma applications, just wondering what sort of revenue base we have for Invetech right now. James Lico : Yes. It's interesting because we normally don't talk about Invetech, now that it's in a smaller segment, obviously a little bit more material. But I think the more important thing is given the strength of the business and the work they did, a little bit of an opportunity to talk about the good work they're doing. And that business that we\u2019re talking about in the prepared remarks, Nigel is really focused on really design and engineering resources for diagnostic companies as an example. So think of it as outsourced engineering capability. And as we said in the prepared remarks, a number of opportunities around testing companies that were looking at COVID-19 and also maybe more broadly and more longer-term in cell therapeutic. So number of opportunities. The business is a little bit lumpy because of the nature of the business model. We're working to change that over time. The leadership team has done a nice job of that, but I think first and foremost, they've done a nice job of growing the business. They were up, I think for the year up over 20%. So good \u2013 roughly think of it as under a $100 million business, so that kind of number. Relative to ASP, I think your question was around AHS and the growth rate at AHS, if I had it right. But I'll talk about AHS and ASP in terms of the growth rate. We certainly have good growth. If we were to think about the guide we've got out there, AHS will probably be one of our better growers. They'll run into a couple of comp issues at FHS an example in Invetech in the second half. But I think if we look on a two-year stack basis, you would see progressively better growth through the year at AHS. And that's on the backs of really ASP, continuing to be good. There is an assumption there that we get vaccinated here, that hospitals get elective procedures back on track by the second half. I think that's a comfortable assumption at this point. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks guys. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for giving all of that detail in the slides. Maybe first question around the free cash flow guidance. So you clearly had an exceptional 2020 with that 120% adjusted conversion. It's guided to moderate maybe to a 105% I think this year. So maybe in absolute dollars growing low or mid-single digits versus that high-teens earnings increase. Maybe help us understand how much of that is just kind of conservatism or is something happening with working capital or those prepaid expenses or CapEx coming back or something? Charles McLaughlin : Hey. Good evening, Julian. This is Chuck. Thanks for the question. Yes, there's a couple of things I want to point out in the free cash flow. We're very proud of how we manage through the year and 2020. Going forward though, keep in mind, there's some tailwinds that came in through the year relative to the CARES Act. And not only did we get a moratorium on some of those taxes that we have to pay back over the next two years, but we also have to reinstate that. So we're a little overstated in \u2013 not overstated. 2020 came in stronger because of that, but that's about a $50 million headwind in 2021. And then the second part would be around working capital as we start to reengage and see growth here and prudent to put to say that, our turns may not go down, but it will probably be a little bit of use of cash as we grow those businesses. So I think we've got another $50 million for that. Those are the two biggest things that's going on there. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then my second question really on that revenue guidance for the PT segment. So you're starting out in Q1 with low double-digit even core growth perhaps, the years guided mid single-digit, second quarter should have an easy comp. So it looks like you're dialing in a fairly steep slowdown in the back half of the year. Is that based on sort of the experience of prior upturns and how quickly you can get that surge and then a fade again? I'm just trying to understand some of the main assumptions in that core sales guide to PT. James Lico : Yes, sure. So you really got the \u2013 you got a couple of pieces there. You've got Sensing business and Tek are the two big pieces there, Julian. I think number one is, if you look on a two-year stack, we'd see the business continuing to do pretty well. So some of it has a little bit to just to do with the comps. The growth rates will look a little bit lower in the second half, but fundamentally, if we look over a two-year period, we'll see those business kind of continue. I don't think we have a plan for it to jump though either. So I think \u2013 right now, I think with the visibility, particularly on the Sensing side, we're probably a little bit more prudent just to dial in what we think will happen without any extensive situation. So as I mentioned before on the question, as we look at the guide, we see AHS probably being the best. If we think about on a two-year stack basis, AHS probably being better, iOS being better, and then PT being and maybe a little bit less than the other two. So I think that's the right way to be, but again, strength of the business and \u2013 we'll see how the remaining part of the year plays out relative to some of the economic situations that we \u2013 obviously we're tracking. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Julian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. James Lico : Hey, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Jim and Chuck, just relative to the full-year guide here 4% to 7%, obviously it's an easy comps along the way, and few aches and pains in terms of site access for some of the businesses, but isn't there any reason to believe that this is not with the new portfolio kind of the \u2013 within the steady state growth algorithm for the business as it stands today, given all the changes? Charles McLaughlin : Well, I certainly think it's reasonable. We wouldn\u2019t have put an unreasonable guide out there. And I think it's based on a couple of things. Number one is, I would say, again, this is where the \u2013 lot going on in 2020, as you mentioned, different regional comps and things like that. But I think as we looked at on a two-year stack, we continue to improve sequentially through the year without any unreasonable need for the economy to come back. But on the same token, we're still in a level of uncertainty here. We really don't know the exact date in which COVID will open up offices and get customers back up and fully running. So I think when we look at it continuing to get better through the year, we make a bunch of our own lock like we did in 2020, where as you know, we were basically over 1% overall in the year. So I think we'll continue to make our own luck. And if things play out a little bit better economically than certainly fundamentally you'd probably see a bigger number, but I think for now with the level of uncertainty out there and the trajectory that we ended on, I think this is a strong guide. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe if you wouldn't mind spending a moment on the M&A environment, obviously it's packed city out there, multiples are high. I think a lot of the things that maybe some of these emerging folks in the market are going off to look an awful lot like what could be afforded business, maybe it's the right multiple. How do you view the competition for assets or scarcity value for that matter, given that they're still maybe some reluctance to sell for better businesses who are still feeling COVID effects? James Lico : Yes. Great question, very timely, obviously. I think we've been very busy in the last six months, if I were to characterize our efforts. We certainly, I think continue to believe in the strength of our funnels. We've been active and looked at some things that quite frankly, we feel very disciplined and responsible relative to the environment. So I think \u2013 the real question is, are there opportunities out there for us? And we think that \u2013 we definitely think there are. We think there are great businesses that can become part of Fortive. We are active in the cultivation, despite the virtual nature of that. As you may have noted, we hired a new VP of Strategy that we announced on Monday. So we're resourcing our capability. There's hardware and software opportunities. So I think the breadth of opportunities out there, but you have to \u2013 you're right, we have to be selective. We have to understand our markets. We have to be able to be in a position to understand and be where we can win and not have to pay unreasonable prices. And quite frankly, we've seen some things, transacted things we wouldn't do. But fundamentally I think if we think over the next 12 to 18 months, while M&A is unpredictable, I feel pretty confident we can put some cash to work that will bring in great businesses for Fortive. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Great. Thanks, Jim. Best of luck. James Lico : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is open. Richard Eastman : Hi. Just a couple of quick questions, and thank you for your time. Just first of all, when I look at the full-year 2021 adjusted profit margin guide, the 22 to 23, if I look at it and break it down by business groups, it looks like maybe at the midpoint of some of these numbers that maybe we're looking for 50 basis point improvement at iOS and 50 at PT. The AHS business has about a 2 \u2013 if I'm doing the math right here about 200 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year. Is that mix or exiting the TSA or which is that just pure leverage if procedures come back? Charles McLaughlin : Hey. Good evening, Rick. This is Chuck. I'll take that. The biggest issue is really exiting the TSA as we get into 2021. You get quite a step up there. Obviously, there's a lot of things going on that business with good position on margin, but I think what you're seeing is the TSA is rolling off. Richard Eastman : Yes. And just as that business recovers, is that likely to be the highest adjusted operating profit margin business within Fortive or business group within Fortive if you go out a year or two? Charles McLaughlin : I think that there's a room certainly to grow is elective procedures are down and that's some high margin business that we're missing right now. So we'll see it. But as you can see, we've got a \u2013 I think there's a three horse race here. So I won't bet against any one of our groups. But I do think there's good margin expansion at health for sure. James Lico : Rick, I would just add on the margin front. One of the things that's really important and maybe gets missed \u2013 isn't seen is, as we continue to add innovation and technology capability into the software businesses, part of that move to SaaS is a move of less services. And we were able to do installations at a lower cost. So if you look over the long-term, the margin profile on the software businesses, we get real leverage through the technology we work. And that's something that you'll necessarily maybe see in 2021, you'll see in some of the businesses. But I think over a long period of time, iOS is obviously an incredibly profitable segment, but the opportunity there to continue to do the work, apply FBS into our services business to make our applications easier for customers to install. Fundamentally, it\u2019s a big margin opportunity as well. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then just \u2013 maybe my last question just around pricing, how do you view pricing as we roll for 2021. And maybe what kind of net price capture do you suspect you'll get relative to some of the inflation we're seeing in electronics and other things? A \u2013 James Lico : Well, we had a very good year in price. As we noted on the call or in the prepared remarks, I think we had a good fourth quarter. We had a good year on price. We expect to have another good year on price. So I would say, first and foremost, we're probably in \u2013 for sure probably close to 100 basis points. We do not have a lot of \u2013 one of the things about sort of inflation is maybe something just to level set now with 40% recurring revenue in the portfolio. And most of that being software or very little material costs, we now have a big portion of our revenue profile that really doesn't have supply chain cost inflation pressure. So the portfolio is really shifted in that regard. So while \u2013 we see some of the supply chain stuff, maybe a little bit on the freight side. But I think fundamentally we've done a great job over the years of really pushing on that. And then while at the same time, really looking for the price opportunities for what we call price realization from an FBS perspective through a combination of innovation and better commercial practices. So on the backs of a very good 2020, we expect to have another good year in 2021. Richard Eastman : On the price side. Okay, great. Thank you. James Lico : Thanks, Rick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Hope you're doing well. James Lico : Hey, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Hey, just to pick up a little bit on the M&A topic and kind of leverage it, I guess, no pun intended over to thinking about the balance sheet. You adjust in any way your view of kind of a comfort level on financial leverage here. Where are you comfortable to go in this environment and any other perspective there would be interesting? Charles McLaughlin : Good evening, Jeff. This is Chuck. Yes, I don't think our view on leverage has changed. I think that what we've been talking about is that we deploy our free cash flow as you go through time. But like you saw us do in 2019, we'll stretch, take it up even up over 3.5. But then we'll work to bring it back down. We feel very comfortable anything under 2x net leverage. But I think that what you'll see is, what you've seen over the last few years, there'll be periods where we will elevate, but then you'll see us take steps to delever. Jeffrey Sprague : And unrelated, just kind of channel dynamics, I think on Fluke, you said, I think, mid-teens growth in China, but high single-digit POS. Are you seeing kind of significant channel fill, refill and other businesses or other markets? Was that a significant part of the topline equation here in the fourth quarter? James Lico : Yes. Jeff, no, it was not. I think as you know, we do a good job where we have our principal channel businesses being Fluke and Tek. We had good sales out. In most regions of the world, we get good inventory levels. No precipitous change really on the inventory side, inventories have been low and really nothing from a macro perspective that would suggest we've seen any inventory build of any magnitude. Some of the China dynamic is on the point of sales side versus the revenue side is a little bit, you typically see a little bit of a difference in China in the fourth quarter as people sort of get prepared for the Chinese New Year. And so it is an unusual for us to out gain a few basis points of point of sale in the fourth quarter. That's not an unusual situation. But I think as we look at where we're at right now, as we said sort of the end of January, we're in a pretty good shape relatively on a global basis relative to channel inventory. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. I'm sorry, can I sneak one more in, just on Advanced Health Care. It almost doesn't seem mathematically possible that core OMX would only be up 50 bps, if ASP was up 300 bps. Is there just some oddity in the way you're kind of accounting for the TSAs or something there in that description? James Lico : Yes. So we have really strong margin performance at ASP. But it was offset by \u2013 as I mentioned, Invetech grew 50% in the quarter and they are lower margin business. As I mentioned, the design and engineering part of that is a more of a people business. So it doesn't have the same margin profile. So it's really a mix issue. If we really look at kind of the core ongoing margin profile of the business, which has made up of mostly ASP and Fluke Health, we\u2019re in a very good shape in the fourth quarter and we're going to exit well. As Chuck mentioned, some of the TSA fall off plus a lot of the good integration work we've done at ASP, we'll have a good 2021 in AHS. But a 50% growth rate in one quarter in a business does tend to mix it down a little bit. Jeffrey Sprague : Sure. Thanks for the color. Have a good night. James Lico : Yes, you too. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Good afternoon, guys. James Lico : Hey, Scott. Scott Davis : Jim, you mentioned \u2013 can you guys hear me okay? James Lico : Yes, we can. Scott Davis : Okay, good. Sorry. Jim, you mentioned the new hire, I think his name is Read Simmons. Can you just \u2013 it seems like kind of \u2013 he has a pretty darn good resume. What's the mandate? What are you looking for and why weren't you able to fill that seat internally? James Lico : Well, I think a couple of things. We had filled the seat internally for awhile and we decided that. I think as we continue, Scott, I sort of think of it this way. And you know we have a 10-year plan. We just updated the Board over the next five years. We've got a lot of skills around the things we've done over the last five years, but as we think forward, having somebody with Read\u2019s resume who understands software, who understands the continuous improvement tools of software, as well as private equity. That's a combination of skills. Quite frankly, we have \u2013 that is really a great opportunity. And from time-to-time, we're going to look outside to supplement and compliment the great team we have. And this was a very unique situation where we have an opportunity to do that. Scott Davis : Yes. It seems so. And kind of that spirit, I mean, is there any meaningful change to R&D spend, CapEx, anything growth related that \u2013 now that we're kind of on our way to being post-COVID at least you can play a little bit more offense? James Lico : Well, I would say \u2013 Chuck can talk about the CapEx side. I think in general, the answer is, yes. I mean, our R&D spend has gone up a little bit as we come have more software businesses, which tend to have a little bit more R&D. We're investing a lot more into the Fort. We actually invested a lot last year, but we're doubling down in that, in our data analytics and machine learning as we noted in the commentary. We've talked about the ehsAI acquisition, which is really an Aqua hire, very little revenue, but really \u2013 just a really smart group of data scientists who can help accelerate our EH&S work. So I think those are good. That's a situation where we're really just hiring a big R&D team and a great capability in leadership. So I think those \u2013 a number of those investments, we talked about our Pioneer Square Labs. We've doubled down in that. So yes, there is a number of places where we are playing offense. You saw some of that \u2013 you heard some of that in the fourth quarter, right? Some of the hardware Sonic Imager, the scopes of Tek, but also things like \u2013 at Accruent we had \u2013 we launched our latest analytics product with maintenance connected Accruent. So a number of places where we're playing offense, and we feel pretty good about how we can drive that in 2021, as you said, as we start to see sort of COVID start to slowdown here hopefully. Charles McLaughlin : And Scott, I\u2019d just add, with the post-separation of Vontier, two things. One is, we'll be pushing 7% R&D up from maybe \u2013 closer to 6%. So that's reflecting with Jim's comments as well. And then on CapEx, I think, we've always been pretty CapEx light, but as the \u2013 our software businesses become 10% of the total, you're going to expect to see that. The CapEx certainly not go up here and we'll remain CapEx light going forward, and maybe even start to trend down a little bit. Scott Davis : Hopeful. Thank you. Good luck guys. James Lico : Thanks Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, guys. James Lico : Hi, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim, maybe you could give us a little more color in how you're thinking about the rate of recovery at Gordian and Accruent, you've talked for a couple of quarters now about constraints then local spend, but also that these businesses should be relatively solid going forward to focus on workplace space, buildings management. So how much visibility do you have in these kinds of businesses for better performance in 2021? James Lico : Well, yes. I mean, we definitely think the businesses are going to get better in 2021. We saw a couple of good evidence points in Q4. I mentioned the SaaS growth at double-digits. That was a good sign. We won twice as many logos in Q4 as we did in Q3. So I think those are really good signs for how we entered the year. We do need customer access to do some things. But we do have some wonderful opportunities. As you mentioned, we talked about the EMS space planning win, we're thinking \u2013 we have a number of applications that we'll be launching around employee experience. So a number \u2013 as companies start to think about bringing teams back to the office for periods of time. So I think we've got a number of things that will help us make our own luck. But we do need to see some of that office access. So I think you'll see the business progressively get better through the year. On Gordian, Gordian has been in great shape, they were growing double-digit before COVID really been a really strong performer for us. We have some visibility into how things are changing at this point. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks around job order contracting, we start to see the projects get loaded, even though they might not be purchasing through the system yet. So that's starting to improve. I suspect we see that improve and as state and local budgets start to get approved into the second half of the year, we would expect to see things continuing. If you think about the second half of the year, it's logical to think that state and local offices are going to start to want to bring people back and they're going to need to change the workplace. We're not about new buildings. We're about changing the buildings you have, changing the structures you have. And I think a number of those things are going to start to characterize themselves as we get further into the year. So I think that's the visibility we have and we feel good about the work, the teams \u2013 our teams are doing to put them in place for success. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks for that. And then I'm curious about your semiconductor business within Sensing. There's obviously a lot of [indiscernible] still out there, geopolitical global semiconductor shortage. It looks like you're still seeing good growth there. So maybe talk about that business for 2021, if you could? James Lico : Yes. It's pretty much with OEM. We call it semiconductor, but it's mostly semiconductor equipment manufacturers. And that business has turned pretty well. So we think it's good for at least another quarter or two. So right now that's about the visibility we have. So I think that's probably where we stand right now. You didn't ask it, but we saw good growth at Keithley on the semiconductor side as well at Tektronix. I think some of that was pent-up demand that we saw, but it would be logical to think that as supply chain issues occur and some more money may get spent there that would be some benefit, but we haven't dialed that into our forecast at the point. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hi. Good afternoon. James Lico : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Yes. So just a question on Tektronix, you highlighted I think some sort of trade related issues in China and just want to understand what are the trade restrictions for Tektronix in China? And do you expect them to be a drag for the rest of the year? And then just given what's happened and give me your exposure to the Tek segment in China? How do you grow in China from sort of the reset-based demand? James Lico : Well, I think first of all, we had about $2 million worth of Huawei in there. So I think, first, if you step back, we call that out because it's an impact to Tektronix in China. But in the big scheme of things relative to Fortive, these aren't big impact. I think the last of the Huawei impact as an example was a couple million bucks in Tek in the quarter. We do have some additional restrictions around military end use that we're seeing. But again, maybe a little bit of headwind for Tek, but not a major issue for the rest of the company not impactful relative to the overall Fortive. But in terms of transparency and giving you a color on what we're seeing, the good news is, as we said in the prepared remarks, as we continue to see point of sale in good place, and we also saw good demand among medium \u2013 small and medium customers. So Chuck and I did try to review this a couple of weeks ago, and we're really pleased with the work that China's team \u2013 the Tek China\u2019s team has done to extend themselves more with digital. And they're just doing a great job of really doing \u2013 expanding into new customer sets, which I think is going to bode well for us in the future. Andrew Obin : And just a question on software and also question on SaaS, what was overall software growth all in for 2020 and what's your SaaS ARR at this point? James Lico : So I'm thinking here, our SaaS growth in the year was probably close to high-single digits, probably, maybe \u2013 yes. So I think that's probably right. I don't have an ARR number for the year, so we can get back to you on that. I think what we saw relative to overall software was probably a little down because of the low-to-mid single digits, we\u2019re looking through the year just based on the services issues. In terms of performance, Censis and Intelex led the way in terms of growth. They grew through the year as well as eMaint. So we had good growth in those places. The places where we saw maybe a little bit greater impact relative to some of the services was at Gordian and Accruent. So hopefully that gives you a little color and we can get back to you on the overall ARR number. Andrew Obin : But in Accruent, just to follow-up on Andrew\u2019s question, I mean, there is just few sort of site budget and education and state budget. I mean, the funding for, I think education and state budgets are in good shape. So that actually given what has already happened until 2021 that should actually improve right? James Lico : Yes, for sure. I think when you look at the situation of what educational \u2013 and this is mostly higher education by the way, higher education and state local buildings inevitably when they bring people back to the office, they're fundamentally going to have to change the social distancing and make changes to the facilities. And fundamentally that's the core part of what we see in Gordian. So in that case \u2013 and then from a facilities management space planning, that's also in the wheelhouse of Accruent. So we should see those things come back for sure. Again, don't can't pick the particular date, but I think if I were to make a bet, it's going to get better through every quarter of the year. Andrew Obin : Fantastic. Thank you so much. James Lico : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. James Lico : Good afternoon, Deane. Deane Dray : Like to stay right on that topic where Andrew left off. On the software side where you've had site access issues and not being able to provide onsite services, would there be a catch-up or will any of those services be lost? James Lico : It's a very temporary or \u2013 I think it's a temporary situation. So by nature of that, we probably see a catch-up, whether that's a catch-up in the year and in people, there's also \u2013 part of this is people reevaluating budgets a little bit. So we sort of classify all of that as a delay, but I think we're practical in the sense that maybe some of that is customers reassessing how many seats they want, how many licenses they want on the licensed software side. But we've seen a little bit of that compression. So I would expect there'll be a little bit of that, but to the broader question, Deane, I would expect there will be a catch-up at some point in the year. It maybe \u2013 as things get back, what I would call back to normal. Deane Dray : Got it. And what's the mix look like now? Is it like two-third SaaS, one-third transactional? And how do you expect that to evolve? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. Deane, that's about right. Two thirds to maybe 70%, is at SaaS. Deane Dray : Okay. And then just a quick question or clarification on ASP. So the high-teens growth in China, I would imagine that there was a benefit there where more elective procedures have started. But is that 93% elective procedure you cite, is that a global number and what does that look like in China? James Lico : Yes, it's a global number. It's probably a \u2013 it's not at a 100% yet in China. We think about the fourth quarter. But it's moving up. I would say part of our China growth as well was equipment. We've been doing well on the equipment side. So I think as we look across \u2013 and quite frankly, across the board, maybe stepping back at ASP, we did an excellent job in equipment sales in the year. We're going to start with a bigger installed base than we did for a year ago. And obviously that bodes well for when consumables come back. So to your specific question, it was a combination of \u2013 it was also a big improvement in services. One of the things that we really been doing Deane in China was that we \u2013 when we first bought the business and we were lucky that this was the business that we took control of early. One of the things we noticed was that the service revenue was a lower percentage of our sales in China than it was anywhere else in the world. So we applied a number of FBS tools, including policy deployment to make service revenue a big push for us in the business. And we've really, really increased the percent, the stickiness or the connection rate with our equipment and increased service contracts with current customers. So the growth was very much a story of not only electives coming back, but also equipment and the big story was service. Deane Dray : That was real helpful. Thank you. James Lico : Thank you. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, first off on the M&A discussion, and I'd love to understand given the one tier sale and the addition to your dev team, is the focus going to be just to bolster the software, the recruiting business across the three segments? Or is there a desire to sort of add a fourth leg to the stool? And I don't know if the stool has four legs, but a fourth leg to the Fortive portfolio if you may. Are you going to think about those dynamics? James Lico : I think we're incredibly plus right now to be in an area where all three segments, I think have incredible opportunities. I mentioned, the $30-plus billion were the served market. We've just completed our next five-year \u2013 our update to our 10-year plan that we did five years ago with the Board. And we feel very excited and really, I think I would say that \u2013 if I were a betting person, I would say, most of our capital deployed in the current segments is probably the winning bet. We have a lot of opportunity. We see the breadth and depth within both hardware, software and services within all three. So I think when I really think about, I'd never say never because you never know when an opportunity becomes available. But I think the focus \u2013 we're blessed with the focus that we have and I think we're going to take advantage of that as we move forward. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then if I could just ask you, when you just talked about the impact from COVID to calendar 2020, you've talked about the revenue impact on elective surgery and site access side, and you also have operational impact from there. Is there a way to think about how much revenues you may have left on the table this year? And how much cost you had to take on because of COVID? And then how do those two numbers stack up in calendar 2021? James Lico : Well, I don't know if I could put a revenue number to it. But if I think about us being \u2013 maybe the easy thing to do would be to say if we were down 6% core in the year and we should be \u2013 well, this portfolio can grow mid-single digits. You can apply that number to our total portfolio and say over 12 to 24-month period, you think that that would come back over time. That's a big number, but I would expect that some of it is that. So I think that's first and foremost. I'll let Chuck talk about some of the costs coming back. But I think maybe the point too is, there's also \u2013 COVID has been a challenge for the year for all of us, everybody on this call, but it's also created a number of opportunities. Particularly in our \u2013 whether it's the focus more on EH&S, that every company in the world, and we have an outstanding portfolio of the EH&S businesses and now the continued increase and people wanting to focus on sustainability or the facilities management challenges that come with bringing people back to the office and to manufacturing sites and the importance of data as it relates to workers and those things. All of those speak to all the solutions that we've made part of Fortive over the last four years. So I think we also have to think about when we get into what I'll call a normal environment, that fundamentally there's going to be tremendous opportunity for us to harness around a number of these new challenges that we're all going to have to deal with as business leaders. And we have the solutions to ultimately deal with \u2013 help them deal with those challenges. So I think \u2013 and that doesn't even talk about the sterilization and infection control challenges that hospitals are thinking about as well, and the solutions we have on the AHS side. So I think when you add that in, you'll come up with some pretty big numbers of opportunity. Charles McLaughlin : Yes. And really quick on the cost, I think what we saw last year, so we took some costs out and it's coming back in and we've rebalanced it and we\u2019re operating to a margin idea. But in the COVID environment going forward, there's going to be some incremental cost associated with that. But I think what we've seen in 2021, more opportunities to be more efficient, not having to go beyond sight all the time and things around travel. And I think there's more opportunity for us to create more leverage that way in total. There'll be puts and takes there as we go forward. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thanks a lot for your time. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. James Lico : Hey, John. John Walsh : So maybe going back to the SaaS business, I'm curious if you've seen any discernible change in kind of the growth that's coming from the retention and churn side of the equation versus maybe the upselling and normal kind of price escalators you have there. Any change in what's driving the growth? James Lico : Well, I think this is been \u2013 I mean, we don't talk a lot about it, but to have net retention over a 100, when customers are reevaluating things and looking for cost reductions, I think is an outstanding effort on the part of our commercial teams. So we've seen \u2013 we've not seen customer churn. We may have seen maybe people wanting to reduce their spend or something like that. But we've been able to maintain a lot of that, keep that net retention number over a 100 and I think that's \u2013 we have a number of FBS tools that are in \u2013 and quite frankly, data analytics solutions that we apply to those types of things to predict what are the characteristics of a customer that might potentially churn. So I think John, we've done a good work to mitigate some of that. I think in a normal year, you think that our net retention might be a \u2013 would be higher than that number. So I think that's a little bit of a \u2013 little bit less upselling and maybe in this environment maybe a slight little bit of churn, depends on the business. Several of our businesses have actually decreased churn. Accruent is an example. So I think that's the environment we come into this year. And from here, I think we\u2019re definitely through the toughest days in that regard. John Walsh : Got it. And then maybe just one on the tax rate and kind of the sustainability of that going forward? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. Thanks, John. What we put in here is the tax rate 14% going forward, that reflects our businesses as it is and the tax rules as we understand them going forward. What we haven't done is try to factor in any potential changes around the Biden administration might do. I would expect that those would changes if and when they come would be 2022. But they do something and we\u2019ll of course, react to that. So right now, we think that if nothing changed, which never happens by the way, but this would be the right rate. So we're going to watch very carefully about what gets proposed and understand the impact. Keep in mind with the acquisitions we've done, we've got a really global footprint, which gives us maybe more opportunities for maintaining an advantage in tax going forward, but we'll have to see what they do. John Walsh : Great. Appreciate you taking the questions. Thank you. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open. Joseph Giordano : Hey, guys. Thank you for fitting me in here. James Lico : Hi, Joe. Joseph Giordano : Hey. You kind of stole my question on tax there, but yes, hopefully you're accruing a nice bonus for your taxes and you're doing a heck of a job. But do you feel like there's almost like somewhat some sort of a target on a new administration for a company, like set up this way? Like a lot of the U.S. company that has significant declines in tax rate or is it something like you feel like is pretty defensible? Charles McLaughlin : Well, we think it's very defensible and what we are doing is interpreting the tax laws as written. And what gives us maybe an advantage over some other companies is one, post-separation, we've got a high R&D tax and investment or R&D investment. And that gives us an advantage in the R&D tax credit. And also, as you do acquisitions in foreign countries, it just creates a fact pattern that we're just following the tax line as it's written. But those are kind of two big factors, especially the ASP acquisition, in Europe a few years back that that what helps us out quite a bit. Joseph Giordano : And then last for me, core OMX in the quarter [indiscernible] on the lightest revenue there. So like, was there some kind of like one-offs there that allowed that kind of magnitude on a comp thing mostly, or how do we think about that? James Lico : It's the volume coming back. So I think that's first and foremost. We see a business like Fluke coming back. That's the high margin business. You saw 280 basis points of core OMX in iOS. It's the strength of the SaaS growth in the software businesses, but it was across the board. So iOS certainly led the pack. As you know on a quarterly basis, there's always one segment that leads the pack a little bit more than the others. But I think what we saw was the breadth of OMX. And I think as we sit here looking into 2021, the 50 basis points that we grew OMX despite all the issues in 2020 gives us tremendous confidence that we can continue to do that in 2021. Charles McLaughlin : And the only thing Joe I\u2019d add to that is the \u2013 this is what can happen when you beat the top-end of your range with a high-50 gross margins. It's a happy problem now. Joseph Giordano : Thanks guys. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : That concludes Q&A. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. James Lico : Well, thanks everyone for today. We appreciate your time. We went a little over, but we knew we had a few \u2013 a little bit longer prepared remarks, so glad we could get to everyone. Thanks so much for your support this year, in 2020 and certainly into 2021. We're all hoping you're safe and healthy and look forward to hopefully seeing everybody in person sometime this year. Until then we'll take all your questions by phone and virtually look forward to seeing you there and have a great day. And obviously Griffin and team are available for questions. Thanks, everyone. Have a great night. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Our first quarter performance continued to highlight the benefits of our efforts to enhance the growth and resilience of our portfolio, significantly expanding our positions in software and healthcare and adding substantial sources of higher growth recurring revenue. As a result, our portfolio has been well positioned to drive rapid sequential improvement over the past few quarters as markets have begun to reopen. In Q1, we continue to see significant improvement, not only across our short-cycle businesses, primarily Fluke Instruments and Tektronix, but also in many of the businesses that have faced COVID-related headwinds, such as Advanced Sterilization Products. Turning to the results in the quarter. We generated total revenue growth of 13.6% and core revenue growth of 9.1%, above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.63, representing an increase of 37% year-over-year. The combined outperformance on core growth and earnings helped drive another strong quarter of free cash flow. Our SaaS offerings at Accruent, Intelex, Censis, eMaint and Gordian continue to perform well, generating double-digit growth in the quarter, with the current Gordian seeing better top line momentum overall. These software offerings are an important part of our strategy to leverage leading hardware positions to provide broader software-enabled solutions to address pain points in our customers' critical workflows and their ongoing digital transformation priorities. Despite the challenges of a COVID environment, we continue to leverage FBS tools to drive performance improvements across the portfolio. ASP is advancing the implementation of the Fortive Business System more broadly, driving strong improvements in working capital turns as well as progress accelerating commercial efforts as it delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of growth in its global installed base. Intelex also continues to see success from the application of FBS tools to improve its sales process, driving better lead generation, improved customer win rates and stronger sales pipeline creation. While these are just a couple of examples, we are highly focused on building FBS capability across our newer businesses in order to deliver accelerated growth, innovation and market share gains. Relative to organic growth, we continue to invest in strategic initiatives across our operating companies as well as build additional capacity to drive future innovation. With the FORT, we are continuing to scale our data analytics capabilities, providing leverage to our operating companies to pursue key AI and machine learning applications. In 2020, we more than doubled the number of projects conducted and expect to do the same this year, targeting more than $250 million of potential revenue opportunity. Our acquisition of ehsAI significantly expanded our machine learning expertise to help grow our position within EHS workflows as well as generate learnings that can be applied more broadly within Fortive. We've also made a number of additional investments to expand our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs with three start-up opportunities currently in different phases of incubation. With these investments, we are enhancing our ability to generate disruptive innovation that will deepen our competitive advantage and increase our customer value proposition. In terms of performance across the major geographies, core growth was led by a low 20% growth in Asia. This included approximately 30% growth in China and low double-digit growth in Japan. Elsewhere, our core revenue grew by low double digits in Western Europe and by low single digits in North America. Taking a closer look at performance in the segments on Slide 7. Intelligent Operating Solutions posted a total revenue increase of 9.5%, with core revenue increase of 5.5%. This included high-teens growth in China, high single-digit growth in Western Europe and a flat top line in North America. Fluke's core revenue continued to improve in the first quarter, increasing by high single digits. This performance was highlighted by low double-digit growth at Fluke Industrial and high-teens growth at Fluke Calibration. Fluke's growth included the launch of the 377 and 378 Fluke Connect clamp meters for noncontact voltage testing. These introductions incorporate Fluke's FieldSense technology and extend its leadership position in safer noncontact measurement tools. At Fluke Industrial, point-of-sale in North America turned positive in the first quarter, increasing by low single digits. Meanwhile, point-of-sale in both Western Europe and China continue to improve, rising by mid-single digits and mid-teens, respectively. Strong performance at Fluke Digital Systems continued this quarter, increasing by mid-single digits as eMaint saw strong demand with mid-teens growth in SaaS bookings. Industrial Scientific declined single digits in the first quarter as a result of continued weakness in instrument sales. The company's iNet offering continued to demonstrate its resilience, increasing by low single digits. iNet also registered an 18% increase in bookings while driving a more than 500 basis point improvement in net retention. Stub's strong bookings growth in ISC's rental business provided a signal of improving stability in its end markets with customers beginning to restart maintenance project activity. At the same time, we are seeing continued success from the application of FBS growth tools at Intelex to accelerate sales pipeline creation, driving a record revenue quarter with low double-digit growth. The integration of ehsAI continues to go well. While the revenue contribution remains small, product integration is on schedule, and the Intelex team has started to accelerate new customer acquisition. Accruent grew by low single digits in the first quarter, highlighted by high single-digit growth in SaaS. Accruent continue to see good momentum in its industrial and life science segments. This included a recent win at BioMarin, which included Accruent's Meridian solution as a critical tool for management of their pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, including communication with contractors and support for FDA validation. Accruent is also seeing growing demand across a range of end markets for its facility planning and resource scheduling solutions with customers beginning to prepare their facilities for the future needs of their workforce as they emerged from the pandemic. Accruent's growth in the quarter was aided by the resumption of some on-site service implementation and project-related activities with further improvement expected as the year continues. After facing headwinds during the second half of 2020, Gordian's top line improved to flat in the first quarter. Gordian's job order contracting procurement business grew by low single digits and is expected to accelerate as the ramp of recovery from COVID continues. The company's estimating business continued to perform well, increasing by high single digits and seeing strong renewal momentum and conversion rates for the SaaS version of its RSMeans product line. Gordian saw signs of improvement during the first quarter regarding site access issues. We expect this improvement will continue in the coming quarters. The Precision Technologies segment posted a total revenue increase of 14.3%, with a 12.1% increase in core revenue. This included mid-30s percent growth in China, mid-teens growth in Western Europe and mid-single-digit growth in North America. Tektronix generated high-teens growth, driven by strength in its general industrial and semiconductor markets. Point-of-sale continue to accelerate, up greater than 40% in China, greater than 20% in Western Europe, while North America turned positive with a mid-single-digit increase in the quarter. Tektronix has seen strong demand in China as economic recovery continues driven by government investment in 5G, electric vehicles and IoT solutions. Looking across the product lines at Tektronix, mainstream oscilloscope and Keithley both had an excellent first quarter. Mainstream oscilloscope posted high 30% growth, driven by strong demand trends across most of its key product segments, particularly our 6 series and 4 series scopes. Keithley grew mid-teens, while the Tektronix service business continued to show stability, reporting mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter. Tektronix also saw outperformance across a range of recent new product introductions, including its new IsoVu Probe solution for semiconductor and automotive market applications. Sensing Technologies grew by low double digits, driven by broad strengthening across end markets, including industrial and electronics customers. Sensing saw accelerating demand in China as it delivered a number of key wins with strong momentum among factory automation OEM customers. Sensing also generated strong growth from its critical environment products, et cetera, with mid-30% growth for the quarter. Pacific Scientific EMC returned to growth, increasing by low single digits in the first quarter. The business continued to see good order trends with a book-to-bill of 1.2 over the trailing 12 months and has a strong backlog that we expect to support improving growth in the coming quarters. Moving to Advanced Healthcare Solutions. Total revenue increased 20.3% with a 10.9% increase in core revenue. This included low 40% growth in China, low 20% growth in Western Europe and low single-digit growth in North America. ASP returned to growth in the first quarter, increasing by mid-single digits. Growth at ASP was driven by a greater than 40% increase in capital equipment sales as it continued to grow its global installed base. This momentum in capital sales more than offset the fact that electric procedures were 91% of pre-COVID levels globally and continue to weigh on ASP's consumable revenue. Stronger capital sales are an indication of the progress ASP is making in its FBS journey by driving better sales execution and improved funnel management at priority independent delivery network accounts. ASP continued to perform well in Western Europe with its fifth consecutive quarter of growth. ASP was also recently named the preferred supplier by the National Health Service in the UK and a large multi-year tender for terminal sterilization capital and services. Censis also had a strong first quarter, growing by low teens with low double-digit growth in its CensiTrac SaaS offering. Censis has seen improved upselling momentum across its business and is also seeing evidence of U.S. hospitals moving to post-COVID operations and faster purchasing decisions. Fluke Health Solutions increased by low teens in the first quarter with broad strength across its product lines. FHS continues to have success deploying FBS to drive growth and margin improvements at Landauer, leveraging global go-to-market scale and accelerating cross-selling and products and services. Landauer is now seeing an approximate 2.5x improvement in its operating margins since acquisition. Finally, Invetech reported mid-40% growth as it delivers against a strong backlog of 2020 orders for its diagnostic offerings. With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will take you through additional details on our margins and free cash flow for the quarter. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Solid execution across the portfolio enabled us to deliver strong margin performance in Q1. Adjusted gross margins were 57% in the first quarter, up 90 basis points, driven by the fall-through on the strong growth at Fluke and Tektronix as well as the year-over-year gross margin improvement at ASP coming off the transition service agreements. It also reflected solid execution with FBS throughout the portfolio, including continued price realization of 90 basis points in the quarter. Our Q1 adjusted operating profit margin was 22.7%, a bit higher than we had guided, helped in part by the stronger volume we saw in the quarter. We generated 40% of adjusted incremental operating margins and 240 basis points of core operating margin expansion and also generated more than 200 basis points of core operating margin expansion in each of our three segments. During the first quarter, we generated $144 million of free cash flow, representing an increase of 50% year-over-year. We continue to be pleased with the consistent growth in free cash flow and have delivered -- that we've delivered over the past year, with the first quarter taking our trailing 12 months free cash flow to $950 million. Along with significant growth in earnings, disciplined working capital management at ASP, Fluke and Tektronix contributed to this free cash flow performance. Early in Q1, we executed the tax-efficient monetization of our remaining 19.9% stake in Vontier, generating approximately $1.1 billion in proceeds, which were used for debt repayment. On the basis of that transaction and our free cash flow from Q1, we ended up the first quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.2x. Supported by a continued strong free cash flow and significant balance sheet capacity, we are well positioned to pursue our key capital allocation priorities and are maintaining an active pipeline of deal-cultivation efforts. We continue to see a broad range of opportunities to deploy capital to build on our core hardware and instrumentation positions as we also leverage deep domain and workflow expertise into adjacent high-value software data-driven opportunities. Turning now to the guide on Slide 11. As a result of the strong first quarter performance and given some improvement in our outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our 2021 guidance. For the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.50 to $2.60, representing year-over-year growth of 20% to 24% on a continuing operations basis. This assumes total revenue growth of 10% to 13%, core revenue growth of 7% to 10%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22% to 23% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. It also assumes core revenue growth of 5% to 7% in the second half of 2021. We also continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the year. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.60, representing year-over-year growth of 30% to 40%. This assumes total revenue growth of 20% to 23%, core revenue growth of 16% to 19%, adjusted operating profit margins of 19.5% to 20.5% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. For the second quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 85% of adjusted net income. The full year guidance incorporates $35 million of additional investments that we are making to drive innovation and enhance our capabilities to support higher growth in the years ahead with $15 million in the second quarter. This includes funding for the FORT to expand our analytic capabilities and talent base as well as to accelerate the development of AI machine learning offerings for our customers. It also includes funding for investments in our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs, where we have seen good early progress thus far. With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks. Jim Lico : Thanks, Chuck. Before we move to questions on Slide 13, I wanted to highlight the continued progress we're making with respect to our key sustainability goals. In Q1, we completed an updated materiality analysis, yielding valuable insights that we use to define the new pillars of our sustainability strategy, which will guide our efforts going forward. We've also made significant progress implementing the Intelex sustainability performance indicators platform across the portfolio, which we used to complete the collection of 2020 emissions data with new, more aggressive carbon emissions targets. We look forward to discussing our progress and our evolving sustainability goals at our upcoming Investor Day. I'd also like to take a minute to thank our employees for their continued adaptability and strong FBS -- and strong execution of FBS throughout the first quarter. The results that we announced today are a testament to the depth and dedication of our teams and the relentless focus on the continuous improvement principles that power our culture. As we look forward, we are excited about the strength of our portfolio, the quality of the market opportunities we address and the significant organic and inorganic growth opportunities ahead of us. As macro indicators continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus will remain on driving strong core growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation, while investing in innovation and deploying our capital to acquisitions that accelerate our strategy and increase the value we bring to customers. We are also excited to share more details with you about our road ahead when we speak on May 19 at our Investor Day. In the almost five years since our spin, we have positioned the portfolio to be higher growth, more profitable and a more powerful generator of free cash flow. This sets us up well for accelerated compounding across our businesses, which we look forward to discussing with you. With that, I'll turn it back to Griffin. Griffin Whitney : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Pasha, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi, good afternoon. Chuck McLaughlin : Hey, Scott. Scott Davis : The margin guide, it seems -- is this all because of additional growth investments that you're talking about? Or is there some supply chain or price cost or timing issues? Is there anything else related to kind of the, what I'd consider kind of a more conservative incremental margin guide? Chuck McLaughlin : Are you -- Scott, this is Chuck. Are you talking for the year or for the Q2? Scott Davis : Honestly, you could answer for both, yes. I was specifically talking about 2Q, but you might as well speak to the full year. Chuck McLaughlin : Well, I think that the -- for the full year, we talked about the incremental investment. There's probably $0.03 of headwinds and also the year for FX. I'd probably point that out a little bit. And further, I'd say that there are -- we've seen some things that are inflationary that are in this. But we called out the bigger things that are different than what we maybe were thinking just a couple of months ago. And... Scott Davis : Okay. Go ahead. Chuck McLaughlin : And in Q2, go ahead. Scott Davis : [indiscernible] Chuck McLaughlin : Sorry, go ahead, Scott. No, I just was going to talk mostly -- the Q2 is about the investment that we kicked off for the investment in growth as we're seeing the second half of the year accelerate versus our previous guide. Scott Davis : Okay. The $35 million in 2Q that you call out? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes. Scott Davis : Okay. And just second, just a follow-up, do you have a sense of whether -- and I know it's hard because your portfolio is really broad, but sense of whether inventories are kind of normal, below average, above average, I know it's hard to generalize, but\u2026 Jim Lico : Yes. I would say where we get -- hey, Scott, it's Jim. I think number one, I would say, we feel pretty good about where inventories are at. You know, we get good point-of-sale data at Fluke Industrial, at Tektronix, and to some extent, we get decent data on consumables in North America at ASP. So it's a decent chunk of our portfolio where we see things where we have channel partners. And I would say we're as good -- we're at reasonable inventory levels. Nothing is elevated. There's always a couple of situations. You saw the strong consistent improvements in POS that we highlighted in the prepared remarks. And I think we've certainly seen sequential improvement from Q1 -- from Q4 last year to Q1 in all of our regions relative to point of sale. So I think we've seen that improving even on a two-year stack. So we've seen an improvement in point of sale. We've not seen a big inventory lift. So we feel pretty good about where inventories are at going into the second quarter. And one other thing, maybe just to clean up on -- just on that margin question. Just the $15 million of organic investments in the second quarter, $35 million in the full year, the other part of maybe the margin part in the second quarter is obviously those one-time costs that come back from a year ago that we've talked about several times. Scott Davis : Okay. Good color and clarity. Thank you, Jim and Chuck. I\u2019ll pass it on. Jim Lico : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to try and circle back on that Q2 margin question, maybe from a different angle. So if I just look sequentially, the revenues are sort of flattish, I think, Q1 to Q2. You're guiding that margin down about 250 bps sequentially. Understand there's 100 bps or so headwind from the extra growth investments. But maybe help me understand, is there something on mix that's also getting worse? Because I understand the temporary cost year-on-year, but sequentially, there shouldn't be a huge delta, I would guess. Chuck McLaughlin : Hey, Julian, this is Chuck. I think you got most of -- there's a little bit of FX. I would say about the temporary costs, as things open up, there is actually some sequential from Q1 to Q2, where -- I'd give a small example. As things open up, we're going to see more travel than we saw in Q1, that's just one small example. So there is some incremental spending that we would expect there. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then maybe homing in on the Advanced Healthcare Solutions segment and a couple of points on that. I think your incremental margin there year-on-year in the first quarter was about 30-ish, and then Q2, there wasn't much at all because of the factors you mentioned. And then it looks like a big step-up in the second half. So maybe just the mix moving around a lot more capital equipment, Q1, huge consumables bounce in the second half has something to do with TSA roll off. Any kind of moving parts in AHS margins through the year? Chuck McLaughlin : Well, first of all, I think that we had -- I thought we had a good margin expansion year-on-year in AHS. I think a couple of hundred basis points in all three of our segments. But I think there is, versus maybe our guide, we were a little bit light. And that has to do with elective surgeries being down in Q1 versus where we thought, but also really the mix of really having a great capital placement, hardware placement, growing our installed base there. And that's -- I see that as an investment in the future. But that's probably what's going on in the first half. And then as elective surgeries improved from where they're at right now at probably 91% in Q1, we'll see a further margin lift. But I have -- we have ASP, which where most of those comments we're talking about as we move through there, I have good margin expansion for the year, well over 100, pushing 200 basis points. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks. Good evening, everybody. Chuck McLaughlin : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, two for me. Just back on the investments, I want to kind of think about the payback side of that equation. Jim, you mentioned a $250 million opportunity. Is that off the spend we're talking about this year? Or does that encompass some of the accelerated spending you were talking about that sort of happened last year? Maybe you could just frame that up for us. And is that kind of a three or four year out number? Just some perspective there for starters. Thanks. Jim Lico : Yes. Sure. I think, number one, is the $250 million is a combination of some of the things we did last year and this year, some of the projects. If we think about really specific to the FORT, Jeff, when we think about the FORT, we're really talking about a combination of projects that I would say are more about 50-50 right now, but moving more to customer focus, but about 50 of internal productivity projects that are really driving better -- better digital transformation within our own operations. And then the other half are really commercial offerings that are going to result. So the revenue opportunity is all tied to those commercial opportunities. There are a couple of years out. So we'll start to see some of that revenue in terms of opportunity. That's the market opportunity, by the way. So we think we start to get some of that in the back half of this year. I would think, all in all, when you think more broadly about the $35 million, there's a combination of investments that are certainly multi-year. I can talk more about that. But I think when we think about some of the investments with Pioneer Square Labs, those are really -- those are early-stage innovation that are really probably three or four years out. So the four investments are a little bit more near term, next year or two, maybe three. PSL investments maybe four, four years out, where they make a meaningful impact. Jeff Sprague : And just so I fully understand. So there's $250 million of revenue, you believe, that obviously would have some profit drop through. But then there's, on top of that, some pure profit productivity fall through from what you're working on, right? Can you size that at all? Jim Lico : Yes. It's pretty tough to size right now because some of it is just inherent in kind of how we just think about productivity on a regular basis. So I would say if we were to think about it, it could be as much as $5 million to $10 million in the next 12 to 18 months, probably on the productivity side. The $250 million, by the way, is kind of sort of market opportunity. So we ought to think about that as we're putting ourselves into an opportunity to gain share in a new part of the served market of $250 million. Jeff Sprague : Got it. And just one more for me. On AHS, the M&A impact was bigger than I was expecting in the quarter and a little bit bigger than I was expecting in the Q2 guide. I don't know if I missed something. Or is there something going on with TSAs rolling on that you're counting as M&A? Maybe you could just elaborate on the composition of the acquisition contribution in AHS. Chuck McLaughlin : Yes. Jeff, what you're seeing there, what we're counting is M&A growth is really just what you theorize. It's the roll-off of the day two countries from the TSA. We don't count those as core growth. And so that's just -- and now as we completed that largely at the end of the fourth quarter, you're going to see that step up as top line growth. And it falls through roughly at the fleet average of operating margin. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Chuck McLaughlin : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys, how are you doing? Chuck McLaughlin : Good. Steve Tusa : Can you maybe just talk about how much of your portfolio is leveraged to -- just remind us how much is leverage to kind of semiconductor CapEx? Jim Lico : Well, we're probably, all up, in the total company, it's about 5% of our sales is semiconductor. And I would say probably 80% of that is sort of what I would say, not -- it's -- I'll call it, non-CapEx in the sense that you don't need it to build a manufacturing plant. Some of our performance scopes that are used in design are obviously expensive, and so they would be a capital project. But the -- but if your question is more along the lines of, as we see new fabs may be coming online, typically not in that sort of CapEx. The most of the CapEx that we have in the company is related to either what we have in Sensing Tech or what we have at Keithley within Tektronix. Steve Tusa : Right. Okay. And then the other thing is just on the acquisition pipeline. What's the flavor of that? Is it still kind of -- is it smaller software deals? Is it -- are there different kind of types of business models you can go into on the hardware side? What are you seeing out there that's kind of most pressing? Jim Lico : Yes. I think I would say the breadth is pretty good right now. I mean, we said 2020 was mostly going to be a bolt-on year anyway because of kind of what we had to do relative to the Vontier separation and what we had to do with getting ASP up and running. With that behind us and the balance sheet in really good shape, I think, we've got far more degrees of freedom to really pursue a range of opportunities within hardware and software. So I think we love the ehsAI deal that we did. We mentioned it in the prepared remarks, while it's small, it's really given us great machine learning capability. You certainly could see more of those kinds of things to really extend ourselves from a feature perspective within our software and data analytics portfolio. But hardware is still \u2013 certainly, lots of places are from a hardware perspective, from an IoT standpoint that we would also take within our opportunity set. So I think it's pretty broad. You can never predict which one is going to happen, but I think at the end of the day, there's a number of things out there that could be potentially exciting. Can't predict when deals get done, but feel good about where we're at right now. Steve Tusa : All right. Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate it. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hi. Yes, good afternoon. Chuck McLaughlin : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Can I just ask a question? It seems that nobody has asked for details around the growth investment. Can you just expand on what exactly it is? And why did you pull the trigger right now? Jim Lico : Yes. I think, number one, I'll take the second one. We pulled the trigger right now because we saw the opportunity with the revenue line coming up and seeing probably be more -- starting the year, obviously, we start -- last year, we're a little bit more conservative. But with another quarter of seeing some trends, we feel good where the top line is at and feel like we're in an environment here where we want to make sure that we lean into some of these opportunities. So that's number one. We've done this over time. And I think with the kind of financial results we posted relative to earnings growth and what we still have, even with that spend in terms of earnings growth and cash flow, we're in a very good position in which to play significant offense in a number of our businesses. I would say the range of investments is really sort of 58% of it is really giving our operating companies, several of our operating companies, more latitude to raise their R&D spend around the innovation ideas that they've got. And we can -- we'll certainly give you more color around that at our Investor Day as well. That's about half of the spend. The other half is in the FORT and in Pioneer Square Labs. So the FORT is really about expanding our data analytics capability. We talked a little bit about that a second ago in Jeff's question. Relative to Pioneer Square Labs, Andrew, we always thought that, that investment -- those investments would be -- we would do a bunch of ideas. As it turns out, the first three ideas we've had are actually getting accelerated funding because they've been pretty good. I'll give you a couple of ideas of what that means. One of them is our TeamSense investment, which is really around connected worker communications technology and how -- and really helping hourly workers be more connected in the work that they do every day. The other one is in condition-based monitoring communications. Think of it as a Nuance for the industrial market, if you know the deal that Microsoft did. So those are the kinds of investments that we're making, and we're just accelerating those investments because we're seeing the opportunity that those might play out here over time. As I mentioned on the answer with Jeff, these are longer-term deals, so they aren't necessarily that's going to give us a lot of revenue next year. But most of those investments we've already made, so it's really about accelerating the investments for the years to come. Andrew Obin : Gotcha. And my follow-up question. Can you just talk collectively about how the SaaS businesses are doing? So bookings, churn, pipeline of deals, whatever you want to share with us. Jim Lico : Yes. We had a very good SaaS quarter, so that's in the prepared remarks. Across the board, every one of our SaaS businesses grew double digit -- in total, grew double digits, but I think every one of them grew their SaaS business at double digits. So very good position in which to do that and we expect to grow SaaS this year double digits. So we want to continue to invest in those businesses. You also heard several examples in the prepared remarks of how FBS is really generating value in those business today, I think, as well. So I think that's how we feel like the performing bookings were good as well. So we feel like we're in a very good position. Relative to software, in general, we're starting to see some of the remote -- some of the on-site services start to come back at a more accelerated rate, although still a long way to go. But as we said in the - that Accruent actually grew all up in the quarter. I think that's a good showing, if you will. Gordian, flat. Both of those on the back of service getting better, still not great, but we like the trend. So I think overall, we're in a very good position across the board. And we're -- some of the investments we just talked about are our investments in those businesses as well. Andrew Obin : Fantastic. Thank you so much. Jim Lico : Thanks, Andrew. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Hi, guys. Hope both well. I want to come back to the temporary costs coming through in Q2 and really the sequential impact because, obviously, margins stepping down as folks have already talked about. If I add the $60 million year-over-year impact to SG&A from last year, it looks like your point to SG&A about 4 75 for 2Q. So the step up Q1, Q2 has been in the range of about 45 to 50. Is that even close to being right? Jim Lico : Yes. I think that sounds approximately right. Keep in mind that in a normal year, there's a step up between Q1 and Q2. So it's not all -- some of that's normal seasonality that you see here. As you can imagine, some spending and -- gets off to a slower start in January than you are in April. And then I also talked about how, as we open up, there's going to be more activity as you move through the year. Nigel Coe : And I don't think we've talked about supply chain in a lot of depth here. Is that having any impact whatsoever in terms of your planning for Q2 or Q3? Jim Lico : Nigel, we -- I think, first -- I think the quick answer to that is it's in our guide. So we -- we've done a nice job. I think, historically, it's such an important part of FBS over time has been a set of supply chain tools to mitigate the kinds of issues that are out there today. They're well documented, so I won't get into them. But I think there's two -- they come in two ways, though. They come in the form of supplier issues and then the other is global logistics challenges. We've mitigated those challenges for the most part in the quarter and have continued to mitigate those and have mitigation strategies. So I think on the backs of that, we feel good about the guide. We obviously beat revenue in the quarter despite having those challenges, what I think is a great demonstration of how well we mitigated those. We continue to believe we can mitigate those through in the quarters to come. And I don't think they necessarily go away. So I think an old -- this is from an old supply chain guy from 30 years ago, but I think at the end of the day, I think they'll be there for the remainder of the year, but we feel good about the work we're doing. Daily management, Chuck and I review those things every month in our operating review. So we're on top of them, and we're continuing to watch them. But I think at the end of the day, we feel good about our mitigation strategies. Nigel Coe : Thanks, Jim. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Jim Lico : Yes. Thanks, Nigel. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, guys. Jim, maybe you could give us an update on your expectations by region for 2021 in the sense that China, as you said, had really strong growth here, continuing to look better than North America. But how much of those results are just easier comparisons given the progress of COVID? And then are you seeing a material inflection at this point in sales rates in North America? Are there any portions of the world that worry you in terms of COVID hotspots? Jim Lico : Yes. I think China will be probably our best grower of the year. You're right, comps did have something to do with it in the quarter, but we were much better even on a two-year stack. So we feel good about the work we've done in China to build the businesses there, and we think that's -- we'll have a good growth year there. I think Western Europe was -- and North America will continue. North America -- Western Europe was obviously pretty good. We like the trends in POS that we talked about. And a number of our newer businesses, like Intelex and Accruent have had good European growth because they really didn't have a European business, and we really invested in that growth. So I think a lot of what you're hearing in the Western Europe are good numbers as well as really our new investments in some of the acquisitions that didn't have as much of a presence in Europe. So I think -- so I think Western Europe, hard to tell, given kind of the hotspots that are going on right now. But we still think we'll have a pretty good year in Western Europe. I think North America will continue to get better. It will broach our best geography probably. We saw -- we started off a little slower in North America in January, but we progressively got a little bit better each month. Some of that, I think, had to do with some of the COVID issues that existed. You heard us talk about the overall COVID number at 91. In the U.S., it was back to the 80s in January in terms of elective procedures. So that got back in the 90, over 90 in March. So I think when we look at North America, a lot of conditions for growth really continued to progress through the quarter. We would expect North America to continue to get better for the year. And then relative to the hotspots, we don't have a lot of revenue in India or Latin America. But those are certainly going to be big challenges for the world for any global business, I think, particularly in the days and weeks and months to come. We don't have a lot of exposure there today. And so we'll continue to do what we can to mitigate, but I don't anticipate that has much impact to our overall business through the year. Andy Kaplowitz : And Jim, I wanted to focus for a second on Intelex in the sense that you -- it seems like you've built this pretty big EHS platform, and Intelex has continued to have very strong growth. So I would imagine it can actually accelerate further given stimulus funding, greater focus on sustainability, and you're working on it with FBS. But maybe you could talk about the growth potential of this platform going forward. Jim Lico : Yes. I mean, I think we've had -- we love the team. We started and really our big investment in EHS started with the work we did at ISC and our overall EHS effort now with the SAFER Systems acquisition, the ehsAI acquisition now. As you say, we've really built out a portfolio that really can take advantage of the secular drivers around sustainability and, quite frankly, worker safety. And so we feel good about that. I think the Intelex platform itself adds tremendous value. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we use it for our own sustainability assessment, and it's a wonderful tool to help us understand how to think about goal setting and how to drive action to really improve, not just report on sustainability, but more importantly, take action. So I think we feel very good about the platform. We think there's investment opportunities in the future that we can make. So I think relative specifically to your question, Intelex has been a double-digit grower for us. It's mostly been in the teens. I think as we continue to build on it, really, as we hit the accelerator with some of the machine learning opportunities that we've really got with ehsAI, we'll start to see some of those things in the back half of the year. I think we can continue to move that growth rate. I'd like to think we can go beyond that. But I think in the near-term, we certainly think it's a double-digit grower for sure. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color, Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Jim Lico : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good afternoon. Jim Lico : Good afternoon. Deane Dray : Hey, I want to circle back on the implications of getting more site access. Could you give us a sense of maybe on a percent basis, how much has opened up? But more importantly, what are the implications? Is there a pent-up business that really has been depending on being able to get back in? Should we think about a catch-up here? Jim Lico : Yes. Look, I think site access comes in the way of two -- it comes in the form of two ways. Number one, I think on our -- anywhere where we have service businesses, but let's call it, non-healthcare. We certainly -- we've gone remote capability, but it takes longer to turn customers on and software as an example. And so I think there is some pent-up demand. But I think, to be honest with you, Deane, we've had such little access here over the last several months that it's hard to predict how quickly it will open up, particularly when you think about that on a global basis. So we certainly believe it's going to continue to improve, but I wouldn't say necessarily that we think it's going to all be better by the end of the year. We just don't have enough visibility yet to -- I think most customers aren't really opening up here until maybe the third quarter. So I think it's still a little early to predict it. But I think the predictions that we have are really based on some of the trends we've seen, which we feel good about. But I think they could get better if we could see vaccinations get more prolific here and start to see more opening up of businesses. So that's on -- that's everywhere from Gordian and Accruent to eMaint to those -- even like our Tektronix Calibration business, which some of it is on site. On the healthcare side, we certainly think that we can continue to have access. We're in hospitals today doing service for the most part, but everything is a little slower. We mentioned in the Censis prepared remarks, though, that we are starting to see purchasing decisions free up a little faster. And again, that's all built into our guide as well that we think we continue to get better. But I think at the end of the day, it is because pockets in the United States plus the nations, it's really too hard -- it's still a little difficult to necessarily predict exactly how that opens up in a sense of any of the pent-up demand, if you will. Deane Dray : Great. And then just for a follow-up. I think I heard in Chuck's prepared remarks that there was 90 basis points of price realization. Was that for the company as a whole? Was it a particular product or business? And then just broadly, how are you thinking about price at this stage? I mean, every conference call we're hearing, people are putting through pricing mostly to combat material cost inflation, which you said is not that big of an issue for you, but is there \u2013 is this a time to wield pricing power? Chuck McLaughlin : So Dean, this is Chuck. The 90 basis points, you heard that correctly for Q1. That was across the company, but fairly uniformly. I mean, there wasn't -- it wasn't 1 company and not a bunch of others. I think that price cost, we've been able to stay ahead of. But we -- it's something we look at every month, and we're going to continue -- it's an evolving situation. We'll continue to look at that and expect to -- one of the levers, it's not the only lever, but it's one of the levers at this point is looking to continue to push on price in this environment. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Jim Lico : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good evening, guys. Just a follow-up on Deane's question on stores that's reopening. I noticed you kind of abandoned the four buckets of kind of COVID sensitivity. But if you think about what's sort of coming online now versus what's been kind of normalized for a while, how do we think about mix within that? Is that positive mix? Kind of fleet average? How does that evolve? Jim Lico : Yes. I would say mix is probably positive, probably the short answer, Josh. When you think about our -- for the most part, our software service businesses are pretty profitable. So they might be a little bit less than SaaS, but on balance, they're still pretty good. And then the other part is consumables. And our consumable revenue is, as we said in the first quarter, with all \u2013 with the tremendous success that we had on the equipment side, we had -- we didn't have -- and we didn't have as much on the consumable side. As consumables come back, that's a margin, as Chuck articulated a few questions ago, that's a good thing for AHS. So I think on balance, if I were to take the corporation as a whole, getting on site is probably a margin enhancer. And quite frankly, on the software side, we need to do the installation to get to the SaaS software. So in some respects, if it can accelerate the move to software, then it's probably almost all margin upside. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, just in terms of the second half outlook, we pencil out kind of 4%, I think, implied organic growth. That sounds like sort of through the cycle number rather than still kind of in the recovery mode. Is that sort of assuming that there's some kind of stealth tough comps from things that got pent-up in 2Q and release? Or is that really what this portfolio, given all the advancement changes you made over the past five years, should be growing at, I don't know, still a mid-innings version of the recovery? Chuck McLaughlin : Josh, this is Chuck. I'll try the first part of that. In the second half, keep in mind, when you look at our first half, second half, we were down 11% in the first half last year and almost flat in the second half last year. So we have, in the second half, I think we said in the prepared remarks, 5% to 7% core growth. So we think that's an acceleration. But the math you're doing about how the portfolio is going to perform, I think -- we're not saying we're all the way back or that we're into the -- a massive recovery. We're just saying we see continued sequential improvement as we go through the year. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Jim Lico : Hi, John. John Walsh : Hi there. I guess maybe following up on that question a little bit, thinking about the Fluke portfolio. If I remember a couple of analyst days ago, you were very excited about not kind of just selling the tool, but also selling some recurring data solutions associated with it. Can you talk about if customers are taking that up as they're reopening their facilities, is that an opportunity to drive that kind of penetration higher? Jim Lico : Yes, John. Number one, we -- I think we've seen some of that growth and, quite frankly, resiliency in the eMaint sales that we've had and some of the work we've done on Fluke Connect. I mentioned in the prepared remarks a new line of clamp meters that comes out that's connected. So we still continue to launch connected devices, which I think gives us, even in a tough environment, gives us market share opportunity. And we do think that we're still in the very early stages of customers really collecting that data in order to put it to use. So we've got some -- as you probably remember, the PRUFTECHNIK acquisition was to give us more vibration capability, vibration data analysis capability, so we can provide better answers to customers relative to their vibration -- how vibration works in predictive and preventive maintenance. So very early days, but we are starting to see some adoption of that. And I would suspect, as we start to get into an environment where manufacturing gets in better shape, we'll start to see acceleration of that. And what's great is we're building a platform for that with eMaint, and we've been building that business very well over the last couple of years, while customers still are adopting some of these other solutions. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe just as a follow-on. You brought up the Analyst Day you'll be hosting, should we expect kind of a deeper dive into the businesses? Or should we expect some kind of potential longer-term targets being put out and/or updated? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes. I think that you could probably -- you should expect both of those things. We certainly want to continue to -- we've resegmented here, so we're going to want to give more visibility and greater understanding of the great things that we think we're doing with the portfolio. And so you're going to see some of that, among other things. And then if you remember two years ago in terms of forward looks, we gave some forward-look metrics that I think that stood up pretty well. And you can expect for us to do something similar to that. Don't want to give away everything. I want to make sure that we leave something for the Investor Day. But those things are going to be there. John Walsh : Great. Thank you very much. Jim Lico : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Graham with Fortive. Scott Graham : Hey, good afternoon. I guess I work at Fortive now. So the -- I think that's what she said, identifying [Multiple Speakers] my firm. Thank you. I appreciate it. Very nice trend. I have just two questions for you. The OMX numbers were really strong this quarter, up 200 basis points each segment. Chuck, can you unbundle that for us a little bit? I know you said price cost is positive, but what are some of the other things that were driving that number? Chuck McLaughlin : Well, strong growth also -- is something that, as we talked about -- and it's across all our segments. So when we have growth, we have really strong gross margins, and that's probably, first and foremost, the thing that I'd point to. I think that ASP is really starting to hit their stride here with -- as they come off the TSAs, that gave us a lift. But across the board, growth and price, it leads to a good outcome here. Scott Graham : Is that a number that you think you can sustain for the rest of the year? Chuck McLaughlin : I think -- well, with over 200 basis points of OMX, yes, remember, we're coming in -- we're looking at a pandemic last year. I wouldn't want to get thinking that's what we're going to do every year. But I do think that as we go through the year, 100 to 200 basis points of OMX for the year is something that's well within our grasp. Scott Graham : That's great. Thanks. And then the other question was simply from back when you bought Gordian and then you bought Accruent, it just seemed like a really large field for M&A. And whether with site access or otherwise, just look like you need a little bit of time to operate the businesses and what have you. Is now a time -- with both of these businesses are looking really much better in each of the last couple of quarters, is this a time now where we can start to look for you guys to do something more in that area -- those areas? Jim Lico : Yes. Scott, it's Jim. I think, number one, we've never stopped looking. So I would say both businesses, Gordian has been just a benchmark for FBS in a business and in an acquisition in a short period of time. The team there has done an outstanding job. Accruent has also done a very good job. And I think you're -- from a standpoint of positions, we certainly had to get through last year given some of the things that were going on in the business and just make -- COVID was not easy to try to get on site and do some of those things. But we're proud of where we are today. And I think we're certainly always active in looking for things that can accelerate. I think on the Gordian side, we have a very under-penetrated market. Real opportunity to continue to really live -- do that, accelerate our data. We have a great data business there. Globalizing Gordian, great opportunities. It's almost exclusively a North American business. So on the current side, there's a breadth of products within occurrence of a broader portfolio given the way it was built by private equity. So a variety of different areas from CMMS to facilities management to asset management to -- as people come back to the workplace, tools and technologies to help companies bring people back into the office and do that safely. So yes, I think there's a wide range of opportunities. Those are very good secular and popular -- great secular drivers and popular secular drivers. So certainly, we'll -- there's plenty of opportunities for us to do things. We'll be disciplined in that approach to do things that we really think can leverage the growth opportunities futuristically and really accelerate strategy. And I think those businesses are in a good position to do that in -- right now. Scott Graham : Well, thank you. Appreciate it. Jim Lico : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, love to just get your perspective on two dynamics up there. One is just for the proposed infrastructure listing that's build that the SMEs proposed. Could you just maybe talk about what sort of impact that could potentially have for your company? And specifically, I guess, where do you think those benefits would stack up? And then secondly, related to this, there's also proposed tax increase from corporations. How do you think that plays out to you folks? Jim Lico : Yes. I think -- I mean, I think on the infrastructure side, certainly an infrastructure build that puts money into facilities and what we call general infrastructure is going to help Fluke and it's certainly going to help our Accruent and Gordian business for sure. Certainly, probably, as we think about our Sensing businesses as well. So a good -- as we think about investments in EV and AV, Tektronix has got a good automotive offering that will help. So we certainly think that there are opportunities. How quickly that occurs? I think is still a question as we think about some of -- how the stimulus gets spent. As we often talk about the term shovel-ready and how shovel-ready. But certainly, a good portion of the portfolio is exposed to some of those opportunities. Nearer term, to the extent that these investments go into healthcare and helping hospitals deal with some of the challenges they've had, that certainly is probably a near-term opportunity for us as we continue to sell into hospitals through all of our AHS businesses. So I think in that sense, lots of opportunity for us, but obviously, it's still very early days. We'll look forward to seeing some of those things play out. But I -- and obviously, get into law and then get spent. So still early days, but we do feel the portfolio is well exposed to some of that additional spending. And I'll let Chuck comment on the tax part. Chuck McLaughlin : On taxes, at this point, we don't expect any changes for this year, although there's still months to go in the year, but we don't expect that to happen. But we note -- we note the direction that everything is going and that there would likely be upward pressure. But we're going to need to the details of what really gets agreed upon because that's what really matter here. But given the global nature of our business and how we're set up, I'd like -- what I'd like to believe is that we're going to maintain a relative position to our tax rate relative to our peers. So there'll be upward pressure, but I still think we'll be advantaged given our structure. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Chuck McLaughlin : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Chuck McLaughlin : Hey, Joe. Joe Giordano : Hey. Good evening, guys. You might have touched on this when you were talking about Accruent earlier, I just went out of my office for a second, so my apologies. But I'm just curious like you bought -- you really stepped up your investment in kind of these SaaS platforms and these software platforms a couple of years ago. We've had some time with them now. Like as we're looking at the balance sheet ready to deploy, what have you learned from how to invest into those types of businesses? Like where do you think you did really well, maybe you've learned over the last three years there? Jim Lico : Well, yes. I think we -- in some of the prepared remarks, I think we tried to give some examples of how FBS is really applying to some of the businesses. We'll give a deeper view of that as we get to the Investor Day. But I think, Joe, for sure, what we've learned is the FBS tools were, I would say, somewhat tuned to software when we bought the businesses, but what we've really adapted and really built now is a set of tools that is very specific to helping businesses drive commercial activity, drive digital engagement and improve net retention, net dollar retention, which is such an important metric within software businesses. So I think not -- we always had the tools for software R&D development. So I think those tools we could put into the business, but I think our commercial tools have just been built exceptionally well now to accelerate the capability of the organizations that come into Fortive. So that's -- I think that's what we've learned. I think we also understand what good looks like. Obviously, the multiples that we paid at the time, people looked at it. But I think as we now know that investments in things like property, tech and other places, EHS are -- and today, look like bargains from what we -- what we paid a few years ago compared to multiples now. So I think we were advanced in understanding that. But we also understand what good looks like at a deeper level, in terms of customer engagement, the kinds of metrics that you want to understand when you look at and do due diligence in the business. And I think we've just then continued to improve our due diligence capability to really understand what good looks like, and I think that really helps long term in terms of getting financial returns. So I think a lot of learning, for sure, I wouldn't, any way, shape or form, say anything about that. But -- and I think that leads to us feeling very good about our ability to get to create value and to really get good returns from our investments as we move forward. And I would add that -- try to also say is that we're not just talking about spending our capital here in the future around software. We continue to look for hardware and service opportunities as well where we think we can add value and accelerate our strategy. Joe Giordano : That's really helpful color. One quick follow-up, but not really a follow-up, totally different, I guess. But when I think about ASP, how do you characterize kind of like the roll off of COVID-specific opportunities that you guys picked up during this time like -- as like a negative offset just obviously picking up your regular business? Jim Lico : Well, I think the question is -- it's hard to think about pent-up demand when you start to think about surgical centers and ORs doubling the number of surgeries in a particular month, that feels a little scary. So I think at the end of the day, we think that one of the things that I think was really stellar in the quarter was the fact that despite COVID being at 91%, and COVID, quite frankly, relative to pre-COVID levels of elective procedures, it was a decel from Q4, and yet our consumables was flat in the quarter. And that really is about our growth in installed base. So Chuck used the word hitting our stride. I think we've done some really good commercial work to build the installed base, so that our consumables and service revenue will accelerate when we come back and get above COVID rates -- so COVID, pre-COVID rates \u2013 so \u2013 on elective procedures. So we can't predict that that -- particularly on a global basis, where that's going to be here in the coming months, but we've been certainly building the infrastructure, building the customer base to be able to take advantage of that opportunity when things normalize within hospitals. And we really hope that, that happens quickly for all -- for reasons well beyond our financial success, but much more about the communities in which we serve and the hospitals and customers in which we work with every day. So I think at the end of the day, we feel very good about where that business is positioned. And we do think there'll be opportunities. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, along with Censis, we're seeing -- we're starting to see some things open up, but I think we're still a long way from getting to pre-COVID levels on a global basis. Joe Giordano : Thanks, guys. Chuck McLaughlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over for closing remarks. Jim Lico : Thanks, Pasha, and thank you, everyone, for today, and thanks for taking the time to spend with us. We know this is a busy week and a busy season for all of you. I think as you heard Chuck and I talk through the quarter in terms of the prepared remarks as well as some of the Q&A, we feel we're incredibly proud of the work that went into Q1. We feel like we're incredibly well positioned from an organic perspective. The work we did in 2020 to really stabilize and have -- what we did in the first -- second half of last year is just really showing up in the first quarter and showing up in the remaining part of the year. We're excited about having the opportunity to share with you all of what we see every day more deeply with our people and our team as well as our strategies at our Investor Day in May. We look forward to seeing you then. We hope you're all safe and healthy, and we look forward to answering any questions and follow up. Griffin and Chuck and Ross are available for follow-ups as you see fit. Have a great evening, have a great -- and have great rest of the earnings season. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. We were very pleased with our second quarter results. As you can see on Slide 3, our performance once again highlighted the benefits of our strategy to provide differentiated connected workflow solutions for our customers, creating a portfolio with enhanced resilience and long-term earnings power. During the quarter, we capitalized on accelerating point of sale trends across a number of our larger businesses, continued growth from our software offerings and improving conditions across our key end markets. Against this backdrop, we delivered core revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margins that exceeded the high end of our guidance driving exceptional earnings growth and free cash flow conversion.  As we highlighted at our Investor Day on May 19, we are building on the foundation of our advantaged hardware positions and expanding our software capabilities to address our customers' critical workflow needs and accelerate their ongoing digital transformation. In the second quarter, our SaaS offerings delivered low double-digit growth and we also drove significant improvement across our professional services offerings. We continue to see strong momentum at EMA including increasing demand from its expansion into the food and beverage, pharmaceutical and healthcare verticals.  Gordian and Accruent both had strong quarters as they executed on opportunities provided by increasing demand from facility owner operators and improvements in access to customer sites. Both companies are well positioned to capitalize as customers focused on post COVID return to work challenges and digital transformation priorities. Censis, also performed very well in the quarter as access to hospital customers improved executing on strong demand for its SaaS offerings among existing and new independent delivery network customers. Looking across the portfolio, we continue to be excited about our expanding offering of EHR workflow solutions, which are well positioned to meet the significant long-term sustainability requirements of our customers. ISC and Intelex performed well, capitalizing on strong broad based growth across end markets in key geographies. At the same time, we are excited with the early progress at EH [ph] FAI where the Company closed its largest deal to date and its first joint marketing campaign with Intelex and generated strong growth in the sales pipeline. Throughout the second quarter, we continue to apply the Fortive Business System across the portfolio to drive innovation, growth and share gains. Deployment of our lean portfolio management tool set, which significantly accelerates the efficiency and impact of R&D investments achieved a greater than 40% increase in our on-time program delivery, the application of FBS and digital analytics in search, optimization generated 25% growth in digital traffic from pre-pandemic levels across the portfolio. Meanwhile, the use of FBS growth tools has accelerate innovation at Fluke Health Solutions. Over the past 18 months and continues to drive excellent top line performance.  We have created good early momentum in our partnership with Pioneer Square labs, including the recent spin in of TeamSense a provider of innovative workflow solutions to streamline communications with hourly workers. This marks the first business incubated Pioneer Square labs to be integrated into the Fortive portfolio while still very early, we are pleased with the progress of our TeamSense and are excited to develop additional technologies that accelerates Safety and Productivity solutions for customers within our core markets. In early July, we announced the acquisition of service channel. The transaction brings a differentiated high growth software business with an integrated service provider network and significant proprietary data assets to the portfolio, enhancing our ability to meet the evolving needs of facility owners around the world. Following the expected closing of the acquisition in Q3, we will have significant balance sheet capacity supported by our strong and resilient free cash flow generation. As we highlighted at our Investor Day we see substantial runway across our $40 billion served market for disciplined capital allocation to accelerate our strategy.  Turning to a quick summary of the results in the quarter on Slide 4, we generated, year-over-year total revenue growth of 26.7% as revenue strength exceeded the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, while adjusted earnings per share was $0.66, representing a year-over-year increase of 53.5% given the outperformance for both top line and our adjusted operating margin, we delivered $282 million of free cash flow, which represented 118% conversion of adjusted net income. On Slide 5, we take a closer look at the Intelligent Operating Solutions segment. IOS posted total revenue growth of 31.2% in the second quarter. This included mid-20% core growth in North America, low 30% core quarter growth in Western Europe and low 20% core growth in China. Fluke core revenue increased in the mid-30% range. Fluke also grew by mid-single digits on a sequential basis as a continue to see robust demand across its businesses, highlighted by growth at Fluke Industrial. Fluke Industrial generated share gains across a range of key channel partners and retail counts as point of sale accelerated through the quarter. Fluke\u2019s broader II900 acoustic imaging product line also continues to perform very well as revenue approximately doubled in the quarter and strong growth across both Western Europe in North America.  Fluke Networks also performed well driven by the recent launch of its link IQ product line, which continues to exceed initial expectations tied to office reopenings and network modifications. The Fluke reliability, our efforts to accelerate performance improved of PRUFTECHNIK are gaining traction as we took advantage of increasing demand for alignment and other services. While EMAY [ph] also delivered another strong quarter. With the accelerated pace of orders at Fluke, we did see some backlog build due to supply chain responsiveness. Industrial Scientific increased by Mid-teens driven by strong execution and instruments and rental as demand from oil and gas markets rebounded and the business continued its expansion into new end markets. The company's INET offering remained resilient increasing by mid-single digits with net retention solidly above 100%. Intelex grew by high single digits in Q2 reporting a record revenue quarter. Intelex continues to leverage FBS and has driven improvements in lead generation and funnel conversion. Also in the second quarter Intelex closed multiple deals for its enhanced ESG platform to help customers launch scale and optimize their sustainability programs and meet increasing demand for transparency on a growing set of critical non-financial reporting metrics. Accruent grew by mid-single digits in the second quarter with low double-digit growth in its SaaS business. Accruent generated strong sales and bookings for its Meridian solution for engineering document management and its maintenance connection CMS offering. The business also capitalize on the strong demand for its EMS, Event workspace and resource scheduling offerings as Company's plan and execute their return to work strategies. The company continues to generate new customer logo wins and improving growth in recurring bookings. Importantly Accruent also delivered improved performance and its professional service business which generated mid-single-digit growth as customer site access continue to improve. Gordian increased by Mid-teens driven by low 20% growth in the procurement business and high-teens growth in estimating. Gordian generated a record month for procurement revenue in June with accelerating timelines for key projects across a number of large customers. This included increased project spend by the New York City Department of Education and school construction authority.  Moving to Slide 6, Precision Technologies segment posted a total revenue increase of 25.1% in the second quarter. This included low 20% growth in North America, mid 20% growth in Western Europe and mid-teens growth in China. Tektronix increased by approximately 30% with another quarter of strong demand across its product businesses including accelerating point of sale trends in each of its major regions. Both mainstream and performance of scopes had a strong quarter with high demand for semiconductor industrial manufacturing and communications applications. Tektronix service business again showed its stability and resilience increasing by low teens. Tektronix continues to benefit from the accelerated focus on driving innovation Q2 new product introductions performing very well, including its family of automated test solutions for high-speed data transfer.  In the second quarter Tektronix held 6 regional innovation form events which stimulated the adoption of it's TechSo [ph] platform resulting accelerated funnel creation for the company's broader hardware and software offerings. Sensing Technologies increased by low teens in the second quarter with growth driven by continuation of the broad market recovery. Sensing performed very well in China, with another quarter of mid-teens growth driven by demand for factory automation solutions. Elsewhere Anderson Negele continues to make progress with its approval of its paperless process recorder IoT solution aimed at the dairy industry with broader commercial rollout expected in the second half of the year. Sensing also continues to drive market share gains across elsewhere across the portfolio, particularly cetera led by its differentiated Critical Environments solution and strong demand across its HVAC customers. PacSci EMC grew in the low 20% range with the business seen some alleviation of the COVID related shutdowns and approval delays that impacted shipments in previous quarters. PacSci EMC continue to see good growth in the commercial space market with the resumption of launches by OneWeb providing recurring revenue for smart controllers and initiators. Also on July 20, we were excited to watch the company's mission critical technology ensures safe and reliable separation of Blue Origin's New Shepard capsule from its booster during its maiden voyage.  Moving to Advanced Healthcare Solutions on Slide 7. Total revenue increased 21.8% including 11% core growth. This included high single-digit core growth in each of North America, Western Europe and China markets. ASP grew by high single digits in the second quarter, led by strong growth in Western Europe and China. ASP also realized improved growth in North America, highlighted by high single-digit growth in the US. Overall ASP consumable revenue high teens as the rate of elective procedures across most geographies continue to improve. Our elective procedure volumes increased on a year-over-year basis. Q2 volumes came in a bit lower than expected at approximately 93% of pre-COVID levels which was consistent with the Q1 exit rate. ASP also continue to expand its global installed base of terminal sterilization capital equipment which grew at a 3.5% annualized rate in Q2, we expect to continue to installed base expansion to provide an additional tailwind to consumable revenue as procedure volumes normalize going forward. Sensus increased in the mid-20% range with mid-teens growth in sense attract SaaS offering as well as strong growth in its professional services business. Many hospital customers are now allowing access to vendors, which resulted in a significant increase in activity in the second quarter, particularly with integrated delivery networks. Fluke Health Solutions increased by low-double digits, even at that lapped the sizable COVID related revenue tailwind in the prior year, FHS the high-teens growth from its optimized in 1QA, software solutions, which benefited from accelerated growth investments over the last 18 months.  With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will take you through some additional details on our margins, free cash flow and balance sheet. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered solid margin performance in Q2, driven primarily by strong fall through on our revenue outperformance. Adjusted gross margins were 57.3%, up 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This increase reflected 130 basis points of price realization as we delivered another quarter of solid performance, managing price cost across the portfolio.  Q2 adjusted operating profit margin was 22.2%, a 170 basis points above the high end of our guidance also driven by stronger volume and high associated fall through. We reported 240 basis points of core operating margin expansion, including 570 basis points of core OMX at the IOS segment. Both Fluke and Tektronix delivered strong core operating margin expansion through disciplined outpatient of FBS to drive sales conversion as demand accelerated across their end markets. At the same time strong contributions from some of the acquired pieces of our portfolio including IOC, Gordian, Censis and Landauer also contributed to the margin outperformance across the segments.  On Slide 8, you can see that in the second quarter, we generated $282 million of free cash flow, representing a 118% conversion of adjusted net income. Free cash flow over the trailing 12 months increased 15% to $943 million. Today, our net leverage is approximately 1 times and we expect net leverage to be around 1.2 times at year-end including the funding of the acquisition of service channel but excluding any additional M&A. This gives us significant capacity to continue to deploy towards our key capital allocation priorities.  Turning now to the guidance on Slide 9, given the strong performance in the second quarter and the improvement in our outlook for the rest of the year we are once again raising our 2021 guidance. For the full year we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.65 to $2.75, representing a year-over-year growth of 27% to 32% on a continuing operations basis. This assumes total revenue growth of 13.5% to 15%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22.5% to 23.5% and an effective tax rate of 14% to 14.5%. It also assumes total revenue growth of 8.5% to 11% in the second half of 2021. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the full year. We are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.62 to $0.66, representing year-over-year growth of 24% to 32%. This assumes total revenue growth of 11.5% to 14.5%, adjusted operating profit margin of 21.5% to 22.5% and an effective tax rate of 14% to 14.5%. For the third quarter we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income. With that I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks. Jim Lico : Thanks, Chuck. Before we move to questions, I want to provide a quick update on our sustainability and inclusion and diversity efforts, which is shown on Slide 11. During our Investor Day program on May 19, we introduced an accelerated greenhouse gas reduction goal. It's now targets a reduction of 50% and greenhouse gas intensity for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025 relative to our 2017 base here. During the second quarter, we also issued our 2021 sustainability report, which included Fortive second annual GRI Index, first annual SaaS be index in the 2017-2020 greenhouse gas emissions profile. During the quarter we also became a signatory to the UN Global Compact committed to alignment with the task force and climate related financial disclosure by 2022 and announced our 2025 aspirational inclusion diversity goals. We continue to make significant strides in our highly committed to accelerating our sustainability and inclusion and diversity progress in the coming years.  I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank our team and all of our stakeholders for your support over the first five years of our journey as an independent company. Across all three of our strategic segments, we are expanding on strong established positions with offerings will address the critical work needs of our customers in markets with attractive long-term growth drivers, our strong earnings and free cash flow performance in the first half of this year clearly demonstrated the benefits of the strategic focus and the momentum building in our portfolio. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest and expanding the capabilities of the Fortive Business System as we accelerate operating improvements and innovation to increase the value we offer to our customers. With strong free cash flow and significant M&A capacity, we are well positioned to pursue the key organic and inorganic growth initiatives that will drive consistent double-digit earnings and free cash flow growth in the years to come.  With that, I'll turn it back to Griffin. Griffin Whitney : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Pasha, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Good afternoon. Hey guys, how are you doing? Jim Lico : Good. Steve Tusa : Just a question on the AHS margin. I think the fourth quarter, just backing into kind of the fourth quarter guidance shows margins that are kind of ended like beyond the mid '20s into kind of even a high '20s. And then maybe to some rounding going on there, but at kind of the high end of the range what's implied. Am I looking at that the right way and what's kind of the source of that strength itself? Jim Lico : Thanks, Steve. That's a good question and I think you're calculating it right above the mid '20s pushing 26% to 27% I think is the right zone. What's pushing is that as we move through time, we're starting to see we'll see acceleration in our revenue as elective surgeries get better, but also seasonally, there is more revenue in the fourth quarter and you put those two things together and that's what really drives the health margins at the segment level up. Steve Tusa : So is that any read into next year, or is it like, highly unusual seasonality like the fourth quarter is just a way stronger than the rest. I mean, is there a reason why that seasonality is so acute or can we think about that as maybe a bit of a jumping-off point at some stage. Jim Lico : I don't think from just where the OP is going to be is that jumping-off point, but I do think in terms of every year. You should expect the fourth quarter to be stronger and we have the back half of the year going up by a couple of hundred basis points in each of the quarters and I think, I don't think that there anything anomalous about this Q4 going forward, but I wouldn't take that multiplied by four. I think we're going to go back to a couple of hundred basis points of growth in Q1 and Q2 on what we posted this year. Chuck McLaughlin : Steve, I would just add that just add that, like last year, we sort of have that 25% is an exit rate not saying it was going to be the rate for every quarter, but that would be a good jumping-off point and which to take margins to the next level. I think you're seeing that the same thing, I think it's, it's a combination of the FBS work. The full year effect of the FBS work, the full full-year effect of all the work that we're doing to continue to integrate the business, drive margins and as Chuck said consumable revenue coming up to as well. So the businesses is in a good trajectory right now overall and obviously a big part of that is ASP. Steve Tusa : Right, that makes a lot of sense. And just one follow-up on the margin for the total company. Did you ultimately have some of that cost come back, I think we were thinking of it didn't kind of the $75 million range like temporary costs and then some of those investments that hit this quarter year-over-year. I mean, did you guys ultimately see that stuff come through. Jim Lico : We did there is two things going on for Q2, there was the year-over-year, we had $60 million of snapback cost. We did that and then plus we did another $15 million investments in that did show up in Q2 for sure. Steve Tusa : Yes. So that's like a core incremental on EBIT a of like, I don't know I can back into something like 65% to 70% kind of core incremental. I mean is that the right kind of math? Jim Lico : Well, it is. So the straight year over year incremental for Q2 is 31% stronger than the mid '20s we talked about but yes with our incremental gross margins are going to be in that 65% range. So, yes, that is the right math. I wouldn't expect that flow through at that every quarter in the second half, we would expect, as we've been talking about 40% rating for this, the second half, we have going forward. Steve Tusa : Yes. Right. Got you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks, good afternoon, everyone. Hey Jim or Chuck could you follow up a little bit on the, TOS comments and then know if you have to kind of break it down Fluke and a couple of the businesses. But of the sales, we're observing here in the quarter trailing or outpacing POS and I just wonder if you have any color on what's going on with channel inventories. As for the channels and anyway caught up or this is a pretty good indication of what demand is? Jim Lico : We saw one of the things Jeff as obviously with the beat in revenue and the strength that we saw particularly they accelerated through the quarter point of sales an important target is you're asking. You're exactly right, we saw good POS to continue to improve through the quarter. I think it will continue to improve. Obviously, little bit of an easier comp in the quarter by both at Fluke and at Tek we saw as an example in POS in the Americas, we saw in the 30% range, so better than our even in our sales total sales in some cases. So very good position, we're also obviously making sure given supply chain discussions around the world, we're making sure that inventories aren't, not that we're not seeing accelerated buying, we're doing, you were using a new metric where we not only look at point of sale, but we also look at orders on hand to sort of understand are we seeing a leading situation or not. And we're certainly seeing things continue to be good.  So hence, we took the revenue guide up both Fluke and Tek are performing well and I think we're in a good place and we're certainly it prudently the US and Europe will be the best data. We're certainly in a good place from an inventory position. We don't feel like we're in any situation building excess of inventory. Jeff Sprague : And I wonder if you could just take a moment on in particular in discuss, what's going on in some of the new verticals you are trying to pursue. I think that's going to be an important part of making sure Tek puts up the kind of growth you want to see over time, not just in the cyclical rebound. So where are we have on that push some of these new verticals, maybe some color on what percent of tech sales these are now and how you see those progressing? Jim Lico : I think because we're feeling as we said in the first quarter commentary and again, this time we are seeing automotive data centers is two particular verticals that have continue to increase. I think on a percentage basis, they are about the same, simply because the revenue. The total revenues coming up and obviously in places like Keithley we still continue to see revenue in semiconductor. So I don't think we've necessarily move the needle as a percent of sales, but on a total basis in terms of total dollars we're certainly up. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the advent of tech scope which is sort of a software offering is also I think helps users connect multiple scopes and multiple channels and really bring more data together is also accelerated into new verticals as well.  So, I think it just to answer your question specifically, I don't think we've seen a demand strategic difference necessarily in the percent of sales, but we have seen substantially greater sales in those verticals over time and that should bode well for the futures. Jeff Sprague : Great. I appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi, good afternoon/evening to everyone. But couple of things here. I mean, first of all, I mean obviously you're getting operating leverage, but is price kind of in line with your cost increases, are you still catching up a little bit on that. Or I mean another way to say it is, 130 bps up on price is that accelerating through the year here. Jim Lico : Yes, we're in a great shape on price cost, Scott. First of all, as you said 130 bps in the quarter in the hardware businesses in particular we'll double that number in the second half. So we're in a very good position relative to price, as you know we've gotten good price over the year. So this is a compounding effect. You saw this price read through as well on the gross margin improvement in the second quarter. So we feel very good and really quite frankly, even though we are seeing a little bit of cost inflation, we're still going to be net, significantly net in a good shape relative to material cost reductions for the year. So, material cost reductions will still be a profit improver for the year. Even though we've seen a little bit more inflation than typical, we still are in a very good shape relative to price cost, not only because of price but also because we've done a nice job on the cost reduction side as well. Scott Davis : Okay, that's super helpful. And then this is a little nitty-gritty but just following-up on Jeff's question on the on-tech and kind of it oscilloscope overall, I mean the new markets that you're entering it with the same exact product meaning going to standardize product just different channel or do they have different problems are trying to solve in electric vehicle facility or data center that perhaps you've modified or changing or creating new products? Jim Lico : Yes, I would say, on balance through the same base oscilloscope the 6 series or the 4th series but then there's a set of software that's specific to that vertical application there might be a set of probes that is also different and ultimately there is really a solution around the challenges that they might have. As an example, power usage is a huge issue in data centers. It's a big problem and in electric vehicles in a variety of places. So it might be a power consumption challenge, might be trying to do some different troubleshooting aspects of particular applications as well. So there is a suite of software and probes that typically go with that oscilloscope that is very much vertical specific. Scott Davis : Okay. Encouraging. Thank you. Good luck, guys. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes, good afternoon. I guess I'll just continue to ask questions about tech. It does sound like very broad-based demand in Tektronix. How durable, do you think the demand this year versus sort of more bounce back from COVID? Jim Lico : While certainly an aspect of the bounce back at COVID. So, I wouldn't in any way, shape or form take away from that, but I think when you look at where the business has been historically, we're at an accelerated growth rate here over the last couple of years. So I think in that sense, we feel good about the overall growth rate this year and we think it's certainly durable in the sense of recognized services had a good, a good quarter. We're doing some good strategic work to add to services, the things we were just mentioning around new verticals. So the team is really got the mantra and the strategy to continue to make the business less volatile and less cyclical and really work towards and secular drivers that have more durable growth rate, and I think we're in a very good position relative to how we'll do that over time. Andrew Obin : And my follow-up. So how should we think about the implications around the uptick in professional services and improving site access for your SaaS businesses. Site access was the hurdle for new logos but just trying to get a sense if now you're able to close deals and thoughts on-boarding new clients. Jim Lico : Yes, we were still not where we'd like to be. So, and obviously even the recent news over the last 24 hours is going to, how we will have to look into. But I think we feel confident in sort of double-digit professional services growth in our SaaS businesses in the second half. So we see continued improvement insight access. We're starting to see customers start to really make decisions here at an accelerated rate. Talk a little about that in the prepared remarks, almost all the software businesses. So yes, I think you'd say the second half, we're in a much better place relative to services and that's not just on site services, it's also getting customers to accept remote services. So it's a combination of the good work. The team has done to be able to deliver things more remotely as well as customer site access. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Good evening, good afternoon. So just, on Jeff's question, I'm not sure if you actually address the absolute level of [indiscernible] to your best knowledge and the sort of the question is that obviously lot of channels pretty empty at this point. So, any sense on where challenges are for the Tek and Fluke and other products and then kind of on top of that sounds like a dumb question, given the kind of core we just put out but did supply chain constraints date your ability to supply during the quarter. Jim Lico : Yes, so first of all, I think we're in a good place and channel inventories. I think in some cases given the revenue numbers, both what we delivered in the quarter over delivered in the quarter. Plus, raising the guide for the full year, you'd say, well, we definitely seeing better demand and in the back against that backdrop, we're not seeing an increase in channel inventories nor would we see an increase in channel inventory at least in the next 90 days through delivering the revenue that we have relative to the POS numbers we're seeing. So I think we feel good about end user demand and we feel good about the fact that we're not building inventory in some sort of over oversaturation situation. So I think there is real demand out there and I think we're fulfilling it. Nigel, we're not oblivious in any way, shape or form like our peers and other come in pretty much all the companies in the world relative to supply chain constraints, we've seen those for sure. I think the fact that we've been building great lean manufacturing capability over decades in our businesses, our ability to respond to those things relative to the FBS tools like daily management and problem solving means we're where we're fighting every day to secure material and our ability to beat the revenue in the second quarter is a good demonstration of our success in that way. But I would also say, we continue to see those challenges every day and I would expect to see those challenges, probably through the year at least. So I think we're in a, we've been very successful. Thus far, but it is a daily battle, but I guess given the work we've done over decades to build the kind of capability within our factories. I like our chances and continue to be successful. Nigel Coe : Right. And then I wanted to go back quickly to ASP [ph] margins that later in the quarter 2Q. Is that simply the mix of ASP, does ASP carry a high contribution margin relative to the average there and then that 27% margin you're guiding for 4Q, does that represent quote unquote normal mix in that segment. Jim Lico : Thanks for the question. Nigel. So it's, we really weren't lighter than what we expected. We're over the high end of our guide for Q2 on AHS margins, but I think you're looking at the comparison to last year. And I think, and so there is a couple of things going on there. One, as we have been building out our supply chain coming off to TSAs that's incrementally put in starting last year at this time, more cost. So when you come back to the margins that gives us a headwind on year-over-year margins with that there is a little bit higher freight as well, but there is more revenue to go along with it; so we're still driving OP. Also we had a one-timers last year that inflated margins that obviously that doesn't repeat this year that related to just the transition off the TSAs. But again, I think that we're right where we expected to be in Q2. And going forward, we're going to see us start expanding again double digit, 200 basis points from Q2 to Q3 and then Q3 to Q4, maybe even a little bit more than that. So consistent margin expansion and yes the consumables have very high margin is so as recovery that really helps part of that that story for sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good afternoon. And maybe just a first question around the AHS margins have been discussed a fair amount, but just wanted to touch on the revenue side of things, you took down the high end of the core growth guide for AHS for this year, kept the margins, as you said. So maybe help us understand what's driving that revenue reduction and how good you feel about the overall state of businesses such as ASP. In terms of their market share and winning sort of their fair share of business? Jim Lico : Yes, Julian, I think the second one first. I think were installed base is up 3.5% year-on-year. We're in a very good place relative to equipment placements. We had another good equipment quarter after several 4, 5 quarters in a row of continued increases in the installed base. So we feel very good about where we stand relative to the installed base. I think what we're really saying for the second half of the year. And I think if you look consistent revenue growth through the remaining part of the year. ASP will actually accelerate in growth through the remaining part of the year, but we did see a little bit of elective procedures coming down a little bit than we anticipated. As we said we thought maybe we would end the quarter around 95. We ended around 93. So there's a little bit of an assumption that will probably not get to 100% by the end of the year that has a little bit of impact, but I think we come back to the fact that we're taking share and if things come back, we certainly would see an associated improvement, but I think we're just trying to be a little bit more consistent with what we've seen here recently relative to electric procedures and so there's a little bit of a change.  Obviously, we took the guide up in total up for the overall company, but a little bit, maybe a little bit more conservative relative to where we think elective procedures might come in and as you said, continued very strong margin increases like Chuck was just describing through the remaining part of the year through AHS and at ASP. Sorry for all the acronyms. Julian Mitchell : Thank you for that. And just on China, your growth went from close to 30% in Q1 to sort of mid-teens in the second quarter. So pretty consistent with a lot of the other indicators short cycle wise in recent months there but when you're looking at sort of Fluke and Tektronix in China both have a very good presence there. How are you thinking about the growth in the second half in China, specifically? Jim Lico : Yes, I think very good. I think the answer is going to be to be quick. I did a review with all the China here a few days ago and feel very good about the second half, particularly at Fluke and Tek. The comps play a little bit of a role here and so, but I think as we look at a two year stack, as an example, we continue to grow well in China through the remaining part of the year. So I think we've got mid-teens or something like that for the full year in China and we feel good that we can continue to maintain good growth rates and really good market positions as we get into 2022 as well. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Markus Mittermaier : Hi, good evening, very quick follow-up on pricing, the 130 basis points that you have, you said the targeted to double that in the second half, just to be clear, part of the guy it also the asset on top. Jim Lico : Markus, the hundred and some basis points is really in our hardware businesses, particularly sort of Fluke Tech, Sensing [ph] Tech in particular that I was associated with that number. So that's, that's really a comparison of where really relative to price cost, I think our overall sort of our overall pricing for all of Fortive incorporating everything is probably closer to from the second quarter, probably up about 140 or excuse me, about 40 or 50 basis points up from where we've been thus far in the first half. So, the 200 is really to address the price cost question. And so, but the overall pricing is a little bit less than that. Chuck McLaughlin : And we have to set historic guidance. Jim Lico : Yes, and that's built into the guidance. Yes, thanks. Markus Mittermaier : Okay. No, that makes sense, because then the follow-up but if you see any issues on price elasticity, but it doesn't sound like it? Jim Lico : Go ahead. Markus Mittermaier : And then, the second question of just the balance sheet, our service channel. Now, I think any change in priorities. I know that's a few months ago, you said of relative size between the various business is matters any sort of new thinking here about their priorities are hit for the second half of the year. Jim Lico : No, I think it's, as we said in the prepared remarks, the balance sheet remains in very good shape and we'll be in very good shape to do other deals if when those opportunities become available. So obviously, we're going to continue to be focused on making sure we get good strong financial returns. I think service channel deal is a good example of that both accretive in 12 months, but also with a 10% ROIC in five years. So I think there's lots of those kinds of situations available to us in the second half. And so, you never know if you're going to get a deal done, but I think we both have the capacity financially, as well as the capability to pull off another deal if an opportunity becomes available. So it's hard to predict those things. And what happens, but we are busy and we feel confident that we could put, we could get a deal done. If we have the opportunity. Markus Mittermaier : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : So just focusing on the bigger picture with Gordian and Accruent again you mentioned there is still a bit of noise in terms of the varying pace of return to work especially lately. But you did mention that clients accelerating work on key projects within Gordian. So does that give you better visibility into growth continuing to accelerate within the businesses and can you improvement we've seen in state and local budgets and stimulus giving you an additional boost? Jim Lico : So first of all, you're Gordian had a very good quarter. What we did see in June and we mentioned this a little bit is, there was a little bit of budget clearing at the end of the fiscal year and I think between stimulus and what's already, we're seeing and projects. I think we feel confident; we'll have a good a good year at Gordian for sure. So I think you know as we look forward, the Gordian not only in job order contracting but estimating and even facility assessments. We're seeing good business and I think on the current side, you're seeing, as we said, we're starting to see those back to work projects come back, people who are looking for hoteling solutions. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, our event and hoteling planning solution is sort of leads the way as people start to think about is, the fact of the office. So we saw that accelerate. We really like the professional services because in a lot of those situations. That's the first part of the current before we see the SaaS revenue, we see those projects come in where we, where we go in and help clients get started.  So, I think a number of places where we're seeing real opportunity and I think. We really believe that those will continue. And as I said in previous question professional services being up double digits in the second half is going to be real helpful to us sort of building that business here for not only this year, but obviously into next year. Andy Kaplowitz : It's helpful Jim. And then you mentioned a nice rebound in industrial and oil and gas end markets guys seems like that is the recovery more a function of easy comparisons are you starting to see a relatively significant rebound at this point in energy related markets and what do you see going forward for that business. Jim Lico : Yes, I think we see continued improvement. I would say there some easy comp aspect to the ISC number in the quarter. But one of the things I was, I think we're really excited about is the work they've been doing over the last year and a half to sort of move the business into new markets outside of oil and gas and we saw some success in that in the quarters. Building the business around different end markets at the same time they are starting to see instrument revenue and rental revenue come up, which is really I think consistent with people coming back to work in oil and gas and projects coming back into those customers. So we think that continues to accelerate through the remaining part of the year. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks, Jim. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Jim Lico : Hi, Deane. How are you? Deane Dray : Doing real well. Thanks. Can we just get updated. There was a plan that you would start these growth investments, $35 million in the second quarter and I think early in the call, you called out a $15 million investment. Is that part of it. And what's the plan for the balance of these investments and going into four [ph] and Pioneer Square Labs also. Jim Lico : So, Deane, we called out that we'd have $35 million. You're correct, we had $15 million in Q2 which we did kick off and invest in Q2 and then you think about $10 million in each of Q3 and Q4. Chuck McLaughlin : And then relative to maybe what we saw. I think and the other thing I'd just call on there's a couple of examples, in the call. The II900 that we called out at Fluke in the 1QA at Fluke Health. Those are both examples of investments that we did 18 months ago that are now really paying off. So I think it's a good example of, hey, we give the operating companies money to accelerate product development for accelerated growth and that's a good example we're seeing the payback of some of those investments that we did it roughly a year and a half ago. Relative to Pioneer Square labs as we said in the Q2 call, about half of that $15 million or how and half of that $35 would be at the four [ph] and a PSL we mentioned the spin in $0.15 in the quarter or in early July. That's part of that investment is to fund TeamSense here as we spin that into the business, we're really excited about that opportunity, and then obviously the forward investments which we said we're probably more like two or three years out relative to payback and return just bring those numbers back, we thought it was about a $250 million growth opportunity for all of that work. And we still believe that that's true. Probably hopefully planning to get 30 to 50 that and as we continue to build out the product lines and build out some of the ideas will have greater granularity of that, but we're really excited about the work that we got done in the quarter, which is really going to be good work for us and next year and in the years to follow. Deane Dray : Got it. And that's what nice lead into for the second question about how do the spin in work. With TeamSense are there more in the pipeline and what are the conditions that a start-up is ready to be brought into Fortive? Jim Lico : Yes. So each one has its own sort of particular set of metrics, we have a Board that's made up of team members from Fortive and team members from PSL they sort of advocates for the business through a period of time. Prior to the spin in we fund that and then we make a decision whether the business out of the spun in if it's good strategically are really helpful to our strategically there might be situations where we actually go and get external funding and then situation where we maybe wouldn't go forward. Right now, we have three that we're funding, the one that we spun and team sense we have two others we'll make some decisions here based and those decision criteria, our individual to the businesses based on what they're trying to accomplish strategically, generally has the number of end customers, they have to solidify there are certain goals around what they're doing with those customers from a product perspective is the product ready and if we achieve those milestones. Then we start to assess the potential opportunity. Pioneer Square Labs is really good obviously with their experience a bringing to us, how we think that if we were to go for an external investment is an example how would that business do in that regard. So I think it's been a great experience. And we're really celebrating 12 months of partnership here and I was just with the senior team there PSL couple of weeks ago to talk about the partnership and make sure it's really good footing. And I think without a doubt, we're in a very good place from as a organizationally in which to continue to fund some of these things. We think, we've got great ideas where we'll fund them, but I think they also bring bringing the process of killing ideas and we've held several ideas as well. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good evening guys. Excellent. So Jim, you have a mix of the cyclical seasonal. And I guess some more stable businesses. So maybe the constant how lot here, but where do you think there's still room for, I guess, sequential growth, but sort of ignores the comps. Obviously, we're still coming off the bottom. It sounds like maybe ASP is one of those given that it's still kind of lifting off the bottom and maybe 2Q those elective procedures didn't show as much progress as we hope, but is there anything else where we should still kind of keep an eye on sequential progression, maybe relative to comps or seasonality. Jim Lico : Yes, I think obviously with what happened last year with COVID you've got to consider that. And I think you'd see as an example of Fluke and Tek as an example, on a two-year basis. They're accelerating through the year. So I think in that sense will still what we have implied in the guide is those businesses getting better over two-year basis. So I think we feel good Sensing, it may be in that same boat. So I think we still see some good progress here in a number of places. And as you mentioned we see we'll see ASP, get a little bit better. Our SaaS business is on value [ph] with 40% recurring revenue. We have a large part of the portfolio that did exceptionally well through 2020 and is continuing to do well in the call that out, mostly the SaaS businesses that we have, but obviously we continue to build our ARR portfolio that continues to grow well will have double-digit ARR growth at the end of the year for the full year. So, I think we're accelerating the businesses that have been stable and I think what you're starting to see some of the business that had a little bit more cyclicality, still have some room with them and what we've seen is I think good margin progression with those businesses as we've seen the revenue come back. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then, just on that strength on Gordian and Accruent I think adds a lot of it be to the service channel deal that you already announced. Anything else that either sort of a shift is a function of cold weather or something else, where over the last couple of years, hey, we like this before but gosh that seems even have more ways now and maybe we should look for more externally anything of that sticks out in the portfolio? Jim Lico : Well, I think the obvious one and is just everything we're doing in ehsAI [ph]. I think sustainability is becoming such an important topic for companies around the world and not just large cap. I mean, just about every company in the world now is trying to understand their carbon footprint, they are trying to understand how to action sustainability work and we're just so well positioned with Intelex, ehsAI [ph] around those trends, I think it's hard to call out anything better than that, just given the massive amount of work and effort that's been going into sustainability everywhere in the world. So I think that's certainly a secular driver that we knew was good a few years ago when we bought into Intellect. But I think it every quarter we own that business. We realize we have an even bigger opportunity? Josh Pokrzywinski : Yes, carry with that. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon folks. After all this wonderful very good questions, I want to get back up to 35,000 feet for a second. You've talked me into -- it's the principles and the behaviors of lean that are important and those rules don't really change, but can you talk a little bit about what COVID culture about lean and what's your experience from the last couple of years with SaaS models has taught you about lean. And then I have a quick follow-up? Jim Lico : Well, I think Cliff, I wouldn't have thought that we could have virtualize some of our resources and still maintained a lot of the daily management things that we've done. It's just been incredible. And certainly with some of the supply chain things I was describing our team's ability to collaborate continue to do kaizen events in many cases certainly problem solving events in some cases virtually. I would have never thought we could have done those at the level of quality that we're doing them today. So I think, kudos to our FBS team that virtualized all of our tools and I think that's certainly a great example of probably my own learning that these things can be virtualized. And we've seen some great efforts here over the last year, so a year and a half in that regard. Relative to SaaS, I think there's really a couple of things, you know this better than anyone. Problem solving is problem solving, value stream mapping is value stream mapping. Every SaaS business has processes that are inefficient sometimes customer success, sometimes the customer, sometimes product development, but I think fundamentally we find that those processes can be improved. And I think in SaaS business is no different than any other business in terms of a culture of continuous improvement on everything you do is a winning culture. So I think those are certainly things that we're seeing and obviously, what we're trying to show in our Investor Day is so many examples of where that's really playing out thus far. Unidentified Analyst : How about you held my hand kind of when I was trying to apply lean principles to transactional processes, traditional transactional processes, when you took over Fortive, you said look, we've got all the original divisions where the great pushes in lean came in the '80s and the '90s and you said, I haven't got a business, and I can add another 250 basis points to, how do you feel about your progress of taking these same principles and putting it into SI/NOP [ph] and new product development and accounting and accounting for lean as opposed to lean accounting. Jim Lico : I mean it's a lot of the same stuff we applied value stream mapping into the current business and significantly impacted DSO right away and that was already a negative working capital business that we just made. I think we made better. So I think these transactional processes exist just as much in software businesses and our teams, our Gordian we called out Gordian several places is applied these things all across the board and made great improvement. And we certainly seen that, Intelex operating profit is significantly above where it was when we bought the company that could say that about all the software businesses. So we found those pools of opportunity, they are sometimes in different places, but ultimately if we can teach the principal to the leadership teams of these businesses and encourage them and quite frankly support them. We tend to have real good success. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, this is actually Rock [ph] come in for Joe, thanks for taking my questions. Hey, I just wanted to go back to ASP, real quick, I know you, we've talked a lot about that but the elective procedures. Just wondered, kind of what regions maybe underperformed versus your expectations. In the quarter and what regions might provide some upside in the second half that you kind of called out? Jim Lico : It's mostly the US now part of that because it's our biggest business, so is our biggest region. So I would say most of it was in the US, a little bit in Europe, but, but I think for the most part most markets outside of the United States. We're actually pretty stable. So we're because of the share that we have in the US and we're probably a little bit more receptive to the COVID change the electric procedure change that we are. Elsewhere, we can make a little bit more of our own luck in the other parts of the world and that's what we did. So I think that really is where we stand relative to going forward, as we said, we probably thought that we are getting closer to 100% by the end of the year, we're probably a couple of hundred basis points different than that now where we stand for the second half. Unidentified Analyst : That helps. And then just another one, and I know it might be a bit early for this question but because service channel hasn't had closed yet, but you know as you think about that rolling into the business and you talked a lot about Fortive AI initiatives that you have at Investor Day. Just wondering like it looks like a good overlay for some of the services they provide as well from the matching service providers and customers. And then the back-end on the analytical side, is that something that you're thinking about enhancing and then I guess on the flip side too. When you think about those AI technology have inheriting from like service now for me a little side, is that something you might be able to leverage across the rest of the organization through the initiatives do. Jim Lico : So number one, they have a Scout product, which is really their data analytics product. We definitely think we have an opportunity to accelerate some of the great things they were already planning to do with the port [ph], so answer to that is absolutely that will be a real opportunity for us going forward. It's a very small part of service channel today, but we think it can be a real important part not only the revenue stream but of the customer capture and the ability to accelerate the network flywheel that we talk about between enterprise customers in the service network. Relative to algorithms, the answer is yes. One of the principals roles of the port [ph] is to, is actually to re-task algorithms is to create algorithms that we can apply to the same business problems or the same growth opportunities within the business. Probably the place we're doing that the most is in our software businesses around customer churn predictive models. Once we get those models up and running, we can apply them to different customer sets within different operating businesses. So, we absolutely recast those algorithms and that's a big part of the port [ph] job is to maintain those algorithms and continue to make them better as we get more and more data running through them. Operator : That does conclude our Q&A session, I would like to turn the call back over for any closing remarks. Jim Lico : Thanks Pasha and thanks everyone for taking the time today. I think what you saw today or when with earnings was a really strong quarter. We continue I think to really work hard and diligent to really take advantage of the opportunities of a better market, I think you saw that with the guidance, certainly saw that in the margin profile, and we're really excited about the work going on. A lot of hard work going on with our team every day, so I want to thank our team for all the hard work in the quarter and all the hard work is going to continue through the year as we continue to take advantage of the opportunities of a growing market here. We're in a great place. Thanks for your time. Thanks for your support. We'll look forward to the follow-up calls and conversations that we have. Have a great rest of the summer for those who you haven't taken a vacation yet and we look forward to seeing you soon. Stay safe. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Early in the third quarter, Fortive celebrated its fifth anniversary as an independent public company. This quarter, we continue to demonstrate the success of the strategy we outlined in 2016 to enhance growth and margins across our businesses through the successful execution of the Fortive Business System, the acceleration of innovation and the impact of disciplined capital allocation. Our third quarter results were highlighted by 32% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We continue to generate significant revenue momentum throughout the quarter, realizing 9.1% core revenue growth, an order growth of just over 20% against the backdrop of strong broad-based demand. Strong execution and application of FBS helped to generate 325 basis points of core operating margin expansion, along with very strong free cash flow despite widespread supply chain disruption. In the third quarter, our software businesses grew by low double digits, supported by strong demand and improving net dollar retention. In total, we now have almost $750 million of annualized software revenue across the portfolio with double-digit organic growth profile as well as a high share of recurring revenue and high operating margins. In August, we closed the acquisition of ServiceChannel, adding another differentiated high-growth software asset to our Intelligent Operating Solutions segment. The ServiceChannel acquisition significantly enhances our strategic position in the facility and asset life cycle market, extending our leading suite of offerings for facility owners and operators and providing a variety of potential avenues to deliver unique value-added solutions in combination with Gordian and Accruent. As you can see on Slide 4, across Fortive, we continue to invest in product development to drive organic growth and enhance our competitive position. Many of our investments in organic innovation are focused on enabling digital transformation across our customer base. This includes vertically tailored software offerings at Tektronix and Fluke Health, emerging IoT solutions in Sensing as well as early progress with new tools for improved workforce management at TeamSense. In addition, our investments in The Fort continue to drive data analytics and machine learning opportunities across all of our businesses. Our success in accelerating the pace of innovation across our portfolio is demonstrated by examples, such as the Fluke II900, a groundbreaking product, which was recently recognized as Test Measurement and Inspection, \"Product of the Year,\" at the 2021 Electronics Industry Awards. We continue to build the strength of our talent base to accelerate progress across Fortive. This quarter, we announced a number of important additions and promotions to the senior leadership team, including the appointment of Olumide Soroye as President and CEO of Intelligent Operating Solutions; the promotion of Tami Newcombe, the President and CEO of Precision Technologies; and the promotions of Justin McElhattan and Bill Pollak to Group President roles within IOS. These moves highlight how we are building leadership capacity through a combination of internal development and external hires aimed at adding differentiated skill sets and experiences to our senior team. With Olumide and Tami as well as Pat Murphy, now leading Advanced Healthcare Solutions, we have significantly increased the depth of our leadership within all 3 of our segments. Turning to a quick summary of the results in the quarter on Slide 5. We generated year-over-year total revenue growth of 12%, core growth of 9.1% and orders growth of just over 20%, with backlog increasing by 40% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, while adjusted earnings per share was $0.66, representing a year-over-year increase of 32%. The strong adjusted operating margin performance helped us to deliver $252 million of free cash flow, which represented 105% - 106% in the third quarter, with core growth of 13.1%. This included low teens growth in North America, high-teens growth in Western Europe and mid-single-digit growth in China. Industrial Imaging business continues to perform well, paced by momentum from innovation across its acoustic imaging product line, which doubled year-over-year in the third quarter. Fluke Networks had a very strong quarter, driven by innovations such as its LinkIQ product line. Fluke's efforts to expand its recurring revenue base saw further progress in Q3, including strong performance across both of its service offerings and in eMaint, which generated high-teens growth in revenue and SaaS bookings for the quarter. The combination of robust order growth and supply chain constraints in Q3 led to strong backlog that we're carrying into the fourth quarter and 2022. Industrial Scientific revenue increased by mid-teens as its instruments and rental business continued their strong recoveries. The ISC team has done an excellent job using FBS tools to accelerate product redesign initiatives, which have helped alleviate component supply challenges and limit impact on delivery times to customers. Intelex grew by mid-teens and posted another record revenue quarter. Intelex is seeing solid FBS driven improvements in its upsell process to support higher net dollar retention. Also in Q3, Intelex signed an exclusive partnership deal with Datamaran, which enables Intelex customers to manage their full life cycle of their ESG strategy, including materiality analysis and risk identification. Accruent grew by low single digits in the third quarter while seeing strong bookings greater than 20%. This booking strength was paced by continued demand for Accruent's Meridian engineering document management and maintenance connection CMMS offerings. Accruent also continues to see strong demand for its EMS event workspace and resource scheduling solution to support emerging hybrid office models as customers execute their return to work plans. Among the notable new customer wins for the EMS solution in Q3 were several leading global financial services providers. Accruent also continued to see improved performance in its professional services business, which generated low double-digit growth. Gordian increased by mid-teens, with strong growth in procurement and in estimating. In the third quarter, Gordian continued to see increasing project volume as well as higher average dollars per project. Gordian is also seeing success from its expansion into health care with significant demand for its facility solutions from hospital customers. After completing the acquisition of ServiceChannel at the end of August, we are obviously early in our ownership, but we're very pleased with what we've seen thus far and are excited to have them join Fortive. Specifically, ServiceChannel continues to demonstrate strong momentum in its large enterprise retail business with several large customer wins in Q3, including Walgreens, which will roll out automation software across their more than 10,000 locations and the third largest mobile carrier in North America as they transform their facility management program. Moving to Slide 7. The Precision Technologies segment posted a total revenue increase of 8.9% in the third quarter, with core growth of 7.7%. This included high single-digit growth in North America and high-teens growth in Western Europe. China grew low single digits, but saw strong continued momentum in demand with double-digit order growth in the quarter. Tektronix grew high single digits with strong demand trends across its product portfolio and double-digit order growth. Growth was led by the performance of its mainstream as oscilloscopes with a greater than 30% increase supported by new extensions to the 6 Series MSO product line. Tektronix continue to see traction from its efforts to expand in data centers and other related wired communications applications, delivering a number of key customer wins, including Lenovo and Ericsson. Throughout the third quarter, Tektronix did an excellent job deploying FBS countermeasures to navigate sustained supply chain challenges while also delivering significant price realization. Even with the strong execution, given the continued robust pace of demand from its customers, Tektronix increased its backlog by more than 70% versus a year ago. Sensing Technologies increased by low double digits in the third quarter. Sensing reported strong growth across each of its major regions with robust order momentum across its key end markets. Setra registered additional market share gains with its HVAC offerings in Q3 and continues to generate strong growth across a range of critical environment applications, including hospital isolation rooms and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Hengstler Dynapar had a very strong quarter by utilizing the FBS tool set to improve lead times and on-time delivery to drive share gains with key OEM customers. Pacific Scientific EMC grew by mid-single digits, including improved momentum across its commercial customer base. PacSci continues to see significant growth opportunities in its aircraft and space end markets with strong momentum across its critical safety technology offerings. Moving to Advanced Healthcare Solutions on Slide 8. Total revenue increased 9.3%, while core revenue increased 4.7%. This included mid-single-digit growth in North America and low single-digit growth in China. Western Europe saw high teens decline based on a difficult prior year comp at Invetech, partially offset by strong growth at ASP and Fluke Health. ASP grew by low single digits in the third quarter, highlighted by a strong capital equipment performance, including low double-digit growth in terminal sterilization capital. ASP continues to benefit from the solid sales execution, driving the consistent expansion of its global installed base. Consumables revenue grew by low single digits, led by high single-digit increase across all geographies outside of the United States. In the U.S., the spike in COVID-related hospitalizations led to a notable decline in elective procedure volumes toward the end of the quarter, resulting in global elective procedures at approximately 88% of pre-COVID levels for the period. While we expect only nominal improvement in elective procedure volume in Q4, longer term, we expect ASP's consumable revenue will benefit from procedure volume normalization and growth in its global installed base. Censis increased in the low 40% range, highlighted by very strong growth in professional services and related hardware. It CensiTrac SaaS offering, grew mid-teens as it continue to benefit from new customer additions as well as good momentum with upselling and cross-selling to existing customers. Censis continues to have open access to customer sites and saw strong sustained order growth throughout the quarter. Fluke Health Solutions increased by high single digits with continued strength in North America and Western Europe tied to market share gains with OEM customers through the continued deployment of FBS growth tools. FHS executed very well throughout the quarter, driving significant price realization and managing through supply chain constraints to open new market opportunities. FHS continues to benefit from partnership efforts with The Fort, driving lower customer churn at Landauer using The Fort's predictive modeling tools. The company continues to see good early traction from software innovation efforts with 30% growth year-over-year in Q3. Invetech declined by mid-single digits, which was better than expected against the tough prior year comp that included significant COVID-related tailwinds. The company continues to see strong demand across the diagnostics and life science verticals and expect to end the year with significant order momentum and a healthy backlog to carry into 2022. With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will take you through some additional details on our margins, free cash flow and balance sheet. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another quarter of strong margin performance in Q3, using FBS tools to deliver strong pricing and successful value engineering to implement component substitutions across a variety of hardware businesses. This FBS execution and the continued strength of our software businesses helped deliver adjusted gross margins of 57.3% in Q3. This reflects 90 basis points of expansion on a year-over-year basis as we accelerated to 220 basis points of total price realization. Q3 adjusted operating profit was 22.8%, reflecting solid execution across the portfolio, including counter measures enacted in the face of ongoing supply chain challenges. We had strong margin performance across all of our segments, resulting in 325 basis points of core operating margin expansion. On Slide 9, you can see that in the third quarter, we generated $252 million of free cash flow, representing a 105% conversion of adjusted net income. Free cash flow over the trailing 12 months increased 22% to $991 million. Our current net leverage is approximately 1.6x and we expect net leverage to be around 1.3x at year-end, excluding any additional M&A. Turning now to the guide on Slide 10. We are raising the low end of our full year 2021 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $2.70, resulting in a range of $2.70 to $2.75 for the year. This represents a year-over-year growth of 29% to 32% on a continuing operation basis. This assumes that total revenue growth of 14% to 14.5%, adjusted operating profit margins of 23% to 23.5% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the full year. We are also initiating fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.74 to $0.79 representing year-over-year growth of 6% to 13%. This assumes total revenue growth of 6.5% to 8.5%, adjusted operating profit margin of 23.5% to 24.5% and an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. The adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance also excludes approximately $12 million of anticipated investments in strategic productivity initiatives that we expect to execute before the end of the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 125% of adjusted net income. With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing. James Lico : Thanks, Chuck. We're very pleased with our performance in Q3. We worked diligently to countermeasure supply chain challenges that persisted throughout the quarter and which we expect to continue into 2022. Our teams are doing an excellent job deploying FBS to navigate those headwinds while also delivering strong margin performance and free cash flow generation. Looking across our end markets, the demand backdrop we're seeing is very strong with significant momentum in our order flow, driving continued growth in our backlog and double-digit growth across our software businesses. While continuing our focus on execution, we're investing in innovation, expanding our base of leadership talent and pursuing additional capital deployment opportunities as we look to enhance our competitive advantage and pave the way for consistent double-digit earnings and free cash flow growth in the years to come. With that, I'll turn it back to Griffin. Griffin Whitney : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Alexander, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We have your first question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : It's a pretty good quarter overall. I'm just trying to nitpick a little bit. If price up 220 basis points is - did that fully offset your cost, Jim? And is price still going up as you go into Q4 here to offset kind of the deltas as costs continue to rise? James Lico : Yes, Scott, thanks. I think number one is we've been ahead - as you know, we've been in a really good position all year relative to price cost. And hence, our gross margin's going up 90 basis points in the quarter. So yes, we're ahead. I think one of the things about price is when you think about it, we really think about it in the big hardware businesses as Fluke, tech and Sensing. And in that - those businesses, we were over 300 basis points. So yes and we'll see improvement from there in the fourth quarter. So yes, so we're in good shape. You'll see the price in the software businesses in the net dollar retention. And so net dollar retention at 102 or so with some of our businesses even higher means we're also - we're getting that price in a number of the software businesses. It just doesn't show up in the metric the way you'd like it. But we're, I think, in a very good shape relative to price cost in the hardware businesses relative to any inflationary pressure we might have. Scott Davis : Okay, good. And then ServiceChannel, you made some positive comments. And what is it more specifically that you like more perhaps today than when you closed the deal? James Lico : Well, I think number one, the team, I think, we didn't have full access to the entire organization when we were in the deal. So I mean, I think with the work we've done, we've been in person with the team, and I think we're excited about the quality of the organization. That's number one. We always said the product was great. So I don't think there's any surprise there other than the product is great and the solution is good. And as we articulated in the prepared remarks, the breadth of opportunity is really positive. I would say the other thing is we're really starting to see how we can continue to expand the business and some of the levers that are out there. So we'll do - as you know, we'll do our 100-day plan here in about a month, and we'll certainly codify for the remaining rest of the year, but more importantly for next year, relative to our plans. And right now, we're, I think, in a very good place relative to how we see the business. Operator : We have your next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Just maybe start with Fluke. And in most circumstances, something has not gone right if you're building backlog in Fluke. My guess is that was a factor with the supply chain issues. Maybe some color there would be helpful. James Lico : Yes. Sure. I think we had a very, very strong quarter at Fluke. As we mentioned, we did build backlog. As you know, any product that has a range of electronic components here is going to be a little bit of a challenge. So orders were in the high teens. So we're really good shape on the order side. We built backlog as you mentioned. I've been with the team a couple of times on the shop floor, and they're doing some really good work to get on with many of the component challenges they've had. But we're in a very good place with backlog and with the position of the business. I like where we're at, as we mentioned, from an innovation perspective in the prepared remarks, a number of examples of where I think we're really handling things well, and we're taking market share. And of course, all of that's also really driving strong margins there as well. Deane Dray : Okay. And then as a follow-up, I guess you should not be surprised. This is really a page from your playbook to jump on the opportunity to do some discretionary restructuring in the fourth quarter to get a jump start on the coming year. So this $12 million, just to be clear, that was not in your prior guidance. Is that correct? Charles McLaughlin : That's correct, Deane. We've got some things going on with the ASP Day 2 countries that we plan to get after, but hadn't been put into our guide. And then we've also got some things around facilities reductions that we're looking at reducing our footprint. Deane Dray : Got it. And which segments would benefit from those - from that spending? James Lico : Yes, about half of - half of it's in IOS and the other half and the other 2, almost split evenly between PT and health. Operator : We have your next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Interesting answer to the prior question, absorbing that. Also, is there some dilution from ServiceChannel in Q4 as you bed that down? And any change of view of kind of that year 1 accretion, I think, in the $0.04 to $0.05 range? Charles McLaughlin : So Jeff, this is Chuck. No change to the year 1 accretion around that $0.04 range. And actually, it's coming in just as we expected. But in the fourth quarter, we're going to get revenue with, really, not a lot of operating profit as it moves into profitability, really, in next year. So that's not different. And so inherently, there is a little bit of dilution there in Q4. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Margins look good in spite of that. And then just on this Walgreens deal, was that something in the pipeline already? Or is there some synergy that's already occurring with the Gordian or Accruent or some other part of Fortive? Charles McLaughlin : Jeff, I'd love to take credit for it, but it was in their funnel and the team did a great job executing on it. So I won't - we'll take credit for when the synergies happen, maybe next year. But right now, the team is - we - obviously, we saw it in the funnel when we did our due diligence. So we knew, and I think their say-do ratio of things they said they were going to do during due diligence versus what they've completed during our short time period with them has been really high. That happens to be one of the things that they've executed on extremely well. Jeffrey Sprague : And is the answer to the tech backlog, the same as the answer to the Fluke backlog, essentially just some supply backing up a little bit? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. I mean it's - we're not the first company to talk about it, what I understand. So I think at the end of the day, electronic components. What we said at the beginning of the quarter was it would be more an availability issue than an inflationary issue. We've seen some inflation for sure, but a lot of that's temporary because we're just - given the demand has continued to accelerate, it's a good news story here. This isn't just a supply constraint issue. It's really a demand acceleration standpoint. And with demand - the combination of demand accelerating really has our teams working diligently on these things. But it just puts us in a really good position at the end of the year, I think, to start 2022 off well in addition to, I think, just having a good backlog in the fourth quarter. Operator : We have your next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question on pricing. Just going back to the tariffs. I just remember that putting in pricing, price cost was an issue, and we have a lot more cost and all of a sudden price is not an issue. What has changed inside Fortive to enable this kind of pricing power? Because I just recall, like, 3 years ago, it was a lot more of a drag. Charles McLaughlin : Well, I think a couple of things. One, we've been working at pricing all year long. And I think what you're remembering is we offset the tariffs, but on a one-for-one basis, and so that created an operating margin drag because equal amounts of price and cost will do that. In this case, what we've been doing is staying ahead of that and getting, as Jim mentioned, in our hardware business, it's up to 300 basis points of price, and we still are getting PPV and taking it out of the business. But we are seeing that getting chipped away at, but we've been able to stay ahead, and that's why we're delivering margin expansion. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question. Looking back, you turned out to be prudently conservative on your view on elective procedures relative to everybody else and frankly, us. But where do you see elective procedures sort of going over the next 3 to 6 months? What's the pace of improvement as you see it globally? James Lico : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. What we saw, I think we ended Q3 at about 88%. Obviously, the Delta variant had impact in the quarter as the quarter progressed. We - we're assuming for the fourth quarter about the same, no real uptick. I suspect when we get a number - the federal vaccine mandate in the United States continue to get, hopefully, we start to get kids vaccinated here. Hopefully, we'll start to see in the first quarter, start to see some of those procedures coming back. And we'll get to the first quarter once we finish the fourth. But specifically for the fourth quarter, our assumption is things stay about the same as they are today. So we're in a good - we're in a really good place at ASP. As we mentioned, we had not - just a follow on to your question, a very good quarter at ASP. Equipment came in better than we anticipated to offset some of the headwinds from what we had on consumables. We had very good margin expansion at ASP in the quarter. So we like where that business is at. And if electives come back on the continuous basis in 2022, we'll be in a really good position to take advantage of that. Operator : We have your next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just the first question around the core growth guidance for Q4. So I think it's sort of plus 5% at the midpoint. You've probably got around 3 points of price in there. So sort of 2 points of volume growth . Is that reflecting just a big slowdown in the sort of short-cycle hardware businesses as that recovery has matured? Maybe is there something going on in China? I saw there was a big slowdown. Is that maybe going negative in Q4? Maybe just any context around the sort of volume growth assumption for Q4, please? Charles McLaughlin : Sure. There's a couple of things. I think the way you're looking at it, 200 basis points is the price increase. 300 is specific to the hardware businesses, but - so 200 overall, but you've got that about right. But when you look at it on a 2-year stack, we actually think we're still expanding, growing, increasing our growth rates in Q4 versus even Q3. So I think that's important. Also, I think as we noted, bookings are actually very strong here. So with the - what's implied in the growth, what we're able to get out the door right now isn't really reflective of the underlying demand of the businesses. James Lico : And Julian, I'd just say a couple of things. One, as Chuck said, the underlying demand on the orders for the second half is double digits, so very good order. From a demand perspective, we're seeing good demand. Relative to your China question, in the quarter, we had good growth at Fluke and ASP and as well as in Sensing. We'll see China get better in the fourth quarter, simply because while tech had a little bit lower growth in the quarter, they had over 20% order growth. And so we will see China get back to mid-single digit like growth in the fourth quarter. So we've seen good point of sale in China. So we're watching it carefully, certainly because of a lot of the headlines. But we had a good quarter. Chuck and I were on with the team last week doing an operating review. They're optimistic about what's happening on the ground there and the fourth quarter should improve sequentially from the third to the fourth. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up around operating margins. So you had very strong incrementals in Q3 year-on-year company-wide. It looks like for the fourth quarter, maybe you're assuming something in the third - maybe mid-30s operating leverage, so very good but a little bit lower. Is that just the sort of the run rate going forward for where we are with current sort of volume growth outlook and price cost and ServiceChannel coming in? Or is there anything sort of specific moving around in Q4? Charles McLaughlin : Great. So our underlying assumption is 40% incrementals. And I think when we print Q4, I think that's what we're seeing. Maybe when we get to the follow-up call, we can talk about ServiceChannel and - if that's confusing your model. But we have the incrementals in Q4 around that 40% as well. So I'm not seeing any slowing there. Operator : We have your next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So just going back to the restructuring, I think you said $12 million, Chuck, half of that in IOS, I think. The decision to do that, was that just because you've come in ahead of plan and you just decided that - a good idea to maybe do some investment here. And how should we think about this? Is this something that we can consider to be sort of a, \"one-timer?\" Or would the intention be to do quite a restructuring of this sort of magnitude in '22, '23 as well? Charles McLaughlin : Well, first of all, I think we always had an intention knowing that we'd bring on these Day 2 countries, and we'll need to continue to make some adjustments as we go forward to them on the ASP realm. I'd also say that as we come out of COVID, we're going to continue to evaluate our footprints here and see what we need going forward, then that's probably going to be an evolving thing. So you could theorize that we could see that going forward, but it's not like we have a plan. We're going to do a certain amount each quarter. It's as we see what the situation is and we need to make a change, then you're going to - and then we'll tell you about it. James Lico : And Julian - sorry, Nigel. The other part of it is we did some in the third within the business in Sensing to do some factory relocation as well. So really, in the second half, these are early ideas around the second half. And quite frankly, I think puts us in a good position. As we come together with our return to work plans, it really says that in certain - some of the businesses we have, we can take our footprint down. And so we're obviously going to take advantage of those opportunities as they come at us. Nigel Coe : Great. And then on Accruent, low single-digit growth versus mid-20s bookings. So obviously, a big disconnect there. Maybe just update us on how you see the revenue momentum at Accruent. I think there's a SaaS transition going on there. And maybe just touch on as well, the net retention of 102, that's the year-to-date metric. Is that changing at all through the quarters? And what's your target around net retention? James Lico : Yes. So relative to Accruent, you're right, we had a little bit slower revenue growth there, but we did have good bookings, really strong bookings in a couple of - several of what we'd call the growth businesses. We called those out in the prepared remarks but really strong bookings relative to the performance in those businesses. So I think we're set up well for mid-single digit in 2022. But you're right, we had a onetime hit on revenue that occurred in the quarter, a couple other things - a couple of little churn events or many churn events that we didn't anticipate. So certainly slowed it down a little bit in the quarter. But we think we're - because of the order strength, particularly around new logos, we are - we're in a good position for next year. Relative to the 102, we're always going to have some businesses up and down relative to where that number's at. ServiceChannel and eMaint would be our best performers on that metric as an example. Intelex would be pretty high. But we - I would suspect we'll get to sort of thinking about budgets as we go through the business. But I would suspect that you'd expect 100 basis points of improvement, 100 to 200 basis points of improvement somewhere in that range each year, at least for the next few years as we continue to - while these businesses are still new to Fortive. Operator : We have your next question from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : So just a follow-up question, not to nitpick on some of the - like, the margin differences here with the restructuring and then ServiceChannel coming in. But I just want to make sure I'm understanding this right, in Intelligent Operating Solutions that if we sort of add back in the half of the slugger restructuring that goes there, it doesn't look like ex ServiceChannel, there's really much of a difference in margins in 4Q. Is there something seasonal there or supply chain that's sort of interrupting that? Or am I just sort of putting this under a microscope unnecessarily? Charles McLaughlin : Well, I think their margins are very good, and they've got good margin expansion. So I think that there's just - we're talking about some - the highest - some of the highest margins we've got in the company. So happy to get through your planning sheet with you in detail and to help you understand that. But we're seeing, sequentially, margin expansion, I think, in all of our businesses. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just in terms of kind of your specific thwarted flavor of supply chain, maybe talk about like the 1 or 2 things that would be particularly helpful. I know some folks are really focused on chips, others have like freight and air freight or labor as issues. Like, what would sort of be kind of your top 1 or 2 things, Jim, that would be best to see. James Lico : Yes. Well, I can take you through a lot of detail because I think I've been more involved in these kinds of things over the last 60 days than I typically would, takes me back to some routes, I guess. Josh, I would say a couple of things. One, certainly in our businesses, think of it as the more electronic content, the more likely to have a challenge. So you can think about a circuit board at Tektronix, which is incredibly complicated, has multiple semiconductors on it, has multiple - all kinds of chip technology on a board like that. You're going to just have higher variability because of that. Fluke will be as true as well and then Sensing a little bit less. So from a - just how that goes, that's how it would be. We are seeing mostly electronic shortages. And as I said in the previous comment, mostly around availability. We're paying a little bit more to get things. So there's some premium freight involved in inflation, very - not a lot of labor. We have pretty low labor content in the company, simply because of our decades of productivity initiatives, so we're seeing some labor inflation, but at the end of the day, doesn't move the needle as much. It's really about the material availability first and foremost. And given our gross margins on those products, it makes sense to - even if we spend a few pennies more to get something in faster, given the high demand we have right now and just given the momentum in orders right now, it makes sense to sometimes pay those things, because ultimately, the margins. It just makes sense to do that. And obviously, our first and foremost, we're taking care of customers. So hopefully, that gives you a window. Every day, we're well set up to deal with this because we have daily management, what we call visual management. You've seen it in our factories during tours. Our businesses manage every cell and every factory by the hour. And so we're well set up to just sort of put that on steroids a little bit in order to amplify the challenges and just get after it. And so it doesn't mean we don't have issues. It's how well we countermeasure that really makes the difference here. Operator : We have your next question from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Markus Mittermaier : I wonder how agile pricing is in your backlog. I mean 40% backlog increase year-over-year sounds great on the one hand, but it's a double-edged sword, obviously. So once things hit your backlog sort of how flexible are you to adjust price further if you have to? James Lico : Well, number one, I think what we do is in the big businesses where we sell into distribution or we certainly limit the amount of buying that can occur at pricing. So if we have a price increase stated, we obviously have contractual terms, markets. And we will contractually make sure - we work with our channel partners as part of their contractual obligations to not necessarily buy, like, 6 months ahead or something like that. So that's a partnership and certainly part of how we work with channel partners. We've been able, in many OEM cases to reprice orders as well. So I think it really speaks to - I think others have talked about having problems in their backlog with pricing. We have really good granularity around what that looks like, and that's what gives us confidence to know that we'll continue to get the price here going forward and to know that our price cost will continue to improve. Markus Mittermaier : That's good to hear. And then maybe one - the follow-up on ASP. You talked both a bit on elective procedures where that's trending. But in your opening remarks, you also commented on installed base growth. So if I look into 2022, what's potentially the bigger driver here? Because it seems like the equipment placing trends are actually quite positive as well. So if I get that and I get elective procedure recovery, sort of what sort of growth should we be dialing in here? Charles McLaughlin : Say, Markus, I think that you're right. Our underlying business in placing units is starting to - is continuing to accelerate. We're very proud about that. I think elective surgery's coming back. This could be half - quite a bit of the growth if it all springs back in 1 year. But I think we need to get closer to next year to really see what they actually do and in what month. But I do think that it's a - just to answer your question, if it all came back at once, that would be the bigger driver of the year for ASP and be quite a tailwind coming forward. But we're not calling that all coming back at once in 2022. It will probably ramp. It's over some period of time. James Lico : And I think, man, Markus, one thing we know to be true over the last - certainly over the last 2 years, but certainly in the last 6 months, is that something has occurred every 3 months relative to electives that's caused it to go a little bit sideways. So I think it's premature to call next year, but it's safe to say that when we get to a more normalized sort of event in our hospitals, we'll be in - that business is certainly laying the groundwork, laying the foundation for good growth. I was with a major hospital network about a month ago in their facility. They're placing equipment, and they're looking forward to adding more elective procedures as they get forward. And maybe just one other comment on elect is, it's not only COVID, it's also - particularly in the United States, it is also the nursing shortage. So it's - it probably doesn't snap back, but it certainly comes back over time, which we really are looking forward to, obviously. Operator : We have your next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi Group. Andrew Kaplowitz : So obviously, Fortive continues to have a really strong balance sheet. I think you said 1.3x leverage at year-end. So could you talk about the M&A environment out there? We've obviously seen a flurry of software-focused acquisitions after your ServiceChannel acquisition. And I know valuations continue to be on the rich side. But do you see Fortive remaining active over the next few quarters on the acquisition front? And would you lean toward continued focus on recurring revenue and/or software-related assets such as ServiceChannel? James Lico : Well, Andy, our - as we said over the last few years, we've - as we've talked to you, we remain very busy. And I think the opportunities are certainly out there. I - we're working on some hardware things. We're working on some software things. It's really about accelerating strategy. It's about adding technology to advance our - what we do within workflows with customers. So I think we have a balanced approach to things. I think we see lots of opportunities to deploy capital in ways that really, not only accelerates our strategy, but gets us good returns, is additive from a growth perspective. We're certainly going to lean in on recurring revenue. We think that's a good way to - we really think that's a strategy towards building a more durable, resilient Fortive over time. And so I would say we're certainly leaning towards those kinds of opportunities. As we know, even our hardware deals, whether they were Industrial Scientific or Landauer or certainly ASP, we had a heavy amount of recurring revenue in those deals even when they were hardware. So we're going to continue to look for those opportunities, not exclusively, but probably the majority of the things we're doing is really going to have a passion for growth, but also with that idea that we can continue to build a more durable, resilient growth rate. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then maybe if I could follow up with asking you about tech in sort of a different way. You've always had good momentum there, and you talked about new product introductions this quarter. I know you mentioned tech's continuing strategy of focusing on data centers, EVs. So is that where the momentum continues to come from? And is tech's growth just maybe on a higher plane versus past cycles, given the sort of change in focus? James Lico : Well, I think number one is it's more resilient because our - we had, I think, low-digit growth in our service business, but just a resilient durable base and foundation of revenue that we've built over time. So number one, I think we've got a more resilient durable growth rate just because of that service business that we've built into the revenue stream. We've got some software offerings there that we started with. We mentioned that in the prepared remarks. So we're building a more durable revenue stream. While at the same time, as you mentioned, we've taken advantage of a number of real opportunities relative to what I would call higher growth situations. And quite frankly, when we think about going forward, obviously, the semiconductor cycle is going to extend as people continue to invest in the kinds of things that we've talked about, but also these supply chain issues and constraints fundamentally require a lot of folks who have electronics in their products to redesign those products for different chips or different components. And quite frankly, one of the things they need to do that is in oscilloscope. So we think there's also, not only the sort of long-term secular trends that the business has been going after, but also some shorter-term opportunities is as people start to continue to have to deal with some of these supply chain challenges. And fundamentally, that can often end up in a redesign. And certainly, we have the products and solutions to help people do that. So we're very bullish on the business. Obviously, it still has a component of volatility to it. But we - I think the team has done a nice job of continuing to drive technology and innovation towards higher growth, more durable revenue streams. Operator : We have your next question from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Maybe just a first question, going back to the gross profit margin improvement in the quarter. Obviously, very nice in the face of inflation. You called out the price cost benefits in kind of the hardware businesses. But wondering if you're also getting a lift from kind of this portfolio mix that you've been doing towards more software, more SaaS revenue? Or if that's not yet showing up? Just curious how you parse out that growth. Charles McLaughlin : No, I think - that's a good question. Especially when you take a look at our software businesses, you heard Jim mention a little bit ago about the net retention. That's another - where we also see price and great margin expansion. And we've got those businesses with their great margins growing faster than fleet average. That's going to give you a lift as well. So it's certainly our software businesses, but also the - staying ahead on the price cost is very important and offsetting what's a challenging environment. John Walsh : Great. And then you obviously highlighted both the internal and external promotions here. Was wondering if you could just give us a look kind of the next layer down and kind of your ability to keep the talent from the acquisitions that you've made? Any color there, please. Charles McLaughlin : Yes, sure. Well, we're incredibly excited to have Olumide join us. We obviously announced that earlier in the quarter. and he's off and running IOS and, really, we're excited to have him join the team. He brings a real view on software. It's really - all his experience is in software. And he created an enormous digital data analytics capability at CoreLogic. So he really brings a data-centric approach to these businesses, which I think is a wonderful part of his leadership style. Obviously, Tami's promotion is a great view on our internal development capability in a window on how we develop internal talent. So we're in a very good place with her promotion. Relative to the next layer down, we announced 2 internal promotions, both of whom came with acquisitions. Justin and Bill both came to us with acquisitions, Justin with ISC, Bill with Gordian. And so the promotions that we announced in the prepared remarks is a good example of how we continue to retain folks from acquisitions and how they are additive to our leadership capabilities. So we have a very rigorous internal development process. We announced several internal President appointments here recently as well to backfill for people like Bill and Justin. And we're in a very good place relative to adding talent. On the health care side, we brought in some new real new talent from a health care standpoint at ASP to really give us - even be additive to our health care experience. So I think we've not only have we been able to retain people through a very rigorous development process, but we've become a destination for talent, and we've certainly been able to recruit some top-notch talent. We mentioned Read Simmons as our Head of Strategy in the second quarter. We've continued to take opportunities to bring in folks who bring new approaches, and we're - we've been very successful in being able to do that. Operator : We have your next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joseph Giordano : So one of your competitors was talking - one of your competitors to tech was talking about having success in integrating like protocol analyzer capability into their scopes for, like, connected devices, IT. Is that something that you're doing? Or is it something you think is worthwhile? Just curious if that's an offering yet. James Lico : Well, I think at the end of the day, we have some protocol capability, but I think it depends on the use of the scope and the range of the scope where that's appropriate. So I would say that our direction has been more rather than adding additional measurement capability to some of the scopes, we've been really adding more solutions focused to really different probes, different software around the application to really help folks. That's where we've been really successful in automotive and in data centers, really bringing forward, call it the post scope work that really helps the engineer in the application - specific application that they're moving forward with. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And then, Jim, going into - when you guys gave guidance last time, you knew electives - you were appropriately cautious on elective surgery. Supply chain was bad then. I'm just curious, like, what are the big - like, the 1 or 2 single biggest, like, top line variances that will end up being realized versus what you thought last time? James Lico : In the third quarter? Joseph Giordano : Yes, like versus when you gave... James Lico : Yes. I mean I think electives certainly were part of it. We thought electives were going to be - we were conservative on electives, but we were - they were lower than we anticipated. So you could probably think about maybe $10 million of revenue that was there - just there. And then certainly, on the - we could have easily hit the upper end of our guide relative to revenue, which is roughly 300 basis points if we hadn't had some of the supply chain constraints that ended up. We always said that September's a big month. And we had several things that hit us in September that we didn't anticipate. So we still manage, as we noted, to have tremendous margins and tremendous free cash flow despite those challenges. And I think that's really - that really speaks to the power of FBS in terms of facing challenges, being able to countermeasure through those things. And this isn't a story of the absence of challenges, but rather the ability to deal with them. And that's what we'll continue to do in the fourth quarter. And you didn't ask it, but I would anticipate that we'll be dealing with a number of the supply chain issues well into 2022. Joseph Giordano : Can I just clarify one thing? The stuff that you couldn't get out from supply chain. Is that - because you couldn't - I guess, can you break it down between stuff that you were able to manufacture and the customer wasn't worried to take delivery and it's now sitting in inventory? Or it's stuff that you just couldn't get the components on your side to kind of... James Lico : No, this is all - oh, it's not getting components. We have - demand picked up tremendously through the quarter. As we said, we had very strong orders and we'll have strong orders through the rest of the year. So our demand profile's very good. Customers are taking things as soon as we can get them to them in most cases. So this is not an inventory situation or anything like that. This is purely a component shortage challenge that we're dealing with as, I think, has been well documented by a lot of other companies. Operator : We have your next question from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Andrew Buscaglia : I just wanted to ask on Advanced Healthcare as well. I mean - It doesn't seem like this will exactly be a snapback situation. You're facing some tough comps into the first half of the year. So I guess the question is where, I guess, FBS, but will we see some margin leverage? Like, I guess, what needs to happen to really see those margins pick up in kind of more muted first half maybe? Charles McLaughlin : Well, I think first, in Q3, we saw some outstanding margin expansion in the 8 - Advanced Healthcare segment going from, I think, around 20% in Q2 to 23% of adjusted operating profit. So we're seeing good margin expansion. And that's not just at ASP. Censis had a really good quarter, so did Fluke Health. So we've got - and our hardware placements there. And so you're seeing that already. What we're saying is it could have been better with - if elective surgeries - and that's going to be a future advantage. But to be clear, we had a good step-up between Q2 and Q3 in Health. And from Q3 to Q4, there's - we expect to do another 100 to 200 basis even with elective surgeries to staying where they're at right now. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Fair enough. And Chuck, maybe you can comment, I know M&A is definitely on the top of your minds with - given where leverage is. But stocks is kind of getting cheaper here and kind of - I've done a whole lot the last year. What's your - where are your thoughts on a buyback or maybe choosing that as a different avenue for the cash? Charles McLaughlin : We remain very optimistic about the opportunity to deploy capital. We've said that we laid out that we had probably $5 billion in the first 3 years post separation with Vontier. We've done $1.2 billion. It sounds like we're running way behind there. So we think we've got ample opportunity for that. And so we're not changing our priority being M&A. Operator : We have your next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Just a question on the AHS margins. I think if we kind of backed into a number last quarter. They were a little bit higher exiting 4Q. I don't know if you did a better job on margins this quarter. Is there anything going on there? Is there a - like, is that elective procedures? And can we think - can we still kind of think about a potentially kind of high 20s margin as we look out into kind of next year? Charles McLaughlin : I think it's - first of all, I think that margins - we expect margins to expand for a number of years in health, as we discussed. Yes, they're lower in Q4, and it's all about elective procedures being around 90% rather than the high 90s. That's somewhere around $12 million to $14 million of 75% to 80% margin business. And so when you do that, that clipped off about 200 basis points of margin expansion, but we're still expanding margins from Q3 to Q4. And we know that soon - that electric procedures are going to come back. So today's headwind there is tomorrow's tailwind. So - but we don't - the destination are going into those high 20s. That's still what we think is very possible. Nothing's changed about that. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then just heading into next year, you're exiting at kind of a mid- to - I guess, mid- to highs on organic. I mean, anything about the comps next year that would make that exit rate kind of unreasonable from an organic perspective? Should next year be more in line with your longer-term guidance on mid-singles? Or can you maybe do a little bit better than that given the headwinds you're kind of facing here in 3 and 4Q with the supply constraints? James Lico : Well, it's safe to say that we're going to end the year in a backlog position we never had before, Steve. That would certainly suggest some great opportunity for us next year. I'll hold my enthusiasm until we get to the full year guide. But things are setting up pretty well. Orders are very strong. They're going to continue to be good in the fourth. There's a lot of variables out there. Obviously, there's still to be considered, as we play out the rest of the quarter, to give consideration to. But as Chuck just said, relative to how AHS is setting up, we certainly talk about the software businesses, even where we had a little bit less growth at the current, we had good orders. So we think we can continue to build on our net retention. So I think we're certainly setting up for some good things, but let's get through this quarter. I'm pretty focused on the things we got to do right now to deliver October. So - but we'll get there pretty soon. And obviously, I think if it plays out the way we think, we'll certainly have - we'll be in our best backlog position that we've ever been in. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Whitney for any closing remarks. James Lico : Well, I think I'll take it from Griffin, but thank you, Alexander, and thanks, everyone, for your time tonight. We appreciate it, as always. We benefited from the hard work and determination of our 17,000 employees all around the world. We appreciate all your support, and we look forward to continuing to follow up with any questions you might have around the quarter as we get into the finish of the year. Thanks. Have a great day, and have a great earnings season. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Elena. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter, closing out a very strong year as we focused on delivering for customers in an ongoing challenging environment. While we saw sequential growth and margin expansion across the portfolio, revenue in the quarter finished roughly $50 million below expectations as continuing supply chain constraints and the impact from the Omicron surge hindered our ability to deliver on our robust orders and backlog. Our businesses performed well despite these challenges, generating 190 basis points of core margin expansion and 13% adjusted earnings growth in the quarter. Our tax rate was flat on a year-on-year basis at 9%, however, lower than our expectations coming into the quarter. Free cash flow and conversion were lighter than expected as we invested in inventory to support customer demand and saw lower customer receipts at year end. For the year, we delivered core revenue growth of 9.5% and expanded adjusted operating margins by 210 basis points, driving 32% year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings. Strong demand for software-enabled workflows yielded double-digit software growth in 2021 and the fourth quarter. These results are a testament to the higher growth, more resilient, higher-margin portfolio that we have constructed through organic innovation and strategic M&A. With this portfolio and our team's disciplined and rigorous application of the Fortive Business System, we are well-positioned to deliver long-term sustainable value creation for all of our stakeholders. As you can see on Slide 4, all of our segments contributed to our solid fourth quarter results, including over 100 basis points core operating margin expansion in each. Supply chain constraints within both our supplier and logistics networks as well as COVID-related challenges suppressed core growth across a number of our businesses. Looking at the segments in more detail. Intelligent Operating Solutions posted total revenue growth of 6.4% in the fourth quarter, with core up 0.8%. This included low single-digit growth in North America and high-teens in China, partially offset by high single-digit decline in Western Europe. Starting with Fluke, core revenue declined slightly as continued end market demand and order growth across its product portfolio were more than offset by supplier and logistics network challenges, constraining revenue in the fourth quarter. Fluke Digital Systems performed well with 20% -plus growth supported by strong demand for its eMaint SaaS offering and capped the year with greater than 30% growth in ARR bookings in Q4. Fluke also continued to see momentum within its product innovation pipeline. They introduced a new market-leading power quality platform, the 1770 Series power quality analyzer, and we're seeing continued strength in their acoustic imaging product line. Orders were up high single-digits in the fourth quarter, up 20% for the year, contributing to significant backlog growth in 2021. The team remains highly focused on improving supply management, logistics and factory throughput to deliver on the backlog in the year ahead. In EHS, Industrial Scientific revenue increased mid-single-digits, led by the continued recovery of its rental business and improved net retention for its iNet offering. Intelex grew by mid-teens with the fourth quarter representing the strongest net dollar retention we've seen in the past two years. Strong customer service execution reduced churn and the application of funnel management tools helped deliver a record year for customer upselling. In addition, Intelex and ISC continue to see success with their award-winning Hazard IQ solution connecting real-time field data with EHS management software from Intelex. As anticipated, Accruent declined mid-single-digit although was up sequentially despite less billing days in the fourth quarter. On a same-days basis, their SaaS sales would have been up mid-single-digit. Accruent continued to capitalize on strong demand for its EMS product line due to continued momentum and return to workplace solutions, with bookings up greater than 20% for the quarter and almost 50% for the full year. Accruent also posted its second highest quarter on record for SaaS bookings and drove another quarter of improvement in net dollar retention as it continues to deploy FBS tools to deliver on a higher on-time renewal rate across its growing SaaS customer base. We expect to see this result in higher growth in Accruent in 2022. Gordian increased mid-single-digit, driven by another strong quarter in procurement. Gordian also secured some notable wins in the fourth quarter, including the capture of two new state and local education customers, Clark County in Nevada and the Dallas Independent School District. Both are expected to begin generating revenue in the second half of 2022. ServiceChannel is off to a good start, following its acquisition in August. Revenue grew substantially in the fourth quarter with SaaS increasing low double-digits and SaaS bookings more than doubling on a year-on-year basis. ServiceChannel is successfully expanding its new logo pipeline with some notable wins in the fourth quarter, including a leading health and beauty retailer in the U.K. and is leveraging FBS tools and implementing lean portfolio management to position the company for additional innovation and growth. Moving to the middle of Slide 4. The Precision Technologies segment posted a total revenue increase of 2.1% with core growth of 2.6%. This included mid-teens growth in China, while Western Europe was up slightly, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in North America. Tektronix grew low single-digits despite strong customer demand, driving double-digit order growth across those major regions, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.2 in the fourth quarter. Orders for mainstream scopes and momentum in new product introductions are driving backlog levels to all-time highs, as customers continue to invest in new capabilities across a range of end markets. Tek continues to benefit from FBS, which helped to reduce supply chain risk and improve price realization across the business. Sensing Technologies increased high single digits in the fourth quarter, with good growth in its industrial semiconductor, HVAC and medical end markets despite continued supply chain challenges. Similarly, Pacific Scientific EMC brought further backlog in the quarter, as supply chain constraints persisted. PacSci continued to see strong bookings growth in its core markets, including aircraft and space, while revenues declined mid-teens, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.13 for the year. Moving to Advanced Healthcare Solutions on the right side of Slide 4. Total revenue increased 1.5%, despite a core revenue decline of 0.8%. This included high single-digit growth in China, flat performance in North America and a mid-20% decline in Western Europe. Starting with ASP, revenue declined low single digit in the fourth quarter. While we have grown the installed base, consumables continue to be impacted by lower elective procedure rates, especially as the Omicron variant surged in the U.S. in December, adding to existing skilled staffing shortages at hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers. These challenges primarily impacted revenue in the U.S. while our high-growth regions grew double digits. We are also pleased with the continued evolution of FBS with significant progress in operating margin expansion in the business. Censis revenues increased mid-single digits, highlighted by another quarter of strong growth in its core CensiTrac SaaS offering, which increased in the low 20% range. As in prior quarters, CensiTrac continued to see good momentum, adding new customers and saw improved upselling and cross-selling to existing customers. Fluke Health Solutions increased mid-single digits as revenue and margins benefited from growth investments made throughout the year, driving strong double-digit growth in its biomedical test equipment business. And Invetech declined low single digit as it lapped a tough prior year comparison that included strong COVID-related revenues in 2020. Our strong margin performance in 2021 is just one example of how FBS continues to be an important differentiator for Fortive. As shown on Slide 5, FBS is enabling our businesses to improve operations in our plants, tackle mounting supply chain and inflation headwinds, drive innovation and profitable growth across the portfolio and build skills and capabilities in our leaders to effectively drive sustainable business. Examples in the quarter include the reduction in supply chain risk at Fluke, ISC, CensiTrac and Tektronix through significant use of Obeya and daily management to manage the complexity and uncertainty associated with part shortages. ASP significantly reduced freight expense by over 100 basis points of revenue, contributing to their margin expansion in the quarter. Through the deployment of lean portfolio management, our newest FBS innovation tool, Tektronix overdrove revenue achievement on recent new products, including the just launched next generation of its 5 Series MSO offering. We are also making meaningful improvements in net dollar retention in our software businesses, allowing us to deliver more profitable and accelerated growth in EMA, which finished the year at 108% net dollar retention, while Accruent also increased monthly on-time renewal rate over 15 points from the beginning of the year. Despite COVID, we have continued to support all of our leadership development in kaizen activities. As a result of the rigorous application and dedication by our teams, we're continuing to benefit from our culture of continuous improvement. Turning to Slide 6. We made significant progress executing our M&A strategy in 2021 as we continue to evolve our portfolio to serve higher growth markets with attractive long-term secular drivers. Both, ServiceChannel and our IOS segment and Provation in AHS are acquisitions that significantly accelerate our strategy to deliver a broader offering of software-enabled solutions to address our customers' critical workflow productivity needs. These acquisitions build upon established market positions and customer relationships, adding well-positioned best-of-breed SaaS platforms, combined, greater than $200 million of high-growth software revenue with high incremental margins. Through ServiceChannel's proprietary data assets and networks, we see significant up-sell and cross-sell opportunities across our facilities and asset lifecycle management businesses. And with Provation, we are strengthening our presence in hospitals and ASCs with expanded software and data opportunities, leveraging leading positions in GI to capture multi-specialty expansion opportunities. Together, we expect these businesses to generate more than $0.12 of earnings accretion in 2022 and will enhance our growth and free cash flow profile going forward. I'm also incredibly proud of the work we've done in 2021 to continue our progress towards building a more sustainable future. As you can see on Slide 7, it starts with our shared purpose and our values, which have been translated into aspirational and actionable targets across each of our sustainability pillars. Leading forward to today is a diverse Board and leadership team with recent hires advancing our commitment to top talent and diversity. We recently ran our Day of Caring for the fifth time since the company became public. And in that time, our employees have dedicated over 400,000 hours of employee volunteer time to help more than 300 communities in 30 countries across the world. We are well on our way to achieving our carbon emission reduction targets and recently completed our TCFD reporting GAAP analysis to strengthen our governance and management of climate change-related risks and opportunities. We are actively engaged in responsible sourcing initiatives, and we take seriously the need to understand both the labor and the human rights practices across our supply chain. In 2021, we became a signatory to the UN Global Compact, further embedding our commitment to a sustainable future in our company's strategy, culture and daily operations. And we were also named one of America's Most Responsible Companies by Newsle for the third consecutive year. It's our shared purpose that also pushes us to create innovative and sustainable products and services for our customers trying to solve some of the world's biggest sustainability challenges. We look forward to continuing to make progress on our sustainability journey in the years to come. With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will provide more color on our fourth quarter financials, our free cash flow and our first quarter and full year 2022 guidance. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 8 with a quick recap of our fourth quarter performance. We generated year-over-year total revenue growth of 3.8% with core growth of 1%. Acquisitions contributed over 3 points of growth in the quarter, primarily from ServiceChannel while FX was a modest headwind. Year-over-year orders and backlog in our hardware businesses grew 14% and 84%, respectively. Adjusted gross margins approached 58% in the quarter, and operating margins were 24.4%, near the high-end of our guidance. This reflected 190 basis points of core operating margin expansion with over 200 basis points of price realization. Turning to the right side of this slide. Jim covered the segment highlights earlier and I wanted to provide some further color on the regions. North America revenues were roughly flat, reflecting strong demand across multiple end markets, offset by supply chain constraints impacting Tektronix and Fluke, as well as lower consumables at ASP. Western Europe saw year-over-year declines across much of the portfolio, including a difficult COVID-related compare at Invetech. That said, we had good growth at ASP, where elective procedure rates have held up better, and consumables are benefiting from recent growth in our installed base. Asia as well as our high-growth regions grew revenues double digits in the quarter, driven by mid-teens growth in China with strong performance across the portfolio. Turning to Slide 9. We generated $265 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter representing 92% conversion of adjusted net income. Working capital was a use of cash, as we made investments in inventory to support our robust revenue plan for 2022. And we also saw a change in receivables trend with lower customer receipts in the fourth quarter than we had expected. Staying with cash, we deployed $2.6 billion through M&A in 2021 and ended the year with net leverage of 2.4 times. We estimate M&A capacity of approximately $5 billion over the next three years, and the funnel remains full across each part of segment with both hardware and software opportunities. We remain disciplined, looking to add assets to our portfolio that significantly enhance the leading positions of our segments and increase our value proposition to our customers. Turning now to the guide on Slide 10, as we look ahead, we expect that in 2022 will be another year of differentiated growth and margin expansion in each of our strategic segments, supported by secular tailwinds, continued strong demand backdrop and a robust backlog heading into the year. The 2022 outlook is based on a balanced set of assumptions, including the likelihood that supply chain constraints will persist through much of the year with continued strength in orders at least through the first half. We expect another year of strong price realization to more than offset continued cost inflation and the benefit of our software strategy to generate double-digit software growth in 2022, taking total software revenues to $950 million. And lastly, in health care, we are planning for elective procedures to remain flat to 2021 levels in total, starting lower and ramping over the course of the year. Turning to the next slide. We are introducing full year 2022 guidance with revenue in the range of $5.7 billion to $5.9 billion, representing 5.5% to 8.5% core growth, while acquisitions, net of unfavorable FX, will contribute an additional 3.5 points of growth for the year. Adjusted operating profit margins in the range of 24% to 24.5% with margin expansion in each segment. Adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $3 to $3.13, up 9% to 14%, with an effective tax rate of approximately 16%. Adjusting EPS growth normalized for tax would be 14% to 19% for the year. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be approximately 105% of net income, which would yield a 20% free cash flow margin. In summary, our portfolio continues to show the benefits of the actions we've taken to build a more resilient growth company capable of converting more revenue to earnings and more earnings to cash. Turning to Slide 12 and the first quarter guidance. We expect a similar external environment as the second half of 2021 with revenue of $1.34 billion at the midpoint, with core revenue growth in the range of 1.5% to 4.5% and approximately 4% revenue growth from acquisitions, net of unfavorable FX. Adjusting operating profit margin of 23% at the midpoint, up slightly year-over-year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.65 to $0.69, assuming a 15% to 16% tax rate in the quarter; and free cash flow conversion of approximately 70%, slightly higher than our Q1 seasonal trend, reflecting partial recovery of receipts that slipped out of the fourth quarter. With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks. James Lico : Thanks, Chuck. As many of you know, Fortive celebrated its fifth anniversary as a public company in 2021. And as you can see on Slide 13, we continue to validate the investment thesis that we have pursued since 2016. Our through-cycle core growth has doubled from low single-digit to mid-single-digit as we have more than doubled our base of recurring revenue and meaningfully added higher-growth, higher-margin software businesses to our portfolio. Our gross and operating margins have increased as well. We've improved gross margins over 800 basis points. And back in 2016, we started off talking about 30 basis points to 50 basis points per year operating profit margin expansion. Now we're talking about 75 basis points on average per year through the cycle. As a result, earnings and free cash flow is also up meaningfully over this time. We are on track to a 20% free cash flow margin in 2022, up from approximately 18% in 2021, further differentiating Fortive. Wrapping up on Slide 14, and before we move to questions, I'd like to thank our team members for their exceptional commitment to our shared purpose and core values, which underpin everything we do and how we do it. Extraordinary teams delivering extraordinary results again in 2021, even in the face of unprecedented supply chain constraints and prolonged COVID headwinds, our teams remain focused and committed to delivering for our customers, each other and our shareholders, delivering financial results well ahead of our initial expectations coming into the year. While each of our businesses continues to evolve and improve across key metrics, we know there is more to do. As such, we expect another year of differentiated growth and profitability in 2022, taking us one step closer to delivering on the multiyear targets set back at our May 2021 investor conference. Finally, we know you have a choice and we want you to be with us for the long term. We're confident the work we do to create long-term sustainable competitive advantages for our operating companies and our strategic segments yields best-in-class sustainable returns for Fortive for a long time to come. With that, I'll turn it back to Elena. Elena Rosman : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Josh, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : I just wanted to follow-up on the sort of organic sales guidance for the year. So you're starting out with core growth of low single-digit in Q1. That's moving to mid to high for the year as a whole. And I suppose, particularly in IOS and PT, where there is a lot of kind of short-cycle hardware, what gives you the confidence in that acceleration? I understand fully that supply chain conditions make it a little bit easier for you to execute on orders. But conversely, as you go through the year, we may find that orders slow down. And so, I just wondered what gives you that confidence in that sort of second half or back half core acceleration in IOS and PT. James Lico : Good to hear from you, Julian. Morning and afternoon, our time zone here, I guess. First of all, I think when we look at the full year, as you said we see some improvement through the year at Fluke and Tek. We had a very good fourth quarter in Sensing. So I think the supply chain constraints have been in Sensing, but we have good confidence there. I think when you look at the backlog situation at Fluke and Tek, as you pointed out, very strong, record backlog in both businesses as we start the year. And quite frankly, we don't anticipate any backlog reduction in the first half and really minimal backlog reduction in the full year. So, we see the demand side of this from an order perspective, we talked about that in the prepared remarks, as an example, Fluke up 20% in orders for 2021. So, I think, we definitely - and we're seeing the drivers that we've talked about, some of those secular drivers continuing to play out. So whether it's the strength in innovation, whether it's some of the things that we've been doing in particular markets to differentiate the business, we see the demand front still very good in the first half. So certainly, there'll be maybe a little bit of a slower growth rate from 2021 from an orders perspective. We still see the demand environment very good to deliver the year. And quite frankly, we think we'll go into 2023 very strong as well. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then just my second quick one on Advanced Healthcare Solutions. It's been a tough period, obviously, for two or three years with the TSAs and then COVID and the lingering sort of aftermath. Just wondered when you're looking at that business, would you say that after that sort of tough three-year period, the guide is fairly conservative there for 2022 now? And how do you assess the competitive position of AHS? I suppose, particularly in the ASP piece, do you think that's been losing share or it's holding its own? James Lico : Yes. Thanks. First of all, I think when we look at the fourth quarter, it's really indicative of our strategy playing out. When you think about one of the things we said from the onset is that we could take those high-growth markets and really regions outside of the United States. And as we brought them into a more focused business, we would deliver success. And you see that in the double-digit growth that we had outside of the United States in the quarter. We saw good mid-single-digit growth in capital around the world. And as we said, we've grown the installed base over the last few years. So we feel good about a share perspective because we see that on the equipment side. As you point out, a little bit tougher on the electives than we anticipated. That's been a tough thing to predict. We feel we're going into the year relatively - maybe not conservative but appropriate in terms of looking at what happened in the fourth quarter, not anticipating that getting better through the year, even in Q1, maybe a little bit lower on the electives as we see Omicron. But I think as we stand today, we had great margin expansion at ASP and in health in the fourth and you'll see that in the first even as well. And we think the strategy is playing out very much. We've done a nice job on the gross margin and operating margin side at ASP. More broadly, I think we've positioned the segment well with the addition of Provation, certainly another a great add to the segment. So, I think it's been appropriate relative to predicting ASP. And I think when you look at the core growth rate for the full year in 2022. You see our strategy playing out more broadly. And you certainly see that as we accelerate growth through the year and, quite frankly, continue to deliver strong margin expansion. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : So, I guess just cutting it a different way, how do you expect the year to build from a core growth perspective? Should we expect a nice step-up in 2Q? Is the third quarter? Like just maybe a little bit more color on kind of the organic growth trajectory as we kind of move through the year. Charles McLaughlin : Steve, this is Chuck. What we expect is probably not going to be a surprise. We're constrained right now with supply chain. But as we move through time, we expect that some of that will gradually accelerate. I mean, we're talking about going from 3% up to high single - up 7% for the year. So I think that it just gradually - there's not a step function that happens. It doesn't happen all at the end of Q4 is what's built into this guide. Steve Tusa : Right. But I get to the high - I guess, to get to the high end, I mean, you're talking about something that's beyond that, obviously, where you're starting just how the averages work. So I mean, are you going to be exiting the year at like a double-digit rate on organic? Charles McLaughlin : Yes, we would expect to. We think that we've got, as Jim talked about, strong order momentum coming into this year. We don't - while we expect that supply chain will allow us to increase our shipments, we're not sure that it - and we have a really strong backlog position. So we do expect supply chain as we go through the year to get incrementally better each quarter and would have us exiting year very strong. Steve Tusa : Right. Because I mean, that like $50 million or whatever that you missed out on this quarter, I mean, just looking on a quarterly basis, that's 4% of an impact in any given quarter from that. Is that kind of kind of lessen the trajectory to an extent there? Okay. And then just one last one on ASP. Why are you guys' kind of forecasting electives to be flat? I mean, have you really seen a change in trend there that makes you worried? That seems to be like really conservative. So I don't know, is there something you're seeing that others aren't on that front? Charles McLaughlin : No. It's really that what we realized we haven't been able to predict it going forward. So what we want to show is, hey, this is where it is right now. You can see the margin expansion has been good all year long, and we don't expect us to have growth there. And this is what happens if a basic don't get better. And maybe, if anything, it's acknowledging that we can't actually predict that. We would say that if electives go up, then we'd have upside here. James Lico : Maybe just to add on to that. Maybe just add to that real quick is that, we typically think of this as the Omicron variant and the new variants, it's also the combination. We said this in the prepared remarks that there are some specialty staffing challenges in the United States. And so we think it takes a little longer for that to bring to come back. But I think the strength of the momentum building on the installed base and as we said, the strength of really, quite frankly, the growth we've had outside the United States, those two combinations really showing our strategy play out. So yes, I think we've been a little bit more conservative on the elective side. But I think what we're seeing with the margin expansion and some of the things I just mentioned, certainly, the strategy playing out and creating momentum for the business through the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Just a question, sort of a supply chain question for you. After the tariffs, I think you guys made some adjustments to your manufacturing footprint. As we are sort of experiencing the supply chain constraints, particularly hitting Fluke and Tech, what are your thoughts about how to make the supply chain more resilient going forward? Thank you. James Lico : Yes. Andrew, I think number one, as we said, supply chain constraints, typically, I would think about it in two categories : one, from a supplier perspective, and the other around freight and logistics. So let's take the supplier side. You're certainly right. A number of our countermeasures that we had relative to the tariffs put us into some locations around the world and Asia that were hit harder by COVID. That's certainly been part of the challenge. The second part of it is, when we think about microcontrollers, when we think about ASICs, when we think about FPGAs, those are components, particularly on the ASIC side, where we've really designed around sole source differentiated technology, which has historically given us better margins and better differentiated technology from a product perspective. You see that mostly in the higher-end products at Fluke and at Tech. And that's why Sensing didn't have as big an impact relative to this because they tend to use more commercial off-the-shelf products. So we're getting those things changed where, as you said, the question of what we're doing, we're qualifying new suppliers, we're redesigning some platform architectures around the ability to source in different places. We're moving some - we're moving supply base out of some maybe higher-risk COVID locations in the world. And all of those actions played out and will play out in the fourth - in the first quarter. That's where you see the core growth getting a little bit better at both Fluke and Tech in the first quarter. And then it continues to improve through the year. So we're not anticipating necessarily a big shift in change relative to the supply side in the year. What we're really seeing is the benefit of our countermeasures building through the year. So that's how we think about it. On the freight side, it's clearly freight lane challenges from Asia to the U.S. And you see some of that in the growth rates in Asia between Asia and the United States. Some of that has impacted by the fact that we just don't have to ship product as far when we're shipping product into Asia than we are into the U.S. So that's a broad, broad swath of the actions that we're taking. And it takes a little while to get some of those things all in place, but we'll see that improvement. We're seeing that improvement now and we'll see it build throughout the year. Andrew Obin : That actually makes a lot of sense. Thank you. And I missed the first couple of minutes, so I apologize if you've answered it, but I'm looking Slide 13. And you sort of brought out total software revenue for 2021 and 2022. As I think about the fourth quarter, what was the total software growth? And specifically, if also you could give us a sense zeroing in on SaaS, whatever metric you want to highlight, revenue or ARR, just to see how - what's happening there because that's a big part of the growth strategy going forward? Thank you. James Lico : Total software growth was low double-digits in Q4 and in the full year, so that certainly has the benefit of ServiceChannel. I think our core revenue growth was mid-single-digit in the fourth. So good. And I think really what we saw that was really good was our ARR growth in the fourth quarter was high single-digits. So I think we saw a good benefit from a number of our strategies playing out both core and certainly with the addition of ServiceChannel and Provation. That gets to the 2022 targets that we highlighted in the slide you're referencing. We'll see that growth be double digit in Q1. So we're really seeing, I think, good - we saw some good benefits. It takes a little on the SaaS side for that revenue to impact the full year. But as I said, we'll see it in the first quarter. Feel good about where we're at relative to the core businesses, but also what we had in both ServiceChannel and certainly what we're seeing early days of Provation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. And I\u2019ll say good morning, because its - it is morning where you are. So just want to dig into Fluke and Tektronix. How did the sell-in versus sellout to the channel play out? Because I'm assuming that the channel wants more products. So I'm just curious, if there's a big disconnect between the sell-through, the distribution channels? And any color on where inventories are right now would be helpful. James Lico : Yes, thanks. And Nigel, I think, I said this on the third quarter call, but we think about - when we think about inventory now, we also think about, given that we've got a substantial backlog, we're also going to look at what distributors have on order, so that we make sure we understand relative to true demand versus maybe inventory building on their side. And I think in that regard, we see good sales out and we don't see big inventory on hand or relative to the inventory build. So we're seeing a good demand environment relative to both Fluke and Tech. And I think it is somewhat impacted by the availability. So we would say, hey, it's probably even - it could be even better if we were delivering at the on-time delivery rates that we typically do, which is in the high 90s. So I think, in general, as I sort of said to Julian's question as well, we're seeing good demand on the demand front. And I think we're starting - we're seeing that in some of our channel partners' external comments. So we feel good about the demand environment where we have distribution businesses on a global basis. Where we're delivering maybe a little bit better in Asia, we saw better sales out and we saw good sales in. So I think we feel confident about the level of activity that's going on with customers. We've got a lot of good innovation, as we highlighted in the prepared remarks in the quarter, and we have really accelerated innovation in 2022 at both Fluke and Tek, which we also think will have a nice impact. Nigel Coe : Yes. The question is really more about depletion of inventory rather than buildup. And if the channel is really light, which I think it probably is... James Lico : Yes, it was. Nigel Coe : Yes, that was from acceleration, which seems to be what people are focused on. My follow-up question is - there on Accruent. It was down again in 4Q. Where are we on this SaaS transition? And when do you think Accruent will get back to revenue growth? James Lico : Yes. I think number one, we called it out, and I'm sure probably answered that on the software numbers as well. We did have less days in the quarter. So where we have staff, we have a little bit of impact relative to less days. We think, as we said in some of the guides, we think the combination of Accruent and Gordian, when you sort of think about that, we've moved some businesses between the two on a full year basis at low double digits. That's probably a little higher at Gordian. But we would see - right now, we see Accruent in the mid- to high single digits for 2022. So we had good ARR growth in the fourth quarter. So the combination of the work we're doing, we'll still have some SaaS transition because in many cases, we're relying on new logos and that new logo growth can be a little bit more of a headwind than if we were converting a very large maintenance installed base to SaaS, like we are at Provation. So it's a combination of things that we're doing, new logo growth but \u2013 at Accruent and also just continuing to invest in those high-growth opportunities. We talked about it in the prepared remarks, workspace planning as an example, our EMS product line, which grew 50% in the year. So it's a combination. That's not our biggest product line. But over time, at that growth rate, it inevitably takes over being a bigger part of the growth story, and we'll see that starting to play out in 2022 and 2023 at Accruent. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Welcome to Elena, and thank you, all, for reverting to the morning call slot. Much appreciated, although I was concerned it might throw Jim's biorhythms off, but didn\u2019t happen to be. I appreciate right upfront, you sized the $50 million in revenue miss related to supply chain, but that's really become a catch-all for everyone. Can you give any more specifics, either by product line? Is it semiconductor-related resins, customer readiness? Just maybe take us through what the actual blockages were. James Lico : Yes. So I would say first \u2013 and first, given the fact that I've been on East Coast time for the better part of 20 years, this is a fine change, but we do listen. And Elena's been a great add for sure, and we're really excited to talk about the frame that we've got at a time zone that's easier for all of you. I think number one, we would think about that $50 million is about 70% supply chain. So think of the remaining piece of that as probably COVID related, a chunk of that being electives being lower than we anticipated and some of that is just kind of some of our service businesses and things like that that had a little bit of challenge in December of getting on site. So the 70% of supply chain, let's break that down a little bit. The majority of that is it's Fluke and Tektronix and a little bit at EMC. And I would say, Fluke and Tek, it really is about electronic components and some of the things I described on Andrew's question, very much around how - a big portion of that is application specific ICs. Those are technologies that are pretty much dedicated to what we do in our product lines. And the work we do, as I described before, is really the countermeasure to doing that. So it's - so I won't go into more detail on that since we already did. But another part of that is what we saw at EMC, and the EMC thing is pretty specific to some specific supplier shortfalls as well as some customer challenges that I would also say that it has a little bit of - you might have seen this in other government - people have government contracts on the commercial side and on the military side, where customers have to come in to validate products before they get shipped. And we saw less activity at the end of the year, just given COVID. So that's a swath of it. But the biggest bucket, the highest bar is really the supply chain issues we described at Fluke and Tek. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. And then just a follow-up question on Tektronix record backlog. Can you parse out how much of that is supply chain related, but also with all the semiconductor capacity coming on, you would think that there'd be some demand there that might have also translated into the higher backlog. But are you able to differentiate between the two? James Lico : Yes. I would say \u2013 Deane, I would say almost no amount of that backlog is customer driven from an inventory or buy ahead kind of standpoint. Maybe a little bit, because we've been raising prices. So I'd say, there's a little bit of backlog in what I would call price increase. But we limit the ability for customers to be able to do that in terms of weeks of supply. So there's some of it, but not a lot. It really is on the demand side. It's certainly on the semiconductor side. We're seeing great growth at Keithley. But we're also seeing it more broadly in some of the products that we designate for maybe industrial markets, some of the power strategies we've talked about. We're seeing some of the new innovation on the two series, some different probe categories, and we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the new 5 Series. We're seeing really good customer interest in those products. Hence, our book-to-bill was \u2013 was so strong. So I \u2013 we really think the demand cycle for Tek is certainly going to be strong in 2022. And quite frankly, as much as you can get early signs on this, we think strong in 2023 as well, given those dynamics, some of what you described and also with the color I just provided. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : I got a couple of things here, but one kind of just bigger picture, I suppose. But \u2013 bigger picture is not. ASP, your consumables are down. Are you \u2013 is your total installed base of boxes higher today than base units higher today than when you bought it? Has that grown at all, Jim? James Lico : Yes. We said \u2013 I think, we said, we've had low single-digit compounded growth in installed base over the last several years. I think cap \u2013 terminal sterilization capital is actually up mid-single digit in the year. So we've seen growth in installed base since we bought ASP, which is additional boxes in your terminology. Scott Davis : Okay. And then also a clarification. Did you say that when that backlog in PacSci is going to clear out? Is that something that's first half of the year? James Lico : We don't anticipate the backlog at PacSci side, quite frankly, Deane \u2013 or sorry, Scott. We don't see it completing at all this year. We have a really, really strong backlog at Pacific Scientific right now. Scott Davis : Okay. And then last, just quickly, what is lean portfolio management? I don't recall hearing that term before. James Lico : Yes. It's our new innovation tool. It's really a thing and historically, it's really from \u2013 it really applies to both software and hardware. It's a new tool that we're deploying in every one of the businesses. And it really is sort of an accelerated product development. It's a set of tools that accelerates product development, manages the portfolio better in terms of how to look at early-stage innovation as opposed to maybe being maybe slight \u2013 over the years, we've been maybe a little bit more focused on the next generation of things we do. I think it brings some new concepts around managing not only the things we've got to do in the next generation of things, but also bringing on some new things that really drive full incremental growth base focused on new secular drivers. So built over time, we should see better returns on our R&D investment, and we should see accelerated core growth from those investments as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Good day everybody. Just a few loose ends here, a lot of ground covered already. Just on price, the 2% number, was that Q4 or the year? And can you tell us how much price isn't guided - is embedded in your 2022 guide? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. That was a Q4, the 2% overall in Q4 2021. And for what we're thinking, what's embedded in our guide is 2% for 2022. That's about twice what we would normally get as in a normal year. Jeff Sprague : And on tax, are we in the process of normalizing to some higher level? The tax rate's been certainly on the low side here in the recent past. What's actually driving the increase? And should we expect it to move higher in future years? Charles McLaughlin : Well, I think we came into the year thinking 14% as the right baseline for us, and I think that's pretty good. What drives it down in 2021 is some discrete items that came through usually around some of the bigger transactions, even with the split from Danaher that are really hard to predict. We don't see any of those going forward. So we - a normal, we revert back to that 14%. What we don't have in here is anything about U.S. tax reform or changes. But what we do have is the international tax rate are going up in some countries and there's a global minimum tax rate that's going up. So in 2022, we actually end up with probably a $0.12 headwind versus - and that's embedded in our guidance. The rate is 16%. Jeff Sprague : So if the R&D tax credit gets renewed, extended or whatever, we're much likely coming down a couple of hundred basis points on the tax rate. Is that right? Charles McLaughlin : No. I think we anticipate that to get renewed, so that's not changing. It's really about the \u2013 what's going on internationally in tax rates. Jeff Sprague : I'm sorry, just quick one. Jim, just back to Accruent. Is there any, I don't know, disruption or dissynergy going on as ServiceChannel comes in, maybe mutual customers where one plus one isn't equaling two? Just any color there. Is that any part of the revenue pressure we're seeing at Accruent? James Lico : Not in the quarter. I think what's embedded in - there could be some moving back and forth at this point right now. There's nothing dramatic that's anticipated, Jeff. I would say what we're seeing though is we are seeing those value - I mean, we're getting great visibility into the value propositions of each of those businesses. And I think we have a better sense of selling strategy. And I think we're in a very good place. We may see some challenge between situations over time with customers, but nothing is anticipated from the size. And particularly, some of the growth drivers, particularly like about things like workspace management, no conflict whatsoever. That's really an independent strategy and product line that really resides at Accruent. So I think we've got some good levers to pull in the Accruent business. And obviously, the broader opportunity that we have with ServiceChannel around the things they do is really great. And I think with the combination of what we do at Gordian and Accruent in some of those overlap is only going to continue to help us build a better position and value proposition for customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Chuck, you gave some color on the regions, but can you elaborate as to why Europe was significantly worse than your other two geographies in terms of sales trends in Q4? And it seems like supply chain headwinds have been worse for some of your peers in - so just curious as to what's going on for you in Europe. And then China seems to be holding up well for you. Can you talk a little bit more about your outlook for the key regions in 2022? JamesLico: Yes. I think - I'll take it. Number one, on the Europe side, we really do have a comp issue in Invetech. Last year, Invetech had really dramatic growth in the fourth quarter and that was really a customer in Europe. So a little bit of a comp situation in Europe as it relates to what we typically see, Andy. When we think about the globe and just kind of going around the world, we had, as you said, very good high-growth market growth in the quarter. We had very strong China growth as we've had very strong China growth around the world all year. We're really - Chuck and I did a review with all of our high-growth markets the other day. And quite frankly, we're hitting that - we're really firing on all cylinders relative to the work that the businesses are doing in China, so we would anticipate continued good growth in China for the year. We think that high-growth markets continue to be good. So I would say that plays out. We have a little bit of supply chain headwind outside of Asia simply because most of our supply base is in Asia for the businesses that have electronics. This is a hardware comment more than a software comment, obviously. But we do see some impact, both in Western Europe and in the U.S. simply because the logistics of getting components out of Asia and into the U.S. and into Europe to our - in many cases, our factories, was a little slowed in the fourth quarter. That improves, I think, over time as some of these freight lanes get a little bit uncongested over time.  So that gives you a broad swath. I would also say we'll see North America also improve. A little bit of that elective impact in North America, obviously, had to do with the fact that ASP was strong outside of the United States and really have that elective impact mostly in ASP. So bringing all that back, supply chain improvements really help us globally, particularly in the U.S. and Europe as we go forward here. And as I mentioned and relative to those, some of the activities that we're engaged in relative to improving the supply chain, they'll obviously impact what I would call our developed markets in U.S. and Europe, that probably more predominantly than anywhere else. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that Jim. And then Chuck, you're guiding to relatively normal conversion for Fortive, I think 105% for 2022. And I think you mentioned a little bit of counter seasonal improvement in working capital in Q1. So maybe you could talk about your confidence that excess inventory is basically peaking now and will start to normalize as you go through the year. And then maybe you could give us the impact of cash generation if the R&D tax credit is not extended. Charles McLaughlin : I'd probably have to come back to you on the R&D tax credit if it's not extended. That would be surprising but potentially I guess every time - until it's renewed, we'd put that on there. So let me come in in our follow-up call, I'll add that number for you. From working capital, I think that what will happen here is that supply chain rolls out, we'll get more sales out and our inventory turns will improve. And as we talked about also things related to COVID, we expect that receivables come down. That will primarily start to seeing that improvement in the first half. There's always puts and takes in our conversion ratio about what can go on there. There are some things going on with the timing of tax payments there that - we're talking 1% or 2% here that can go either way. But we'd expect normally, we start off in Q1 with a 50% or 60% conversion. It accelerates through the year as it has the last couple of years. We're probably a little bit ahead of that in Q1, but it won't get over 100% until probably the second quarter and into the second half. Elena Rosman : So I know we're coming up two minutes short on the hour, so if we can take our final question, Josh. Operator : Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Maybe just a couple of two cleanups. One, I don't think I heard you talk about kind of the multiples you're seeing in your pipeline. Are some of the private multiples resetting like we're seeing in the public markets? Or what does that look like in terms of something maybe breaking free here? James Lico : Yes, John. We always say the funnel is pretty good and I would say that, that's very true. We remain busy. The private market tends to lag a couple of quarters here from what you see in the public market. They go through all the cycles of denial and things like that. So I suspect we'll - as we look at things and as we continue to be disciplined about what we look at, we will take that into account as we look at things, knowing that potentially it takes a little while for that to occur. And I would say we feel really good about the two deals we've done over the last few months with ServiceChannel and then Provation closing at the end of the year. So lots to do with those two businesses to really take and help those businesses continue to - they're great businesses. We've bought great businesses. We've got great opportunity there. So we're spending time on making sure they become - they get a great start in Fortive. And we remain disciplined and we'll watch these private transactions. But I do think it will be a couple of quarters before those valuations start to see themselves hit in the private market. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe just a follow-on to this microcontroller supply chain question. How much of your sales ramp through the year? Do you kind of already have commitments from suppliers that you, at least on paper, have access to those components that you need versus how much actually needs the supply chain to get healthier as we go through the year? James Lico : Well, I think as I said, it's a bit of a - there's lots of things going on. We have - we have letters from suppliers very often and then they fall down on those. So we're going to make more of our own lock here as we go forward relative to redesigning, requalifying those kinds of things. And I anticipate with the strong backlog we have, what we've put in the guide is a level of confidence with the things we've got. But it is a little bit of hand-to-hand combat every day on what happens and people, where they stand on commitments. I think it's been well documented the capacity challenges and some of the challenges that exist within the semiconductor industry and more broadly, just the electronic component industry because it's not just semiconductor. So we'll continue to prevail. I think when you look at our maybe batting average on actions, it continues to improve through the year. And we expect it to continue as these countermeasures work. But certainly, as we think about things getting better, we don't have a belief that it dramatically gets better. What we really see is the benefit of the actions that we've been taking, a higher probability of those actions really taking place as we get through the year. Thanks, John. Elena? Elena Rosman : Yes, that concludes our call. Jim, do you have any final comments? James Lico : Yes. So thanks, everyone, for the time. Hopefully, this time works better for you. And this process works well for your time frame. I know you're in an incredibly busy day and a busy time of the season. We appreciate the time and energy that you put into spending some time with us. Obviously, we're available for follow-up calls. I think what you see in the year, hopefully, you got a sense of certainly, there were a number of things and challenges in the fourth quarter. I come back to the 9.5% core growth we had for the year, the great margin expansion that we've had over a couple of years. And quite frankly, over a two-year basis, the strong free cash flow that we continue to demonstrate. We walk into '22, a lot of our strategy playing out in terms of health care, a lot of our strategy playing out on software, as we described. And I think a lot of the actions we're taking to take advantage of the innovation that we put in some of our hardware businesses, particularly at Fluke and Tek and within Sensing. So we're incredibly fortunate to be in the position we're in. The world is not without its challenges. We certainly think we are well positioned to take advantage of those as we move through the year. We look forward to the continued follow-up and conversations with you, and hopefully, we'll get a chance to see in person here sometime in the next few months. Thanks, and have a great day.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fortive Corporation\u2019s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Elena Rosman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rosman, you may begin your conference. Elena Rosman : Thank you, Ana, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today\u2019s call.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks, Elena. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. I\u2019m extremely proud of how our teams have come together to navigate the continued challenging environment and deliver an outstanding quarter with better than expected revenues, earnings and cash flow. Our strong purpose driven culture supported our relentless focus on executing for customers, shareholders, and each other while facing unpredictable obstacles. Despite these challenges we saw record orders growth across several of our businesses, reflecting continued demand for our leading connected workflow solutions. Hardware orders grew 14% adding approximately $130 million to backlog. And our software-enabled businesses grew mid-teens with double-digit growth in both our SaaS and license revenue streams. Through the rigorous application of the code of business system, we continue to deliver improvement across our businesses, driving greater visibility and insurance of supply in the quarter. Our teams also worked hard to overcome higher inflation, which resulted in 60 basis points and 30 basis points of gross and operating margin expansion, respectively, a 11% EPS growth and 36% free cash flow growth in the quarter. Overall, the momentum across all three of our segments in the first quarter sets a strong foundation for the year ahead and reinforces our confidence in our full year 2022 outlook. Turning to Slide 4. I wanted to provide an update on what we are seeing, and what we expect a over the remainder of 2022. Starting on the left in the current environment, strong orders growth was driven by accelerated innovation, continued share gains and leverage to favorable secular drivers spanning all geographies in end markets yielding an 18% increase in hardware backlog in the quarter. Our continuity of supply is improving, driven by daily management and conversion Obeyas [ph] allowing us to ship more product in Q1 than initially planned. Our China teams did a great job mitigating the intermittent government mandated COVID lockdowns across the region, starting in Tianjin in January. Shanghai lockdown at the end of March impacted shipments by approximately $20 million in the quarter, primarily at Tektronix. With operations restarting, we expect to face sub bottleneck in supply chains. However, our teams will be relentless and work to revamp quickly. Moving to the right hand of the side of the slide, we expect sustained core growth driven by normal seasonality, continued strong customer demand and record backlog, which gives us a tailwind for growth again in 2023. Combined with pricing and operational performance, we expect strong margin expansion in another year of double-digit earnings and cash flow growth. As Chuck will cover in more detail shortly, we are updating our outlook to reflect the strong start to the year, raising the low end of our guidance for the year. Lastly, our ability to convert more earnings to cash, underpins our investment thesis, and allows us to reinvest in our businesses, accelerate our strategy and enhance our returns to shareholders. In the first quarter, we took the opportunity to buy back approximately 1 million shares totaling $64 million. The M&A pipeline remains full with hardware and software opportunities across each of our segments and we estimate M&A capacity of approximately $5 billion over the next three years. Moving to Slide 5. Our leading connected workflow solutions facilitate transformation across high impact fields like workplace safety, facilities management, product development, and healthcare. Our strategies across these segments is incredibly powerful. We serve customers ranging from technicians and facilities managers to engineers, product developers and healthcare professionals who all work in challenging environments where Fortive technologies provide higher quality instrumentation, better sensors, superior software, and real time data analytics to empower them to do their jobs more safely and more efficiently. As you can see, each segment is well positioned to benefit from favorable secular tailwinds and durable business models that underpin our strategy and vision to build a stronger collection of businesses with industry-leading profitability and free cash flow margins. And I\u2019ll now provide some details on each of the three segments beginning with Intelligent Operating Solutions on Slide 6. IOS had a terrific start to the year, as customer demand for maintenance, uptime assurance, environmental health and safety and facility planning solutions all contributed to double-digit orders, growth and strong revenue growth in the quarter. Total revenue was up 15% with core growth of 8.7%. This included approximately mid-teens core growth in North America, and high single-digit growth in Western Europe, more than offsetting a low 20% decline in China. Our FBS countermeasures to improve assurance of supply are making progress, mitigating the effects of the COVID lockdowns and driving better core growth in the quarter. We continue to see solid price realization, which we expect further benefit perform to the second quarter and the remainder of the year. And while our counter measures enabled us to ship more product, we also incurred additional costs from elevated freight and logistics expenses. As a result core operating margins were flat year-over-year, despite price cost being positive on a dollar basis. IOS adjusted operating margins were 27.2% down 145 basis points due to the dilutive impact of the ServiceChannel acquisition. As a reminder, ServiceChannel\u2019s margins are ramping nicely in line with expectations and IOS core margins are up over 200 basis points on a two-year stack basis. Some other highlights of the quarter include, record revenue and bookings of Fluke supported by strong point of sale, particularly in the U.S. where point of sales grew of mid-teens. Industrial Scientific continues to make progress diversifying its businesses with nine out of the 10 largest Q1 deals booked with new customers outside of oil and gas. Intelex is also seeing strong demand for it SaaS solutions continuing to grow at a healthy double-digit pace. And likewise, we saw record core growth in facilities and asset lifecycle management in the quarter where Accruent had a solid start with mid single digit growth and is on track for sales acceleration in the second half. Gordian generated strong double-digit growth and secured a large data win with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Further ServiceChannel had a strong double-digit revenue grow and record bookings in the quarter as customers continue to outsource their facilities maintenance work. Turning now to Slide 7 in Precision Technologies. We saw record customer demand, driving double-digit order growth across major geographies and a broad set of end markets, including HVAC, aerospace and defense, automotive and electric vehicles and semiconductors. PT revenues grew 3.4% with core revenue growth of 4.6%. High single-digit growth in North America and Western Europe was partially offset by a low double-digit decline in China, driven by COVID related lockdowns in Shanghai at the end of the quarter. As a reminder Tektronix operates a major manufacturing facility in Shanghai, which shutdown the last week of March. The impact was approximately $15 million to PT revenues or 350 basis points of growth, which also impacted their margin performance in the quarter. That said PT operating margins expanded 30 basis points, reflecting over 50 basis points of gross margin expansion, partially offset by continued investments in new product development. Some highlights of the quarter include successful new product launches, driving incredibly strong order growth at Tektronix, including the refresh of the five series in the first quarter, which is tracking solidly above plan. Sensing also saw low-double-digit top-line growth, reflecting solid share gains across it key markets and had over a 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in the quarter staying well ahead of inflation. Moving now to Slide 8 in Advanced Healthcare Solutions. AHS continues to accelerate innovation and digitization in hospitals and ASCs. With custom and clinically superior workflow solutions, AHS is well positioned for a multi-year recovery in healthcare. Revenue increased 8.5% in the first quarter with core revenue growth of 0.6%. Mid-single-digit growth in North America was largely offset by a low-single-digit decline in China due to the impact of COVID restrictions on ASP and a high-single-digit decline in Western Europe as expected. AHS operating profit margins benefited from FBS enabled productivity initiatives, driving core margin expansion at ASP, as well as the accretive benefit of the probation acquisition partially offset by lower volumes in Invetech. From highlights in the quarter include elective procedures in North America were roughly in line with expectations in the first quarter. As a reminder, we expect electives to continue to improve an average 88% of pre-COVID levels for the year. We saw approximately 20% growth in the Censis track SaaS offering at Censis an approximate doubling of subscription orders in the quarter. And probation secured several significant orders in the first quarter, including four competitive GI wins in large 20 hospital network win for its eye procedures anesthesia solution. Execution in an otherwise challenging and uncertain environment is one example of how FBS continues to be an important differentiator for Fortive. As shown on Slide 9, FBS enabled our businesses to enhance supply chain resilience, drive innovation and profitable growth across the portfolio and build skills and capabilities in our leaders to effectively deliver on our commitments in the quarter. Examples include, an improvement in unit output and reduction in supply chain risk at Fluke through the use of daily visual management, allowing them to outperform in the quarter. The execution of lean portfolio management at Tektronix driving several new customer driven product launches in the coming quarters. Value pricing and pricing leakage tools, driving strong price realization at Sensing Tech. Substantial margin expansion at ASP from broad cost reduction [Technical Difficulty] more than offsetting lower consumable volumes in the quarter. Daily management and problem solving drove an improvement in working capital terms at Fortive China. And several examples of our progress in our software businesses, including incremental growth realization at Accruent from improved uplift on renewals, a 20% improvement in time to first revenue for procurement customers at Gordian and an acceleration of growth opportunities at probation. As you heard me say before, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the work we\u2019ve done, continuing our progress towards building a more sustainable future as you can see as Slide 10. Fortive\u2019s commitment to sustainability started on day one. When we developed aspirational and actionable targets and subsequently invested significant time, energy, and talent to establish a performance driven program. This timeline reflects the evolution of our program and commitments we have made since 2016. In early June, we will publish our fifth sustainability report, reflecting consistency and progressing levels of transparency, including adherence to the GRI reporting framework and completing our first CDP climate change disclosure in 2020. Adding the SASB reporting standard to enhance our climate related disclosure to investors in 2021, and new in 2022, we will provide our first UN Global Compact statement of progress to find our status and plans for TCFD-aligned disclosure and offer initial Scope 3 emissions data and Scope 2 market based submissions in our CDP climate change disclosure. It is our shared purpose that also pushes us to create innovative and sustainable products and services for our customers trying to solve some of the world\u2019s biggest sustainability challenges. For example, Intelex leading software solutions for EHS and sustainability managers serves leading Fortune 500 companies across multiple industries. In fact, our EHS and sustainability teams use the Intelex application to manage and drive continuous improvement of our greenhouse gas emissions accounting in accordance with the GHG protocol. Includes diverse range of products provide solutions that advance workplace health and safety as well as optimization of renewable energy installations for our customers. Consistent with our culture, we are driving incremental improvements in sustainability, and we look forward to continue progress in the years to come. With that I\u2019ll pass it over to Chuck. Who\u2019ll provide more color on our first quarter financials and our second quarter and full year 2022 outlook. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks Jim, and hello everyone. I will begin on Slide 11 with a quick recap of our first quarter performance. We generated year-over-year, total revenue growth of 9.3% with core growth of 5.3%. Acquisitions, net of FX were as expected contributing four points to total growth. Turning to the right side of the slide. Jim covered the segment highlights earlier, and I wanted to provide some additional color on the regions. North America revenue was up high single digit, including low teens growth in software and related services. Partially offset by lower consumable volumes at ASP. Western Europe revenues grew mid-single-digit more than offsetting year-over-year declines in advanced healthcare solutions driven by a difficult COVID-related as compare at Invetech, that said we had good growth at ASP despite capital and installed delays in the region. We have low-double-digit growth in Asia, outside of China. While China revenues declined low teens driven by the impact of the COVID-related lockdowns. Note, that we continued to build backlog in China with high teens order growth in the first quarter, thus reinforcing our outlook for double-digit revenue growth for the remainder of the year. On Slide 12, we show operating performance highlights for the first quarter. Adjusted gross margins were 57.6% increasing by 60 basis points year-over-year, while adjusted operating margins increased to 23% in line with our guidance. We realized over 300 basis points of price in the quarter more than offsetting inflation, yielding 30 basis points of core operating margin expansion and 250 basis points on a two year stack. Adjusted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.70. While free cash flow generation of $196 million represented a stronger than normal conversion of adjusted net income in the first quarter. The strong, free cash flow performance included an improvement in the timing of receivables collections representing a normalization of the trends we saw in the fourth quarter. Turning now to the guidance Slide 13 and starting with the second quarter. We expect low to mid single-digit core revenue growth, which includes a headwind of approximately $40 million from the COVID-related government shutdowns in Shanghai, which we expect to subside in mid-May. Adjusted operating profit margins are expected to be up at least 80 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.73 assumes a 15% tax rate in the quarter and free cash flow conversion of adjusted net income is expected to a increase to approximately 100%. For the full year 2022, we are raising the low end of our revenue guidance by $40 million to reflect the strong start to our year. We continue to expect adjusted operating profit margins for the full year to be up over a 100 basis points. Adjusted EPS is now in the range of $3.4 to $3.13 up 11% to 14% and free cash flow conversion of approximately a 105% for the full year. Moving to Slide 14, we are expecting a 48-52 split of revenue first half to second half, which represents a step up of approximately $255 million of revenue and includes favorable price and FX, first half to second half, in addition to higher volumes supported by a robust backlog position and the work we\u2019ve done to mitigate supply chain constraints across our portfolio. We also expect to recover lost China volumes as a result of the government mandated lockdowns in the first half shifting more revenue to the second half. Incremental margins on a sequential volume are expected to flow through at attractive levels, contributing to strong margin performance in the second half. In summary our portfolio continues to show the benefits of the actions we have taken to build a more, a durable growth company with high recurring revenue profile, mitigating the risk of slowing demand in the second half. With that, I\u2019ll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks. Jim Lico : Thanks, Chuck. I\u2019ll now start to wrap up on Slide 15. Over the last six years, we have articulated a portfolio strategy to build a more resilient, less cyclical business capable of outperforming and even the most difficult of times. The Fortive portfolio of today is a reflection of how well we\u2019ve executed that playbook. Our acquisitions have added approximately $2.3 billion of revenue to Fortive as of 2022, which is expected to grow low-double-digits this year. And in doing so, we\u2019ve doubled the through cycle core growth of the company versus the time of the spin-off from Danaher in 2016. We have also more than doubled recurring revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to approximately 40% and built a portfolio of software enabled workflow solutions, which is approaching $1 billion of revenue and continues to enhance our long term competitive advantage. In addition, the businesses we have added to Fortive have been an important contributor to the more than 1000 basis points of gross margin expansion that we have driven since 2016. In short Fortive of today is delivering higher and more profitable growth. And there\u2019s nowhere that this shows up more than in our free cash flow. Lastly on Slide 16 that strong free cash flow, which is nearly doubled since 2019, continues to be a hallmark of our investment thesis, compounding faster than revenue and earnings and allowing us to accelerate growth and compound returns through discipline capital deployment. 2022 is off to a great start. As the outperformance in Q1 reinforces our focus on sustained growth and execution leveraging the power of FBS, which will always be a part of who we are? And how we do? What we do? We expect another year of double-digit earnings and free cash growth on track to deliver on the multi-year targets set last year with differentiated growth and profitability amongst our industry peers. As a result, we\u2019re confident, the work we do to create long-term sustainable competitive advantages for our operating companies, the strategic segments we yield best-in-class returns for Fortive for long time to come. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Elena. Elena Rosman : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Emma, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question today comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning or whatever it is \u2013 over here. Yes. It\u2019s kind of afternoon over here. So within kind of the businesses that are most exposed to China, what are you seeing there in kind of the, just the ground level economy? Not necessarily like the shutdown dynamic, but what are you seeing outside of the shutdowns and what is your kind of order pace and backlog look like over there? Jim Lico : Yes, Steve its Jim. First of all, I think commercially, we think the business was it had a very good quarter orders were up double-digit in the quarter. And despite the shutdowns that started in a various cities at the beginning of the quarter, we really didn\u2019t see a lot of impact relative to our commercial activities. Point of sale still good throughout the quarter. So from a commercial perspective, we\u2019ve pivoted like as an example, when we had to have folks work from home, we did that in 2020, so that was an easy process. So the real impact was really just to the manufacturing facility in Shanghai that we described in the prepared remarks and was really not really a commercial issue relative to commercial activity, really just a function of the fact that, that our factory, the Tek factory, and as well as our industrial scientific factory were shut down and our logistics providers were shut down as well. Steve Tusa : Right. And I guess if can you maybe talk about, have you guys done any, analysis around what if we went into kind of a mild global recession, what would be kind of the algorithm for you guys, what you think your core would do, how you would defend earnings? I mean I think there\u2019s obviously a lot of concern around recession out there. You guys get bucketed in this kind of short cycle industrial camp for some reason. Maybe talk about what you would kind of any leverage you could pull to mitigate the cyclicality that\u2019s inherent in the business. Jim Lico : Yes, well I think number one, in the short run, give kind of our backlog position, we would be in very good shape as an example, if we saw the sort of a slowdown, that some businesses saw in 2019, we would weather that storm with the backlog without an issue. We would just dip into the backlog more than we anticipate in this guide. So in that sense, we\u2019ve got much more of an insurance policy going into the second half more broadly, as you remember. I think our, even when we see something more dramatic, like we did in Q2 of 2020, we had outstanding free cash flow, then we had obviously protected our gross margins extremely well. And it, with a high gross margin number, we can flex expenses pretty well in the medium term, which we demonstrated in 2020. So I think those are some of the levers. And then the last thing would just be, we\u2019d lean on the 40% of recurring revenue in the healthcare side of the business, which, we\u2019re going to be in a healthcare resurgence here, I think because of COVID. And it\u2019s really not going to be economically impacted. It\u2019s really going to be all the things we\u2019ve described. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about, so I think, we certainly don\u2019t want the recession in any way, shape or form, but I think we\u2019ve built the portfolio for the last five or six years with anticipation that inevitably something like that might happen. And we\u2019d be far more resilient relative to our business model in which to be able to handle a situation like that. Steve Tusa : Right. Great. Thanks a lot. Jim Lico : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good afternoon. Hey maybe just the first question, trying to drill into the adjusted operating margin. So I guess looking sequentially, revenues were flat-ish in Q1, you had a big margin dip sequentially you assuming a pickup sequentially in Q2, even with the China headwind getting worse or looking at it year-on-year. You\u2019re looking for a bigger acceleration year-on-year in Q2 than Q1. Again, even with that China headwind. So maybe help me understand the, sort of the confidence on margins, particularly as I think you only came in line with the initial guide for Q1. Chuck McLaughlin : Yes, so Julian a couple of things first, if well, revenues were flat from Q4 to Q1, but really there was, we brought on service channel that didn\u2019t have the same I\u2019m sorry, probation, I mean into that mix, but when you look at Q1 to Q2. I think that there\u2019s merits and things that come in, but Q2s margins are up 80 basis points over the prior year and really showing those 40% incrementals in Q2. And then as we move through the year, we see more revenue coming through not even having it come through probably around 50% incremental margins on the step up and volume plus things like the service channel and become margins will increase as we go through the year and also probably get a little bit more consumables. We expect to have more consumables in the second half; all these things build towards that margin expansion. Having said that, a tough environment, 23% in line operating profit margins for Q1 is up 30 basis points. And given everything that went on, we feel pretty, we feel very good about where the start to the year. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then just, wanted to discuss sort of how you\u2019re thinking about your orders in the current quarter. I think you called out Jim, hardware orders overall at 40 or up 14% in Q1 even including strength in China there. So, wondered how you\u2019re thinking about the resilience of that order intake in the current quarter, and whether you\u2019ve seen anything change for example, in terms of European demand yet. Jim Lico : What\u2019s interesting, Julian is European orders were good. I would say so I think as we look around the world and I\u2019ll stick to the orders or order question obviously continued improvement in orders, I like the fact that when we look at things like U.S. POS or Fluke and Tek as an example, that those numbers were in line with POS or order growth was pretty close to our sales out. So, I think we feel very good about the durability of the order pattern at this point. The numbers are slow on a real basis simply in the second half, simply because of the two year stack and things like that. But I think as you look at the progression of strength that remains there, we saw a little bit of advanced buying at blue for some ahead of a price increase. So there\u2019s a little bit of that but that\u2019s all inherent in our guide. And I think we you know, we built, as we said, 130 million in backlog. So I think what you really look at is the durability is good. Some of the order strength that sensing is real was advanced ordering for the second half. We saw some large customers are put in the orders for the second half. So, I think we have a good sense of what\u2019s advanced ordering and what\u2019s really real time demand. And we base that against a number of the things that we\u2019re looking at channel inventories are in pretty good shape, little bit of elevation, but not anything that we would be alarmed, certainly within demand of what they typically be at. So, I think out in balance, when we look at the hardware businesses, we\u2019re certainly looking for signs of things that might suggest to slow down or anything like that. I think thus far we\u2019ve yet to see that and feel good about the backlog situations that we\u2019re in our ability to sort of deliver on that. So if the order rate were to go down as an example, like I said, on Steve\u2019s question, if the order rate were to go down in the second half, then we would just dip into the backlog, which in the current guide is we\u2019re not planning to do much of. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Andrew Obin : Hi. Yes. Good morning. Jim Lico : Hi Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hey just looking at the Slide 14, you seem to be embedding higher throughput in volume, just shipping more hardware, and looking at the progress from Q4 to Q1, can you just talk about some tangible steps that enables you to achieve this, that you could share on this, is just more supply chain clearing or the counter measures that you are taking, but just maybe dig in a little bit more as to what is allowing you to sort of actually finally get the volume out of the system. Thank you. Jim Lico : Yes. So thanks, Andrew. I think number one is, what we saw in the quarter were some nice examples of getting after a number of the things relative to some of the supply chain constraints that we\u2019ve described, obviously for a few quarters here. And to be just consistent with what I\u2019ve said pretty much for the last nine months, we really never anticipated the supply chain issues would go away in 2022, what we anticipated and what I think what we saw in the quarter and will continue to see is the impact of our countermeasures. And so, you saw that at Fluke with their growth rate, as one example, certainly Sensing Tech performance in the quarter, which was outstanding, both on the top line and bottom line as another good example of that. And quite frankly, we would\u2019ve seen more of that at Tektronix, if it hadn\u2019t been for the shutdown in Shanghai in the last week. So a number of examples of progress in the quarter relative to those challenges. So not from a lack of challenges, but just the power of FBS to countermeasure those challenges will continue to see that as the year progresses. As you mentioned, what some of the things that\u2019ll, provide that volume in the second half, some of that is just kind of normal, normal seasonality. We just tend to see things go out a little bit more in the second half. Some of that is U.S. government buying in the third quarter. Some of it is year-end stuff. So some of its inherent in that we\u2019re going to see consumables get better, the elective procedures get better. We\u2019ll see ACV growth continue to sequentially improve in our software businesses. And then as I described, we\u2019ll see some continued improvement at Fluke Tech and at Sensing Tech, which I think we demonstrated in the first quarter. And we\u2019ll continue to demonstrate through the remaining part of the year and into 2023. Andrew Obin : And then just a follow up question and perhaps it\u2019s a conjecture in our part, but we would\u2019ve thought that Tek has the most advanced chips and once again conjecture, but probably the toughest supply chain situation. So, what gives you the confidence you\u2019ll be able to catch up on the 60 million of volume that was shifted out of first half into the second half. Thanks a lot. Jim Lico : Yes, sure. I think number one is if we look at tax performance in the quarter, you never like to say if China hadn\u2019t had, but the reality is we had an unanticipated shutdown of a manufacturing facility in the last week of the quarter, if we shipped some of that, that volume roughly $15 million, you\u2019re into a good growth rate for Tek. And I think that just represents the progress we\u2019re making, but you\u2019re right. A sophisticated supply chain, for sure. We\u2019ve got good partnerships with a number of large scale semiconductor manufacturers who supply a number of key components. We\u2019re redesigning some things that are going to occur in the second and third quarter. So, I think we look at the tangible actions that are in place, the progress that we\u2019ve made thus far, and the confidence in those, in that progress going forward. So those are really and this is not in a theoretical level. This is really, we talked about the conversion obeyas [ph] and some of the daily visual management and part of FBS. This is literally walking into those obeyas and having a sense or the actions, pressure testing and like we would under any kind of operating review that we do every month. And really what comes out of that is a higher degree of confidence as we progress through the year. Chuck and I were with the Tek team down at Beaverton a few weeks ago, I guess it was more than that now. And you know, literally walk us through the factories, seeing the actions and what the team\u2019s doing and that\u2019s where that confidence comes from. Andrew Obin : Fabulous. Thanks so much. Jim Lico : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Yes. How things how as well \u2013 by the way, I love the new format of the slides. It\u2019s a much easier to read, much more formative. So just thinking about the Accruent and Gordian performance, double digits, I think maybe mid teens in 1Q and I want to make sure I heard this way Accruent grew mid-single-digits there, which I think is the first quarter of growth in some time. And so number one, just maybe talk about that transition back to growth that Accruent, and then look into 2Q you got the mid-single-digit growth from Accruent and Gordian that\u2019s a detail from 1Q. Just wondering what you see in there. Thanks. Jim Lico : Yes, I think we have a \u2013 first of all, we had a good quarters in both businesses. I think we\u2019re, we mentioned in the fourth quarter call about, we were starting to see traction with some of the countermeasures and actions that we were happening in the Accruent. I think we just seen, we continue to see those things. It\u2019s a consistent message from what we said in our last call. Olumide is doing a really, really great job with him and the team I think in making progress. And so that\u2019s a multi quarter continued improvement, but we\u2019re starting to see the green shoots and their efforts. And obviously you see that in the quarter. Gordian had a fabulous quarter across many, many ways their JOC Solution was up over 20%, I think. So just a very good quarter and really across their product line. That\u2019s just a, I think just a continued strength of that business that we\u2019ve seen for some time. And the combination of those two businesses is really performing well right now, as you know, we\u2019ve moved some product lines between businesses. So it\u2019ll slow a little bit in the second quarter because of a comp that we had a Gordian last year where they had a, some finishing of contracts that of job order contracting that was some upside in the second quarter last year, but in the base business and kind of on a two year stack, we\u2019re seeing good performance Q1 to Q2 sequentially with the common in those businesses for sure. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks, Jim. And then just on the price, I think you the queue called that 3.2% price in the quarter. Can you just remind us, what your expect expectations are for the full year and how that shakes out between first off as the second half? Thanks. Jim Lico : Well, I think we had probably about 300 basis points of price if I remember in the quarter, I think if I remember that number right. And I think it was, we had good price across the board. We\u2019ll probably see a part of, you obviously saw it in the bridge. There\u2019s I think $20 million more of price in the bridge first half to second half. So you\u2019re seeing, you\u2019re going to see a little bit more price in the bridge. So, I think on balance, we\u2019re continue to see good traction with price and a good balance between price and volume as well. So, I think we\u2019re certainly getting price in price cost. I think the idea that we grew gross margins by 60 basis points in the quarter, I don\u2019t know a lot of companies that grew gross margins in this environment and for us to grow gross margins in the quarter, I think is just a real testament to the high quality work we mentioned on the slide, the price realization work, and the price kaizen that we do really, continuing to demonstrate our ability to get price, but also quite frankly, our ability to still maintain and deliver value to customers. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks, Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks, Nigel. And I didn\u2019t answer your second question. So the second part of that question, which is that will improve, as I said, $20 million in the second half, we would believe that there\u2019s, that just demonstrates, I think the continued success that we would have relative to those kaizen in. So, we\u2019re going to continue to do a lot of those events through the remaining part of the year. Not assuming that inflation does anything, but either stay the same or maybe even get worse. We want to be ahead of the game and proactive on the price game. Emma, go ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : Hey good day, everyone. Jim Lico : Hey Deane. Deane Dray : Hey first question, just to clarify the expectation or how you land on that $40 million impact from China, is that a bottom up analysis of the front log customer discussions and so forth, or is it a kind of a top down swag on a percent of the business that you do \u2013 you\u2019d be expecting? Chuck McLaughlin : So Deane, it is really not a customer issue at all. As we mentioned, we\u2019ve got really strong backlog. It\u2019s just about, the rock rolling block downs in Shanghai, particularly in having the factory open and being able to produce, that we\u2019ve done a great job of getting material in and available and improving supply chains, but we need those lockdowns to end. And it\u2019s function of how many days it\u2019s locked down. That\u2019s how we\u2019re calculating the impact Jim Lico : And customer specific orders to your question around detail, Deane, this is not, this is really looking at orders that are on hand on the books, in some cases, products that are already sitting in the factory just need to go out. Deane Dray : Understood. Is there, if you think about potential sales that could not be realized in the second quarter you\u2019ve quantified China. Are there any other, either areas, regions or product lines that of sales that, will be either past due you just can\u2019t ship component shortages, or is it all China? Jim Lico : Well, I think the story of certainly the 40, we talked about is the China story certainly inherent in the way we talked about our backlog is that, we continue to have a very robust backlog, but of course, that means that customers are always getting the products in the timeframe that they necessarily want them. In some cases where it\u2019s distribution, that might be going into distributor inventory. I think the stat we look at in that case is we look at the amount of time to fill meaning what is our, if we\u2019re missing an order from an on time perspective, how much time does it take for us to fill it on to the time that the customer requested and those numbers aren\u2019t getting better? So, I think, first thing we look at is that time to fill after that, then we look at the on time delivery. So those numbers are starting to get better. We\u2019re in customer conversations all the time in situations. So throughout those conversation around backlog, we\u2019re having conversations with customers about, how do we help them be more successful? And I think what\u2019s been good about that is I think we continue to see share gain opportunities and have seen share gain across the portfolio in a number of those cases. So, I think that suggests that we\u2019re doing a nice job of managing those challenges. Deane Dray : That\u2019s helpful. And it just as a follow up on the commentary about M&A, and the capacity you said you\u2019ve got both hardware, software candidates there. Do you have a bias between the two? Is there a bias on deal size? And then lastly, what inning you think Fortive is in, in terms of the portfolio pivot that has started a couple years ago, because you think back at 2016, you had a set of businesses and it\u2019s been dramatically changed in terms of a higher gross margin, higher recurring revenues, more software. If we think of that as a journey, at what point \u2013 what inning do you think you\u2019re in today? And when would you see that there\u2019d be a stabilization or maybe a landing point. I know there\u2019ll be continuous tweaking from there, but just some context would be helpful. Jim Lico : Yes. Great question. I think number one, we don\u2019t, I think what our bias is a balance and think, we\u2019re going to be deal dependent in the sense of what comes available. It\u2019s hard to say with relative to the funnel hardware or software balancing act versus what becomes available, what we\u2019ve been working towards and that kind of thing. So, I would say at any point in time, it\u2019s going to look like we have a bias, but I think over a longer period of time, you see that balance kind of coming out. So, I\u2019ll stay away from committing to that balance because some of it is very much asset dependent. I think we probably are biased more towards bolt-on kinds of deals right now, I would say. I think given where we just did two great deals on probation and service channel, as we met that in the prepared remarks, they\u2019re out of the gate and out doing really well. And we certainly see an opportunity to do a number of kinds of deal, the breadth and depth of the funnel. But if you have to sort of think about, there\u2019s probably a slight bias towards the bolt-on or two here, in the near term, at least relative both into the transformation, I think it\u2019s interesting, Chuck and I have talked a lot about this with, if you look at the segment structure today, we\u2019re only 12 months into that segment structure. And I think when you look at it, and you look at the power of what the segments have delivered this quarter. I think you could only look at that and say, we must be in the final, final innings of a transformation because it, the performance is so strong across the board and the opportunity is so great with $40 billion worth of serve market. So you never say never. That\u2019s why we do strategic plans every year. That\u2019s why we sit down with the board on a regular basis to talk about performance, but I think where we stand right now, we feel very good about where we\u2019re at and it\u2019s spring. So we\u2019re always optimistic as baseball fans, but I think at the end of the day, we feel really good about the portfolio right now. And I think as you look at the guide for the remaining part of the year, and you start to see how the full your stacks up segment-to-segment strong growth, strong margin expansion with great free cash flow performance, I mean, all three segments are going to be strong contributors supported. Deane Dray : That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks Deane. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Scott Davis : Good morning, afternoon, whatever it is guys. I was interested in just getting an update on probation. I mean, it, where are you versus kind of the deal model was, I mean, pretty big growth rates, but you were expecting good growth rates. Are we ahead of the deal model or in line behind update? There would be helpful. Jim Lico : Yes, we did a 100 day plan with the team actually last week and could not have been more excited about the work that they did, the quality of the business and the degree of growth opportunities. They\u2019re certainly out of the gate well ahead. We\u2019ll see where they end up the year. It\u2019s still early, but we feel really good about where the business is at. We mentioned the prepared remarks about the, the number of GI wins and as well as their extension, one of their largest orders in the history of the company with in anesthesia solution. So we\u2019re seeing those additional strategies. We\u2019re seeing the strength of the clinical superiority. We feel really good about the business, and the ability for that business to grow. I think in the short run, like we thought in the long run, I\u2019m starting to think maybe even better just given the number, the strength of the strategic plan, but strategies are just PowerPoint slides. We\u2019ve going to go out and execute. And I like our chances with the team we have. Scott Davis : Okay. And then, on Slide 4, there\u2019s a little quote there that just says M&A returns nearly double next five years. What\u2019s the context on that? You mean deals done in the last year double in the next five years done in the last five? Is there a little color you can put on that? And what does that mean? Double from five to 10 or four to eight or, or three to six? Jim Lico : So Scott, we\u2019re talking about the ROI returns and I think that for it would be doubling, say 4% to 8%. It\u2019s probably a good way to think about that. That doesn\u2019t mean we think most of our deals are getting to the 10% ROI in five years, and we\u2019re very pleased with progress, but coming out with the last couple years, we feel like we\u2019re inflecting here and we\u2019re going to start seeing more from these deals and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to talk about. Scott Davis : Okay. Jim Lico : I think it what we saw in the quarter and what you\u2019ll see, maybe just add on and Chuck spot on here. I think, the legacy deals, the ones we did early, right eMate and IFC and Landauer doing outstanding. Some of that medium term, you\u2019re starting to see, Gordian\u2019s trajectory, just take off your, Intelex had a strong quarter. Accruent, as I mentioned in the question around continuing to improve and SP with really strong margins and ready for consumables to come back, it helped care changes. So, and certainly the last two deals we\u2019ve done as I described. So, I think we\u2019re in a great place relative to returns. And this inflection is obviously we\u2019re excited about, I think it put a lot of hard work into it. I think we\u2019re in a really good place relative to those doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have an issue or two, but I think what we\u2019ve seen certainly in the last several quarters, as well as these inflections have started to happen in the businesses. Scott Davis : Well, good luck guys. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeff Sprague : Hey, good day, everyone. Two from me. Just first on back on price cost, Jim, you noted IOS was price cost on a positive on a dollar basis. Was that true for the other segments? And also if you could maybe put it in the context of margins, as you noted gross margins did improve nicely. Would that \u2013 was that in spite of negative friction on price cost, right. You can be positive on dollars and still negative on margins kind of the essence of the question. Chuck McLaughlin : So, Jeff its Chuck. For Q1, our core operating margin expansion is up 30 basis points. So as a percentage basis, we\u2019ve talked about the dollars being up. But certainly we saw real margin expansion. We continue to see that accelerate as we go through the year. And so that the \u2013 was it true for everyone? It\u2019s true in PT, but we were down a little bit and in at AHS down \u2013 I think about 40 basis points, which is on the slide deck. Jeff Sprague : Okay. And then on AHS. I think you gave us the 88% recovery on procedures for the year. What was it actually in Q1? And what\u2019s the magnitude of improvement you\u2019re expecting in Q2? Chuck McLaughlin : So 85 was Q2 \u2013 Q1, excuse me. And obviously I have got correctly better through the quarter. So I think we\u2019re probably in a couple basis points better in the second quarter. And then obviously probably starts to approach 90 as we get through the second half of the year. So still early, Omicron was an influence in January and February, particularly in the U.S. But we expect now to really to see gradual improvement. And we\u2019re seeing some green shoots, we\u2019re starting to see some hospitals that are now over a 100% from the 2019 levels. So, it\u2019s a combination of sort of competence gets built on the overall number, but also kind of looking through the detail to understand, what hospital networks and where they\u2019re at. And we\u2019re starting to see some of those numbers where, hospitals are getting in much better shape as they progress through the quarter. Jeff Sprague : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Jim Lico : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Jim, you mentioned the new five series in Tektronix, and you\u2019ve been talking about a significant product refresh, I think in Tek and Fluke for some time now. So maybe you can give us a little more perspective, how much new product growth should help you in 2022? How might this new product cycle compared to previous cycles you\u2019ve had? And then I think you\u2019ve said last quarter that you expect minimal backlog reduction in Fluke and Tek for the year. Is that still the case? Jim Lico : Yeah. So, let\u2019s talk about, let\u2019s break them up. I think Tek certainly has a refresh coming in a couple of product lines. We mentioned the five series. I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to ruin their, their announcements here, but we\u2019ll start to see in the second and third quarter, some announcements around things that they\u2019re coming out with. So we\u2019ll \u2013 inherent in that sort of step up in from the first half to the second half probably is some new product introductions in the \u2013 at Tektronix, it\u2019s hard to sort of say what\u2019s backlog reduction? What\u2019s new product? I mean, I sort of put those, but we will see good product refresh. Some of that refreshing quite frankly, comes with some changes in chips as we were doing some things relative to component changes, and so decided to make some improvements to the product as well. So, I think at Tek we\u2019re going to see nice. We don\u2019t anticipate much by way of backlog reduction at Tek in the year consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying before. And, but I think the business is going to be in very good shape. We said, as we said, the China situation very much an independent situation relative to just Shanghai overall growth and the rest of the world was very \u2013 was good, and should continue to improve through the year. Relative to Fluke. Fluke\u2019s kind of always a little bit of a \u2013 has a pretty broad product line. So there\u2019s really no one product that necessarily moves the needle. But they will \u2013 they do have some things that are going on in terms of new clamps and some acoustic imaging, things like that are coming through that\u2019ll probably be more back half. But unlike Tek where one product category can make a difference typically at Fluke, it takes that that is \u2013 they just have a broader product line to the nature of the business. So, but we do, we will get a little bit of backlog reduction at Fluke this year, I suspect. But again, they\u2019ll end the year as well in a good position for 2023. So, both businesses showed, demonstrated success against their countermeasures relative to challenges in the quarter. And inherent in what we think about the year will be the continued \u2013 those continued countermeasures will continue to have impact for the business. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that. And then Jim, maybe just talking a little bit more about the M&A market, you obviously have a ton of capacity. You mentioned the big pipeline of opportunities. Have some others ask come down yet the bit given lower mark evaluations, or do you think it might take some time to get buyers and sellers on the same page here, given the volatility in the markets? Jim Lico : Well, every deal has its story, but I would say typically it takes longer. Our conversations here recently in a couple of situations probably would suggest that, and as transactions that we\u2019ve watched occur would suggest that things are still I would say things haven\u2019t changed much. So, I would anticipate that\u2019s more of a second half early, 2023 real impact. Some deals will have different situations and be certainly be situational dependent. But I think at the end of the day, just more broadly about how we think about things, I would say, it\u2019s, we\u2019re probably still waiting a little bit more until some of the \u2013 maybe some of the uncertainties that we\u2019ve seen recently sort of find their way to kind of know in the natural direction of what that might be interest rates being one of them the macro, some of those things. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciated, Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Jim Lico : Hi Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a quick question on the backlog, Jim, you mentioned it, several times in this call and I think for Cosco [ph] the shorter cycle industrial world, this has been a bit of a talking point, like what does backlog really mean in this environment? Any historical context for what happens to backlog, if incoming orders soften, like, do you see cancellations? Is there any kind of context for something like a double ordering or channel dynamic, like doesn\u2019t sound like anything\u2019s happening today? Just trying to get my arms around? Like what does backlog look like if the environment really change? Jim Lico : Yes, I think, it\u2019s something we spend a lot of time on Josh, obviously when you build a another 130 million in backlog, like we did in the first quarter, obviously a topic of conversation every month with our operating reviews, with the Presidents and CFOs, I would say I\u2019d break it into a few places within Fortive. And our Sensing Tech businesses, we have a real sense of what it looks like. And what we\u2019re seeing is, we are seeing some orders being placed for like November shipments and things like that. That\u2019s not double ordering. That\u2019s just somebody wanting to say, Hey, I want to get in the queue for deliveries for that kind of thing. And so in the case of Sensing Tech, I think we have a good sense of the backlog. We don\u2019t see double ordering, little bit of people trying to get around some pricing, but at the end of the day, that backlog will flow in and it will flow out and we\u2019re confident with that. On the Tek side, 50% of the business is direct and we can very much see those customers and their use cases and their needs and we\u2019ve tested that pretty profusely feel very good about that. The channel inventory then and that\u2019s about, a little, little bit less than half of Tektronix revenue and close to 75% or 80% of Fluke\u2019s revenue. That\u2019s where we get into looking at point of sale data. Where are those trends going? What do inventory positions look like? What do they have on order? And we have a sort of methodology and calculation that we use from an analytical perspective to test that. And what we see today is in those, we don\u2019t see anything getting out a range. And so point of sale remains good, inventories remain in a good place. And there\u2019s no natural increases that, that if you sort of play around with the analytics where things would go haywire quickly. And that\u2019s what we watch. And we watch it consistently. We get \u2013 we get a little bit better more refined data in the U.S. and Europe and some of those things that we do in the rest of the world, but that\u2019s how we test the portfolio. And I think when you step back and say, what does that all tell you? We\u2019d say the natural demand patterns are good. The inventory levels are not substantive relative to natural numbers. And what\u2019s on order doesn\u2019t significantly increase their inventory at any time soon. So that\u2019s what makes us feel pretty good about the near term. And I would say, that informs our guide. It gives us the confidence, we\u2019ll start the second half with good backlog. And so if we saw some changes in some of those demand patterns, you might see a \u2013 you might see a little cancellation, although, and I would say historically, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of that. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just on, some of the more facilities facing platforms on the software side, return to work and maybe even a more of a hybrid model than remote and folks would\u2019ve expected six months ago seems like it\u2019s well, in order anything that\u2019s kind of permeated through that organization or, customer behavior that tracks alongside some of those changes good or bad? Jim Lico : Well, I think it\u2019s great to be in facilities and asset lifecycle management from a software perspective, because it really, the combination of what we\u2019re doing is ServiceChannel and Accruent. And to some extent, Gordian are they supports hybrid work and supports the kinds of changes they\u2019re going to occur in facilities over time to support collaboration and the kinds of things that people want to do as people come back into the offices, not full time, but, from time to time. So, I think that trend in that secular, driver\u2019s going to be out there for years. It\u2019s well documented and we\u2019re very in the early innings of those transformations. And so I think, on balance we\u2019re back, our customers are in many cases back, we\u2019re back at hospitals. We\u2019re \u2013 there\u2019s times when our service revenue trying to get customers on site to get things service can take a little bit longer. But as we mentioned in a couple of places, we\u2019re starting to see the opportunity to compress those timelines from when we come on site to help start up a customer as an example, whether it be in a hardware, software business and the time to value. So, we\u2019re starting to see those come down at the people come back to work, come back into the office, come back into the facilities. So, I think on balance inherent in sort of our natural trajectory of the business is some of these things happening, and being helpful to how we how we conduct business. Josh Pokrzywinski : Appreciate the call guys. Best of luck. Jim Lico : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Your final a question today comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jim Lico : Hey John. John Walsh : Hey there, good day and thanks for squeezing me in. Kind of following along those lines was just curious if you could talk to for the software businesses kind of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of maybe a net ad as it relates to subscribers, or if you have more granularity around churn, and absolute ads. And then just as, I\u2019ll do my follow on right now, the pricing, are you seeing anything different between the ability to get the price on the software side versus the hardware side? Thank you. Jim Lico : Yes. Great questions. I think on basis, we announced, a lot of the prepared remarks, we tried to highlight a number of places, where new logos are occurring. And I think quite frankly, we had \u2013 I think we had our largest, I think one of our largest iNet [ph] deals in the history of the company at ISC, we had one of our largest, I think we had the largest anesthesia procedures, procedures order at probation. So a number of places where new logos. We\u2019re in a good place relative to new logo growth in the quarter. And I think when you look at where our software growth was, I think our low-double-digit teens and low-double-digit growth in SaaS and our team\u2019s growth in software, that\u2019s going to stand up. I think against a lot of software players looked at a few folks that reported today, even in and feel really good about where that double-digit number\u2019s going to stand up relative to others. That\u2019s also helpful because our net dollar retention continues to improve on the backs of churn reduction. And so I think we\u2019re in a really good place to continue to improve net dollar retention. Our FBS efforts are making a difference there. And I think \u2013 and I think that some of that is also getting a little bit more price. So, we\u2019re still getting more price in hardware businesses to the second part of your question, John, we think we\u2019re in a good place relative to that. And I think the balance, we didn\u2019t talk about this, but in our hardware business is that good balance of probably about 50% price, 50% volume in our growth, I think is an outstanding balance. It really demonstrates the strength of our brands, the strength of our value propositions. So we think that\u2019s going to play out this year and obviously we\u2019re getting the price that\u2019s inherent and some of the inflationary challenges that we\u2019ve documented, but we\u2019re also driving tremendous value with customers that ultimately is driving our volumes. So anyway, I think, I I\u2019ll end it there. Thanks everybody for great call today. I think we\u2019re incredibly proud of the quarter we had. We\u2019re incredibly excited about 2022. We\u2019ve said this was a show me year, and I think we just did that. So, we\u2019ll look forward to your follow up questions. We\u2019ll talk to you soon and we\u2019ll see you on the road. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for our attending. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Fortive Corporation's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Elena Rosman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rosman, you may begin your conference. Elena Rosman : Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's earnings call. With us today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by Regulation G are available on the Investors section of our website at fortive.com. Our statements on period-to-period increases or decreases refer to year-over-year comparisons on a continuing operations basis.  During the call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. Information regarding these factors is available in our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Elena. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin on Slide 3. We had an excellent second quarter with strong broad-based execution across the portfolio, contributing to revenue, margins and earnings all above the high end of our guidance, resulting in our raised outlook for the year. Despite the effects of COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, significant FX headwinds and ongoing supply chain constraints, our team was able to achieve 9% core revenue growth, 190 basis points adjusted operating margin expansion, 18% adjusted earnings per share growth and outstanding free cash flow generation in the second quarter.  Consistent with the first quarter, demand for our leading workflow solutions remains robust. Year-to-date, hardware orders and software ARR both increased low double digits, reflecting our more resilient and diversified product portfolio. At the same time, our rigorous application of the Fortive Business System allowed us to deliver for customers in a challenging sterile environment and improved our profitability despite higher inflation and rising FX headwinds. Turning to Slide 4. I want to provide an update on what we're seeing and what we expect in the second half of the year. Starting on the left with the current environment, demand and orders remained strong in the second quarter, driven by accelerated innovation, continued share gains and leverage to favorable secular drivers. Hardware orders increased 9% in the second quarter, yielding a hardware backlog that ended the quarter 21% higher than year-end 2021. Our supply chain measures continue to gain traction while we expect that component constraints will persist for the rest of 2022 and into 2023. While ongoing COVID lockdowns in China remain a risk, we substantially mitigated the headwind from the lockdowns that commenced in late March in Shanghai and continued through most of May, shifting most of the $60 million of risk we previously highlighted in the first half. This is an excellent example of our team's ability to utilize FBS tools to navigate unprecedented obstacles, keep our employees safe and deliver for customers and shareholders.  Moving to the right side of the slide, we expect higher core growth for the remainder of the year as our more resilient product portfolio positions us to benefit from continued customer demand. We also continue to build momentum in our software businesses, with upsell and cross-sell bookings, new logo generation and lower churn all contributing to double-digit ARR growth for the full year.  Given the strength of our first half performance, we are raising the outlook for the year. Our revised outlook also includes a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $100 million on revenue and $0.08 on EPS that was not previously contemplated. Lastly, our ability to convert more earnings to cash underpins our investment thesis and allows us to reinvest in our businesses, accelerate our strategy and enhance our returns to shareholders.  Turning to Slide 5. The work we have done over the last 6 years to build a stronger collection of businesses has resulted in a more diversified end market mix and durable recurring revenue profile as demonstrated by the shading in all the end markets we serve today. For example, in 2016, a sizable percentage of our revenue came from the retail fueling and vehicle repair markets. Today, our largest end market by revenue is health care, which has very durable revenue characteristics. And as you can see further in the slide, there are recurring revenue opportunities across a range of end markets.  We have more than doubled the percentage of our total company revenue, which is recurring. This includes the software and consumables business model additions we have made to the portfolio and the services revenue that we have expanded at businesses like Tektronix. When you look at our footprint today and the end markets to which we participate, we have several opportunities to globalize our leading brands and take advantage of the secular drivers which are driving sustainable growth in these markets. I'll now provide some more details on each of the 3 segments, beginning with Intelligent Operating Solutions on Slide 6. IOS continued its strong momentum, with revenues up 16% and core revenue growth of 12% in the second quarter, with strong double-digit growth in North America and Western Europe and high single-digit growth in China. The work that businesses have done to improve availability of supply and offset inflation is contributing to better-than-expected core growth, with sequential improvements in shipments and stronger price realization driving 205 basis points of core operating margin expansion, more than offsetting incremental FX headwinds.  Some other highlights in the quarter include : Fluke's product innovation and new service offerings, including the recently launched Fluke Solar Solutions, in addition to rigorous daily supply chain management drove mid-teens core growth, while their orders forecast has continued to move up throughout the year. Industrial Scientific saw strong bookings for iNet, up 55% year-over-year because of continued progress diversifying and globalizing the customer base. Intelex SaaS revenues continued the double-digit pace, on track to 10%-plus ARR growth for the year.  Moving to facilities and asset life cycle management. Gordian revenues were up double digits as several customers, including the New York City Department of Education and the Pennsylvania Department of General Services, leveraged Gordian's procurement platform to manage large infrastructure projects with city and state customers. Accruent continued to build a strong foundation for second half growth with software bookings up more than 20% and an expectation of accelerated second half bookings. Their commercialization success is a reflection of the significant progress they have made building FBS capabilities across their sales organization. Finally, ServiceChannel had another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. ServiceChannel is continuing to see strong customer demand for managed solutions, with customers increasingly outsourcing their facilities maintenance work.  Turning now to Slide 7 in Precision Technologies. Total revenue increased 6% with core revenue growth of 9%. Demand remained strong with robust core revenue growth and another quarter of double-digit orders growth across major geographies and end markets, particularly industrial, semi, medical, power and energy, raising backlogs to new record levels. China revenues grew over 20% as Tektronix mitigated the Shanghai lockdowns and continued strength in Sensing Technologies. PT continues to benefit from a number of secular drivers, including the expansion of power and precision devices going into the electronics innovation space and the expanded use of semiconductors broadly.  We achieved 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, driven by favorable pricing and disciplined cost management, partially offset by higher component costs and FX. Some highlights in the quarter include : mid-20% bookings growth at Tektronix, with new product launches, including the 2 Series MSO, which continues to be strong globally and represents an example of another next-generation platform that provides innovative and differentiated technology for customers; mid-teens growth at Sensing driven by pricing, FBS countermeasures and continued growth in core end markets in the second quarter; innovation and vertical market strategies are gaining traction at Gems, et cetera, contributing to 20%-plus growth in those businesses.  Moving now to Slide 8 and the Advanced Healthcare Solutions. Total revenue increased 9% in the second quarter with core revenue growth of 3%. Low single-digit growth in North America and low double-digit growth in Western Europe was partially offset by a high single-digit decline in China related to the COVID lockdowns, which reduced the number of elective surgeries in China. COVID pressures, associated staffing challenges, along with supply chain constraints within capital equipment persisted as expected, limiting revenue growth across the segment in the second quarter. Elective procedures improved in North America, contributing to mid-single-digit growth in ASP consumables.  The team continues to implement FBS tools, driving productivity savings, which in addition to the accretive benefits of the ProVation acquisition, contributed to 300 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in the second quarter, including 150 basis points of core OMX. Some other highlights in the quarter include : Censis had another quarter of very strong performance from its CensiTrac SaaS offering, which was more than offset by a difficult prior comp in marketing hardware. On a 2-year stack basis, Censis revenues grew 17.5%. Provation's GI business grew revenues and orders double digits. They have several competitive wins, including a 16-site standardization order from Essentia Health, where half of the sites are SaaS migrations and the other half are new Apex wins. Turning to Slide 9. The Fortive Business System continues to be a differentiator for us, enabling our businesses to enhance supply chain resilience, drive innovation and profitable growth and build capabilities in our leaders to effectively deliver on our commitments and distinguish our performance in an otherwise very challenging environment. Examples in the quarter include using Kaizen to utilize closed-loop production and operations in our Shanghai facilities, accelerating the restart of production, ensuring availability of supply and creating new demand opportunities, effectively mitigating the impact of COVID-related lockdowns in the region in the first half; utilizing lean portfolio management at Fluke to align new products to strategic growth areas.  Similar to what we're doing at Tektronix, this has meaningfully improved our product vitality, doubling the 3-year revenue potential for new products. Provation is utilizing Obeya Rooms to significantly accelerate SaaS migration bookings and daily visual management implementation at Accruent is driving a significant improvement in net working capital. As you can see by all these examples and our performance in the quarter, we had tremendous success applying FBS. And with that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will provide more color on the second quarter financials and our second half 2022 outlook. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. I will begin on Slide 10 with a quick recap of our second quarter performance. We generated year-over-year total revenue growth of 11% with core growth of 9%. Acquisitions contributed 5 points to total growth, partially offset by FX, which reduced total growth by 3 points in the quarter. Turning to the major regions on the right-hand side of this slide. North America core revenues were up high single digits, with contributions from each segment and strong double-digit growth in software and services. Western Europe revenues grew mid-teens, again with favorable contributions from these segments, including a return to growth in Invetech. We had low double-digit growth in Asia outside of China, while China revenues increased to mid-teens as we mitigated the Shanghai lockdowns that Jim highlighted earlier.  We also continued to build backlog in China with approximately 20% order growth in the quarter as customers looked to replenish inventories and assure access to supply heading into the second half and 2023. Lastly, we had strong double-digit revenue growth across our high-growth markets.  On Slide 11, we show operating performance highlights in the second quarter. Adjusted gross margins were down 30 basis points, while adjusted operating margins expanded 190 basis points to 24.1%. Gross margin expansion and operating margin expansion were both negatively impacted by 70 basis points of transactional FX headwind in the quarter, which was more than offset by over 500 basis points of price in the quarter, demonstrating the excellent job our teams are doing implementing price increases to offset higher input costs.  Adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.78, reflecting strong fall-through on higher volumes as well as lower share count, partially offset by higher interest and tax expense. Free cash flow was another standout at $276 million, which reflects 98% free cash flow conversion in the quarter.  Turning now to the guidance on Slide 12 and the outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect core revenue growth of high single digit to low double digit, with adjusted operating profit margins anticipated to be up at least 100 basis points year-over-year in both the third and the fourth quarters. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.77 in Q3, up 12% to 16%, and in the range of $0.85 to $0.88 in Q4, up 8% to 11%.  For the full year 2022, we are narrowing the total revenue range to reflect incremental FX headwinds while raising core revenue growth to 8% to 9.5%, with higher core growth in every segment. Adjusted operating margins are still expected to be up over 100 basis points for the year, and we are raising the midpoint of adjusted earnings per share outlook to $3.07 to $3.13, reflecting better operational performance in addition to lower taxes more than offsetting $0.08 of incremental FX headwinds and $0.02 of higher interest versus our prior guide. We expect free cash flow conversion to be seasonally strong in the second half and average approximately 105% for the full year.  Moving to Slide 13 and the updated revenue walk for the year, starting on the left. First half revenues reflect our outperformance in Q2, more than offsetting incremental FX headwinds with stronger-than-expected performance in IOS and the shift in Shanghai-related revenues back to the first half as lockdown countermeasures allowed us to recover volumes that were previously expected to get pushed to the third quarter.  Looking at the right-hand side of the chart, we've updated the first half to second half revenue bridge we showed you last quarter. It now reflects a lower step-up of approximately $110 million in volume supported by our robust backlog position and continued pace of recurring revenue growth across our portfolio. We also continue to embed favorable price in the second half versus the first. On a net basis, the second half core growth average is 10% at the midpoint, and it is roughly 16% on a 2-year stack. Incremental margins on sequential volume are expected to fall through at attractive levels, contributing to strengthening margin performance in the second half. In summary, our portfolio continues to show the benefit of the actions we've taken to build a more durable growth company with high recurring revenue profile, mitigating the risk of slowing demand in the second half. Turning to Slide 14. As Jim highlighted, the Fortive of today is delivering higher, more profitable growth, and there's nowhere that this shows up more than our free cash flow. A strong free cash flow, which has nearly doubled since 2019, continues to be a hallmark of our investment thesis, compounding faster than revenue and earnings. Over the last few years, we've taken proactive steps to strengthen our balance sheet, which combined with higher free cash flow generation, yields ample capacity to invest for growth and compound returns through disciplined and accretive capital deployment.  As a reminder, we deployed $2.6 billion towards M&A in the second half of 2021 and continue to prioritize M&A as the primary driver of capital deployment. In addition, we opportunistically bought back shares in the second quarter, totaling 4 million shares year-to-date. At the current share price, we continue to see compelling returns consistent with the return criteria of all of our investments. As we exit the year with relatively low leverage of approximately 1.5x net debt to EBITDA, giving us substantial M&A firepower to continue to invest in our businesses, accelerate strategy and enhance total shareholder returns. With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks. James Lico : Thanks, Chuck. We're now on Slide 15. Before we move to questions, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the positive impact we are having for customers, employees, suppliers and communities as we advance our sustainability mission. As many of you know, we published our 2022 sustainability report in June, and I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished, the aspirational targets we continue to set and the robustness of our reporting initiatives, such as alignment with key ESG reporting frameworks, including GRI, SASB, TCFD and the UN Global Compact as a signatory. This report serves as our communication of progress toward the principals and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  We also made significant progress across each of our sustainability strategic pillars, including: achievement of our 50% greenhouse gas emissions intensity goal early; reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity by 51% between 2017 and 2021. As a result of achieving that target early and in keeping with our continuous improvement culture, we have set a new and more aggressive target to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2029 from 2019 levels, a goal which is aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative guidance.  We improved on each of our inclusion and diversity leadership goals, including gender inclusion and senior leader diversity. And lastly, we exceeded our performance on our supplier diversity spend target in 2021 and completed 100% of our supplier audits as planned despite COVID. There's much more in the report, including examples of our innovative and sustainable products and services, and we encourage you to check it out on our website.  Lastly, on Slide 16, we are demonstrating successful execution of the Fortive formula, even in the most difficult of times to drive more resilient growth, double-digit earnings and free cash flow growth. We said that 2022 is a show-me year. We are on track to meet or exceed our commitments, including mid-single-digit annual core growth on a 3-year stack basis. More than 300 basis points of operating margin expansion, 50% growth in earnings and 90% growth in free cash flow, all while navigating unprecedented and prolonged headwinds. This differentiated growth and profitability amongst our industry peers is a testament to FBS, driving innovation, demand generation and profitable growth in 2022 and beyond that is helping to generate 50% more cash per dollar of revenue recognized.  As Chuck highlighted, that creates more opportunities to deploy that cash to accelerate growth and compound returns through disciplined capital deployment. As you've seen with our first half performance, we're incredibly proud of the contributions from our Fortive team around the world. This July, we celebrated our sixth year as a public company. Since our inception, we have endeavored to build a truly special company, one that yields best-in-class performance.  As you can see in 2022, we have made considerable progress against this goal, with strong growth through the strength of our highly desirable brands and technology, outstanding margin performance through the quality of our portfolio and exceptional free cash flow through the power of our business system. I look forward to your questions, and with that, I'll turn it back to Elena. Elena Rosman : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Rob, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe, Jim and Chuck, just a first question around the AHS segment. That's the one where sort of pricing seems to have been stuck a little bit at 1% in the first half versus 700, 600 points higher at the other 2 divisions. And the overall core growth sort of 4% this year. How are you thinking about that, the main headwinds on the pricing and the volumes aside from the China impact in Q2? And when we're thinking about, say, the out year '23, there are some factors that could kick that growth rate a little bit higher. James Lico : Yes, Julian. I think, number one, if we really think about AHS in the second quarter, it really came in from a core growth perspective as we anticipated. A little bit of puts and takes with elective procedures, a little bit better in North America versus -- and then obviously, China a little -- obviously much worse in China. We would anticipate, for electives, it's still going to come in the way we thought for the year.  I would say we feel good about the acceleration of core growth at AHS in the segment itself in the first half -- first quarter to the second quarter, and we think it will continue to accelerate into the second half. We did see some supply chain issues with equipment. That was in our guide. We anticipated that. We'll see those things get better. In fact, we've started to see the kind of equipment production that we need to see in June. We're already seeing that what we need for the second half. So we think the step-up in core growth will be there.  Relative to price, we'll continue to get a little bit more price in the second half than we did in the second quarter, but it's just a little bit more difficult to get price in this environment, but we're ahead of price/cost. So I think in that sense, really, we were in a great place with margins in the second quarter in AHS. In fact, if it hadn't been for some current -- of FX, we would have been right on the guide.  So I think where we stand with the segment is in a very good place. We'll get a little bit more price. We'll continue to work on price into next year. But I think relative to price/cost, we're in a better -- we're fine. We haven't seen as much inflation on the input side and health as we have in some other places. So we're good in that segment, but it's going to take a little longer negotiating some of those longer-term contracts to get more price in the segment itself, particularly at ASP. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then maybe one on capital deployment. Not going to ask you about the M&A pipeline. But if we look at, say, the buybacks that did step up in the second quarter, Chuck had talked about 1.5x leverage ending the year. So trying to figure out at current share prices, what kind of buyback spend are you planning on, I think, given the comment of sort of compelling returns right now? And there are matters of guidance numbers in the deck, which makes our lives a lot easier. Share count was maybe 1 that I missed. Just wondered what you're dialing in for the year on share count vis-\u00e0-vis the buyback discussion. James Lico : Well, Julian, as you know, M&A remains our priority here. What we're saying there is where our leverage will finish the year without any capital deployment. We're not forecasting -- we don't forecast share buybacks as it's not really a program. It's just being opportunistic. But as you know, in the first half, we did buy 4 million in the first half over the first 2 quarters, and we'll continue to be opportunistic as we move forward. Elena Rosman : And just, Julian, this is Elena. We ended the quarter with 358 million shares outstanding, so that would be the appropriate assumption going into the second half. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : So I actually will follow up on the sort of M&A pipeline. And more so, there's a lot of talk about interest rates changing, environment changing. Are you seeing fundamentally any change, maybe private equity exiting, maybe more strategic buyers, buyers' expectation -- or sellers' expectations or is it just too early to tell? James Lico : Yes, it's a complex question. But obviously, private equity is a buyer and a seller, so they're obviously seeing it on both sides. But I would say what we've seen really here at this point, Andrew, is really one where I don't think we've really seen reality set in, in a number of places. There have been some things transacted. It's still higher prices here in the last 90 days, but I don't think that's reality going forward. So I think it takes a little while.  We've seen things take longer for sure. We would continue to remain busy. But we're going to be disciplined here in this kind of time horizon. So I think that's where it's at right now. I said a couple of quarters ago, it was a 12-month to maybe even 18-month kind of time horizon. We're obviously 6 months into that kind of time frame. I suspect maybe we'll start to see some things here maybe later in the fall, start to look what I'll call more normalized. Andrew Obin : Got you. And then that's another question for you. This earnings season, one of the surprises, I think sort of across the board, just Western Europe, just on the margin, just looks okay. And even for you, it's mid-teens core. Why is Europe so good? And why we're not seeing more of a headwind from what's actually happening there? James Lico : Yes. I think Western Europe has been a good story for us. Certainly true as you said. And if we look -- it kind of normalized -- it's a little bit more in the quarter but it sort of normalizes compared to North America, if you look at the first half. Orders are actually a little bit better in North America. So I would say what we're seeing probably is a function, in the quarter, a little bit more just on getting more backlog out. We probably have a little bit more backlog in Western Europe just because of the location of our factories, many of them in the U.S. So it's a little bit that. In health, it was really the Invetech that we called out in the prepared remarks. But we are seeing good business right now in Western Europe.  And now if you look at the entire European theater, including high-growth market, Eastern Europe, Russia, then you start to see a slightly different story. You start to obviously see the slowing because of some of the Russia impact. So it's really -- it's a good story in Western Europe. If you step back and look more broadly, it does tell a little bit slightly different story, and that might fit a little bit more on some of the headlines we're seeing. But I think as we look through the year, we're still going to do pretty well in Western Europe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Charles Tusa : What are you guys seeing in China? And in particular, I guess, outside of the health care stuff, just the more industrial type of stuff? James Lico : Yes. I think one of the highlights of, obviously, the quarter was obviously how China has come back. I think one data point that Chuck and I look at, Steve, is our -- at Fluke is our point of sale, which was high single digit in our shop channel, which is a more broader view of the economy, was actually double digit in the quarter. So I think from that standpoint, we had a good business in Sensing. We had good business, as you said, other than really our health businesses, China was good in the quarter. Obviously, a little slower in the first quarter. So when we look at the first half, still decent in those businesses. And I suspect we would plan and assume that that's going to continue here in the second half. It's pretty broad-based. It's with -- our OEMs on the Sensing side have been pretty good. And again, as I said, a number of places at Fluke and Tek where we're seeing good business. So we think Healthcare probably does continue to be a little challenged here for at least another quarter relative to what we're seeing in hospitals, but the remaining part of the business is in a good place. Charles Tusa : And then one last one. Gordian and Accruent, I think, you have up low double digit in the quarter, I think it was I saw on the slides. I think that's better than you guys had been expecting. What's going on at those businesses and how are you accelerating the growth there? I recall there being some question marks around the growth that I think it was Accruent over time. James Lico : Yes. We're -- I mean, as we increasingly think about the business, we're going to increasingly think about that as the combination of those businesses and probably ServiceChannel. We've traded some product lines in between businesses. And obviously, we're going after some things with common sales channels and stuff. But as you said, Gordian, very strong on the back of good state and local spend. We think that continues. Certainly, some of the things that we're seeing out of Washington are going to be helpful to that business as well. We mentioned some of the good wins that we have with current -- increases in business that we have with some really strong customers like the city of New York. So I think we're just seeing good dynamics. I think we've seen -- we're starting to see the turnaround in Accruent that we've been talking about. Olumide has done a nice job there with the team. And bookings are going to be -- are going to continue to get better through the year.  So I think in general, a lot of our countermeasures. We put a lot of effort and energy into really sort of optimizing Gordian and really helping that team. They're a great user of FBS. Accruent, I think, as we've said, has been a fix-it story, starting to see some of the results of some of that work, and that will continue to play out through the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So just digging into the guide for ASP margins. We got flat margins in 3Q and then we've got 100 basis points of expansion in 4Q year-over-year. So just wondering what sort of the underlying assumption there is in terms of what needs to happen to drive that improved operating leverage at ASP -- sorry, AHS. Charles McLaughlin : So Nigel, I'll take that is in the second half, really not much other than normal sequentially growing, particularly in the fourth quarter, for us to achieve that, so nothing superhuman there, given the levels that we're seeing. They're shrugging off pretty well and showing that good margin expansion despite FX, so we're really pleased about that. We saw a little bit of that in Q2 as well. But I actually saw quite nice core margin expansion in Q2 of this year. So when you look at Q3 and Q4, you don't need some big step-up. It's just normal flow-through based on where we sit right now. James Lico : I think we had a pretty decent hit on onetime FX in the quarter and the second quarter for AHS or margins would have been even better. So I think when you take that into account, Nigel, this is really kind of a normalization of what we see, and as we said, a great margin story in that segment. Nigel Coe : Great. I mean, it sounds like the transactional FX is heading AHS more than the other segments. Just I wonder if you could just maybe just clarify why that is because I don't sure I understand why. But on the free cash flow conversion, I did want to touch on free cash flow in my follow-up. You're obviously very impressive, especially compared to some of your peers. But are you absorbing the R&D tax credit headwinds this year within that number? Because if you are, it's even more impressive, but just wondering how that's impacting things. Charles McLaughlin : Yes. Nigel, thanks for the question. Yes, we are. We anticipated that when we put out our guide for this year. And we've got about $20 million in the first half of this year and probably looking at another $40 million next in the second half. But again, that's already contemplated in the guidance. To the question on the transactional FX, it's actually hitting all of our segments. But what you're seeing there in terms of different from what we guided is at AHS, there are revenues coming really basically where we thought they would in Q2, and the other 2 are coming in a little stronger so it's hiding what is actually hitting all 3 of them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : I wonder if you could give a little more color on Tektronix, both kind of what's driving the order strength. I'm just looking at the book-to-bill at that level. I would assume there's still some issues getting yourself out the door kind of impacting the backlog and book-to-bill. But can you give us a little color on both sides of that equation? James Lico : Yes, sure. I think we're really excited about the work that the team has done over the last several quarters from an orders perspective, a lot of innovation that we've really launched, Jeff, we talked a little bit about it in the prepared remarks. Their book-to-bill, I think, in the second quarter was like 1.3, almost 1.3. So they continue to see good orders even on the backs of mid-single-digit growth. They're going to be -- they're going to continue to do well.  It's really an innovation story. They're taking advantage of -- we launched the 2 Series, which we mentioned in the prepared remarks, which is obviously very good. We've also had an enhanced 5 Series launch, and some follow-on scope -- follow-on probes and things like that, that go with those products. So it's an innovation technology story. Obviously, the market's good. We talked about not only getting some -- we're certainly getting benefit from some of the semiconductor investments.  But we're really getting the benefit of how just more digital technology being in everything from the power challenges of EV batteries to the power challenges that are in a small IoT sensor, really everywhere where we've got now more digital transformation going on, we've got more R&D needed and more investment needed in order to deal with some of those challenges, particularly around the power side. So they're taking advantage of those strategically that they've really had in their strategic plan over the last few years, and that strategy is playing out well. They'll continue to see good order growth. They're now starting to get caught up on some of those orders, as we said, with mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. That obviously means they're starting to get things -- we're starting to get -- we have very low inventory with channel partners. So pretty much we're really hand-to-mouth on everything mostly in our channels. So the opportunity now to really, I think, continue to build the business here is just really strong in the second half as well. Jeffrey Sprague : Interesting. And I think the last time we talked, you had mentioned some of the activity that you're seeing in Tek sort of show the kind of a reshoring element as people were kind of pivoting where they were investing or where they were maybe preparing to capitalize production. Could you maybe elaborate on that a little bit more? Is that still going on in the business? James Lico : Yes. We don't play a lot in the production side of semiconductors. But obviously, as onshoring occurs relative to semis, certainly, what has been announced here out of Washington, we'll benefit from that because those are going to be, many times, new generation of designs or are going to be certainly going to be required from a key fleet perspective. We do have some semiconductor opportunities there. So they will benefit from that kind of investment.  And more broadly, because there's -- if we think about the bill that's out there now, also has billions of dollars invested in technology investment to really bring all industries within the United States up from a technology perspective. And anything that goes into innovation and into any investment that goes into R&D budgets, particularly around hardware, is going to benefit Tektronix. So as we said and we talked to you a little bit about the secular -- there are some secular drivers around here, and we certainly think even the latest headlines would suggest things might be even slightly better. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : I was just -- the order book up 12%, it's a big number but sometimes these things lack some context. I mean, is the price in that order book consistent with the price that you are posting today, kind of in that 5% ballpark or is it a little bit higher? Charles McLaughlin : No, it's about the same, Scott, at around 5% of what we saw in the third -- the second quarter. We do expect that in the second half as well. Scott Davis : Okay, so it's strong. And then just to get a little of minutiae here, ServiceChannel, if you can help us kind of understand the sales cycle a little bit better. I mean, pretty big growth numbers this quarter. Are there any kind of variations in that sale? If there's kind of, I should say, updates or whatever that may cause people to buy ahead of them or price increases that people buy ahead of them or new product launches that people pile on. Is there kind of any lumpiness to that business that we should be aware of? James Lico : Well, yes, there's a little bit of bumpiness in the sense of they do have some portion of managed service that they run procurement of services through. And that can get -- it can be slightly heavier at certain points in time. And they did benefit from a little bit of that. But when we look at the SaaS part of the business and the AI part of the business, it's very strong. And in fact, it's 20-plus percent kind of growth.  And so we feel very good about where they're stationed from a growth perspective. So it's -- the sales cycle itself is pretty -- we don't really see the buy-in ahead or anything like that. It's a pure SaaS model so we don't really have a license aspect to it. So we've just -- but the sales cycle with a big retailer or a big user, somebody who has a number of facilities, that's a fairly long sales cycle. So we won't see anything dramatically move up or down from the standpoint of that. We secure a whole bunch of customers in 30 days or something like that.  The funnel looks good for the second half. We feel good about it. The team has done an excellent job of -- I think we're going to get into core here at the tail end of the third quarter. And we feel really good about where the business is stationed today. We're making some changes around the innovation aspects and offerings that we'll start to see in '23 that we're excited about. We just think in general, the business is off to a very good start. Scott Davis : That's helpful color. Big numbers. Thanks, Jim, and good luck to you guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim, you mentioned the higher recurring footprint that Fortive has, along with the record backlog that you have continued to add to. And you did also mention that your backlog should help you in '23 in the presentation. So how much confidence do those metrics give you as you potentially enter a slow growth environment? How likely is it that you could grow even if the world does moderately slow? James Lico : Well, we certainly -- as we sit here with the first half, it's not only we would get some '23 questions. I would say a couple of things around what we think. Obviously, every slowdown, if there is one, has a slightly different aspect to it, so no one is perfectly predictable. But I would say a couple of things that we know to be true. We're probably going to end the year with twice as much backlog as we started 2021, January of '21. So we'll have twice as much backlog starting the year as we did.  We're going to start with, as you said, a high recurring revenue and aspects of the business, both on the software side and on the health care side with strong consumables. We think that's obviously a really good thing. We're going to go into the start of the year as well with a number of efforts that have been multiyear around our organic efforts to attach all of our businesses to better secular drivers, whether that's the service strategy that we've had at Tektronix or some of the things you're seeing play out and some of the environmental work that we're doing within Sensing. All of those things are going to be less dependent on what the macro looks like.  So we think that those 3 factors, from a framework perspective, Andy, are going to set us up well. And I think depending on the scenario, we certainly think there is growth to be had for sure in '23. And obviously, we'll get through the remaining part of the year and see what happens. But those 3 factors are going to really be strong things going in. And even -- and we're building scenarios around what could happen and understand what that is. And I'd just remind everyone that in '20, when we had some pretty significant COVID challenges, we still grew earnings and free cash flow. So our ability to apply FBS to these scenarios in a very difficult environment, we certainly have a track record of that. But we set the portfolio up to be more resilient, and we'll see how things play out, but we're pretty confident we're going to be much more durable and resilient than we've ever been before. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim, I just want to follow up on something you said earlier in this conversation. I think you said last quarter that channel inventory was a little elevated at Fluke and Tek, but you're generally feeling good about it. And I think, Jim, you just said that your channel in Tek actually was pretty lean. So am I hearing that right or maybe you could just clarify your channel commentary? James Lico : Yes, sure. I think in Tek, it's pretty lean. And because demands continue to be good. And so I think we're going to be -- we're pretty hand-to-mouth in a number of regions around inventory. That's at Tektronix. On the Fluke side, what I said last time was when we looked at -- we look at both the inventory in the channel and what they have on order and in backlog.  And what we saw in the second quarter is some of that order and backlog moved into inventory. And so the number itself didn't change dramatically, but the makeup of it was a little bit less backlog, a little bit more inventory. We actually think that's a good thing because we've had mid-single-digit growth in POS here. And we think without really hardly any demand generation, we've held off on the demand generation standpoint at Fluke because we didn't want to be out there with lots of demand generation if we couldn't fulfill those orders.  So we're going to turn that spigot on. In fact, we've already turned it on. We're going to go lean into the second half relative to demand generation investments, now that we've got channel inventory in a better place where we can help our channel partners deliver on a more consistent basis. So we actually think that's a little bit more inventory and what we're seeing right now will help us drive a little higher POS in the second half. And we think that overall is a good thing for us and our customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess two questions for me as well. First off, on the free cash flow, I was hoping you just talked about, when I look at the free cash flow projection for the back half, there's a pretty big uptick in Q4 free cash flow, both dollars and conversion rate. Maybe just talk about what is driving that dynamic for you? And then as we look and when you look at your working capital metrics, do you think those have sort of peaked and as you go into '23, more importantly, does that become a source of free cash flow generation incrementally for you? Charles McLaughlin : Amit, this is Chuck. I'll take those 2 questions. The second half is always seasonally stronger. In the first half, we paid out incentive comps and so when you compare first half to second half, it's going to be stronger. In Q4, we -- there's a little bit more in shipments. And then when you look at Q1, there is a step-down. And so what you see us doing is relieving some of our working capital and that -- those are a couple of the dynamics that would drive the fourth quarter to be stronger.  Keep in mind, we're very pleased with up 11% of our free cash flow in the first half, so I feel really good about that. And keeping -- the biggest thing that we were looking at is a back-end load in Q2 was out of China with this being locked down in April and May. And so we think that we've got strengthening even from what we normally would do over cash flow, so feel super positive about that. The working capital trends, I do think that maybe with supply chains, we would expect, particularly inventory, is more at peak levels. And as the supply chain continues to get better, it's still a very tough environment. You could theorize in 2023 that we would expect to reclaim some of that ground in inventory. But having said that, we've done a fantastic job with our working capital and really benefited from the working capital that you get with software business. Amit Daryanani : Fair enough. And then if I just follow up on Europe, I know you talked about this a bit earlier, but the growth of mid-teens is really impressive, given all the macro worries people have in Europe. I was wondering if you could talk about and maybe if you have a sense if your customers in Europe, are they -- when they get the products imported, are they deploying it in use cases or are they holding it as inventory?  And I'm just thinking out loud on a scenario where given all the of energy shortages that could happen in the winter in Europe, could customers largely just be building up inventory to offset those issues that they seem to have? I'm wondering if you're seeing any of that or any shift in patterns from direct to the OEM versus channel, if there's anything you can talk about? James Lico : Yes. I think number one is we've seen pretty broad-based success there as I was mentioning a few minutes ago. But I would say we've seen point of sale is good as well. So I don't feel channel partners are stocking up or anything like that. And for the most part, when we look at the businesses, Fluke is one of our larger European businesses. We don't typically see people stock up Fluke products. They really take them to use them.  So from an end user perspective, Tek is pretty very much the same way. So I feel pretty good about it. A good chunk of our revenue base is really not stocking up, but they're really -- it's selling through the channel partners and it's being utilized. I would say on the -- we are seeing some of our software businesses, many of our software businesses that we purchased have -- didn't have big European footprints, and we've been expanding some of that. So we're seeing some growth in software there, which has a little bit of impact here, and I don't anticipate that to be an issue but as we mentioned, we think the overall environment has been.  On the Sensing side, we might see a little bit of that. We have a pretty good sense of that, though. We know when the orders are out there. And so we'll probably see a little bit possible, but I don't think it's meaningful in the -- from a standpoint of 3- or 4-quarter outlook of Europe, I don't think that's a meaningful number.  So I think on balance, we feel good about Europe. But I think we, like everyone on this call probably, looking at some of the macro factors, some of the things that might occur in the winter, certainly looking at it and keeping a real sharp eye on what might -- any trajectory changes that we might see over the next, call it, between now and the end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : If we go back to Page 5, I really like that updated mix, revenue mix. And how would you describe the target and the path for the 40% recurring revenue? Is there a time line that you can share today where you think it begins to level out? James Lico : Well, I think number one, we're continuing from an organic perspective across the businesses to seek out new business models that even in our current businesses, as you know, while Dean, things like some of the things we're doing around our cloud offering at Tektronix, which is just very early today but it's going to have a recurring theme to it in the next several years. So organically, we're building on it.  And then, of course, we're getting -- the software businesses are going to grow inevitably. Obviously, they're growing well -- really well right now, along with our hardware businesses. But the long-term growth rates of our software businesses are better, and that compounding is going to continue to add to what we want to try to do -- what we're trying to do relative to the business model.  So you'd see that number continue to tick up without any inorganic activity. And then, of course, no matter hardware or software, I think one of the things that's been consistent with our acquisition strategy over the last 6 years has been that almost exclusively, our acquisitions have had a recurring theme to them. Sometimes they were consumables like ASP or Landauer. Sometimes, they're software. But fundamentally, they've had a recurring theme to them. And while I wouldn't say we'll be at -- that will be exclusive, it will certainly be the majority of capital that we deploy over time. And so you'll see that 40% continue to go up over time, I suspect, both organic -- with both organic and inorganic efforts. Deane Dray : Okay. And then back on Page 4, I just want to make sure I have the mechanics of this right on the COVID lockdown being mitigated. So does that $55 million, does that constitute a pull-in from what was expected to be in the second half? And was that in your second quarter guide? Charles McLaughlin : So it would -- Deane, if you remember when we talked about second quarter, we talked about revenue shifting out because of the lockdown in China into the second half. And so this is -- I think of it as a return to the second quarter. And so we didn't have it in our -- we didn't expect to get this in Q2. Team did a fantastic job about, as we said, mitigating some of those things. But it's just a return to where we originally had it forecast. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse. John Walsh : First question was just, if you were to think about your SaaS software assets, you've had them for several quarters now. Have you seen any discernible change in the pace of new logo adds or customer retention? Are you kind of accelerating? Has growth plateaued there? Just any color around that you can provide. James Lico : Well, I think when we think about our growth in our ARR, we talked about kind of the bookings level, where I think our trailing 12-month number is around 9-ish percent or almost 10%. It's going to be double digit by the end of the full year -- by the end of the year. So we really see SaaS accelerating.  We continue -- I think customers continue to look for cost savings and so many of our SaaS offerings are really cost savings-driven. We've always said we positioned the portfolio around safety, quality and productivity. And so a number of these offerings allow them to continue to do the things they need to do.  I would say the one place where we've seen a little bit of maybe the funnel moving out a little bit is in health care software, where we've started to see a little bit on the new logo side where some staffing shortages and IT organizations and things like that have pushed a few things out a little bit. But we've also -- on the other hand, when we've had the customer, we mentioned in our prepared remarks the Provation example, where we have a customer where it was a SaaS upgrade and new logo, new SaaS. We were able to close that relatively quickly.  So the upselling and cross-selling is happening at the same pace in health care. The new logos will be slightly longer a little bit. I think more broadly, we haven't seen much in the areas of really delays too much more broadly across the portfolio. So that's why we see SaaS continuing to accelerate in the portfolio through the year. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe just a modeling question here. You provide a lot of detail there. The one -- if I look at IOS, just based on the ranges you provided, it looks like in Q4, that's the only one that might be down sequentially. I don't know if there's some mix there or it's just there's a wide range on what the greater than symbol means on your guidance slide. James Lico : Well, I think number one, I wouldn't -- there's probably a little bit in the rounding there. IOS margins are going to continue to be good. I don't think we have any discernible changes relative to that. We can get back to you on the specifics around modeling. But I think what you saw in the quarter in IOS, very strong margin expansion. We will continue to do, I think, a good job with probably a little bit on -- there might be a little bit on the comp side.  But I think where we stand today with margins, pretty much every business is getting better as we move through the year. So I think we're going to continue to see strong margins as we progress through the year. Elena Rosman : A bit more of a rounding. So we just went to a solid number and we obviously did have the impact from FX and the one-time FX impact on the transaction component roll through into the full year. But there's really nothing else. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Joseph Giordano : I think some of the pricing dynamics for many companies are kind of skewing their year-on-year comparisons a little bit. If I was to think about the orders from your more industrial businesses on a sequential basis from here, how do you kind of see them going? Are those going up consistently on a sequential basis still, or are they more like kind of staying flattish at a high level? James Lico : Well, first of all, prices are a pretty good constant from the second quarter into the second half, so you can kind of think about that as a constant. It sort of does depend on the business because of the amount of backlog. And also, we'll start to see orders in Sensing as an example. Probably look to -- we'll start to see 2023 dates on them because we are seeing a little bit of Sensing/Tek customers, a little bit of buy-ahead. Still strong growth on a 2-year stack but that's how I think about it. So that's number one. We'll see continued strength in orders at Tektronix through the year. Fluke will slow a little bit but that's really a 2-year -- that's really more of a comp thing than it is anything. So we really think when you look at both volume and price, we'll continue to see strength as we go through the year. Obviously, revenue is going to get a little bit better on the core side. Hence, our upgrade or our increased core. But I wouldn't say there's any real change in dynamics if the -- I'm assuming the base of your question is, is there a big change in price versus volume in the second half? I don't suspect there is at this point. But we're going to continue to really do things like the demand generation activities I talked about at Fluke, and we'll see how that plays out through the year. But I think the good -- we've been in a good place relative to price volume in the first half. We like where that's at. I suspect we will in the second half as well. Joseph Giordano : And just last thing for me. When you talk about Gordian and Accruent and maybe even ServiceChannel starting to combine a little bit, like what does that actually mean for those companies? Does this ultimately become one single brand under Fortive? Or like what logistically needs to happen for those businesses to move that way? James Lico : Well, I think what we try to do from an IR perspective is give you the perspective of the performance because of some moving pieces between them. And it just makes sense. What we do strategically, branding, product lines, product portfolio, is still to be determined. We certainly have a similar customer base in certain situations. We're managing that incredibly well while we're separate companies.  But inevitably, we'll start to bring some things together probably from an architecture perspective, if you were to take a longer-term view. But still early days on all that. The team is still bringing all that together. I think the story though is continued acceleration of performance. Margin expansion is very strong. We mentioned that one thing we didn't talk about is we're a little ahead of both when we combine ServiceChannel and Provation from an earnings perspective and EPS perspective, a little ahead on the first half. So we're in a really good place, not only on a growth standpoint but where we stand in margins in those businesses. So we're going to end up with the combination of those businesses with an over $0.5 billion revenue base with very strong margin capability, strong margins today and even stronger margins. Two of those businesses are Rule of 50 businesses already, and so a real opportunity -- or almost Rule of 50 businesses. So that entire segment ought to be able to be that way in the future.  So I just think we're really well positioned strategically, no matter how we sort of put them together, don't put them together, we're going to be in a good place. We are in a good place long term to really build that franchise really well. Operator : And this brings us to the end of our question-and-answer period. I'll turn the call back over to you, Jim, for some closing remarks. James Lico : Well, thanks, Rob, and thanks, everyone, today for joining us. We couldn't be more -- as we said in the prepared remarks, hard to believe we just celebrated our sixth anniversary with a lot going on. We appreciate -- truly appreciate the support that all of you on the call have had for us over the last 6 years.  We said 2022 was a show-me year. We think the first half really demonstrates that in so many ways across the portfolio, both the breadth and depth of the quality of what's going on in the business. It's just something to be incredibly excited about. We're even more excited about the second half. We think there's even more opportunity to do a number of those things. We'll continue to obviously have an opportunity in the follow-up call to give you a little bit more detail on that, but we're set up well.  Obviously, a lot of uncertainty out there but we've weathered a lot of a lot of the storm exceptionally well. And I'm highly confident we'll continue to weather the uncertainty and things that might be in the outlook no matter what the scenario and we look forward to continuing to share that. If we don't talk to you between now and the end of the summer, have a great rest of the summer. And we'll look forward to seeing you in person, hopefully in the fall. Thanks, everyone. Have a great day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Lico. Jim Lico : Thanks, Elena. I'll begin on Slide 3. We had another quarter of outperformance with 12% core revenue growth; 80 and 160 basis points adjusted gross and operating margin expansion, respectively; 20% adjusted earnings per share growth and 22% free cash flow growth, all above the guidance we set coming into the quarter. Our ability to outperform reflects the quality of our portfolio, our team's rigorous execution and the power of the Fortive business system, delivering higher and more profitable growth and free cash flow generation. Third quarter also demonstrated continued success launching a number of new products and solutions that solve our customers' toughest safety, quality and productivity challenges. We have strong conviction in the secular drivers favoring enduring growth in these markets. As a result, we are confident the work we do to create long term sustainable competitive advantages for our operating companies and strategic segments will yield best-in-class returns for Fortive for a long time to come. Turning to Slide 4. We are delivering 2022 at the high end of our initial outlook we set back in February, reflecting continued strong momentum as we've moved through the year. Short cycle demand has held up well with hardware product backlog more than double what it was at the beginning of 2021, while our software businesses have continued their double digit pace of growth. This speaks to the strength of our portfolio and our ability to countermeasure challenges. Our supply chain measures across the portfolio continue to gain traction, especially at Fluke and Tektronix, although, we expect some component constraints to persist into 2023. Our latest outlook now reflects a year-over-year foreign exchange headwind of approximately $175 million on revenue and $0.11 on EPS for the year. Despite these headwinds, we are driving higher growth and operating margins by leveraging FBS tools to accelerate profitable growth and position the company for continued outperformance in 2023. Moving to the right hand side of the slide, we are preparing scenarios for a range of potential macroeconomic outcomes in 2023, including moderating hardware product orders growth. Lastly, our strong balance sheet, supported by robust free cash flow growth, presents several levers for earnings growth and continued value creation compounding. Turning to Slide 5. We just finished our annual strategic plans for each of our operating companies, and I'm even more excited about the depth of our strategy to take advantage of the secular tailwinds accelerating progress across our five critical customer workflows. Our solutions for managing facilities and assets, environmental health and safety and measurement and connected reliability keep much of the world running safely, productively and sustainably. We are enabling product realization with precision measurement and sensing solutions underpinning many of the most exciting product innovations in the world from your phone and car to the electric grid and to safer food and pharmaceutical production. Our health care solutions for the perioperative loop keep clinicians and patients safe, serving over 5,000 customers, including all the top US hospitals, as well as hospitals around the world. Each workflow is well positioned to benefit from durable business models that underpin our vision and strategy to build a stronger collection of businesses with industry leading profitability and free cash flow margins. They\u2019re also aligned to our sustainability mission by helping our customers accelerate safety, good health and well being, advanced industry and customer productivity, utilizing new and more efficient clean energy resources and drive reductions of our customers' greenhouse gas emissions. Today, over 60% of Fortive's products and services enable more sustainable outcomes that are aligned to the United Nations' sustainable development goals. As we continue to accelerate innovation for our customers at scale, demand is proving more resilient even in the face of slowing economic growth, given the recognition of how our workflow solutions drive productivity benefits for our customers. I will now provide more details on each of our three segments, beginning with Intelligent Operating Solutions. IOS continued its strong momentum with revenues up 14% as unfavorable FX was offset by the ServiceChannel acquisition, which became core in mid-August. Our region growth was broad based with low double digit growth in North America, mid teens growth in Western Europe and low 20s growth in China. Double digit core growth in every workflow drove 345 basis points of core operating margin expansion, more than offsetting inflation and incremental FX headwinds. Some other highlights in the quarter include : At Fluke, demand remains solid with double digit point of sale growth in each major region. Using FBS Voice of the Customer and product development tools, Fluke launched a breakthrough platform serving the renewables market that reduces the time to test solar installations by as much as half. This kit combines multiple Fluke hardware tools with a software platform and has been awarded industry recognition for its safety and time saving features. EHS had low double digit revenue growth as we continue to see the benefits of share gains and efforts to diversify its customer base. Industrial Scientific saw a greater than 20% increase in bookings with strong iNet quotes and instrument bookings in both Europe and the Middle East. And Intelex had another quarter of mid teens SaaS revenue growth. Moving to facilities and asset life cycle. Gordian revenues were up double digits once again with the business continuing to drive accelerated penetration of projects flowing through Gordian's job order contracting platform with an expanded set of customers. Accruent saw strong software demand with its SaaS offerings growing low double digit. Accruent also continued to utilize FBS tools to improve its annual recurring revenue profile, with the recent Kaizens focused on driving price and improved customer retention. Finally, ServiceChannel had another exceptional quarter with strong double digit revenue growth and high teens growth in SaaS. As some customers face mounting cost pressures, they are increasingly turning to ServiceChannel to help them outsource their facility maintenance work, reducing their third party contractor costs. As a result, we are reinvesting a portion of their upside into transitioning customers to our more profitable SaaS managed service offering to continue to drive profitable growth. Turning now to Slide 7 and Precision Technologies, which delivered core growth ahead of expectations in every business. Core revenues were up 19% with double digit growth in all our major regions driven by continued investment in the industrial, power and energy, semiconductor and medical end markets. PT also saw 280 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion with higher shipments and strong price realization more than offsetting inflation and FX headwinds. Some highlights in the quarter include, seven consecutive quarters of double digit orders growth in Tektronix, fueled by a number of new entry and mainstream scope product launches. As a result, trailing 12 month orders are now greater than $1 billion. Our teams are diligently applying FBS to countermeasure supply chain constraints to deliver on this record level of demand. Sensing Tech benefited from another quarter of volume growth and strong price realization. While supply chain constraints continue to limit output, Sensing book-to-bill was greater than 1, with strong demand in Qualitrol\u2019s utility and power business. Similarly, Pacific Scientific EMC saw improved material availability and capacity expansion across key production lines, driving double digit revenue growth in the quarter. Moving now to Slide 8 and Advanced Healthcare Solutions. Total revenue increased 3% in the third quarter with a core revenue decline of 1%, as continued supply chain constraints limited growth at ASP and Fluke solutions, resulting in lower than expected core growth in the quarter. Mid single digit growth in Western Europe was more than offset by low single digit decline in North America and a mid single digit decline in China. We saw a sequential improvement in core growth at ASP as their supply chain shortages constrained capital equipment growth started to ease in late September. Electric procedures improved to the low 90% range, excluding China, while rolling lockdowns kept electric procedure rates around 70% of pre-COVID levels there. AHS core segment margins were down almost 400 basis points stemming from lower volumes and FX headwinds in the quarter, as well as the recognition of a bad debt reserve in Invetech. As you can see, the team is diligently deploying pricing and cost controls to offset these headwinds, which we expect will deliver margin recovery in the fourth quarter. Some other highlights for the quarter include : an acceleration in new hospital bookings at Censis and double digit growth in their CensiTrac SaaS subscription revenues. Provation SaaS offering is also seeing good demand from customers looking to further standardize on Provation across their health systems. Lastly, we completed the sale of Fluke Health therapy physics product line, which will be adjusted from core growth going forward with annual sales just under $20 million. Turning to Slide 9. Fortive Business System continues to be a differentiator for us, enabling our business to drive innovation and profitable growth. I'm excited to share that we just completed our annual CEO Kaizen event, accelerating our culture of performance. We brought together our most senior Fortive leaders, including our segment leaders and many of our operating company presidents with a total of 28 teams and over 400 team members, driving significant improvements in growth, margin, free cash flow and breakthrough innovations. In Fortive, how we do Kaizen is what sets us apart. It's the deep engagement of our leadership and teams as well as the achievement of our high expectations. Some highlights include the teams of Fluke identified gross margin opportunities, resulting in margin expansion through freight cost reductions and value engineering opportunities. At ISC, lean conversion Kaizen realized a 20% to 40% improvement in productivity across four product lines, and they improved the lead time for iNet quotes by 80% and time to market for newly developed software by 75%. Our teams reduced the average test time by more than 25% on a highly constrained production process in Tektronix. And Censis implementing Kaizens yielding a 2 times improvement in productivity and reduced time to onboard new software customers. These results are a continued example of how FBS is driving results at Fortive. With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will provide more color on our third quarter financials and our updated 2022 outlook. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim. And hello, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with a quick recap of our third quarter performance. We generated year-over-year core revenue growth of 12%. Acquisition benefits were as expected, contributing approximately 4 points of growth, offset by higher than expected FX headwinds in the quarter. As a reminder, the ServiceChannel acquisition became part of our core growth in mid-August. Turning to the right side of the slide. We saw double digit core revenue growth in each of the major regions. North America revenue was up low double digits with mid-teens growth in software. Western Europe revenue grew mid-teens with favorable contributions from each segment. Asia revenue increased in the low 20% range with mid 20% growth in China, driven by robust growth in Precision Technologies, partially offset by a decline in health care. Lastly, we saw high teens revenue growth across our high growth markets. On Slide 11, we show operating performance highlights in the third quarter. Adjusted gross margins increased 80 basis points to 58.1% as volume and strong price realization continued to demonstrate the value proposition of our products and solutions. Adjusted operating margins expanded 160 basis points to 24.4%, up 440 basis points on a two year stack basis. Adjusted earnings per share increased 20% to $0.79, reflecting strong fall through on higher volumes, partially offset by higher interest expense. Free cash flow was another standout at $307 million, reflecting approximately 108% of adjusted free cash flow conversion. Turning now to the guide on Slide 12 and the outlook for the remainder of the year. For the fourth quarter, core revenue growth is expected to be approximately 11% at the midpoint and adjusted operating profit margins are still anticipated to be up at least 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.85 in Q4, representing year-over-year growth of 4% to 7% or 10% to 13% normalized for a low tax rate in Q4 of last year. This reflects an incremental $0.03 headwind from currency movements not contemplated in our prior outlook. For the full year 2022, we are narrowing and raising our adjusted earnings per share outlook to $3.10 to $3.13 to better reflect operational performance in the third quarter, partially offset by FX headwinds. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 14.5% for the year. Lastly, we anticipate that free cash flow will be seasonally strong in the fourth quarter and we continue to expect full year free cash flow of $1.17 billion and conversion to be approximately 105%. Turning to Slide 13. I wanted to update you on our strong credit and liquidity positions. Early in the fourth quarter, we amended our $2 billion revolving credit facility, extending the maturity out to 2027. The amended credit facility utilizes a sustainability feature whereby pricing varies depending on our achievement of our recently published commitment to reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50%. We also added a new $1 billion delayed draw term loan, giving us the financial flexibility to refinance the $1 billion term loan coming due in December, with a prepayable loan where we can delever with available free cash flow without penalty. We are now levered at roughly 2 times on a net debt to EBITDA basis with an average debt maturity of five years and a 3.2% weighted average interest rate. The proactive moves we made to strengthen our balance sheet, combined with our robust free cash flow generation, also give us ample capacity to invest for growth and compound returns through disciplined and accretive capital deployment. With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some preliminary color on 2023 and closing remarks. Jim Lico : Thanks, Chuck. Turning to Slide 14. We wanted to share some initial thoughts on 2023. Starting with the hardware products business, which includes Fluke, Tektronix and Sensing Technologies. Backlog across these businesses are roughly double pre-pandemic levels and the secular trends I mentioned earlier are driving market expansion and development of new innovations where we have a strong right to play. As a result, that gives us increased confidence in our ability to grow through a potential decline in new customer orders in 2023. Our software services and other recurring revenue businesses, including facilities and asset life cycle, environmental health and safety, Provation and others, are expected to benefit from enhanced market positions driving double-digit growth in our SaaS and license revenue streams. At the same time, our healthcare businesses, excluding software, are 70% recurring with consumables and services. On the capital side, we expect supply chain to normalize, while the overall pace of recovery in hospitals will continue to be slow given the labor and productivity challenges likely to continue into 2023. While we haven't completed our planning process for next year, we are confident the work we have done to build a more resilient revenue and earnings profile will enable us to outperform the evolving macro environment. Lastly, on Slide 15, we are demonstrating the results of our successful portfolio transformation, yielding higher cash compounding power having nearly doubled free cash flow over the last three years. Our sustainable competitive advantages are evidenced in our ability to outgrow the attractive markets we serve and deliver workflow innovations that solve our customers' most critical safety, quality and productivity challenges. The third quarter demonstrated our team's continued success launching a number of new products and solutions, generating compelling investment returns and adding to our ability to continue to compound results. Lastly, our ability to raise our earnings outlook for the year once again in the face of continued headwinds speaks to the power of the Fortive Business System and our culture of Kaizen, which is all about finding a better way. We have a strong culture of setting high expectations. And through the rigor, discipline and the unrelenting efforts of our teams, we are delivering strong results. When taken together, this creates a powerful formula for value creation with a high quality portfolio of desirable brands favorably leveraged to sustainable secular trends, industry leading margins and free cash flow generation and best-in-class execution, enabling Fortive to outperform in almost any environment. With that, I'll turn it back to Elena. Elena Rosman : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Dennis, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Can we start with the comment on '23 regarding the positioning on the hardware backlog of 2 times historical? Can you parse out how much of that is reflecting incremental demand versus supply chain inefficiencies? And when you talk to a few quarters back, you don't typically see a big backlog in Fluke. But are lead times normalizing? And so I just want to get a perspective on how that hardware backlog looks heading into '23. Jim Lico : Dean, I think as we said, we continue to -- we'll take backlog down a little bit in the fourth quarter, which I think is the first quarter we've done that in quite a while. Order demand remains very robust. So if I were to look at that backlog, I would say a good chunk of it will be at Tektronix, which we think is mostly demand in a number of places, and lead times are out. So we feel very good about the backlog. Fluke is lowering backlog from where they were. They are -- and their lead times have come down a little bit. So if I were to think about it, most of the Sensing backlog, I think, is really advanced orders for '23. So if you were to think about it, probably parses out to protection of -- longer lead times on protection kind of getting in line, if you will, which makes it, I think, pretty certain, probably half of that is -- at least half of that is that number and the other half is good demand throughout -- mostly at tech but in other places as well. So I mean that's why I think our confidence in the backlog is much higher than maybe what others might think just because I think we've really examined it pretty deeply and feel good about the opportunity to deliver that in '23. Deane Dray : And a follow-up for Chuck. Can you break out the year-over-year margin decline in Advanced Healthcare Solutions? Just kind of how much is supply chain price cost, or is that bad debt included? If you could size that. Chuck McLaughlin : You're talking about the third quarter specifically? Deane Dray : Yes. Chuck McLaughlin : So when you look at year-over-year, the biggest -- the first thing is the bad debt at Invetech, is pushing, I think $5 million reserve. We still hope to -- we haven't given up on collecting that and getting some back to that, but that's an accounting reserve. It's just good management there. I think that there's -- year-over-year, there's -- we've got FX and inflation, that's probably 100 basis points that's causing a problem. And then really just lack of the growth as the supply chain, the rest of it is supply chain and Fluke Health and a little bit in our biological indicators at ASP. Deane Dray : What was that last one? Chuck McLaughlin : Biological indicators that ASP\u2026 Jim Lico : It's literally a plastic vial. It's when you think about the BIs go through the sterilization process to calibrate the effectiveness of the sterilization cycle. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Jim, maybe just to kind of close out something that Dean was asking about in terms of the backlog. I mean we're hearing supply chain getting better pretty quickly here across a whole different host of verticals and product lines. It doesn't really look like 4Q guidance in IOS has a significant amount of backlog reduction, or is there some assumption about seasonality orders or something else going in there. But of that extra backlog, I mean is that something that you should be able to work down over the next couple of months? And would you prefer to keep more backlog in this business versus just kind of get it all out the door in a quarter or two for that excess? Jim Lico : Well, I think, first, it starts with customers. And obviously, we're doing everything to take care of customers. Fluke specifically and more broadly, but Fluke specifically, point of sale is very strong. As we said in the prepared remarks, it's double digit across all regions. So point of sale is good right now. So we obviously want to take take advantage of those opportunities. I would say, Josh, so I would characterize the supply chain as broadly getting better. But at the end of the day, it's down to a few hundred components around Fortive that still have very, very long lead times, like in the 50, 60 week kind of time frame. So while broadly that number of components has gone down dramatically, there's still a number of components that are keeping our lead times out there. Now we're more used to it. It's more in our cycle. But that's why we suggested in the prepared remarks that supply chain constraints probably continue into '23 and I think that's pretty well documented around the electronics supply chain world. So we'll take down a little bit of backlog here, but we'll -- I think the robustness of what we do relative to FBS has those continued improvements helping us, and that's why you see strong growth in IOS in the fourth quarter. But obviously, as we said in Dean's question, we'll still go into the year with what I would call a nice sized backlog in which to mitigate any potential short cycle challenges that might be out there potentially. Josh Pokrzywinski : So there won't be a quarter where you like blow out $100 million all at once because supply chain gets better\u2026 Jim Lico : No, we won\u2019t be. I think we feel it's just that -- the supply chain situation is just not that robust in that sense. Josh Pokrzywinski : And then just following up on tech. I mean performance in the quarter was pretty exceptional. I know you guys have talked about kind of the virtuous product redesign cycle that everyone's going through based on new chip availability. And I'm kind of wondering, how much is that determining kind of the go forward visibility intact versus maybe some residual backlog that could be electronics facing and more susceptible as the economy slows? Jim Lico : I think one thing we've said from -- since the inception of Fortive is that we were going to work diligently to improve the growth rate of Tektronix and to reduce its cyclicality. And so they've had exposure to cycles in the past, and I think we're pretty well -- we've talked a lot with you and others about the fact that we've made good progress in that regard. What we're really seeing and we said in the prepared remarks around the seven consecutive quarters of growth is really the secular drivers playing out. The innovation cycle that has been such a great success in Tektronix really hits the market at the right time relative to the kinds of things whether it's the power challenges in the EV market or in IoT, everything becoming digital, requiring a hardware backbone and infrastructure. All of those dynamics are secular in nature and are going to continue to be part of the investment cycle, I think, over the next several years. Now part of the business will still be exposed to some of the macro potentially, but I think the backlog and the work we've done around innovation match to these secular drivers is ultimately going to make it growthier and more durable for sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Just on the -- I guess, to follow up to Deane's question on the fourth quarter at AHS. I mean, it looks like you're still growing core but margins are down. Maybe that's 4x or something like that. Can we get a bridge kind of to the fourth quarter there for AHS margins? Chuck McLaughlin : So Steve, when you look at -- the biggest thing is a little bit of FX, but I'd say a little more in AHS in fourth quarter around inflation there. We don't -- it takes longer to get pricing in the health segment, and so I think inflation is a little bit ahead of us there, unlike maybe the rest of our portfolio where we've been able to be ahead and we're ahead of the total on that. So that's probably the biggest thing, the reason we\u2019re down in the fourth quarter. Steve Tusa : I guess why wouldn't that have been hitting you already over the -- I don't know, over the last like 18 months of inflationary pressures? Why is that hitting you now in the fourth quarter? Chuck McLaughlin : Well, I think it has been hitting us, but FX has also accelerated and is hitting us a little bit more as well. Jim Lico : Steve, I think the other part of that is the volumes that we ship in healthcare, because the predominance of the revenue being in consumables and service, we were able to mitigate some of those supply chain and expenses for a longer period of time than we were in some of the other businesses. So as Chuck said, we're seeing a little bit more inflation. Most of this all predicted, most of the -- many of these things. And ultimately, we're continuing to improve margins here at health. So we feel like with mid single digit growth in the fourth quarter and into next year, we're going to -- we'll start to see some of these improvements playing out. Steve Tusa : What's the carryover level of price you guys have in the next year, if you just snap the line today, for total company\u2026 Chuck McLaughlin : We didn't do anything different. While the first half has looked probably a lot like the second half of this year, so probably plus 4% to 5%, we might lap a few things there. But we would expect to continue to deploy price to offset inflation throughout the year. So it might be a little less than this year, but that's just the theory. We have to wait and see what inflation is. We're committed to being ahead on our price cost there. Steve Tusa : And one last one. Any loosening up of the acquisition environment, Jim, and anything looking a bit more attractive here? Jim Lico : I think for sure. I think the -- I think we've been patient in a number of situations here over the last several months. But you're starting to see, I think, probably more on the -- maybe not as much on the private equity side but certainly elsewhere on the other parts of the private market, certainly some public things that we're starting to see. So yes, I think we feel -- we obviously are going to be disciplined. It's a noisy environment as we all know and will probably continue to be, and that should continue to [Technical Difficulty] but given the fact that we do work on these things throughout the cycles, we feel confident we can -- we'll be able to deploy some things that can certainly accelerate what we're trying to do in 2023. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a first question around the hardware business. Just trying to understand exactly what's going on in orders. So I think orders in hardware are up 9% in Q2 year-on-year. It sounds like they're up maybe low mid single digit Q3. And then is the point that they're down in Q4 and that's helping to explain the backlog reduction that's taking place? And if there's any difference to call out between hardware orders trends at IOS versus PT at the moment? Chuck McLaughlin : I think you've got the bookings right in Q2 and Q3. And in Q4, the rate slows but it doesn't go negative. But in a normal Q4 what happens is we would normally expect sales to exceed bookings and then take backlog down. And I think that's what we've got modeled in there, but that doesn't mean our orders are actually negative in Q4. Jim Lico : I think the other thing, Julian, is as we started the year, we had always said really consistently that the second half orders would be slower than the first. We saw orders much better in the first half. So some of that, as we talked about, was a little bit of things that we saw were coming in a little earlier because of lead times and things like that. So parsing quarter-by-quarter is a little bit dangerous just because of the strong demand we had -- stronger demand in the first half, and I think that really speaks to the strength that what Chuck just described of how we really, obviously, saw very strong third and we're going to continue to see a strong fourth. So I think it just speaks to -- orders have played out almost better than we thought for the full year, for sure. And I think it puts us in -- as we talked about, puts us in a great position for '23. Julian Mitchell : And then my follow-up just on the Healthcare segment. You talk on Slide 14 about a modest pace of recovery there on the ex software piece in 2023. Just when we're trying to think about the overall healthcare business from here, I think this year, you're guiding for just under 2% core growth for the year with a very big -- or a decent step-up again in Q4. When you're thinking about next year, what's the sort of framework for healthcare growth? I think it's tended to come in a bit below what people had hoped for various reasons in the last two or three years. Are we thinking core growth is similar to this year's just under 2% next year, or is there a chance to do better than that? Jim Lico : I think first of all, what we're trying to sort of frame for '23 is we think the hospital market is going to be better in '23 and '22. I think it's pretty well documented. If you look at some of the public hospitals as an example, in the US, certainly, there have been challenges, obviously, with COVID in the first part of the year and some of the labor challenges that they've had. We think that -- we've studied it pretty deeply. We certainly think that the market will be good next year. And we think mid single digit is possible. We're going to see that in the fourth, and we think that's possible leading end of the year. So yes, it won't be back to what I'll call normal. I think we're still determining what the new normal is. But I think as we look from Q3 to Q4, it gets better, it gets better at probably Q4 to Q1. So I think we're pretty -- I don't want to be bullish necessarily in the overall situation, in total, pollyannaish, if you will. But I think for sure the market is going to be better in '23 than it was in '22. And as we look out, we just finished our strategic plan with all of our health care businesses, 24 looks better than 23%. So think, obviously, COVID wasn't that far away when we really think about it. It feels that way a little bit but it was only four or five months ago. So as I think we continue to see step through some things. And as we said, really, what we saw in the quarter from a revenue perspective, what it played out, as we said, if it hadn't been for a couple of supply -- very specific supply chain challenges. So I think in general we have some confidence in the outlook here. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : I wanted to ask about Provation just since we're talking about healthcare. Do you think that business would be kind of ripping on labor shortages? But at the same time, you think it's maybe hard to do installs when you have labor shortages, too. So how does that -- what drives that business, how does that kind of ebb and flow with the issues that are going on today? Jim Lico : Well, you're spot on around productivity. I think the productivity and value proposition that comes in the GI suite is very positive, and we talked about the SaaS numbers in the prepared remarks being very strong. We've seen a little bit of delay on the sales funnel, Scott, from the standpoint of just taking a little longer to implement. So some of our services revenue is a little slower than it had been, but we're probably -- we're very bullish on the business. The value proposition is very specific and very much in right in the sweet spot of what challenges hospitals and ASPs are seeing. So we secured a very large order with a large government entity, that's going to take a little while to implement. But I do think it just speaks to the breadth and strength of the recognition of the value proposition. So yes, we think that business is going to continue to accelerate. Got a few challenges that we've got to work through because some of those labor challenges in hospitals aren't just kind of the folks in sterilization labs or whatever, they're also in some of the IT organizations. But I think when you start to look over the next six, 12, 18 months, we feel really strongly about the business. And it's obviously still on track from a profitability and returns perspective. So we feel really good about it right now. Scott Davis : And then follow-up, earlier question on M&A. You had an interesting response, which perhaps was different than what you've said in the past where you mentioned publics. Now just to be clear, are you talking about pieces of public companies you could potentially take, or are you talking about potential public to private -- or public to public, opportunities, which is not necessarily something you guys have done a lot of in the past? Jim Lico : I would say, first of all, when you look across I think just public valuations being more in the zone of -- in certain places, so I think it really is more a general comment relative to that. But we're certainly eyes wide open in whatever opportunities are available. And we've got, obviously, a really -- a very specific set of places where we think there's great investment opportunities, but we're also patient relative to those situations. So I never want to -- as you know well, I never want to predict what we do for lots of reasons, but we feel good about where the environment is going to be going here over the next several months. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Just a little kind of geographic walk here, if we could. First on China, do you think the strength here is kind of reflective of just the lockdown balance, or I don't think you're expecting 20% organic growth to continue necessarily, but it does seem extraordinarily strong. So just what's driving that, and what are you expecting here in the next quarter or two? Jim Lico : Well, we've had so much strength in China over the last three or four years. I mean I think it really does speak to the -- how we built the businesses over there. Pretty independent China manufacturing and design for the market, there's a little bit of a bounce there. So I think that's definitely true. But our outlook is still pretty good. And I think, obviously, healthcare, as we said in the prepared remarks, both IOS and PT were good. IOS obviously a little -- healthcare a little slower just because of the COVID lockdown. So I think as we look out, we still continue to see a good growth opportunity there. We'll see that in the fourth quarter. We should see it next year. Some of that backlog, obviously, that we described in the previous conversations includes China as well. So we think this can be a good market here certainly for the next several quarters as we look out. Jeff Sprague : And how about Western Europe, any signs of cracking there? Jim Lico : For obvious reasons, we're continuing to put a real microscope on everything we do over there. Point of sale remains pretty good. So I think when we look across some of the things that would typically tell us, we had good healthcare, I think it was our best region for healthcare. So I think at the end of the day, we continue to think Western Europe probably has hit some [stars] here. But if you look at the signs that we would typically look at, still holding up there pretty well. But I would anticipate it's hard to believe that just given some of the challenges they've got that there isn't some issues certainly in '23, and it's part of our scenario analysis. Jeff Sprague : And maybe just the last one sort of on that on kind of thinking about scenarios. Obviously, there's a lot of mix even within the segments. But at a high level, how would you have us think about decremental margins if we were to get into kind of, call it, a moderate recession environment where you're putting up negative maybe mid single digit type organic growth? Chuck McLaughlin : Well, I think if we got to negative -- actual negative growth, you could probably expect what we did during 2020 with the -- our up and down. We try to manage it to the same level. But keep in mind that we've got a really strong elevated backlog position. And while we expect slowing, we also -- that might not be our base case. But we've always said we manage to the up and down decrementals. Jim Lico : I think it's part of our -- as we look at our playbook, too, Jeff, to Scott's question around how we should think about all this, I really think that when we look at broadly our solutions, and Scott got to the Provation question. But if you look broadly across the portfolio, everything we do pretty much today is around productivity improvements. And whether it's Provation example we were talking about or what we do at ServiceChannel like we talked about in the prepared remarks, how we're bringing innovation and design cycle times down with our Tektronix solutions, what we talked about in the prepared remarks around solar with Fluke, we're really focused on saving money for customers with our solutions because of our workflow strategy. And so I think to Chuck's point, we certainly have scenarios across the board of what could happen relative to the macro. But I'd be remiss if I didn't sort of think about what we've really built in these workflow strategies is really to be, to be there for customers at their toughest -- with their toughest challenges. And I think we're certainly seeing that in a number of places where our orders are very, very strong. Because the reality is, is that customers are going to need to save money in the future, I think. It's going to be more important, and our solutions really play well to those challenges. Operator : Next question your next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : So when you guys talked about '23 outlook, and I appreciate it. It's very, very initial. How should we be thinking about the pricing as we frame '23, right? I think price was 6 points in the third quarter. So how much momentum do you have going to next year? Jim Lico : Well, from a momentum perspective, obviously, we'll have more price in the second half than we did in the first half of this year. So I think that's a starting point from a momentum perspective. As Chuck said before, we don't take some of that lightly. We're continuing to look at where situation is where we would continue to get more price. So I think we think the pricing envelope for next year, certainly in the first -- it's hard to have a 12 month outlook by every quarter. I think the price rate itself will not be as high as it's been this year. But our ability to retain price while at the same time getting additional price, I think, still is there. So I'll probably stay away from a specific number until we kind of get closer to the guide and how we see the fourth quarter play out. But I think we still -- as we've talked about, we think we can get more price in the software businesses. We think there's still some more price to get in the health care businesses. So there's still opportunity within the portfolio to accelerate some things while at the same time continuing to do the things that we've done so well over the last several quarters. Andrew Obin : And just a slightly different question. There were all these restrictions imposed by the Biden administration in China semiconductor production. I think there was a headline today that SK Hynix is like thinking to pull out of China. How do you -- how should we think about businesses like Tech Keithley in China? And I know even business like Fluke will have exposure to just sort of regular day-to-day CapEx in China. Have you guys been able to quantify or do any sort of initial assessment of the potential impact of the restrictions? Jim Lico : So first of all, as you know, semiconductor exposure broadly through Fortive is still pretty small. But I think we're certainly aware of what's going on there. Given the current regulations, we feel comfortable that, that's not a huge impact relative to customers. We typically don't sell into production fabs. We tend to be more in the innovation cycle. Some of that work that maybe gets shut down or moved out of China gets moved to other places. We should benefit from that, whether it\u2019d be the US, whether it\u2019d be back into Korea or other parts of the world. So I think we benefit from some of those changes over time as we see those play out. We need to continue to evaluate what we see and what happens in China from those regulations, which are still pretty new. I think what you know to be true is that we've continued to countermeasure challenges in China and still be successful over the last three years. We've had good growth over there despite export control. It started several years ago and some of the other things we've lost close to 28 customers at tech over the last few years because of export control. So we've weathered a number of these things as they've been applied, and I think we'll continue to do that as we see fit. And depending on reactions that come back from China, we'll react to those as well. So I think we understand what's going on there today. It's obviously a very fluid environment. We'll continue to watch it. But I think one thing that's been true over the last several years is our ability to be successful despite -- being able to play within the rules and do the things necessary to continue to build business more broadly around the world. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So obviously, lots of impressive growth rates across the portfolio. What stood out to me was Gordion, Accruent up high teens and IOS. So it seems like that's really clicking now. But we don't really expect these businesses to grow high teens, maybe a bit slower and steadier. So just wondering to provide a bit more breakdown on what's driving that growth. You mentioned pricing in software, but just wondering what's driving the strong growth rate there. So maybe talk about net retention there as well. Jim Lico : One, we really -- as we've said, with the addition of service channel and the combination of service channel, Gordian and accruing into the one business that we really call facility and asset life cycle, really a very strong quarter. We had always said that we were going to have some self help happening to Accruent over time, and we saw good steps forward in that regard. So I think that business is very good. ServiceChannel is really a great value proposition for facilities managers. We're transitioning that business as well, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks where we're trying to take some of the pass-through revenue and turn it into longer term SaaS revenue. So really, we've executed well. Net dollar retention, as you pointed out, is improving. So that is inevitably probably now our fourth biggest business, and we'll pretty quickly be probably moving up to scale in that regard just because of its impressive growth rates. So I think it's been a great addition to the portfolio. We still have great profitability opportunity in the business. Gordian is certainly firing on all cylinders. So I think we feel like -- we feel very good about it, lots of work to still do, but I think we really feel good about what's that and you heard that in the prepared remarks. I think longer term, we certainly see those opportunities to still be there, consistent with some of the comments I made about value propositions and productivity, really our solutions really give customers a better view of their facilities, better view of their assets, how they can reduce costs, how they can reduce investment. And obviously, pretty much everybody in the world is thinking that way these days. So that value proposition is going to continue to resonate well into '23 for sure. Nigel Coe : So it sounds like you're starting to see the revenue synergies from put together three businesses. Okay. And then going back to Tektronix, I understand the chip and everything secular themes, but you've had store the amount of product vitality this year. I think you launched the 2 Series midyear, and there's been other launches this year. So I'm wondering, have those new product families, has that had a disproportionate impact on growth rates this year? Jim Lico : I would say they've been incredibly successful, but 2 Series just launched in -- really launched in the third quarter for around the world, and it's exceptional. And I think it really -- that is a product along with the new [V] version of our 6 Series -- 2 big launches, the 6 Series just won our innovation award at Fortive last week. So I think we're still seeing early days of those innovations, to be honest with you. So our capability there is just only increasing with the value proposition of those products. And most of our success in the quarter really was more broad based than that. So we still think we're in the early days of some of those successes. And really more broadly, the innovations that we've really been doing over the last 12 to 18 months are still continuing to help from a success perspective. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Jim, you said you examined demand break deeply at some of your shorter cycle businesses, and you mentioned point of sale is still very good at Fluke. Obviously, we've begun to see some destocking, more consumer facing businesses than other companies, but it seems like you're suggesting that your short cycle industrial channel inventory is in reasonably good shape. But maybe you could just elaborate on that. Jim Lico : Point of sale of both Fluke and Tech has been good. As I was mentioning before, Tektronix inventories have been at all-time lows for the better part of the year now. So we don't feel like there's destocking risk there just given lead times, while orders have been strong, as you well know, our revenue has been accelerating. So we feel -- we look at the combination of backlog and inventory in order to make sure that things are not out of whack there, and we feel good about that. A little bit elevated inventory at Fluke from a few years ago, but not anything recent. The point of sale really and our lead times sort of would -- just the math there would suggest that that's nothing more than a little bit of elevated lead times. We're going to watch POS more than anything there, and that continues to be strong. So certainly, we're keeping a watchful eye on it. But as we sort of snap the eye right now of what we're seeing, so far, things look -- still look pretty good. We're not in any way, shape or form, thinking that what's happening around the macro more broadly and certainly into next year wouldn't influence that, and that's why I think we're keeping a close watch on that pretty much every day and every week. Andy Kaplowitz : And then Chuck, you've continued to generate basically spot-on cash flow versus your own expectations, good conversion when most -- a lot of your peers have faltered to an extent. We know much of the good performance is likely coming from FBS? But why haven't you incurred either a bigger inventory build or receivables build as your core growth has been higher, and do you see conversion continuing at this rate in '23? Chuck McLaughlin : Well, first, I'll take the easiest one. We think 105% for the year is the right conversion rate for this business. I think there's two things that are really helping us here, most obvious one is FBS and in a really tough supply chain environment that's not only helping us get products out the door, but mitigating the impact that inventory is having on this. We do have elevated inventories from where we would normally be, but I think that's certainly -- we've done very well maybe versus some of our peers, I would theorize, because of FBS. The other piece is the addition of these software businesses that while taken in whole have negative working capital. And so the free cash flow generation from the software business is incredibly stable. And I think that's an element that we're very -- that's playing out as we expected but very happy with. Andy Kaplowitz : And then, Chuck, just real briefly, just given the changes on your balance sheet, should we -- knowing that there is some floating rate debt. Should we think about higher interest expense in '23? How do we think about that? Chuck McLaughlin : I think because we're delevering, we'll give absolute guidance going out, but I don't think it's a huge headwind at this point from -- even though rates are going up, but our debt is coming down. Overall, our debt level is really very low. We would expect to be -- well, we're at 2.0 net leverage now and going down between now and the end of the year. Operator : Today's final question will come from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joe Giordano : Two quick ones from me. When we think about the elective volumes, and let's just focus on North America for this. We haven't really had like COVID lockdowns or anything for a long time now. Is there some risk that like maybe the bar to go in for an elective surgery has just changed, and like we're trying to get back to a level that like isn't the level anymore. Is that a possibility? Jim Lico : No. I mean I think at the end of the day, when you look at where we've been on a lot this year lately, we've been pretty close to the close to the pin here. So China is obviously its own story. But when you look at the US we've been pretty much spot on in what we thought. So I think at some point in time, we're going to get out of the conversation what electives are doing and just talk about the growth rate year-on-year. And I think we think electives will continue to improve. I think that's where we see it today. It is a -- COVID wasn't that long ago and labor productivity, labor challenges do restrict. We have a number of customers that are not running all of their ORs right now but would like to. So I think you're going to continue to see that as an improvement over time. And fundamentally, that's going to be, as I mentioned a few questions before about how do we see the '23 hospital market, we think it improves off of this year. '22 is probably the low point from a combination of all kinds of challenges, the financial challenges that occurred that have sort of cropped up in '21 and '22, the labor challenges and COVID. So 22% is probably the low point in that regard and we continue to see things pull up here over the next -- into '23. Josh Pokrzywinski : And just to be clear, I wasn't talking about your ability to forecast for electives. What I just meant like as a country, what do electives actually\u2026 Jim Lico : I think they're just going to continue to improve a little bit, but not -- they're not going to go from 90% to 105% or 110% right away. But they're going to progressively move up through, I suspect, over the next several quarters. Josh Pokrzywinski : And then just last, like we've been hearing from some companies that while the order environment is still pretty good, but like behaviorally, maybe customers are being a little bit more measured about saying yes to things. So are you seeing like any sort of like incremental behavioral shifts or like the bar to accept projects or anything like that is moving somewhat higher or taking longer to get to the end of the line? Jim Lico : I think we talked a little bit about this. We are seeing it in a few places where sales funnels are extending a little bit. where we might have closed business. I'm just going to pick a number, 60 days, maybe that's moved to 70 days or 75 days. So we are seeing sales funnels to close business move out a little bit, that's in software and hardware a little bit. So yes, we are seeing a little bit of that, but we're not losing business. I think in a number of places where we saw things extend that was caught on eye, in no situation have we lost any business. So it's really just -- it comes down to maybe customers stretching their dollar a little bit. And that's why the point I made around our value proposition is so important, because I think we're going to stay at the top of the list of things to do with our customer base simply because of the value proposition and our ability to save money and the return profile that you get from an investment in the workflow solutions that we've sort of developed over the last five or six years. So it doesn't mean it's going to happen exactly like we think it is from a time frame perspective, but we're not seeing things fall out yet, which I think is good news for the -- into '23 for sure. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to hand the call back to Jim Lico for any closing remarks. Jim Lico : Well, thanks, Dennis. And thanks, everyone, for taking the time today. We know you have a busy schedule today and this week. Hopefully, you heard from Chuck in our remarks on the Q&A as well as our prepared remarks. We're really proud of the quarter we just had. I think it demonstrates the power and the resiliency of the portfolio. I think the gross margin and operating margin expansion and free cash flow on the accelerated organic revenue is just demonstrative of the power of what we're building here, and we're really excited about what's going on. Obviously, a lot of noise out there, both from a macro perspective and geopolitical. We understand that. We're not oblivious to that in any way, shape or form. We're preparing scenarios for that. We'll continue to see how things play out here in the fourth quarter, and we'll look forward to talking to you through the quarter and obviously into '23 as we get ready for a guide in the new year. So thanks, everyone, for the time. Good luck this week, and we look forward to talking to you all soon. Thank you.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Fortive Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Elena Rosman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rosman, you may begin your conference. Elena Rosman : Thank you, Julian, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. With us today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by Regulation G are available on the Investors section of our website at fortive.com.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks, Elena. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin on slide 3. Fortive had another quarter of outstanding operating performance in Q4, delivering 14% core revenue growth, 50 and 110 basis points of adjusted gross and operating margin expansion, respectively, 11% adjusted earnings per share growth, 62% free cash flow growth, all ahead of the guidance we gave in October. Our strong purpose-driven culture is supported by our relentless focus on executing for customers and shareholders in 2022. The continued evolution of our portfolio within the markets we play is characterized by strong secular drivers, which powered 9% ARR growth in our software businesses and backlog expansion in our hard products businesses, contributing to record core revenue growth for the year. Our performance would not have been possible without the dedication of our 18,000 team members around the world. Team overcame continued supply chain and inflationary challenges, which will likely linger into 2023. We believe the power of the Fortive Business System is a key differentiator, contributing to more profitable growth, record gross margins and free cash flow generation. As we look forward, we're excited to update you on the progress we've made on our multiyear targets and strategies that are driving outperformance at our upcoming Investor Day in May. Turning to slide 4. Even against the backdrop of a difficult macro in 2022, Fortive continue to validate the investment thesis that we have pursued since 2016, delivering core growth of 10% and 20% on a two-year stack basis, accelerating over the last few years. Our portfolio transformation has also driven approximately 1,000 basis points of gross margin expansion since 2016, which has translated into higher operating margins and provides further opportunity to improve margins in the years to come. We also delivered free cash flow growth of $1.2 billion, with margins approaching 21%, underscoring our ability to compound cash flow off a higher base, a key Fortive differentiator and value creation driver. In summary, we had said that 2022 would be a show-me year and we delivered strong results across all of our segments, which I will highlight in more detail on the next few slides, starting with Intelligent Operating Solutions on Slide 5. IOS grew core revenue by 13%, representing its third consecutive quarter of double-digit core revenue growth. We had good growth in all regions, with low double-digit growth in North America, mid-teens growth in Western Europe and high 20s growth in China. Double-digit core growth in every workflow, combined with our rigorous application of FBS, drove 330 basis points of core operating margin expansion, more than offsetting inflation and FX headwinds. Looking at our performance drivers by workflow and connected reliability, look at low teens growth, supported by a strong backlog position and continued success with their new solar and calibration products serving the energy, renewables and electric vehicle markets. POS remains strong in every region. However, we expect to see some slowing as supply chains continue to normalize. Strong end market demand drove double-digit EMEA SaaS revenue growth in the quarter, with record net dollar retention of approximately 106%. In EHS, revenue grew by high teens with strong contributions from both Industrial Scientific and Intelex. Industrial Scientific revenue grew approximately 20%, as strong demand was supplemented by record iNet expansion and higher instrument shipments following the resolution of key supply chain issues at the end of the third quarter. Meanwhile, Intelex posted another quarter of low double-digit SaaS growth. They have successfully deployed FBS initiatives to accelerate software implementations and create upsell opportunities to customers. Moving to facilities and asset life cycle. We had low double-digit growth in Q4. Vontier revenues once again increased double-digits as customer labor shortages and deferred facility maintenance continued to drive higher volume through the company's job order contracting platform. Accruent SaaS revenue grew by mid-single digits, despite a sizable headwind from end-of-life products. Accruent continues to see good success from its recent go-to-market focus in asset management and workplace solutions to enable mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2023. And ServiceChannel saw another quarter of double-digit revenue growth taking their full year growth rate to just under 50%. As a reminder, we are transitioning from a largely pass-through revenue base to a better long-term business model that includes more recurring SaaS revenue. This change will create a short-term revenue headwind in the first quarter. However, we expect service channel to remain a strong double-digit growth business in 2023 with above 20% adjusted operating margin. Turning now to Slide 6. Precision Technologies delivered another strong quarter of double-digit revenue growth in every business. Core revenues increased 20%, driven by high teens growth in North America and greater than 20% growth in both Western Europe and China. PT also delivered 240 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion with higher volume, price realization and productivity more than offsetting inflation in FX. Some highlights for the quarter include : record quarterly revenues and operating profit at Tektronix, which continue to benefit robust backlog, driven by new product launches, share gains and new entry in mainstream as sold scopes. We saw orders slow in Q4 as expected as demand normalizes following the 40% growth we've seen over the last two years. Sensing Technologies had another quarter of mid-teens growth, driven by strong price realization across all businesses and continued demand in Qualitrol's utility and power business, offsetting industrial and semiconductor demand softening. Combination of Gems and Setra in 2022 also drove approximately 200 basis points of margin expansion and four working capital turns improvement. Pacific Scientific EMC saw high 20s growth in the quarter, facilitated by capacity expansion and improved materials availability. Moving now to slide seven in Advanced Healthcare Solutions. As expected, revenues increased 5% in the quarter, driven by broad improvement across all health care operating companies. By major region, mid-single-digit growth in North America reflected the benefit of our higher installed base and some improvement in hospitals, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Western Europe and a high single-digit decline in China. The exit rate on China elective procedures was the lowest we have seen post-COVID and roughly 30% of normalized levels. January 2023 volumes were roughly half of prior year levels, which was reflected in our Q1 outlook for the segment. In the fourth quarter, AHS segment margins were down 260 basis points, driven primarily by higher inflation, partially offset by favorable M&A. Notably, margins were up approximately 400 basis points versus Q3. Versus our fourth quarter guidance, margins were unfavorably impacted by additional transactional effects and lower margins at Fluke Health Solutions. As we look ahead, the team is starting to see traction on their pricing and productivity initiatives, which we expect will deliver margin recovery in 2023. Some other highlights of the quarter include; ASP finished the year with core revenue growth of 5% as capital share gains and consumable volumes more than offset COVID headwinds in China. Even with inflationary pressures, ASP ended Q4 with the strongest margins of the year and continued to deliver strong working capital improvements. While hospital profitability remains pressured, due to labor and inflationary challenges, Censis continues to drive robust growth and in Setra SaaS offering in Q4 and for the year with mid-teens net new ACV and record cross-sell opportunities. Lastly, Provation is ahead on its return expectations, having contributed $0.10 to earnings in 2022. As customers continue to standardize our probation across their health systems, we are seeing accelerated SaaS growth, setting them up for a strong 2023. Turning to slide eight, the Fortive Business System is a powerful mindset that makes continuous improvement a way of life at Fortive. We drive deep engagement across our teams and hold them accountable for delivering on high expectations.  As a reminder, in October, we brought together over 400 team members and our CEO Kaizen Innovent. Our most senior Fortive leaders, including our segment leaders and a number of our operating company presidents, collaborated to drive significant improvements in growth, margin, free cash flow, and breakthrough innovations across four operating companies, Fluke, ISC, Tektronix, and Censis. We're proud of the success our teams are having sustaining results to directly attribute it to this event, including, at Fluke, we reduced bold change over time by over 50%, eliminating stock-outs on critical plastic components and reducing past due backlog. At ISC, we applied lean conversion in the Fortive material system to improve quality output and turnaround time for iNet and rental customers, dramatically reducing the cost of repairs and product redesign. At Tektronix, we applied lean conversion to circuit board repair, increasing on-time delivery to 98% by altering material flow, installing 5S part management, and building standard work and documentation of our procedures. In Censis, we applied value stream mapping and transactional process improvement to identify the inefficiencies and waste, resulting in a 50% reduction in time to onboard new customers. With Kaizen activity accelerating in 2023, we expect significant results across in the year ahead. I'm incredibly proud of the work we have done in 2022 to deliver powerful results and continue our progress towards building a more sustainable future, as you can see on slide nine. We believe in taking a holistic approach to creating value that includes setting aspirational and actionable targets across each of our sustainability pillars as shown on the page. Leading Fortive today is a diverse Board and leadership team, with recent hires and promotions advancing our commitment to top talent and diversity. Strong and inclusive culture is core to Fortive\u2019s mission, with inclusion and diversity, a critical component of FBS. Last year, we published clear goals to increase our diverse supplier spend, gender representation, by pack representation and senior leader diversity by 2025. We believe this has resulted in part to an increase in our employee engagement scores, up five points from pre-pandemic levels. Our progress also extends to how we protect the planet. It includes the early achievement of our 2025 greenhouse gas goal in the adoption of our new ambitious goal of 50% emissions reduction by 2029. It's our shared purpose that also pushes us to create innovative and sustainable products and services. Today, approximately 60% of our revenue is derived from products and services that enable more sustainable outcomes, aligned to the United Nations' sustainable development goals. And we have award-winning products that promote sustainability for our customers. Lastly, the commitment to drive meaningful and sustainable outcomes that matter most to our stakeholders is reflected in our recognition by Newsweek for the fourth consecutive year as America's most responsible company. With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will provide more color on our fourth quarter financials and our 2023 outlook. Chuck McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. I will begin on slide 10, with a quick recap of our fourth quarter performance. We generated year-over-year core revenue growth of 14%. Acquisitions net of divestitures contributed 1.5 points of growth. FX headwinds were approximately four points. Turning to the geographies. We saw another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth in each of our major regions. North America revenue was up low double-digits with broad-based strength across our businesses, Western Europe revenue grew mid-teens, with volume contributions in hardware products and favorable pricing, partially offset by a decline in healthcare. In the fourth quarter, bookings growth slowed in North America and Western Europe as expected. Asia revenue increased high-teens, with low 20% in China, driven by robust growth in Intelligent Operating Solutions and Precision Technologies, more than offsetting a dramatic drop in elective procedures in China impacting Advanced HealthCare Solutions. Lastly, we saw a broad-based performance in our high-growth markets with mid-teens core growth. Turning to slide 11, we show operating performance highlights for the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margins increased by 50 basis points to 58.3% as volume and strong price realization continued to demonstrate the value proposition of our products and solutions more than offsetting higher inflation. Adjusted operating profit margins expanded 110 basis points to 25.5%, up 230 basis points on a two-year stack basis. Adjusted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.88, reflecting a strong fall-through on higher volumes and productivity, partially offset by higher interest and tax expense. Normalized for tax earnings in the quarter were up 16%. Free cash flow was another standard. Strong year-end cash collections and the benefits of our FBS-driven working capital initiatives yielded $428 million of free cash flow in the quarter, taking the full year to $1.2 billion. Before turning to the guide, I wanted to provide some context on our 2023 outlook on Slide 12. We expect that 2023 will be another year of growth and margin expansion in each of our strategic segments supported by secular tailwinds, driving market expansion and new customer innovations. Our recurring revenue businesses at roughly 40% of sales are expected to benefit from the work we did in 2022 to increase demand generation and strengthen our go-to-market efforts, driving double-digit SaaS and license revenue growth. Elevated backlog in our hardware products businesses, particularly at Tektronix, is expected to derisk moderating demand as order rates normalize in 2023. Further, the benefit of 2022 pricing actions is expected to carry over into 2023, driving another year of above-trend pricing realization along with increased sourcing and value engineering savings contributing to gross margin expansion. We also expect our productivity initiatives to yield strong incremental operating margins, including actions in the first half of the year to countermeasure the slowing macro environment. Project paybacks related to these initiatives are expected to average one year. We have included these benefits in our margins and earnings outlook for the second half, with carryover benefits into 2024. In summary, we believe our 2023 outlook reflects a more resilient revenue and earnings profile, as we expect to weather the evolving macro environment. Turning now to the guide on Slide 13. We are introducing 2023 guidance. Starting with the full year, we expect core revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5.5%. Our outlook reflects a year-over-year foreign exchange headwind of just under 1% on revenue. Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 5% to 10%, with margins in the range of 25% to 25.5%. Adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $3.25 to $3.40, up 3% to 8%, which includes higher interest and tax expense. And free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.25 billion, representing conversion in the range of 100% to 105% of adjusted net income and a 21% free cash flow margin. For the first quarter, we anticipate core revenue growth of 5% to 6.5% with an FX headwind of 2.5%. Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 4% to 9%, with margins in the range of 23.5% to 24%. Adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.71 to $0.74, up 1% to 5%, which includes higher year-over-year interest and tax and free cash flow of approximately $170 million, reflecting the stronger cash collections that pulled forward into Q4 as well as our normal seasonal variations. Turning now to Slide 14. We are expecting a 48-52 split of revenue first half to second half, which reflects a step-up of approximately $120 million of core revenue growth, which when you compare to last year, it's less than half of the increase we saw in the second half of 2022. The step-up in 2023 is largely driven by acceleration in new products, a ramp in the growth rate of advanced healthcare as we lap China COVID lockdowns and an increase in software and other recurring revenue streams. FX and interest account for abnormal earnings seasonality as FX becomes a tailwind in the second half of the year and interest expense is expected to decline as we pay down debt with available free cash flow as the year progresses, giving us a bigger than usual step-up in EPS first half to second half. In summary, our revenue outlook reflects a similar linearity profile to 2022 and while core growth decelerates first half to second half, it accelerates on a two-year stack basis. With that, I'll pass it back to Jim to provide some closing remarks. Jim Lico : Thanks, Chuck. I'll now wrap up on slide 16. In summary, I'm incredibly proud of the contributions of our 18,000 team members to make 2022 a record year for Fortive and further differentiate our more resilient financial profile. As we turn the page on 2022, that resiliency will be on display again in 2023 as our outlook reflects an expectation for slowing growth as customer demand normalizes after two years of robust double-digit hardware product orders, but it also reflects the benefits of the investments we have made to accelerate strategy, strengthen our market position, scale our software revenues and develop new innovations that are solving our customers' toughest safety, quality and productivity challenges. As you've also heard today, we are seeing the benefits of our continuous improvement culture, unleashing the power of the Fortive Business System to deliver more profitable growth and strong free cash flow, again in 2023, allowing us to compound returns through disciplined capital deployment. When taken together, this creates a powerful formula for value creation with a high-quality portfolio of desirable brands favorably leveraged to sustainable secular trends, industry-leading margins and free cash flow generation and best-in-class execution, enabling Fortive to outperform in almost any environment. With that, I'll turn it back to Elena. Elena Rosman : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Julianne, we will now take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey, good afternoon. Jim Lico : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just talk about -- for iOS, the margin expansion kind of sequentially from the first quarter for the -- through the full year, the kind of key building blocks for that? Jim Lico : Yes. Hey, Steve, it's Jim. A couple of things. One, obviously, we play a role in that. And -- so as we continue to progress, we'll see that. As we noted, some of the asset life cycle, a little bit lower growth in the first quarter. We can talk about that, but that -- those margins will expand. So, the revenue coming back certainly in the software businesses there as well as just continued progression of -- a lot of the actions that we've got price will continue to be a helpful piece of this driving gross margin expansion along with our productivity initiatives. So, I don't think we've got anything dramatic from the first half to second half in terms of anything that you wouldn't normally see seasonally in terms of growth, price realization, productivity initiatives get more traction as you go through the year. Those are probably the big drivers outside of just normal revenue. Steve Tusa : And then should we assume this excess $350 million backlog that that all obviously gets washed out this year? And then what's the pace of that being washed through? Chuck McLaughlin : Steve, this is Chuck. Actually, in our modeling, no, we wouldn't expect that all gets washed out based -- but of course, it depends on the order rate. It's one of the reasons why we think that we've got a pretty resilient forecast here. If the order rates moderate beyond where we think they're going to be, we could still do it. It's really still -- we've got -- supply chain is getting better. It's just -- it's not resolved. So it sounds like we can just flip the switch and get it all out. But we would -- we'd probably cut it in half. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Jim Lico : Thanks Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to start with some more detail on the product hardware orders. So I think those were up mid-single digit Q3. It sounds like they're up maybe low single Q4. And then you've got this slowdown commentary. And then also on slide 14, you talked about orders improving through the year. So is the way to think about that, you're trying to say that orders, I don't know, ended last year up low single, maybe they're down in the first half, grow in the second half? And then that's what informs the PT organic sales guide, because if I look at that on slide 17, you're starting the year up double digit. The year as a whole is up low to mid. So you're implying the organic sales in the year flat or down. Is that just, kind of, the orders flowing through with a six-month lag? Is that how we're thinking about it? Jim Lico : Well, I think, first, we would think of the second half of 2022 is basically flattish for orders for those businesses. So a little bit down in the fourth relative to -- and right along where we thought. If you remember from the third quarter call, we said, yes, we also saw some orders that came in, in the first half for the second half. So that's kind of the backdrop of what we just described, backlog in and around where we thought it would be from an ending year. So the backlog, obviously, as Chuck just described, that obviously helps in the -- with some of the order down slowing that we saw. We expect orders to be around the same in the first half relative to those product businesses, Julian. So you think about probably the second quarter -- first quarter and second quarter being probably negative in those businesses. But backlog obviously mitigates a number of those things. And then it starts to pick up a little bit. Some of that pickup is an easier comp, obviously, because of what I just described in the second half of 2022. And there's a little bit sensing probably stays flat through the year is probably not a big improvement through the year in sensing, but a little bit of improvement in Tek. And we think Fluke will come back as well, typically comes back a little faster. Chuck McLaughlin : And Julian, the only thing I'd just remind you is we have an easier comp in PT in Q1. So when you start -- when you look at $1 standpoint, it's not as dramatic as you move through the year. In fact, I think from $1 standpoint, we'd expect that it would -- there would be an upward trajectory in PT each quarter sequentially. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And when we look maybe within PT at Tektronix, maybe flesh out a little bit more what you're expecting. You've got that high-teens growth first quarter. The year is up mid-single. But I guess if I look at a lot of what's happened in, say, electronics, it feels like people are in kind of the teeth of the destocking right now and have been for three or even six months. So, I understand maybe you're protected a bit by the backlog in Tektronix. That means you have a sort of gradual descent through the year. Maybe just help us understand kind of where you see channel inventories in that business? And again, on Tektronix, it looks like the guide implies down revenue in the back half. Just wanted to kind of confirm a couple of things there. Jim Lico : Yes. Well, number one, I think, on the back stuff, as we said in the prepared remarks, 40% order growth over the last couple of years. It's obviously a little bit higher growth rate than what we'd normally expect for Tek. So, what you start to see in the full year, it\u2019s a moderation or a normalization back to that mid-single-digit growth. I would say when you think about customers, very much playing out the way we anticipated in terms of moving the business. The business just doesn't have as much of influence from consumer electronics anymore, where you're seeing a lot of that distortion with the things we've talked about in terms of power, data centers, industrial IoT, all of those drivers are really driving the business much more today than ever before, making it more resilient. So, I think those are all the things we've described that I think really continue to have the business. It does dissolve a little bit, but it moderates off of really, really large numbers. So I think mid-single-digit growth for the year is what we're calling out here. It could be a little bit better. We'll still end the year with a decent backlog, as Chuck was just describing a couple of questions ago. So, I think when we look at the business for the year, very healthy channels have almost no inventory. So we continue to see good point-of-sale strength. And some of that is just fulfilling past due to some extent, but there really isn't a channel inventory situation whatsoever. And so I think we're in a good place. Orders will slow a little bit, but some of that is just the big heavy comps that we've sort of had over the last couple of years. So we think we're in a good place, and we think we'll exit 2023 in a good place as well. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey, Jim and Chuck and Elena. I hope you guys are well. If I look back at my notes, I think you said, the service channel probation would be like $0.12 accretive in 2022. It sounds like maybe that came in a couple of pennies better. Is that accretion step-up meaningfully in 2023? We think just given the growth rates of those businesses that would be a nice tailwind for you. But I know you did make some comments on the SaaS adjustment on service channel, though as an offset. Chuck McLaughlin : Yes. Scott, you got right. We came in at, I think, $0.14 in 2022. And I would expect that, that would grow as you expected. We build on that $0.14 in 2023. Faster growth rates there, also more profitability in the first half in service channel and things. All that are going to give us a nice tailwind. Jim Lico : And Scott, just to maybe add on to the first quarter service channel thing, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. This is really -- the SaaS revenues continue to be incredibly strong in the business. But we did have a little bit more pass-through revenue in the year than we anticipated. That's why we grew the business almost 50% on a full year basis. So really strong growth this past year. But we'll move to a better business model, which is a little bit less pass-through revenue and a much -- but the strength of the SaaS business has been there all along. We've now got a data analytics platform that we're offering as well. So we're really going to, kind of, get through that in the first quarter and a little bit in the first half, but the profitability really does raise considerably as well. We got what we needed in 2022 in that regard. We'll be an even better place in 2023, simply because the business model transformation that we intended to do is really start going to hit the -- full hit of the P&L through the year. Scott Davis : All right. That's helpful. And I think it was Jim. You mentioned in your remarks that the discretionary procedures in China finished the year at like a 30% number, which 30% of normal, I think I'm reading it as, which just sounds crazy. But -- is that -- are you still seeing that in January? I would imagine that the reopening -- just the timing of the reopening, that stuff would pick back up here in 1Q pretty aggressively, but I don't know. But are you still seeing that kind of... Jim Lico : Yes, I mean you got it exactly right. December, in particular, was really low. I think that speaks to the strength of AHF, quite frankly, on the revenue line is we were able to weather that storm because of the strength of other regions of the world. We talked about the 5% growth that we had in the segment. So we think, we're about probably 50% in January, so about half of where we were a year ago. But you're right, it's going to ramp. We're seeing some of that improvement. A couple of weeks ago, we think was the low point. But it's now picking up to 70 in a week, but we should see continued improvement. Again, on the other side of the Chinese New Year holiday, we'll get a better view of things, as we always do. But we anticipate that this will continue to improve throughout the year, as China just kind of gets back to normal, and we certainly started to see that. Scott Davis : Okay. Well, best of luck. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Jim Lico : All right. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jim Lico : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey. Thanks. Good day, everybody. Hello. Hey, Jim, as you're well aware, right, there's a process going on out there for national instruments and a lot of speculation out there about your interest. I'm sure you're fairly limited on what you might want to say, but any color you could give us on your appetite for any deal at large or you've expressed interest in the past and hardware-related deals? Anything there make any sense for you? Jim Lico : Yes. So, I think, number one, we obviously, know the company and have read the news. So you're exactly right. We wouldn't comment on any process that we'll be involved in or not involved in, particularly a public one. But I would say this. I mean we've known NI for a long time. I can remember meeting Dr. T 15 years ago or so. So we know them well. We partnered with them at Tektronix and have for a long time. So I think what we've said strategically about all of our funnel was there was a balance of large, small deals, hardware and software. So we can -- the balance sheet is an incredible place right now, as you know. So we're in a great place to do things. But we're going to be disciplined. We're going to make sure that every situation we approach, we approach it strategically, how well that accelerates, what we want to do, and I'll leave it at that. But I think more broadly around M&A, we're in a very good place relative to our opportunities ahead of us. And we'll -- we certainly are playing offense in that regard. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for that. And then just totally shifting gears. Just back to kind of the inflationary pressures in AHS. At this point, do you have the cost and other actions in place to be neutral or better as we move through 2023? Maybe just put a little finer point on how you see kind of price cost and kind of the margin impact playing out over the balance of the year? Jim Lico : Yes. So I think, more specifically around AHS, we called out a couple of kind of onetime headwinds in the quarter. We -- I think there's a number of things that are working in our favor relative to the 2023 year. Number one is North America. We had good growth in North America and anticipate that will continue -- we're not necessarily calling everything getting perfect in North America, but we do believe it will get better. And we saw that in the fourth quarter, and that's a good thing for our margin structure. And then number two, to your point, we're seeing a little bit more price realization in the fourth and into this year. Things are starting to get a little traction. We've talked about that on the call that it just takes longer, and we're starting to see that. And then finally, productivity. The team has -- that leadership team has really adopted FBS, and they've really embraced a number of things to really drive productivity. So, we don't see the additional inflation either as well. So the combination of we don't see incremental inflation at this point and we have those actions getting deeper and deeper into the margin structure, if you will, through the year. So, we feel like we're in a much better place starting here in 2023, both from a market and obviously, the kind of actions that we need to continue to make the business better. And I would just kind of ask, but we have grown gross margins in AHS -- operating margins about 130 basis points over the last two years. So, despite those challenges, we're in a good place. I call that the launch path from where we are today. Jeff Sprague : Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jim Lico : Hi Nigel. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning everyone. Hey guys, how are you? By the way, [indiscernible] is going to be very happy, you put them in that competitive basket. So, just want to follow-up on Jeff's question, obviously, the National Instrument news is out there. Where do you stand philosophically on issuing equity for a deal? Because based on the math of we're doing -- your leverage will get to very high levels. So, just wondering, what is the leverage ceiling you prepare to go to for the right opportunity? And philosophically, would you issue equity for the biopsy? Chuck McLaughlin : Nigel, it's Chuck. We've always felt we want to maintain an investment-grade rating. And so we wouldn't do anything that -- on any type of deal that would jeopardize that. I've pointed out in the past, we've done equity instruments, like the mandatory convert. And we've always said that in situations where we want to do something, equity has never been off the table. It just hasn't been needed at this point. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's helpful. And then just going back to the FY 2023 plan. How much of that $350 million surplus backlog are you sort of planning to eat into underpinning your plan? And then maybe just touch on the service channel SaaS transition. It seems like it's a very sort of discrete sort of intra-quarter, maybe 1Q first half event. These SaaS transitions tend to be kind of drawn out when we look at other companies. So, just curious why that would be so short-term? Chuck McLaughlin : Nigel, I'll take the first part. We would expect to take of the excess backlog that we're talking about probably up to half of it is included in the assumptions for this year in this guide. But to be clear, this is what we consider excess. And that's still -- we get more out if supply chains get better. So there's a little more there, but it's still constrained by supply chain throughout this year. But getting back Nigel on the service channel question, I wouldn't think of it as a SaaS transition. The SaaS revenue has continued to be good. It's just -- we grew the business well over 70% in Q1 of 2022 and so with a large amount of this just pass-through revenue. And so if you think about it, we have a customer. Some of our contracts have. We're passing through a number of amounts of the facility maintenance costs that they have pain plumbers or electricians. We're just doing less of that. And so it's really not a SaaS transition in the traditional sense. That we're replacing that solution, though with some other added benefits. And so we -- that's why it's a short-term transition. It's really kind of going from losing some of this one-time pass-through revenue and quite frankly, we didn't make any money on. So I would see it as that, and that's why it's short-term as opposed to sort of a conversion of what you'd see traditional license revenue to SaaS revenue. We're not going to see that. This is -- service channel is 100% SaaS revenue company. Nigel Coe : Right. Okay. Thank you. Chuck McLaughlin : Thank you. Jim Lico : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, guys. Chuck McLaughlin : Hi Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Jim, you and Chuck mentioned increased productivity initiatives planned in all segments that primarily benefits the second half of 2023. I think you already mentioned FBS in AHS, but could you give us a little more color around what the bigger initiatives are and maybe size these initiatives for us? And then if there's any sort of cost to undertake these initiatives? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes, Andy, the first half, we'd expect to put up $20 in $25 million to $30 million of cost. See cost to get after some of these structural things. Some of them are looked up, a few of those, but there'll likely be some outside of the U.S. Maybe there are some regions that we want to convert to a dealer approach rather than a direct approach, and I'm thinking here in our health margins. We've always thought that there was cost that we needed to improve our go-to-market there. And we're just getting after that. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. And then Jim, can you give us more color into what you're seeing by region? It looks like Western Europe has continued to be strong for you. We've talked about China and AHS, but outside of AHS is strong. So what are you thinking for 2023? You talked about orders slowing in Western Europe and North America, but are that more a function of supply chain normalizing? Or are more of your customers are little cautious to start in 2023? Jim Lico : Yes, it's interesting. I think we've always thought for the last several months that customers would inevitably start 2023 out a little more conservative just given we've seen some of the Tek layoffs and some of those things, the PMI and where it is. And so that's number one. That's number one. That's kind of a planning assumption from an order perspective. Now we also knowing that we had -- we're starting here with a good backlog situation. I would say, if you think about it regionally, Andy, obviously, North America is going to be pretty good and pretty resilient, given the fact that we have most of our software businesses have the predominance of their revenue streams in North America. And I mentioned the health care, particularly ASP North American story. So, North America is going to be pretty resilient I would say that Western Europe and Europe more broadly, probably a weaker area for the year, just given a number of things. Some of that is supply chains normalizing a little bit back to normal. Some of it is just a little bit of weakness as well. China is going to be good all year. Healthcare will be weak in China in the first quarter because of the actives but should continue to get better through the year. So that's kind of the regional play, and that's sort of our planning assumptions going forward. I think it's still early days. Obviously, a lot of the year to play out here. But that was -- that's sort of fundamental to our planning assumption. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, Jim. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jim Lico : Hi, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. We do this every quarter. Morning, afternoon, sort of depends. I hope everybody is well. Not to beat a dead horse on this hardware backlog conversion and sort of what's in the guide but not, but I just want to be clear here, Chuck, on that comment that you only have about half of the excess backlog getting worked down. I don't know how fungible that backlog is even within something like Tek where it's a little bit more weighted. But am I to understand then that like orders on a volume basis could be down close to double digits. And you guys are basically still hitting the guide if you can work down that backlog fully this year, providing there's no like other governor in the way? Is that sort of a fair way to think about how that's calibrated? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes. I mean, that's not what we're seeing here in there. But what we are seeing is reason we can't get the backlog down more, it's more supply chain constrained we've got so much material is the way I'm thinking of it. So if orders go down $10 million more, that doesn't necessarily change our revenue guidance. That's what you say. I would agree with that. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Jim Lico : And that's where going -- yes, I was just going to add that it's -- as you said, it depends on the business as you pointed out, a little bit more backlog intact. So it does matter where the orders go down relative to how we can make it off. So that certainly is part of it. But we ought to think of that extra -- the half that isn't planned to go out as an insurance policy, again some additional decline. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess sort of related to -- I think it was Jeff Sprague\u2019s question on price cost. Maybe taking a step back and just thinking about kind of total bullet effect on supply chain. I would imagine there were some frictional costs last year that probably get better, but maybe you're also kind of working down some inventories. So, is there some sort of like offsetting absorption hit to the absence of those frictional costs? Or how would you sort of balance those two as a net headwind versus tailwind for this year? Jim Lico : Well, I would take it this way. There are some spot buy costs that probably go away from 2022, for sure. But there are some embedded costs in the standards that are going to be with us here for a while. I think the real thought is we're going to have price cost like we have been, we grow gross margins more in 2023 than we did in 2022. So in that sense, I think we're going to be as we've shown over the last several quarters, the media had -- we're not too worried from a factory absorption perspective. If that's -- if you're going in that direction, we won't worry about that. We'll really be focused on is making sure a number of commodities are down or will be lower, things like metals, plastics, but the majority of our buy is electronic components. And that will take a little bit longer to sort of wean ourselves from some of that inflation that we saw this year. So, we plan to -- I think we're super aggressive in that regard. We'll get after everything. We have great supply chain teams, but it will take a little while. But I think you're going to see that throughout the year as the gross margins continue to look good. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Super helpful. Best of luck, guys. Jim Lico : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jim Lico : Hi, Dean. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good day, everybody. Can we put the spotlight on free cash flow by here? It looks like Fortive is the only company we've seen that is over delivered in the fourth quarter significantly above your 4Q average. And Chuck, you mentioned some working capital initiatives you could take us through that? But also there was a reference about collections pulled into the fourth quarter from the first quarter. So what was the dynamic there? Chuck McLaughlin : Yes, a couple of things we have always have a lot of work as you know, working at our working capital across all of our operating companies is the focus that we've had all year long and it's been -- it's been a challenge. It is -- it always is, but we've really done a great, ASP actually was a stand up there. So I think that's really what we were talking about there. But they weren't building ones. We had a couple of really good place. I wouldn't say pulling so much is really thinking about it as just some time. We thought we had a really, we did have a really strong guide, and we came in a little stronger that. There could be -- sometimes you just get your on receipts, sometimes they come in a little late and show up in Q1, this time, I'm probably think maybe $20 million came in a little early. You really can't do much about that. It's just whether sometimes when they cut the check before New Year's or after -- that's -- but we were very pleased with our free cash flow performance all year along. Deane Dray : Yes, it looks -- it came in at $107 million. So that's right in the sweet spot for you all. And then a follow-up question on cross-selling. Jim, you mentioned sensing having some success in cross-selling. Just kind of take us through what's going on there? How much is that encouraged, how do you track cross-selling? And what are the opportunities? Jim Lico : Yes. Dean, I think number one is, as you -- I know you know when we've seen a little -- in a couple of places, we've seen new loan book. When things get a little slow, particularly starting the year out. New logos maybe a little bit harder to grab on to as people maybe take a month or so to maybe an extra 30 days to close the business. But cross-selling and up-selling is something you can do every day. And so our Presidents are very much tuned in times like this where maybe things are a little bit more -- there's a little bit more ambiguity out there as to how the year is going to play out. The teams are really conditioned to really move the sales motion to more cross-selling and that really drives our net dollar retention. We talked about it in a couple of individual places we've got over -- we've got a number of businesses that are well over 105 now, we're about 102. So the metric we really used to drive that is cross -- is net dollar retention. And so what we're really pushed on early in the year is get those renewals, drive gross retention up and then drive the cross-selling and up-selling as well. So, I think we're well -- from a process perspective, FBS has a number of tools that support those efforts, with customer success organizations. That's a big focus for us here at the start of the year. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jim Lico : Hi, Joe. Joe O'Dea: Thanks for taking my questions. Hi. I wanted to start just more macro and I think you know what you're talking about on the orders front is more just kind of backlog normalization as supply chain corrects. But as you go through that mean, how do you think about coming out on the other side? And how do you think that it's sort of soft-landing type of environment when we see sort of industrial production and we see PMI, so just in general, what you're seeing on kind of structural growth or outgrowth and kind of confidence that backlogs normalize and then the growth is there on the other side? Jim Lico : Yes. Joe, I think it really goes back. It will have an opportunity to really give a lot of this detail on our Investor Day in May. But I think what we really think about this is really how we move the growth rate on long-term through the cycle growth rate to mid-single-digits. So we got two really strong years of growth 10% average in the last two years. That's on the backs of a number of things we've done from a portfolio perspective and just demand has been better than historically. But as we get into 2024, and we normalize around the kind of things that we would see. We certainly would continue to see that mid-single digit as a number on the backs of continued stabilization of the macro for some of our product businesses obviously continued improvement in our healthcare businesses and just the strength of success that we've had in software. And those sort of combination pillars are really are going to be what really drives that mid-single-digit growth rate. As we said, as things normalize here, hopefully sooner rather than later. Joe O'Dea: Got it. And then I think in the prepared comments, you mentioned some actions to counter some of the slowing. You're not sure what might be happening on the cost front, but anything that you could expand on there? Jim Lico : Well, yes, I think as Chuck described, it's really kind of across the segments. And it really deals with a number of things. Certainly, looking at certain product lines that maybe are a little slower than over the next few years, we closed a couple of rooftops, continue to do some things on the lease front as we continue to consolidate our real estate footprint. So a number of those things are really what we're talking about. It's an accelerated rate, given kind of after a couple of years of 10% growth, we've may be more focused on the growth, maybe a little bit more focused on supply chain. But now as things start to normalize here, we're back to getting after some things, and in the traditional sense, we want to be ahead of those things, and that's really what we're talking about. Joe O'Dea: Great. Thank you. Jim Lico : Thank you. Chuck McLaughlin : Thank you. Operator : Our last question will come from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jim Lico : Hi, Joe. Joe Giordano : Hey, guys. Hey, how are you doing? I just want to follow-up a couple of things on the orders here. Particularly, let's strip out like the AHS and look more on the hardware stuff in PT and Fluke and Tek. What gives you confidence that orders in the second half of the year start to get better? I guess like just the revenue guide suggest that you exited kind of the lowest point of the year. And you said, Fluke -- Tek orders were up like 40% over a period of time here. So, like is it just going from plus 40 to normal levels? Is that like reasonable or like could you see declines in orders because of the magnitude at which they expanded over felt relatively short time? Jim Lico : Well, as we said, I think in the first half, we're going to see some of those declines as we described. And I might note, point-of-sale is still really strong. So at Fluke and Tek, we normally get that scenario in a coal mine question around Fluke. And quite frankly, Fluke's point-of-sale has stayed strong. So, we think that will moderate as some of the macro impact certainly moves that number down. But you're working on such high comps relative to the last few years is that any moderation whatsoever could make it look negative, but really, quite frankly, is not a significant issue relative to both the backlog and kind of where we're at relative to the historical perspective. So, yes, we'll -- some of that improvement in the second half is comps for sure, but some of it -- we think Sensing probably as an example, probably stayed a little rough through the year. And we get -- we know what the OEMs are doing right now. So, we mentioned in the prepared remarks some places in industrial, like industrial automation and some parts of the world like China. But on balance, when we look at the sum total of Sensing, Fluke, and Tek, we still think there'll be a little bit of improvement in the second half. But we don't need a big improvement necessarily to really deliver what we described. It is as we talked on a couple of the questions, we've got some backlog as an insurance policy against those things may be declining a little bit more than we anticipated. Joe Giordano : Okay. So, you're saying it's more of a dollar thing. I mean more of a comp mask think than dollars, I guess? Chuck McLaughlin : That's right. That's right. I mean we're really looking at some pretty significant growth rates over the last couple of years in orders that were much bigger than our revenue numbers because of the supply chain issues and the creation of a bigger backlog. And quite frankly, a bigger pass-through backlog, which we started to burn down as we've talked about throughout the day. Joe Giordano : Okay. And then just last for me. You talked about, I guess, theoretical M&A on the call so far. But if you were -- in a theoretical situation where equity was a component of a purchase, like how do you think about what your return hurdles would be in scenarios like that where equity is part of it? Chuck McLaughlin : Well, first of all, I think it's clear we're trying to convey here is discipline will continue to be the word of the day relative to M&A. And I think we -- our return hurdles are going to be what our return hurdles are. We've talked about 10% ROIC for the various kinds of deals, and we'll continue to think about that. I think what we've been trying to describe is situations in which we'll be disciplined. I think what you've seen in 2022 is the strong returns of that, certainly the most recent M&A that we've done for patient and service channel, beating their first-year numbers as an example of that. But also the deals that we did five, six years ago. that are just performing outstanding like Gordian and eMaint and Landauer. So, I think we're in a great place from a balance sheet perspective to deploy capital. And I would be much more focused on our discipline around returns and our discipline around accelerating strategy in places where we can really do that. Joe Giordano : Thanks guys. Chuck McLaughlin : Thank you. Operator : We are all out of time for questions today. I would like to turn the call back over to Jim Lico for closing remarks. Jim Lico : Thank you, Leanne and thanks everyone for spending the time with us today. We really appreciate -- we know you're busy this week with a number of things. I think what you heard from us today is a real sense of pride of what we did in 2022. We said 2022 is going to be a showing year and I think what you saw through the quarters and certainly in the full year numbers, the real power of the Fortive Business System and the building for us -- use the FBS tool to accelerate. We try to convey the fact that getting back into in-person Kaizen is something that's really important to us from a cultural perspective and from an ability to deliver in any sort of economic time. And that acceleration of in-person events we tried to demonstrate and show you some examples of that. We're back to work in that regard as we get into 2023. We look forward to continuing to share our strategies in May with you, and I think, what you'll see this year and what you're seeing in our guidance is the continued improvement in our portfolio and the strength of our culture in our business system. Special thanks to our 18,000 teammates around the world who made that happen and make it happen every day. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day. We look forward to the follow-up calls, and we'll see you soon. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Lico. James Lico : Thanks, Elena. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin on Slide 3. We had a strong start to the year, delivering better-than-expected revenues, margins and earnings in the first quarter. At 9% core growth, we're demonstrating strong execution of our strategy, building leading positions across our customers' critical connected workflows. Our ability to deliver strong growth and continued margin expansion is directly tied to our culture of continuous improvement and dedication to the Fortive Business System. As a result, we expanded adjusted gross and operating margins by 80 and 100 basis points, respectively, taking margins to a first quarter record expectations for further merger and expansion this year and into the future. Free cash flow in the quarter reflects our normal seasonality as well as the timing of China collections that pushed into April. Overall, our teams have done an excellent job managing working capital in a more challenging supply chain environment as seen by our outstanding performance in 2022. By harnessing our unique competitive advantages and strong execution capabilities, we are confident in our outlook and are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 guidance. Turning to Slide 4. I wanted to provide an update on what we're seeing and what we expect over the course of 2023. Starting on the left in the current environment, hardware product orders were better than expected, down mid-single digit and backlog was more resilient with a book-to-bill of 1.0 in the first quarter. Our software businesses continue to see good growth benefiting from strong customer value propositions, driving double-digit growth in our SaaS revenue streams. While industry challenges remained in our Healthcare segment due to China, consumables growth in March reaffirmed recovery is underway. We expect momentum to continue and accelerate growth and profitability throughout 2023. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, we are seeing traction on our new product launches, favorably aligned to secular drivers including Fluke's latest family of solar tools and Tektronix' leading power and electronic test systems, together with continued software strength and recovery in healthcare, we expect to sustain core growth in the second half. Combined with favorable pricing, cost savings and discrete productivity initiatives that span all segments, we expect over 75 basis points of margin expansion in the year. Lastly, we expect robust free cash flow growth again in 2023 which together with our very strong balance sheet, gives us confidence that our attractive M&A funnel will provide opportunities to enhance earnings and cash flow compounding in the future. Turning to Slide 5. We want to take a minute to remind you of all the work we've done to transform our portfolio and create focused segment strategies favorably aligned to a number of strong secular trends, has resulted in a more resilient Fortive with enduring growth and further margin expansion opportunities. As a result, today, we have a stronger collection of businesses with a more diversified end market mix and durable recurring revenue profile that includes leading healthcare and software franchises. Together with our enhanced innovation capabilities, we have focused our portfolio around multiyear megatrends, including automation, digitization, the electrification of everything and improving healthcare trends to name a few, all to reduce the overall cyclicality of our businesses and provide more tailwinds for growth by expanding into new markets. As a result of these megatrends, we see continued growth across our portfolio. including the more durable software and services businesses as well as the nonrecurring portion, given the sizable amount of backlog, some of our product businesses are working through, while continuing to see resilient demand. Finally, our portfolio quality is reinforced by the substantial improvements we've made in gross and operating profit, working capital and free cash flow as a percent of revenue, driven by the rigorous application of the Fortive Business System. Turning to Slide 6. FPS is a powerful mindset that makes continuous improvement a way of life at Fortive to drive deep engagement across our teams and hold them accountable for delivering on high expectations. With Kaizen activity accelerating, we saw significant results across the portfolio, including material improvement in delivery and past due backlog reduction in our hardware products businesses by improving planning and reducing part shortages with the Fortive material system. Board of software system deployment in our SaaS companies, including service channel, a current information is accelerating delivery of software features to customers, driving customer value and resulting in higher renewal rates and pricing gains. Our record gross margins in the first quarter were driven by a significant expansion of Kaizen events in the quarter, approximately double the number the prior year, setting us off for improved performance throughout the year. Turning to Slide 7. Fortive made sustainability a priority since its founding. It is inextricably linked to our company's shared purpose, values and business strategy, which you'll read more about in our upcoming 2023 sustainability report to be published in May. This year's report will further highlight how our commitment to sustainability is grounded in our culture of Kaizen, leveraging the power of FBS innovate products and services that enable more sustainable outcomes.  We'll also hear how our team has strengthened our responsible sourcing initiatives, ensuring robust review of the labor and given rights practices across our supply chain and how our strong and inclusive culture is creating a community where everyone belongs, which is positively reflected in our latest employee engagement and inclusion, diversity and equity performance. In summary, we are accelerating progress towards a more sustainable future for Fortive and our customers as well as the environment and the communities in which we operate. We invite you to review our report next month. I'll now provide more details on each of our 3 segments, beginning with Intelligent Operating Solutions on Slide 8. IOS grew core revenue by 10% as our connected workflow strategy drove better-than-expected performance in the quarter. The segment saw a good growth in all regions with mid-single-digit growth in North America and Western Europe, and mid-40% growth in China, lapping prior year shutdowns. Solid core growth in each workflow and strong FPS driven execution resulted in 300 basis points of operating margin expansion, taking operating margins consistently above 30%. Looking at our performance drivers by workflow. In Connected Reliability, Fluke core revenues grew by low double digits with mid-single-digit orders growth in the quarter and point of sale remained positive in all regions. Fluke is benefiting from lean portfolio management, driving record revenue attainment and Fluke's new product launches, including the SMFT 1000 solar tester, which are benefiting from strong demand in the energy, renewables and electric vehicle markets. Elsewhere at Fluke, eMaint posted another record quarter with strong double-digit growth. We are seeing accelerated customer adoption of the X5 CMMS system with enhanced connected worker capability also closed the largest deal on record with a strategic enterprise customer. EHS revenues grew by mid-single digit with both Industrial Scientific and Intellect providing solid contributions. Industrial Scientific saw strength across all product lines, including iNET and orders growth outpaced sales driven by new product launches and cross-sell activity. Intelex posted another quarter of strong SaaS growth with low double-digit ARR growth. Moving to facilities and asset life cycle. We had high single-digit growth in the first quarter, driven by high single-digit SaaS revenue growth. Customers continue to shift larger projects to Gordian's job order contracting platform, while the wind down of endo-light programs are occurring, and the business model change and service channel lowered core growth, revenues exceeded expectations in [indiscernible] as customers continue to seek more productive and digitized solutions to optimize their facilities management. For example, a large worldwide retailer is migrating multiple manual processes to the [indiscernible] real estate management platform at Acron and a large enterprise customer is leveraging service channels automation services to save hundreds of thousands of dollars of mismatched invoices. Turning now to Slide 9. Precision Technologies delivered another quarter of strong double-digit core revenue growth or revenues increased 14%, driven by a high single-digit growth in North America, low double-digit growth in Western Europe and high 30% growth in China. PT also delivered 190 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion with higher volume and strong price realization more than offsetting continued inflation and FX. Some highlights of the quarter included greater than 20% core revenue growth at Tektronix. Orders were better than expected, benefiting from bookings growth and electric vehicle testing programs. This and strong point of sale in all major regions drove double-digit growth across its product businesses in the first quarter, which continued to see good demand for recently introduced entry-level and mainstream stopes.  Sensing Technologies reported low single-digit growth as expected, driven by another quarter of strong price realization across all businesses and continued broad strength of Ultra. Pacific Scientific EMC reported a second consecutive quarter of greater than 20% growth as the business continued to deploy FBS to improve operational performance. Moving now to Slide 10, in Advanced Healthcare Solutions. Core revenues are flat as the improvement in electric procedure volumes outside of China was offset by some supply chain challenges at Fluke Health Solutions and the expected headwinds in China elected procedures and the wind down in Russia. By major region, North America was up slightly, and Western Europe grew mid-single digits, offsetting a high single-digit decline in China. China elected procedures were covered in March, exiting the month at approximately 90% of normalized levels. Our outlook continues to assume that China electric procedures return to normalized levels in the second half of 2023. In the first quarter, AHS adjusted operating margins declined 260 basis points as a result of FX headwinds, supply chain challenges at Fluke Health, lowering contribution margins and higher-than-expected inflation. Some highlights in the quarter include we exited March with stronger ASP consumables growth, reaffirming recovery post COVID is underway with sales outpacing the market in most regions. Double-digit growth at Census was driven by a Censo [indiscernible]. Censis is also seeing strong demand for its AIT productivity platform and continues to drive productivity improvements through the application of FBS tools, which have accelerated the time from bookings to revenue. FHS saw solid demand for equipment orders and dosimetry services despite continued supply chain strengths that stalled equipment shipment. Lastly, Provation continues to perform very well with another quarter of double-digit growth driven by its Apex SaaS offering. Apex has seen continued high customer demand with substantial Q1 orders and a greater than 3x average revenue uplift from license migrations. Following a strong start to the year, we continue to expect the probations growth will accelerate through 2023 supported by customers looking to further standardize our formation across their health systems. In addition to our remarks on the first quarter performance, we thought it would be helpful to provide more detail on our expectations for the AHS segment for the remainder of this year. The headline is that we expect sequential improvement in both revenue and adjusted operating profit margin as we move through the year. Specifically on revenue, we expect favorable price in addition to the recovery of electric procedures in China resolution of supply chain challenges at Fluke Health Solutions and normal healthcare seasonality to drive higher volumes over the course of the year.  As a result, we expect core growth will go from low single digit in Q2 to mid-single digit in the second half of the year. On margins, in addition to the uplift from higher volumes and favorable price, we see compounding tailwinds from the benefits of the productivity initiatives taking second half margins to approximately 25%. Go-to-market changes in ASP consumables in North America will improve performance and enable closer connection to our customers to better serve their needs, transitioning from a primarily distribution model to direct to the customer. All these actions will have carryover benefits in the years to come, positioning us for accelerated growth and profitability as the general healthcare environment continues to improve. With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will provide more color on our first quarter financials and our 2023 outlook. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. I will begin on Slide 11 with a quick recap of our first quarter revenue performance for Fortive. We generated year-over-year core revenue growth of 9%. FX was 230 basis points of headwind to growth. Turning to the geographies. We saw another quarter of strong revenue growth in each of our major regions. North America revenue was up mid-single digits, with growth in all 3 segments. Western Europe revenue grew high single digit with mid-single-digit growth at IOS and AHS and double-digit growth at PT. Asia revenue increased in the 20% range with low 30% growth in China driven by strength in both IOS and PT as we lapped easier prior year comps. Growth in China was partially offset by a high single-digit decline in AHS related to lower electric procedures due to COVID as we expected. Lastly, our high-growth markets together posted strong core growth of almost 20%. Turning to Slide 12. We show operating performance highlights for the first quarter. Adjusted gross margins increased 80 basis points to 58.4%. As Jim mentioned, FBS driven productivity and price realization more than offset inflation, leading to record gross margins in the first quarter, which was complemented by higher volumes. Adjusted operating margins expanded to 100 basis points to 24%, while adjusted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.75, reflecting strong volume conversion, partially offset by higher interest and tax expense. Free cash flow was $150 million. While first quarter is typically our largest free cash flow quarter, receivables were negatively impacted by slower China collections in the quarter, which has since recovered in AHS.  Turning now to the guide on Slide 13. We are raising and narrowing our previous 2023 guidance to reflect outperformance in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we anticipate core revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5% with an FX headwind of approximately 0.5%. Adjusted operating profit margin is expected to increase 3% to 7% with margins in the range of 24.5% to 25%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.78 to $0.82, flat, up 5%, includes higher year-over-year interest and tax expense and free cash flow of approximately $285 million reflects approximately 100% of cash conversion in the quarter. For the full year, we now expect core revenue in the range of 4% to 5.5%, which continues to reflect year-over-year foreign exchange headwind of just under 1 point of revenue. Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 6% to 10%, with margins in the range of 25% to 25.5%. We are increasing our adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $3.29, $3.40, which represents an increase of 4% to 8% and includes higher year-over-year interest and tax expense, as previously expected. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.25 billion, representing conversion in the range of 100% to 105% of adjusted net income and 21% free cash flow margin. Turning to Slide 14. We've consistently said that the Fortive [indiscernible] today is delivering a higher and more profitable growth. There is nowhere that this shows up more than in our free cash flow. Between 2019 and today, we have more than doubled our annual free cash flow, and we expect to continue to further enhance our compounding model with over $5 billion of capacity for M&A, enabling us to continue to invest appropriately in our businesses to further position Fortive for long-term value creation. With that, I'll pass it back to Jim to review our upcoming Investor Day and provide some closing comments. James Lico : Thanks, Chuck. I'll now start to wrap up on Slide 15. Our team is thrilled to be back in New York for our first in-person Investor Day since 2019 to be held on May 25. We are looking forward to highlighting our progress, executing our strategy and the results that has yielded over the last 7 years, building on our strong foundation and enduring principles that underpin our execution capabilities. We will showcase how our businesses have leveraged FBS tools to innovate, take advantage of the secular tailwinds, accelerating progress across our 5 critical customer workflows. This has translated into relevant product innovations helping to solve our customers' toughest safety, quality and productivity challenges and contributing to sustained strong growth for Fortive. In the spirit of setting high expectations, we will set long-term targets. Looking out 3 and 5 years, culminating with the evolution of our strong free cash flow, supporting us ample opportunities to further accelerate our strategy. We are actively fueling our future success by building on the transformation progress and learning that has taken place since our inception, unlocking future value for Fortive.  Wrapping up on Slide 16. The combination of portfolio work we have done and the productivity initiatives we are implementing in the first half of 2023, prepare us for the continuing evolving macro environment and set us up for differentiated performance again in 2024. As you saw in today's press release, we're also continuing to build on our exceptional leadership culture for the Fortive of the future by expanding Tammy Newcombe's responsibilities to include the Advanced Healthcare Solutions segment in addition to our current role as segment leader of Precision Technologies succeeding Pat Murphy, who will retire at the end of the year. As you heard today, FBS is more robust than ever with powerful new capabilities to bring breakthrough innovations to market for our customers faster and drive enhanced business results. The evidence of this is reflected in our strong financial performance, including our free cash flow, the currency we use to measure our success. These factors culminate in the powerful formula for value creation, enabling Fortive to make a real difference in the world and deliver exceptional value to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Elena. Elena Rosman : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Brent, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe the first one, and sorry to be boring and predictable. But the AHS, you gave us some very good detail on that sequential improvement through the year. I guess a couple of things I just wanted to clarify on it. One was maybe the scale of the productivity savings in the second half? Is it sort of $15 million, $20 million, something like that, that you're getting in the AHS EBIT in the back half? And then just trying to make sure we understand the scale of the importance of China for AHS. Is it about sort of 10% of the business. Charles McLaughlin : So Julian, I'll take the first part of that. Productivity, we probably expect to do about $10 million in the first half, and that generally has a 6-month payback. So we'll probably see a like amount in the second half there, annualized is going to be a little -- obviously, a little bit bigger. James Lico : Yes. And on the China aspect, yes, it's about 8% to 10% of the business overall. And as we said in the prepared remarks, maybe a little bit more color there is that we obviously started pretty low in electives in the first part of the quarter in January has got better through the quarter. We exited in around 90. So we'll see a little bit of continued improvement. I think at this point, it's fair to say we sort of see electives as kind of being back to normal going into the second quarter. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then just switching back to the overall product hardware orders. You said those were down about mid-single digits in the first quarter. Is there any sort of interesting movement as you go sort of month to month? And any clues on how you're thinking about the second quarter. And if we look at the Precision Tech business specifically, and I suppose, Tektronix in it. You've had cautious comments perhaps from some companies who might be peers in recent weeks, have you seen anything shift in the market outlook for Tektronix or product hardware within PT? James Lico : Yes. First of all, I think, as we said, the quarter orders for the product businesses came in better than expected. Book-to-bill being one was better than we expected. So what we saw in the quarter was pretty consistent through the quarter. Obviously, the numbers from a year-on-year perspective, get a little bit better simply because of the way China affected those businesses last year. But I think when we look at point of sale, Julian, point-of-sale was good throughout the quarter, and it was good on a global basis at Fluke and tech. So we think those things are good and feel really good about sort of the strength. I think maybe the other highlight is that Fluke grew mid-single-digit orders. We said that in the prepared remarks. But I think that's a highlight for sure.  A little bit of maybe that came out of the second quarter, which quite frankly, I think just derisked the second quarter for us. So I think we feel good about that. So we're certainly out there watching for things, but we feel good about the order trajectory right now. But the 2-year stacks are still very strong. And so sometimes, we've got to be a little careful about that. I would say the last thing is that roughly $350 million of excess backlog that we talked about at the beginning of the year, it still remains intact. So that -- we tried to highlight that on one of the slides relative to the backlog protection. So I think on -- at Fluke Industrial, which is kind of our -- typically the canary in the coal mine, things look still pretty good and really still good, and we still maintain the backlog protection that we went into the start of the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Just back on AHS. I'd just like to deconstruct a little bit more kind of what happened in the quarter. Obviously, it was a very large margin miss. And then just you address it a little bit to Julian's question, but if you think about the climb out into the back half, how much of that is really in your control? You mentioned favorable price. I assume that's kind of in hand the supply chain questions. I just wonder if you could give us a little comfort or confidence that, that, in fact, is resolved and anything else to just give us some visibility on how we get to those numbers in the back half. Charles McLaughlin : Jeff, I'll take the first part of that. There's 3 main things that happen in health in Q1. You mentioned about Fluke health supply chain, that was a hit. FX strengthening dollar is -- it shows up more here in one of our more global businesses. So that was a part of it. And then also just thinking about the mix effect of lower consumables from China as we had COVID really hit maybe a little harder than we thought there in the first part of Q1. Those 3 things are the main reasons we came in short versus our guide for in the health sake. James Lico : Yes, Jeff, I would just say, as we move through the year, really, I think 3 things that are definitely in our control. Number 1 is the productivity. Chuck outlined that on Julian's question, I think, is in hand in that regard and that we're -- we've got that. Number 2 is really around price. We've had 3 quarters now of better price. The trajectory and price continues to be good. And so I think in that sense, we're leaning into that and team has done a great job relative to that principally at ASP, by the way, in that one. And then finally, a little bit better growth, as we said, elective's now normalizing here back to back to normal. And so we see that continuing to improve. We mentioned the go-to-market change that we're making at ASP in North America to go more direct, which really, I think, gives us closer to customer care and really I think, really helps us from the standpoint of really making sure that our sterilizers are running actively. So we think those are certainly things that are within our control well after it. I feel good about the team and the work they're doing. So in that sense, it will get better in the second quarter. And then as we said, it will step into the second half with continued improvement. So -- and I think the other thing that gets missed in AHS was the quality of the quarter in Census and probation. Those businesses are obviously 2 of our higher-margin businesses. You combine that with some of the supply chain fixes that we've got in place at Fluke Health, which is really our highest margin business within how those 3 things are going to continue. So you get the help at ASP, like I just described, you get the continued work at some of the other businesses. I think that really bodes well for continued improvement throughout the year. Jeffrey Sprague : And then totally shifting gears, just PT strategically, right? If I don't know if you're going to end up commenting specifically on NATI, right? But it looks like you were there at or near the alter. You haven't deployed capital there really actually since Danaher bought Tektronix, really, right? and maybe you're on the verge of doing your biggest deal ever by an order of magnitude. So I just wonder if you could frame that up for us what your thinking is or was and maybe the strategic direction of that particular segment in business over time. James Lico : Yes. We've had a couple of small bolt-ons in both sensing and in tech over the years, and those have been helpful to a lot of the success, quite frankly, that we're seeing as an example. Keathley probably being the biggest capital deployment that we did a number of years ago. And that is really obviously a real success for us at tech. That was a little while ago. Since Fortive, if you will, a couple of small bolt-ons in sensing, but not much. I would say, just relative to the NATI process, we won't comment on that. But I want the interest in that from others, certainly, I think, speaks to the story that we've been telling at Tektronix. And you see it in the quarter, you see it in the back quality of the backlog. It's just the attachment of our innovation capability to some of these secular drivers in auto, EV principally as well as in power. And those are, I think, speaks well to the organic strategy and the investment we've made there tech in particular. So I think it's -- as we look forward, one of the things that I think I'd just remind everyone, we had said we had moved tech from a low single digit through the cycle grower to a mid-single-digit grower through the cycle and I think we feel very good about that to the extent that we can find ways to accelerate the capability throughout PT, we'll continue to look for those things. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Charles Tusa : Just on the management shuffling a little bit here. Can you talk about how you came to that decision [indiscernible] a lot of visibility for Tammy. So and there are 2 kind of pretty different businesses. Is that a permanent solution? Or should we expect another step in that evolution? James Lico : Well, I think it's certainly the solution that we feel really good about. I mean I think our talent development process. And if you go back a lot of years, you'd see us ebb and flow a little bit relative to those jobs as well as the jobs below that and Group President and operating company presidents. Our talent development is in, I think, in really a good place. Every one of our group presidents was internally promoted. 80% of our current operating company presidents were internally promoted. So I think when we really feel good about the structure, it's not just what we have at the segment level, but it's within those group presidents and operating company presidents, and we've, quite frankly, never been stronger in that regard. It gives us degrees of freedom to do some things throughout the leadership structure. I would also say that when you sort of look at it, it's pretty balanced from an operating profit perspective and from a just contoured market standpoint. So if we look at the split of responsibilities, yes, 2 segments to 1 segment. But when we look at a served market, ILS has half the served market, profitability is pretty close that ebbs and flows with deals. So I think we're in a very good place relative to the structure that we came to. But in part, it's not just the most senior job. It's also the quality of folks that we have across the board. We had all of our presidents in last week for our quarterly leadership summit with them, and I couldn't be more proud of the work they're doing and quite frankly, where we stand relative to the quality of leadership at the operating businesses. Charles Tusa : And in terms of the portfolio was current, I mean, you guys have done a lot of [indiscernible] over the years. Is there is there a constant [indiscernible] you seem to be have been subtracted, I guess, in the portfolio. But are you, in any way, shape or form still kind of evaluating things there for maybe divestitures or spins or anything like that? I mean I'm thinking really Tektronix, especially in the context of what's just happened here in the last several weeks with Emerson and Nate. James Lico : Well, I think -- you broke up a little bit, but I think at the end, I think we got it. So I think when we look at the 3 segments we have today, the quality of businesses we have, the execution that's going on, we feel good. So I think, certainly, the Nate process, if you will, ending with Emerson doesn't really change the market structure. We feel good about what we're doing at tech and we'll continue to run the play there that we think is really good. And that's obviously a part of our success right now is the strong execution that we've had at Tektronix over the last several years. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : I know there's just so much you can say about NATI, but it was, I think, as Greg said, kind of a pretty darn big deal versus kind of your history, is there anything that we should be taking away as far as your willingness to make bigger bets? Was this kind of a one-off unique? I know the gross margin structure was pretty attractive. But I think historically, you guys have generally looked at assets coming out of PE or pieces of assets coming out of bigger companies, but not necessarily looked at buying other public companies is really a big part of the M&A strategy. Has that changed at all, Jim and Chuck or is this -- or should we not read too much into this. James Lico : I think -- and we'll have a real opportunity as well to talk about this in May at the investor conference. But I think the $40 billion roughly of served market that we have today, kind of when we look at the M&A opportunities funnel, if you will, we've always talked about breadth and depth, breadth, meaning all 3 segments, operating companies, ability to accelerate strategy, depth mini size, and you're exactly right. What we've done is the deals sort of in the middle and a few -- some bolt-ons in the lower part of that if you were to think of that as a triangle. So with the bigger deals at the top, and there's fewer of those. So that's always going to be the case. I won't speak specifically to any one company or process in any way, shape or form. But what's not going to -- what never changes is the fact that we're going to continue to scan the landscape for opportunity to accelerate strategy. We're going to be disciplined about what we do.  We're going to look for outstanding financial opportunities to continue to build the portfolio the way we have. And I think our 2022 performance speaks to the quality of that, and I think our first quarter speaks to that. So that's what we're going to continue to do. And I think that when we talk about breadth and depth, that means there's a variety of different kinds of opportunities. But most opportunities are always going to fall in the sort of bolt-on and mid-tier opportunities simply because there's a lot more of them. And we're looking to accelerate strategy in a few different businesses, and that's where those opportunities are. Scott Davis : Fair enough, Jim. And just to clear something up. What was the Fluke Health supply chain issue? I don't recall hearing an explanation on that. James Lico : It's one of the things, and maybe more broadly, I think we handled our supply chain challenges. We've said we're kind of down to those sort of one-off issues that occurred through the portfolio. The fact that we did 50% more organic revenue in the quarter speaks to the quality of the teamwork we had around Fortive to deal with those challenges really, really well. But we did get caught on a couple of what we call our quality assurance equipment business in Fluke Biomet, literally 1 component that we were shorted and we'll clean that up in the second quarter. So we feel good about the work we're doing, quite frankly. Supply chain challenges are down to what often is called the golden screw. But there are a few of those, but I think we're doing an outstanding job more broadly when you look at the -- when you not only look at the core growth in the quarter, but also the 80 basis points of gross margin expansion, which I think quite frankly, I think is going to stand up well against most people. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question as I'm sort of looking at the sequential guidance for IOS and PT growth and looking at the comps. Just trying to figure out, it seems there is a step change down. And I apologize if I missed it, but I was just wondering, you also commented that the order book looks good, March looks good. So why this step down? And I was wondering specifically if there was some sort of clearing out of things in the backlog was sort of the golden screw becoming available or is there something else happening? Because you guys certainly don't sound particularly more pessimistic about the macro into the second quarter. Charles McLaughlin : Andrew, I'll take that. The biggest thing is really what happened last year. It's really the comp. If you remember, Shanghai was shut down at the end of Q1 and a lot of that revenue showed up in Q2. So when you -- if you adjust for that comp actually Q1 and Q2 look pretty similar from what we're doing this year. If you interrogate on the 2-year stacks, you actually start to see some acceleration even into the second half. Yes. So you're right. We think came in on balance better than we expected in Q1, and we're optimistic moving forward. Andrew Obin : Okay. Got you. But you're sort of saying take a look at a 2-year stack as opposed to 1-year stack. Charles McLaughlin : I'm also saying look at the first half this year versus the first half last year, there was a lot of revenue missing in Q1 that showed up in Q2. So it's really a tough comp. But if you look at that, you really see that shutdown that happened in the last week of Q1 of last year is really what explains most of what you're talking about. Andrew Obin : Okay. I'll take it offline. But can I just have a question on probation. Did we hear that right that the SaaS version is 3x revenue uplift and how fast is the SaaS conversion going? And what's the SaaS versus license mix? James Lico : Yes. We -- you did hear it right, we're at about 3x right now. We would expect the early migrations to be maybe slightly a little bit higher than maybe what the downstream ones. But we're actually ahead of the game on new bookings relative to the SaaS. So that's good. So we're all up, just probation, things are better. We thought '22 was better than expected and we started the year off well. So we are seeing a little bit of extended discussions with customers, I would say. And maybe more broadly, there are certainly in the software world. There's a little bit more funnel activity, things sitting in the funnel a little bit longer just given maybe how typical start of the year, but we still have good confidence in the projections we have for what we have in software. We had a very good ARR quarter, and we feel good more broadly about software in general. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just going to dig in a little bit on implied second half for PT, especially with the backlog holding up really well here in the first quarter. It looks like volumes would be kind of flat, maybe even down. Now I know the comp gets a little longer there, but just trying to triangulate the book-to-bill still being good with the basically kind of no growth second half. James Lico : Yes. It's really about the 2-year stacks. We have really accelerated growth in PT in the second half of last year, Josh. So it's I think we -- as we said, the book-to-bill coming in the quarter is better. So you may say maybe that slightly derisked the second half a little bit. But it really is -- we will see a little bit more growth in the second half in PT on absolute terms, but it's really the comps. We really see continued -- really continued performance relative to the market going first half to second half for sure. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the order intake. Again, I know you're surprised that the book-to-bill was won in the quarter. But any sort of rightsizing of the order book as lead times start to improve a little bit, customers basically just saying, look, I still want everything, but now that it's not as urgent, was there any kind of air pocket pushout that you see as a function of that? James Lico : No. I mean I think what we've seen is point of sales remain strong. Some of that, particularly at Tektronix is probably the backlog coming down, but we still have that excess backlog, which is really customer demand, it's not inventory is still very much in demand from customers. So at tech, in particular, we have very little distributor inventory or channel inventory, if you will. So we feel good about the demand being actual demand or the backlog having actual demand to it. So we haven't seen those air pockets yet. And we continue to watch -- we have a watchful eye just given what we see in the macro and those kinds of things. But so far, the demand is real and point of sale stayed strong. And that point of sale stay strong on a global basis. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : I want to circle back on the Page 5, the concept about backlog protected, and it came up in Julian's question, too, is it was my sense that some of this backlog build, the excess or outside backlog, like Fluke, short cycle wouldn't typically see much in the way of backlog, but you've got it now. To me, that seems it's more transitory, a supply chain heel that will come down -- so how much of this backlog protected would be transitory by definition? Or you just think there's a certain amount that carries through each year on the kind of book and ship over a couple of quarters? James Lico : Yes, it's a great question. I think number one is, if we take Fluke in the industrial business, we don't have a huge amount of excess backlog in that business. Point-of-sale remains strong. And I think what we're seeing is just continued good execution from the Fluke team. The back -- the sort of backlog protected on that slide is mostly a Tek and in sensing. And in Tek, I think it's we don't anticipate that excess even burning down this year, Deane. So I would say in some respects, we're probably going to run with excess backlog in perpetuity. And I think in both cases, it's really about the secular drivers that exist that we've really tried to build the business around. We're seeing better performance as an example, in Western Europe. And I think that's really because of the sustainability, electric vehicles, the power -- a lot of the grid upgrades, some of those things, those investments are very much happening in Europe, and we're taking advantage of those opportunities. So we like the durability, if you will, of the backlog. Some of it is excess, and that's why we call it that way. And some of it is a little bit of in precision relative to what it will be like long term. But we do see when we interrogate that backlog on a pretty regular basis, we like the durability of it, the resiliency of it pretty because of the secular drivers that we listed on the right side of that page. So we think we're in a better position for the year because of the strategic moves we've made over the last few years relative to those secular drivers. Deane Dray : Great. That was really helpful. And then just as a follow-up, and I might have missed this. Did you comment on carryover pricing benefits and whether you plan any further pricing actions over the near term? Charles McLaughlin : Yes, Deane, this is Chuck. We had about 4.5% price in Q1. Much of that is carryover. But we continue to be active at we still got inflation coming out. So maybe it won't be as high, I would expect that inflation is going to moderate from the rate set increases from last year, but there's still inflation coming out. And so we'll still be deploying price as we go through the year. James Lico : The other thing that we continue to see opportunity for is the FBS tools related to price. We still see even the price that we put into the marketplace, still opportunities to realize that price at a higher rate, Deane. So we're going to continue to do the things Chuck just described. And as we mentioned earlier, health will continue to improve price, which we feel good about so. But it's also the realization. And I think this is -- we've always had good realization, as you know, knowing us for a long time. But I think our ability to continue to do that and apply FBS to that is something that we'll continue to do throughout the year, even in places where maybe we don't put as much into the marketplace, we're going to continue to work on the price realization. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So I want to go back to Tammy taken leadership at AHS. Jim, are you looking for a change in the way that HS is management. I have no idea what that means, it's bono question, but if you think about accelerating growth or improving the consistency of the margin performance, supply chain, et cetera, are there things that Tammy can bring to bear from the time running Tektronix that can actually improve AHS. James Lico : Yes. I think any time we get a new leadership into a role like that, Nigel, we see a new set of eyes and that always is a good thing. When we hired Olumide a few years ago, I think we got a new set of eyes on IOS, and you're seeing that quality of performance play out in IOS right now. He's brought some new skill sets to the role has done some things over the last year that you've had health that are definitely sticking and Tammy will bring the same thing. That's the expectation. And I think we benefit from sometimes those new perspectives. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then just going back to the whole kind of Nate situation. If you think about what Nate might have given you, if you had bought that business, are there things you can do organically to accomplish those things maybe on a longer-term basis. But you've done -- obviously, you've done a good job of extending the kind of the vertical markets that [indiscernible] time. But other things you can do to extend down into the more the validation and maybe the production phases of your customers -- or the other bolt-ons you can do, yes. James Lico : I would say, regardless of the process, our strategic thinking around tech has been very focused on the secular drivers, not to bear too much repeating on that. But it's been around changing the vertical focus, as you know, well, and that's played out. And some of that has been innovation efforts that we would certainly look to add to if opportunities become available. So we would never say never to -- but that doesn't really change anything that relative to what's been going on in the external environment. That's why we do strategic plans every year. That's why we really kind of come with a different emphasis every year. And we feel good about the strategy at tech and to the extent that we've got bolt-on opportunities there as well as any of the other businesses that we have, we're always going to be looking at those opportunities to accelerate strategy into the markets. As an example, we would power is a good example. We would love to do more in power. If we found an M&A opportunity that is that, we would certainly look at it. [indiscernible] is a good example, although it was a few years ago. It's really extended our ability to do some things relative to power and we're bearing the benefits of the fruits of that work today. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim, can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing by region? I know you mentioned you expect China to slow a bit, but it's continued to be really strong for Fortive. I think -- last quarter, you said Western Europe might grow a little more slowly, but you just mentioned some secular trends holding up well in Europe. So you would you say these trends are proving more durable than you originally thought? And do you see an extended CapEx cycle in the U.S. from trends such as electrification and onshoring? James Lico : Yes. It's -- I definitely think China will slow. We've had so many good years of China. And obviously, we just posted a 30% kind of quarter. It was probably going to stand up pretty well. So I think in ad sense, we got -- we'll digest some of that growth here through the year. But I would expect China to slow in the second half a little bit, particularly because of the tough as well as tough comps. It's part of that tougher comp conversation we had relative to the segments. I think Western Europe is holding up for the reasons I said. Broader Europe has slowed a little bit. And so that's in the context of everything that we've got in the guide is the expectation that probably Central and Eastern Europe is a little slower. Some of that having to do with the war. Some of it obviously has to do with us getting out of Russia. But it's also just a little bit of slowing. But the Western European investment in a few countries has held up pretty well. I still expect North America to be a good region for us, partly because our software and a lot of our durability is in North America. I think when we -- it's probably still too early to tell to be very specific. But my expectation probably when we get to the end of the year is that North America probably is the most durable of all the regions. Andrew Kaplowitz : Helpful Jim and I wanted to ask an AHS question maybe in a different way. You mentioned China letter procedures at 90% in March. Maybe a little bit faster improvement from where you started the quarter and you did mention overall consumables better in March. I know Invetech is still somewhat weak, which I think is still somewhat difficult comparisons versus during the pandemic. But do you think by the second half of '23 that maybe normalization from the pandemic actually happens, whether it's improved staff in at your customers, better consumables for you or improve [indiscernible] just the market around you change. James Lico : Yes, we do. I mean we even saw some green shoots in March, quite frankly, in the U.S. consumables as an example, which had good growth. So Yes, we think the -- you're exactly right. We think the second -- it's going to start to get a little weird still comparing to 2019 here by the time. So I think as we get into the second half, I think we'd probably say our bet right now is it's normalized. There'll still be labor shortages. If you recall back in our start of the year call, we said, \"Hey, we thought '23 would be better than '22. '24 would be better than '23.\" And I think some of that continues. That's going to continue through the year and our self-help is going to get better as well. as I said earlier in the call. So I think the combination of things getting a little better in the marketplace as well as our self-help start to see the traction of that. I'm confident we'll start to see the benefits of those things playing out in the second quarter and then into the second half. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joseph Giordano : So on the pie chart that you have for revenue where you have like the backlog protected that Deane was referencing earlier. Just curious like the biggest piece of that is recurring ex software. Just like if we go into like a more like a real recession, how recurring is that business in a good time versus how recurring is it in a bad time is there slippage as customers get tighter with their wallet? James Lico : I think it holds up pretty well. I think, number one, there's a couple of big pieces in there, right? Consumables at ASP is a big piece. iNet our EMC businesses in there, which is long-term contracts. So we've got a number of -- and of course, broadly defined services, so though it should hold up well. And we feel good about -- it held up very well in the first quarter as an example with really good growth. So you combine that with software and then even the healthcare hardware. We've got a good portion of the portfolio that we think is really resilient. You combine that with roughly 25% of our hardware nonrecurring, which is backlog protected, we feel pretty good. And as I mentioned earlier, the secular drivers in the entire product side also provide some -- another good insurance policy here. So we're -- we've really run the playbook that we've talked about so many times. We're prepared for a number of scenarios. We took some restructuring earlier productivity initiatives earlier in the year, as you know. We've upped that as well. So we feel like we're building scenarios around what could happen. It's hard to predict the future. But the portfolio was developed many -- over the years, in most cases, to deal with a lot of these challenges, and we think we're well prepared for. Joseph Giordano : Fair enough. And then just to follow up on the discussion about the cyclical businesses. And so like IOS and PT, both came in quarter ahead pretty solidly ahead of what you suggested in your guidance for 1Q and the full year guidance on the growth side are pretty much the same, a little bit bump in one, but pretty much the same. Now how should we think about that? Is it kind of lower view of the second half? Or like you mentioned the backlog is totally high. So just curious how we should interpret that. James Lico : Yes. I think the first half doesn't change all that much. Chuck kind of talked about that a little bit. But I think you think about derisking the second half. It's a little bit of derisking. And if things continue to play out as positive as they have, there might be some opportunity. But I think right now, let's see how things play out. But as we said on a 2-year stack, the hardware business, the product businesses do get a little bit better given the tougher comps in the second half. But where we stand today, I think we -- I think most people would be envious of the start that we had for the year, and we feel good about that. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Lico. James Lico : Thanks, Brent, and thanks, everyone, for taking the time today. We know it's a busy schedule for all of you. We appreciate the questions. We certainly appreciate the interest. I hope from the words from Chuck and I, you heard as well as the prepared remarks, and hopefully, the presentation was helpful was helpful as well. We're off to a good start. We feel good about it. There is certainly some uncertainty out there in a number of ways. We feel well prepared for it. We'll look forward to the follow-up questions, I can give you more color on that to the extent we can be helpful. We're really looking forward to sharing our story more longer term at our investor conference. We think it's an opportunity for us to really demonstrate a lot of the things we've talked about today relative to how that plays out, the strength of -- in addition to not only the strength of the financials, but also the strength of the strategy, which really continues to help us. We had a great 2022. We think it's also going to help us post a good '23. We look forward to seeing you soon. Thanks, everyone. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Fortive Corporation's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Elena Rosman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rosman, you may begin your conference. Elena Rosman : Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's earnings call. With us today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by Regulation G are available on the Investors section of our website at fortive.com. Our statements on period-to-period increases or decreases refer to year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise specified. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. Information regarding these risk factors is available in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Lico : Thanks Elena. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin on Slide 3. Our second quarter results once again demonstrated the durability of our portfolio, and the strength of our execution, allowing us to deliver higher core growth, margins, earnings, and free cash flow. Core revenue growth of 5.5% reinforces that our strategy is working, building leading positions across our customers' critical connected workflows with performance reinforcing the resilience of our transformed portfolio. We also delivered record margins in the second quarter, expanding adjusted gross margins by 250 basis points to 59.5% and an adjusted operating margin by 190 basis points to 26%. We're converting more revenue to earnings and more earnings to cash, with 9% growth in adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow in the quarter. Our ability to consistently drive off performance is directly tied to our culture of continuous improvement and dedication to the port of business system. Our mandate this year to unleash FBS, which is driving record productivity from Kaizen activity across the enterprise, and increasing our confidence in our raised outlook for the year that we believe further positions Fortive for accelerated compounding in 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 4. I wanted to provide an update on what we are seeing and what we are expecting over the course of the rest of the year. Starting with health care, industry recovery is on track as labor and productivity challenges continue to moderate. We are seeing traction on our pricing and productivity initiatives, yielding sequential growth and profitability in the second quarter. We expect further improvement in AHS in the second half with higher core growth and operating margins. We also continue to drive growth in our software and services businesses with SaaS revenue up mid-teens on strong enterprise growth and bookings. Hardware products have also been running ahead of expectations as traction on new product launches and leveraged to secular drivers are helping to provide more backlog to buffer the normalization of industrial demand. As we sit here today, we now expect to have over $200 million of excess backlog heading into next year, well positioning us for 2024. Our strategy to create a more durable growth company is working. Our recurring revenue businesses are expected to accelerate first half to second, led by higher software and consumables growth. Combined with favorable pricing and discrete productivity initiatives, we now expect over 125 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the year. Lastly, our robust free cash flow and low leverage profile provides further flexibility to accelerate compounding with an attractive funnel of M&A opportunities aligned to our workflow strategy. Turning to Slide 5. Our success in the quarter demonstrates our ability to leverage our domain expertise and hardware and accelerate software and data analytics across our five customer connected workflows, where we are enabling progress in a number of high-impact fields. All benefiting from customer investments in automation and digitization, the energy transition and the need for productivity solutions to address labor, manufacturing, inflation and regulatory challenges globally. For example, solar energy is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources worldwide. From the grid to hybrid and backup systems connected reliability solutions are ensuring the maintenance and efficiency of critical infrastructure, enabling the energy transition and IoT expansion. Environmental health and safety solutions are safeguarding workers and enabling customers ESG reporting and compliance. Our leading facility and asset life cycle software applications are improving asset performance, optimizing workplaces and accelerating customer productivity efforts. Our innovations in the product realization workflow are solving customers' toughest technical challenges, the speed breakthroughs in a wide range of applications including helping to increase the proliferation of electrified and connected devices and advance the democratization of high-performance compute and AI-driven data analytics as well as in the perioperative loop, where we're helping health care providers deliver exceptional patient care more efficiently, with industry-leading clinical safety and productivity solutions. In summary, we are seeing strong customer success on new product launches, highly aligned to these secular trends where our innovation funnels remain focused, which I'll take a moment to discuss further on Slide 6. As we highlighted at our Investor Day in May, our FBS growth tools are accelerating innovation cycles to drive share gains and maximize R&D returns to create and sustain our competitive advantage in a number of exciting new areas. For example, we highlighted new product launches at Fluke to accelerate the distributed energy strategy and penetrate the high-growth EV storage equipment market with new testing tools that ensure technicians safety and asset performance. At Gordian, our unique planning tools, RS means data and technical expertise helped the California County optimize their infrastructure resulting in millions of yearly cost savings and a significant reduction in project completion time lines. Tektronix is providing performance scopes and wave form generators to help customers develop quantum computing to advance AI applications, including a large aerospace and defense customer win in the quarter. Provation's latest cloud-based documentation software is saving physicians roughly 16 hours per month in documentation and reporting which is why Provation continues to be the provider of choice with accelerated win rates and apex adoption. Lastly, Intelex leverage lean portfolio management to expand its foothold in environmental accounting, compliance and reporting. Accelerating the launch of its new ESG corporate reporting solution. Fortive is committed to innovation across all aspects of the company. And this quarter, we received two notable recognitions for our innovative sustainability efforts. In May, USA Today and Statista have named Fortive, one of America's climate leaders in 2023. This award recognizes us as a leader in greenhouse gas emissions reductions and singled out Fortive as a top emissions reducer among more than 2,000 companies nationwide. And in June, Fortive was selected as a finalist for the 2023 World Sustainability Awards in the profit with a purpose category which recognized as companies that link revenue generation to sustainability. We're incredibly proud of our culture of innovation and continuous improvement and how that not only shows up in the solutions we deliver for our customers but also in the positive impact we are making around the world. I'll now provide more details on each of our three segments, beginning with Intelligent Operating Solutions on Slide 7. IOS grew core revenue by 4%, driven by good growth in most regions. Strong FBS driven execution resulted in 420 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Driving operating margins to a record 33%. Looking at our performance drivers by workflow and connected reliability, Fluke core revenues were up slightly, lapping the Shanghai recovery last year with mid-single-digit orders growth in the quarter. Fluke margins expanded by more than 300 basis points year-over-year, driven by productivity initiatives and solid price realization, eMaint saw record quarterly bookings, fueled by the continued success of the new X5 CMMS product launch. EHS revenues grew by high single digits with record iNet growth at ISC and strong SaaS momentum in Intelex. Further, Intelex saw strong bookings for its new ESG corporate reporting solution. Moving to facilities and asset life cycle. We had low double-digit growth in the second quarter, driven by mid-teens SaaS growth. Gordian had strong growth and operating margin expansion in the quarter as more customers utilize their job order contracting platform to procure and manage their large infrastructure projects. [Inaudible] is seeing sustained improvements in win rates and good growth in their streamlined portfolio, supported by FBS-led innovation and pipeline generation efforts. Service channel had an acceleration in growth and profitability as planned, driven by strong SaaS bookings and resulting take rate as customers leverage the service channel network to maximize their cost savings to large retail customer is already $2 million ahead of their $14 million cost savings goal in 2023 after taking advantage of the automation capabilities of the platform, powerful testament to the secular drivers underpinning the FAL workflow strategy. Turning now to Slide 8. Precision Technologies continued its momentum with another strong quarter with 8% core revenue growth and 190 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion reflecting volume and price benefits more than offsetting inflation in FX. Some highlights in the quarter include record second quarter revenue at Tektronix with orders better than expectations and strong point of sale in all major regions. The team delivered mid-teens growth, which was over 20% on a two-year stack basis in the second quarter. Tektronix is executing on robust backlog and power and digital test and measurement solutions and delivering outstanding margin, operating margin expansion. As orders continue to normalize, we anticipate Tektronix growth will moderate to mid-single-digit levels in the second half, and we expect we will end the year with elevated backlog levels again heading into 2024. Sensing technologies came in better than expected, up slightly driven by strong price realization across all businesses and continued broad strength at Qualitrol. Lastly, Pacific Scientific EMC reported a strong sales quarter with mid-teens growth as it benefits from strong customer demand and Kaizen activity to improve manufacturing capacity and operational execution to deliver on record backlog. Moving now to Slide 9, in Advanced Healthcare Solutions. Core revenues were up 4% in the second quarter as the industry continues its modest pace of recovery. Consistent with expectations, adjusted operating profit margins contracted by 60 basis points year-over-year. The benefits of sequential volume, price and productivity drove operating margins higher by 180 basis points versus the first quarter. China electric procedures remained at normalized levels throughout the quarter, only slightly trailing global rates, allowing for double-digit growth. Our outlook continues to assume that electric procedures remain close to pre-COVID levels in all major regions. Some highlights for the quarter include, ASP/Censis had mid-single-digit core growth, driven by capital expansion at ASP and double-digit SaaS growth at Censis. ASP saw sequential growth in consumables as planned and U.S. channel transition to direct is on track, contributing to sequential price benefits, driving margins higher, a trend we will expect will continue through the rest of the year. Supply chain constraints are largely resolved, yielding good growth at Fluke Health Solutions and Provation had another great quarter with mid-teens core revenue growth, driven by Apex SaaS adoption and new logos. With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will provide more color on our second quarter financials and our 2023 outlook. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with a quick recap of our second quarter revenue performance. We generated year-over-year revenue growth of 4% with core growth of 5.5%. FX was a 90 basis point headwind to growth. Turning to the geographies. North America revenue grew high single digits with growth in all three segments. Western Europe revenue was essentially flat in the quarter, following mid-teens growth the prior year. Asia revenue grew mid-single digits with over 20% growth in Japan and India and low single-digit growth in China. We saw strength in healthcare in China. As expected, however, growth was muted by COVID reopening tailwinds that benefited the hardware products revenue in the second quarter of 2022. Looking ahead, we continue to expect China growth to moderate in the second half as we lap outsized growth in prior years. Turning to Slide 11. We show operating performance highlights in the second quarter. As Jim mentioned earlier, adjusted gross margins increased 250 basis points to a record 59.5% driven by volume, FBS initiatives and strong price realizations, which more than offset higher inflation. Adjusted operating profit margins expanded 190 basis points to 26%, another Fortive record, reflecting higher gross margins and productivity initiatives that have started to gain track in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.85 despite higher year-over-year interest and tax expense. Free cash flow was $300 million, which reflects approximately 100% free cash flow conversion. A testament to our working capital efficiency enabled by the Fortive businesses. Turning now to the guidance on Slide 12. We are raising our previous 2023 guidance to reflect the outperformance in the second quarter. Starting with the third quarter, we expect core growth of 3.5% to 4.5% and with revenues reflecting our normal linear profile and adjusted operating profit margins are estimated to be up over 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.85 in Q3 and reflect a 17% estimated effective tax rate. Our fourth quarter guidance assumes a seasonal uplift in all segments with core revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5% year-over-year and strong margin expansion, reflecting the cumulative benefits of our productivity initiatives. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.94 to $0.97, up 7% to 10%. For the full year 2023, we have raised our core revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 6%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected to increase 10% to 11% with margins higher in the range of 25.5% to 26%. We are increasing our adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $3.36 to $3.42, which includes approximate $0.06 headwind from higher interest and tax expense versus the prior guidance. Free cash flow for the year is now expected to be approximately $1.26 billion. This represents conversion of 105% of adjusted net income and 21% free cash flow margin as well as over 30% growth on a two-year stack basis. With that, I'll pass it back to Jim to provide some closing remarks. Jim Lico : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start to wrap up on Slide 13. At our Investor Day in May, we highlighted our progress executing our strategy over the last several years, building on our strong foundation and enduring principles that underpin our unique and compelling culture. Talk about the operating rigor and leverage of FBS growth tools to innovate and enhance leading positions across our three segments and five connected workflows contributing to outstanding fundamental financial performance. Since 2019, we have doubled our core growth rate and delivered more than 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion per year, driven predominantly by higher gross margins. We've driven double-digit earnings, annual earnings per share growth, converting working capital as a percent of sales, nearly in half, allowing for us to run our businesses more efficiently and contributing to more than double free cash flow generation over the period. We are now generating 50% more free cash flow per dollar of revenue, which is a testament to our portfolio transformation and the power of FBS, fueling our current and future success and with a $60 billion served market, we have substantial runway to accelerate growth organically and inorganically. Wrapping up on Slide 14, the combination of portfolio work we have done, the rigor of the Fortive Business System and the development of leadership capability around the world is driving better-than-expected growth and operating performance in 2023 despite a continued evolving macro environment. As a result, we've raised our outlook for the year. And as we look ahead to 2024 and beyond, we are confident in our ability to accelerate our progress. With a high-quality portfolio of desirable brands, segment strategies favorably aligned to sustainable secular trends, industry-leading margins and free cash flow and best-in-class execution. Fortive is poised to deliver exceptional earnings and free cash flow compounding in the years to come. Our attractive funnel of bolt-on and adjacent M&A opportunities across our three segments, five connected workflows drives upside, making Fortive a more durable, high-growth cash flow compounder and a premier company delivering exceptional value to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Elena. Elena Rosman : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Rob, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good day, everyone. Can we just drill a little deeper into tech? Just want to clarify what you said about orders. So orders decel but were stronger than expected. And I guess you're talking about backlog being pretty healthy. So are you actually running at a book-to-bill above 1 in tech? Jim Lico : Hey, Jeff, it's Jim. A couple of things. One, I think it was better than expected. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've seen some slowing in some places, obviously, or maybe more moderating for sure, places like China as an example, but we're seeing some acceleration in investments from places like aerospace to defense customers. So the book-to-bill -- I think our orders were down about 10% in the second quarter. But to put it in some context, it's up, those orders are still up 30% from three years ago. So we're still seeing good demand here. And the backlog is actually above our expectations. We've talked about that excess backlog, and that backlog today is above expectations to what we thought going into the year. So anyway, I'll stop there and if you have any follow-up. Jeff Sprague : No, I'll just switch gears to AHS then. On the channel distribution shift that sounds like -- I don't know if you viewed it as a hump, but maybe kind of the risk of any kind of leakage during the transition would have happened in this quarter. Is that fair? And then you've got kind of a bit clearer sailing on how things play out over the balance of the year? Jim Lico : Yes. We're really pleased with the performance of ASP in the quarter. As we said, we had really strong capital placements which bodes well for the rest of the year and obviously into the future given the consumables. Our project, what we call Elevate is on track, and it certainly was a headwind in the second quarter, but nothing that we didn't plan for. So I think when you look at it mid-single-digit growth, even better than that ex Russia, exit out of Russia. So really a strong performance from a growth perspective in the quarter, and we think really as we kind of play out the rest of the year, we're going to see continued performance there just given the work we've done and given that headwind from elevate ], really, there's a little bit in the third, and then it really goes away completely in the fourth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hye, guys. Just wanted to follow up on the AHS question. It looks like the margin was tweaked lower just adding up the quarters. I think like maybe 50 basis points below that 24% you had talked about at your Investor Day. Maybe just a little bit of a more shallow recovery in second half, but still earning strong in the fourth quarter. Just curious, as we kind of look out to next year, on the way to that 30% margin, I just wonder obviously reaffirm that. And do you like step up to more of a linear move from what you thought this year would be and kind of capture that next year in the margin? Or are we just kind of like a little bit of a shallower inflection on the way to that 30%? I'm just trying to figure out if '24 is kind of like a more linear year considering '23 is a little bit below expectations? Charles McLaughlin : Yes, Steve, this is Chuck. I think the change this year in terms of the guidance is it's Invetech being a little bit lower than we expected in Q2. As far as moving forward, we note the sequential improvements that you talk about here and then that's with -- as COVID comes off and self-help with some of the productivity initiatives and also seeing more price. As you look into next year, well, we're not calling next year, but we expect to still have those tailwinds around COVID and pricing. And I think sequentially, it'd be above the margin expansion that we normally would expect. We talked about mid-single digit and 75 basis points, it will be elevated from that, but we're not going to get to 30% next year, but we're going to continue to make progress and have good margin expansion through next year, and you'll see it as the electric procedures recover, we will expect that to continue to be a tailwind for quite a while. Steve Tusa : Yes. I guess my question was more along the lines of like is next year -- should we view next year as kind of a plot in a linear, from a linear perspective on the way to that 30%? Or is it -- does what happen this year kind of make that target more back-end loaded to maybe '25, '26, '27 type time period. That was my question is '24 more of a nice recovery year early on? Or is it more back-end loaded to that 30%? Charles McLaughlin : I don't think the back-end loaded much, it's not back-end loaded. I think you're going to see good progress towards that. And because I think we're going to see stronger top line. I would just add, I mean, when you look at the trajectory now, we already have -- when you look at Provation, when you look at Fluke health, when you look at the Censis part of our sterilization business. Those are already plus 30% operating profit businesses. So the growth trajectory of ASP is really what we're talking about. And when you think about it, I mean the fact that we -- what we did in the quarter relative to placements going to accelerate consumables in '24, consumables coming back. And I think our launch pad here, I don't want to get too ahead of our skis, but we took a good step forward in the second quarter relative to margins for health. Steve Tusa : Yes, totally. And then just one last one. Where is the $350 million today? You had $350 million of excess you say it's going to be $200 million or something at the end of the year. Where is the 3 -- where is that number today at the end of the 2Q? Steve Tusa : So about 300 -- we still have about $330 million of excess at this point. Steve Tusa : All right. I'll round that up to $350 million. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : Good morning out there, Jim and Chuck and Elena. The IOS margins up 400 basis points on pretty limited volume is impressive, of course. But -- what -- is that sustainable? I mean, it sounds like it's sustainable given your guidance and such, but will -- is there any risk that some of that price cost spread that you're capturing right now perhaps goes the other direction on you in the next 12 months or so? Jim Lico : No, I think there's a couple of things going on. As you said, I think we had really -- I think it speaks to the power of what we've been trying to do in IOS as we continue to accelerate, obviously, acquisitions that we made several years ago, FAL did exceptionally well, our EH&F. So you're seeing the margin improvements from those businesses, Fluke while little slower in the quarter, still very strong in the year and it's obviously been a perennial good margin improver. So I think you probably won't see 400 basis points every quarter. That's probably a little strong. But I think it just speaks to the fact that the work we've been doing over the last few years to really get the entire segment up. And I think the second quarter was a good view of what the potential is in the entire segment. Scott Davis : Okay. That makes sense, Jim. Now I want to just follow up on Steve a little bit here on this one. But the comment on the Slide, I just lost the Slide, but that said pockets of industrial slowing. Can you parse out what part of that might be inventory destock versus kind of real sell-through demand that could be leaking a bit? Jim Lico : Yes. I think what we -- a couple of things maybe. In PT, as we think about the entire segment, the book-to-bill is about 1.0 for the year. That's better than we thought. So year-to-date, we thought we'd be about 0.9, we're at 1.0. So I think what we've seen is better orders in the year than we anticipated, obviously, on stronger growth on the revenue side. What we have seen in Sensing in particular is parts of Sensing are doing really well. Qualitrol is executing very well. We think Anderson-Negele is going to be good through the year, parts of the rest of Sensing. But we are seeing some slowing in industrial businesses, particularly in Europe with some automation customers. We're seeing some slowing in places like HVAC with some OEM customers, mostly on the OEM side and Sensing is what that comment really has to do and also in some of the semiconductor business, parts of the business are Sensing. So that's the slowing. And we would anticipate -- this is kind of nothing different than we originally thought would happen. But that's kind of what we're seeing right now and what we anticipate will continue through the sort of second half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good day, everybody. Wanted to circle back on this concept of the excess backlog, and I know you just sized it. But just be interested, I know there's the implied earnings visibility that you get from elevated backlog, but can you share with us some thoughts about the flexibility within the backlog? Like let's say, something happens, whether it's supply chain or customer readiness, how much flexibility do you have to immediately just draw down the next in line on the backlog and have that kind of seamlessly flow through to the P&L? Because when we hear excess backlog, we immediately think there's flexibility, but sometimes it may not be as flexible based upon customer timing and so forth. But any color there would be helpful. Jim Lico : Yes. A couple of things, Deane. So as Chuck said, we've got about -- the excess backlog is higher than we anticipated at the start of the year. It's about $330 million. We'll probably get that down in the $200 million range by the end of the year. And it's -- I would call it, it kind of depends. But if we were to think about half of that excess is at Tektronix, that's relatively flexible and has been -- I wouldn't say within a month, it's necessarily flexible because it does have some supply chain aspects to it. But it's -- in the sort of 90 days kind of time frame pretty flexible. Sensing a little bit less, depends on some of the OEM customers, so and Fluke pretty flexible. So I would say that's kind of where it stands. And that's why we think it is a good insurance policy relative to slowing, and that's what you saw in the second quarter, right? You saw us get a little bit more backlog out. EMC was a little stronger as well than we anticipated. And so those are places where we think we can use the backlog in a way that sort of prevents any near-term challenges. And also maybe just to add on to the Scott question because I didn't answer the destocking piece. We're really not seeing a lot of destocking or de-booking, very little, pretty much around our normal numbers, which is pretty small. We see some rescheduling of backlog on the OEM side in Sensing. That's why Sensing is a little slower in the second half than maybe the rest of the portfolio but we really haven't seen destocking. We haven't asked distributors really not asking to cancel orders or anything like that. That's been pretty minimal to the point. That's why we think the backlog remains flexible. Deane Dray : All right. On behalf of Scott, I'll thank you for the destocking answer. And then my follow-up, just any color on the excess of 20% in India and Japan. Is that a comp issue? Is there anything specific on the business side you call out? Jim Lico : Yes, it's a little bit of a comp thing on the Japan side. We'll still see, I think, high single-digit growth in Japan, the remaining part of the year, but certainly a little bit of a comp side in Japan. India, no, we've seen good growth in India. We're seeing I think we're getting some benefit of some of the reshoring and some of the investments that are going -- the sort of foreign direct investments that have been going into India here over the last 12 months. We benefit from that. Our big companies like Fluke and Tek and ASP are seeing the benefits of that, but even more broadly in some of the rest of the portfolio. So we think India is going to be probably 20% the rest of the year. Those are smaller regions in some like Western Europe, so they can move a little bit more on a big chunk of business, but we like the demand dynamics right now in India in particular. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hey, how are you guys? I was going to ask AI question, but I was made fun of. So I'm going to ask something else. I'm going to keep beating down this dead horse with inventories. In the revenue breakout, and maybe this is not the best way of looking at this, but I think revenue through distribution was down 13% year-over-year this quarter. So how do you think just inventory levels among your distributors because I think our data shows that actually people continue to build inventory in the channel. And I know you've sort of talked about it quite a bit. Jim Lico : I would think demand -- I always think of inventory in the channel is a function of demand. And so as demand moderates a little bit around just the big numbers we've had over the last couple of years, there are pockets of inventory where we might see some increased inventory. But as I said on the previous sub couple of questions. We don't see any of that in a major way. We do get, particularly in the U.S. and Europe around Fluke and Tek, we get pretty good visibility to the inventories. And so I think the places that we don't -- obviously, those channel numbers that are in the Q and the filing represent also channel inventory relative to what we see in ASP, what we see in Sensing. So it's a broader view of channels, and in many cases, international partners. So I think we really managed relative to how we think about demand creation. We're still seeing strong point-of-sale attack. And so that's really fulfilling the backlog and customers are really hanging around for those orders, and they're getting them. And so we're still seeing strong POS. And Fluke gets a little bit more mixed, but it's still -- it's really more of a moderation than it is anything. We still saw mid-single-digit POS growth at Fluke in the second quarter in the United States. We saw even better growth in China and even Europe was pretty good for POS. So as those things moderate, there'll be some verticals that probably will get a little bit of channel inventory but we really have a strong process for understanding that and putting out demand creation vehicles for that. I would say the other thing is, we have a number of -- we probably have -- we have a very good second half for innovation and product launches. And so I think that's also an opportunity for us to continue to really help the demand creation side where we might have some excess inventory. Andrew Obin : No, I appreciate this. And just a question on Fluke and Tek. I remember being in China in 2018 when sort of Chinese CapEx hit a wall and that these businesses were hit in reverse with all these mega projects in the U.S., right, how much visibility do you have related to specifically Fluke and Tek to these projects? When would you expect to get orders and does it structurally change the growth rate for these businesses over the next couple of years? Thanks. Jim Lico : Well, I think on the tech side, we are starting to get visibility. In fact, even in some semiconductor businesses where the business is obviously slowed a little bit. We have already had conversations with customers along a number of product lines about 2024 investments. And I think what's been good about tech is that they've taken that part of -- they've taken advantage of some other opportunities in power and in the aerospace and defense customers to continue to offset some of that. So that's a good story and will hopefully be a good story in '24, although still too early to tell. On the Fluke side, it's really going to be less around when those facilities are getting built as much as it is going to be keeping those facilities up and running. So we're probably a few years out from some of that. When a manufacturing plant gets built, obviously, there's some advantage to what we do through the build cycle electrical contractors buying more Fluke equipment to build some of these facilities. But the real opportunity is going to be once those facilities are up and running and the maintenance staff and those facilities are building out those opportunities. I think we're probably a little off from that opportunity. But I think until then, we're seeing good -- the secular drivers that we've got at Fluke in power and solar and some of the sustainable investments that we talked about in the prepared remarks are remain a good opportunity for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, folks. Just wanted to follow up on FAL and with some of the, I guess, changes going on in the construction markets, so maybe a little bit of mix divergence, more manufacturing, a little less in some of these commercial or warehouse verticals. Anything that you guys are seeing across customer base that gives you any kind of cyclical impulse, whether this business is countercyclical, more procyclical, like I guess this is maybe one of the first real construction cycles since you guys have owned some of these assets. Like anything that you would just point out cyclically that you guys are noticing it seems like your business is doing well, but anything would be helpful. Jim Lico : Yes. I don't -- we don't have a lot of exposure to commercial buildings really in the sense of traditional in FAL. So I think maybe we have commercial customers or maybe 5% of sales or something like that. So it's not a big driver. What we are seeing is, quite frankly, on the positive side, at Gordian is a lot of deferred maintenance. And what Gordian Solutions and quite frankly, what we see in FAL is taking advantage of deferred maintenance and seeing the opportunity for deferred maintenance, improving project time line. So that's really been a big growth driver for FAL, and I think it really played out in the quarter, and we think it plays out certainly in the second half. So I think that leads to some of the infrastructure improvements that not only is going on in state and local, but also in the commercial industry, just more broadly. What we're seeing from customers really in FAL also is the fact that people want to understand the capital in this time of return to work and how are my real estate assets working, particularly with things like retail customers, they really want to understand their investments, and we really do -- our solutions are really oriented towards understanding that how to bring facilities costs down. So really, in some respects, the reassessment that people are doing around their commercial infrastructure, to some extent, is a growth driver for us and that we sell software that really helps them bring that together and really helps them understand their expense, what they're spending and where they're spending it and how they might take opportunities to save money. We talked about in the prepared remarks about a customer that is ahead of schedule on a $14 million cost savings because of our solutions. So quite frankly, I think a number of the sort of noise that's in the commercial real estate market that I think your question is really orient at in many respects is, to some extent, a driver for us because of the solutions we have. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Makes sense, seems what the numbers say as well. And then maybe just shifting gears. We've seen a few folks thus far this earnings season have maybe a bit more of a reaction from customers from lead times normalizing, so not necessarily a destocking or a change in point of sale. But are your lead times across some of the hardware businesses improving more materially here in 2Q? And is there sort of a customer impulse reaction to that? Jim Lico : Yes. I think when we see a little bit of that is at Tektronix, where our lead times have come down and it does create a little bit of a pause. That was embedded in our guide. That's why we thought orders would be the way they were. So yes, to some extent, we're seeing that as lead times moderate and you don't need to order something 18, 20 weeks in advance, you can now order at 6 to 8 weeks in advance. There is some moderation. But that's really what's been embedded in our guide from the first places. We've made some assumptions around that. And by and large, that's come into play the way we thought. At Fluke, a little bit less so because our lead times have been always pretty good. So I think to the extent we're seeing any of that, it's really a Tektronix. And as I said, we've embedded that as we give you sort of the book-to-bill dynamics and we give you some of the order growth rate, it's really embedded in those kinds of numbers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Thanks a lot. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to circle back to AHS as people seem very focused on that one given the history and so forth. So if I look at the second half it looks like you're assuming sort of $30 million, $40 million of profit step up, I think, half-on-half in AHS and maybe sort of $50 million or so step up from the top line there. And obviously, last year, we had a more stable half-on-half performance. So is the delta on the top line this year, a lot of that is the elective procedures element? And then when we look at the profit step-up with that, is it sort of just normal leverage plus some of that distribution channel shift and maybe some cost savings? Any sort of color as to that half-on-half move. Charles McLaughlin : Hi, Julian, this is Chuck. A couple of things going on there. Yes, I think you've got the numbers roughly right in terms of the first half, second half step-up, things going on in the second half. Basically, normal seasonality takes into account a lot of that, especially in the fourth quarter. But also coming out of Q1 in the first half, China was obviously really low with the COVID and the electric procedures there. That was -- that made Q1 lower. But Project Elevate, the dealer shift is going to give us more revenue in Q4 as we work through that and also more profit. And then we're getting more price in as we go through the year. So I think those are three things that really help. And then the self-help that we put in, the productivity things that we announced earlier in the year also helping us. Our incremental going from first half to second half on that step up to 65%. And that's all the things I mentioned and including seeing more consumables in the Tek now. Let me stop there and see if I covered the basis here. Julian Mitchell : That's very clear, Chuck. Thank you. And then maybe switching Tek. I don't think capital deployment has come up much on the call yet. I think the buyback did sort of get going again in the second quarter after a quiet six months or so. And clearly, on M&A, it's been quiet for 18 months given the -- partly given the tough M&A backdrop. But we get lots of questions around whether there's been any change in view fundamentally about M&A or some of the types of deals? And then also, is there more of an effort now to balance M&A with buybacks in terms of cash usage. So just any sort of thoughts on that given that buyback spend in Q2. Charles McLaughlin : Julian, let me take the buyback, and then I'll pitch it over to Jim to talk about M&A. We remain opportunistic with our buyback. I think we, Q1 is our lowest cash flow in the quarter, and we didn't do any there. But we'll be opportunistic as we move forward when we think that we're undervalued and see an opportunity. So I think that's going to continue to be the case. I think from a capacity standpoint, what we're doing here doesn't change anything about when you look at 3 to 5 years where actual capacity. So we've got plenty of capacity. Jim Lico : Yes, Julian, I would say we've been very busy this year. As you point out, it's been Provation, since we did Provation. But I think where we stand today its activity is actually pretty good. And we've seen some things transact in the market lately that wouldn't suggest prices have come down necessarily. But there are some pockets of that. And our bolt-on activity is very busy right now. But we remain disciplined, there's a number of processes that have failed given some sellers lack of desire to sort of get pricing into what we think is the appropriate frame. So we'll remain disciplined around the opportunities. But we do think there's a number of things out there that are possible. And we'll continue to work through them. And with the work we do and the diligence we do and we look forward to when those things get done. We don't have a burning time clock of getting something done for the sake of getting something done as you well know, we'll remain disciplined and there are opportunities for us, I think, in the back half of the year to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. Jim, can you give us more color by region and especially what's going on China and Europe. Obviously, China has become more of a concern recently and maybe your, but I think you already did say China is one of those pockets of industrial weakness, and that will continue to decelerate moving forward. But Could you give us more details regarding how China and Europe are reflecting your guidance moving forward? Jim Lico : Yes, sure. We've obviously had a -- we've had a strong North America view, and that will continue second half, probably in that mid-single-digit range. And quite frankly, when you look at the two-year stack in North America, very, very good, kind of mid-teens kind of numbers. So we feel good about where we're at in North America. And obviously, as you know, Andy, that's where a majority of our software businesses are. We're getting the benefit of obviously that in our North American growth rate. We're getting the benefit of a lot of the great work that our ASP team is doing as well. So that's kind of North America. I think relative to Western Europe, probably roughly flattish. Europe has been so strong for a while now. It will be mid-teens and, it was mid-teens in a two-year stack for the second quarter. So we think it will be more flattish around the second half of the year, maybe up a little bit. We're seeing some good traction in some places, but we're also seeing some, as I mentioned, in Sensing, where we're seeing some industrial OEMs slowdown, and that will be -- that's reflected in our second half guide. Relative to China, as you mentioned, I think we've been consistent from really all 6 months of the year and is that we've had four really, really strong quarters of growth in China, stands up exceptionally well against many, almost everyone. We did think the market would take a little bit of a breather in the second half, and we said that back in February, and that's really -- we really still believe that. So embedded in our guide is really more kind of low single-digit growth in China for the second half. And that's more like high teens -- accelerating kind of low 20s on a two-year stack. So we're really accelerating in China on a two-year stack. So business is still there pretty good. It's just off a very large base from the second half. And then high-growth markets, as I mentioned, on the India conversation, we still think there's a number of opportunities in the second half to take advantage of some opportunities. But those are -- those kinds of go -- they're a little bit smaller, so they tend to -- the growth rates tend to move around a little bit, but we do feel like we've got some opportunities in some of the high-growth markets in the second half. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. So you can make fun of me, I'm going to ask an AI-related question, but I'm going to ask it in the context of precision you talked about some of the verticals fueled by geopolitics and investment in AI and compute. And I think PacSci you had guided much lower for the quarter than you actually reported. So I think you talked about A&D inflecting. Maybe you can talk about the inflection you saw in PacSci. Was it AI-related? What's going on there? And what does it mean for the future? Jim Lico : Yes. I think there's probably two places that we've seen from a customer investment perspective. I would say, number one is we're seeing investments in quantum computing and R&D organizations that are really working towards opportunities for AI. So obviously, you got to get the hardware in order to get the benefits of AI. And Tektronix is really playing strongly in that regard. And we mentioned -- we obviously mentioned that order in the prepared remarks. EMC is really more a geopolitical aspect of less AI-related, just more in general of what they've historically done. They've got a tremendous backlog of the business. It really extends. We don't even include that backlog in our hardware backlog because the number is very positive. But we've had some supply chain capacity challenges. We got more out in the second quarter than we anticipated, as you said, and we're continuing to work through that. But we, in the second half, we probably have some opportunity in the second half to do better than that, but we've -- we'll see where that goes and some of the improvements, we've made are really good, but we want to see those more sustainable, particularly with our supply base at EMC. But we -- the demand for EMC right now is at an all-time high. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Hi, guys, good morning. So I think we've covered AI. So let's move to price. So you're one of the few companies actually seeing better price Q-o-Q, I think, 50 basis points better, if I'm not mistaken, maybe a bit more than that. So just curious, it seems like you're still pushing price, especially in AHS. So what is your perspective on how pricing looks in the back half of the year, especially within AHS, is there still more runway in health care? And then I'm just also quite curious as well, how pricing looks across software and services? Jim Lico : Yes. So I would say a couple of things. In the quarter, a little bit better than we anticipated, really around Sensing. As we said, we overdelivered in Sensing, and I think that brings the number up where we probably are getting the most price, if you will. Relative to health care, it will accelerate a little bit in the second half just because of Elevate and the channel mix change that we have, that will probably be more true in the fourth and then third, but we will see that. And yes, we're continuing to see price and upselling, cross-selling, our net dollar retention, as an example, has continued to improve, and we're getting some opportunities to really push more price and that sum of the story of the margin improvements in 2Q and IOS is really the good work we've done. The leader in the clubhouse that net dollar retention is service channel, I think we're at almost 115% now. I think it just gives you an example of us continuing to push the opportunity for really value. I think it's -- on the software side, it's really about value and the value you bring. And if we can continue to have those features that we can go cross-sell and upsell, we didn't talk much about it on the question around AI, but AI does present us an opportunity over time to create more features and opportunities within our software business to improve net dollar retention. We've seen that in Censis as an example with the AI launch that we had with them in the second quarter. So we do think there's plenty of opportunity for net dollar retention to really continue to go up, Nigel. And that's really where we'll see the price component of what we do in our software businesses. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great. And then moving on to Fluke. The flat revenues, it sounds like units down mid-single digits. I think you called out China comp has been quite tough there. But are there any other pockets of headwind that you call out? Just curious because this is to canary in a coalmine. Jim Lico : Yes. I think when we, we probably, if anything, such a strong first quarter there. When we look at the mid-single-digit growth in the first half, at Fluke, we really feel good about that number. And yes, there's a -- I would say the industrial business has got a little bit of slowing there, but the calibration business and other components of the business are accelerating. So all up, I think the mid-single-digit number on the back of such a good first half last year, I really think speaks to the strength of Fluke. The second half will look similarly in terms of about mid-single digits for the second half, and that's really on the backs of even higher growth last year in the second half. So in many respects, kind of an acceleration from a two-year stack. So overall, we like the trajectory in the business. You're right. There's a couple of places pockets of things we're continuing to watch. We continue to watch the PMI and industrial production. But I think the team has been executing well, a number of good technology launches. We had -- the eMaint business is performing really well so. So we've built some things that are into the portfolio over time, as you well know, trying to make Fluke less cyclical, more tied to secular drivers, and we believe that will continue to play out here in the second quarter. We've got a number of new product launches that could take advantage of those opportunities as well. So if there is some slowing in the marketplace, we think that can be -- we've got a number of actions out there that we think can countermeasure some of the potential slowness. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from TD Cowen. Joe Giordano : Hey, good morning, guys. Again, I want to just on the short cycle stuff. One, I just want to make sure I understand, Fluke flattish this quarter, it accelerates in Q half in the second half? I just want to make sure I understood that. And then on Tek, you mentioned earlier, orders were down 10%, but still up 30% from three years ago. Like that's obviously very positive. But at the same time, does it like scare you in a way that like what's the right or not like the normal level for a business like that? Because if we're talking about 350-ish of excess backlog going to $200 million and half of that is Tek, it's like $75 million of excess revenue delivery versus orders in the second half alone, which is pretty significant. So I just want to understand like where these businesses exit the year and what it means for comps into next year from like a 4Q starting point? Jim Lico : Yes. So let me clarify the Fluke comment. What I said -- what I say Fluke is, we were mid-single digits in the first half this year, will be mid-single digits in the second half. So from that standpoint, no acceleration. The quarters might move a little bit, but just if we think about first half to second half, about the same. However, because we grew more in the second half of last year, the two-year stack does accelerate a little bit. So hopefully, that clarifies the Fluke comment. I think relative Tek, we always knew that there were a number of parts of the business that we're really fulfilling over time. And as I mentioned, plus lead times going down would ultimately impact orders. What's been nice to see is in the strength of point-of-sale attack which around the world has continued to be good. And I think it continues to solidify our belief that the demand is real and that the demand can be played out over time. And that's why that we believe that demand, the excess backlog, if you will, remains an insurance policy against anything that might occur relative to some slowing that's going on. So I think that I'll stop there, and hopefully, that clarifies your two points. Joe Giordano : And then just a follow-up on margins. Like if I look at your Slide 16, obviously, a big ramp in all three segments from 1Q to 4Q. And I just want to kind of -- if you can frame out maybe how much of that variance from 1Q to 4Q is like normal seasonal? And how much is like a new jumping off point from the fourth quarter level into next year? Charles McLaughlin : I think the -- Rob, it's normal seasonal. It's just it's more -- I'm sorry, Joe, sorry. This is normal seasonality step-up from Q3 to Q4 when you're talking about what's going on there at the fall-through margins. I do think that but embedded in there is some of the self-help we did in the first half, and that will carry over and be held in the certainly in the first half of next year and then the pricing that we've been putting in. So to a certain extent, it is a better jumping off point going into next year. But keep in mind that Q4 to Q1 step down. But when you look year-on-year, I think those things are going to be tailwinds with pricing self-help and then the Elevate and health margins perhaps give us a great stepping up into the first half of next year. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Joe O'Dea: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just one related to a comment around channel distribution in AHS. And I think you talked about how still have a headwind in the third quarter, headwind goes away in the fourth quarter. I guess I'm curious about the tailwinds associated with this and what that looks like. And I don't know any framing around kind of the cost headwinds you've seen so far, but then as you sort of reach that transition point, how long you think it takes to then sort of reach the more elevated margin target opportunity that you have there? Jim Lico : Well, I would say relative to just the transition itself, the biggest impact, I think we ought to think about the biggest impact is in the second quarter. There's some impact in the third and that sort of equates itself out of the number by the fourth quarter. So that's kind of the sort of the sequential aspects of the impact of it. We think that benefits -- I think we talked about this, it benefits margins from the perspective of, we think we get better price. And so in that sense, it has a margin impact as well. I also think it has a growth impact, and this will probably be more a late Q4 in the '24 impact. And we still need to see it, but the direct aspects of our terminal sterilization, which is our a really strong business for us allows for us to accelerate the sterilization cycles that go on in our equipment, meaning that we can, now that we're direct, we have much more contact with customers and our application engineers will be more directly working with customers on the sort of efficacy of accelerating sterilization into other products that might be in the sterilization lab. That should have impact on growth over time. So not only in terminal sterilization, but also in our biological indicator business. So we feel that there's a real -- there is a growth in this as well. We think there's a customer satisfaction in this as well. And I think to some extent, the reason why our capital numbers were better in the second quarter was because customers are starting to understand that they're going to have a better opportunity to really have ASP salespeople, ASP application engineers in their hospitals every day helping them out. And so I think it's a margin and growth story. It certainly is going to -- has already started to play out, I believe, on the capital side, plays out on the consumable side in the second half and certainly into '24. Joe O'Dea: And then I wanted to ask one just on orders. I think you talked about Precision Tech book-to-bill at 1.0 better than the 0.9 you were anticipating. I'm not sure about Fluke, but orders up mid-single digit, I guess, if anything, maybe a little bit better than expected. And so I don't know if there's sort of anything overarching about it, but what you would sort of most attribute to seeing some of these order trends kind of better than anticipated out there. Jim Lico : Yes, I think, well, here's what we're seeing. I mean I really if we, as we started the year, we thought there'd be some slowing in the year just because of the moderating aspects of some of our businesses and maybe some economic impact in pocket. We really have seen -- we really haven't seen much of that in the first half of the year. But embedded in our guide is still some aspects of thinking that there's going to be some economic impact. Obviously, PMIs in the world, some of the portfolios still have some ties to industrial production. We've been able to mitigate all that because of the strong strategy around secular drivers and the recurring revenue parts of the business that have played out exceptionally well. So we'll continue to -- that was a book-to-bill of 1.0, which included, by the way, Fluke orders as well on that overall book-to-bill. So I think where we stand today is in a much better position. As we said, the excess backlog number is more robust than we anticipated as we go into the second half. And I think that bodes well for the three things we talk about going into the year. If there were some concerns around the macro that we would have the strong backlog, excess backlog, as I described, software and recurring revenue and the self-help work that's going in AHS. And I think what you saw in the second quarter is all that manifesting well. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Brett Linzey from Mizuho Americas. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning, all. Yes, thanks for taking the question. A lot of ground has been covered, but I just want to come back to price. Clearly, advanced here in the industrial cycle and seeing some softness in some of those hardware businesses, how are you thinking about the ability to take more price or hold the ground on price should the macro develop more weekly here, particularly within Sensing. Jim Lico : I think, number one, our ability to hold price, we feel very good about it. I think the quality of our franchises, the kind of value and investments we've made in innovation, are really speak to our ability to hold price. And we think of it as value creation and our ability to create more value for customers and get paid for it. And I think you see that across in a number of the things we were talk about, I think we see that. So we think strongly, we can hold price and we feel we can continue to get it, probably not at the rates we got in '21 as an example in '22 but we've always been a good price leader relative to, I think, a number of companies. And I think we -- there's no reason why we wouldn't continue to be as we go into '24 and '25. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to you, Jim, for some final closing remarks. Jim Lico : Thanks, Rob, and thanks, everyone, for the time today. Hopefully, you get a sense of the excitement in the second quarter and the conversations we had. I think as we look into the second half, the raise of our guide really speaks to the confidence that we have out there despite probably some noisy things. Our strategy is playing out the way we anticipated, and we're excited about that and we look forward to sharing some of the details with you as we get through the follow-up calls and a number of things that we'll be doing here in the third quarter. Between now and then, have a great summer. Thanks for everyone. We look forward to your follow-up questions and take care. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Elena. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. In the third quarter, we continued to see the benefits of our portfolio strategy with core growth and margin expansion in all segments. Third quarter core revenue growth was 2.5%, tempered by specific headwinds in health care and slowing in parts of Sensing in China. Strong execution by our teams drove substantial improvement in gross and operating margins, earnings and free cash flow. Adjusted gross margins expanded by 160 basis points to 59.7%. Adjusted operating margins increased by 150 basis points to 25.9%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 8% and free cash flow increased 25% to $384 million. As you can see, our strategy is delivering results with enhanced portfolio positions, innovative new products and dedication to the Fortive Business System, allowing us to consistently perform despite a mixed macro environment. As we look ahead, our attractive funnel of bolt-on and adjacent M&A opportunities across our three segments and five connected workflows are expected to drive upside in 2024 as exemplified by the acquisition of the EA Elektro-Automatik as well as three other bolt-ons in the quarter. Turning to Slide 4. We wanted to highlight how the year is playing out relative to our initial expectations and begin to frame our thinking for 2024. Beginning on the left, hardware product orders were stronger in the first half of the year as traction on new product launches and leveraged to secular drivers provided more backlog to buffer the normalization of supply chains. Hardware product orders were down mid-single digit, which we believe reflects continued solid demand with orders up over 20% on a 3-year stack basis in the third quarter. Point-of-sale trends in North America and Western Europe have remained healthy even as channels normalized, while we did see slowing specifically in China and parts of Sensing in the quarter. Software and services continue to demonstrate their resilience with high single-digit growth across our facilities and asset life cycle, environmental health and safety and perioperative customer workflows. The health care environment continues to improve. Core growth in the third quarter was constrained by the clearing channel inventory in ASP and continued weakness in the bioprocessing market in Invetech. Turning to the right-hand side of the slide, we are delivering 2023 performance ahead of our initial expectations coming into the year with mid-single-digit core growth with adjusted operating profit margin incrementals over 60%, delivering nearly 2x the margin expansion planned in the year. And we are accelerating our capital deployment in the quarter with robust free cash flow and ample firepower to fund attractive M&A opportunities. Further evidence that our strategy to create a more durable growth company is working is highlighted on Slide 5. Our innovation and portfolio strategy continues to build on leadership positions in our connected workflows benefiting from customer investments in key megatrends, including automation and digitization, the energy transition and the need for productivity solutions contributing to our improved through-cycle performance. We have several good examples across Fortive, including: providing customer software solutions to digitize and automate processes and deliver customer success in AI-driven ecosystems. Provation is partnering to enable real-time AI in the GI workflow, contributing to their strong win rates and accelerated mid-teens growth in 2023. And in the third quarter, Fluke added Azima DLI, a bolt-on acquisition, accelerating their AI-enabled predictive maintenance capabilities with vibration analytics and remote condition monitoring. Fortive is also helping to solve our customers\u2019 toughest energy transition challenges with breakthrough innovations. Fluke and are both benefiting from strong demand in solar, EV storage equipment and the build-out and modernization of electric grid infrastructure. In addition, Fluke acquired Solmetric to further solidify their leadership position in the fast-growing distributed energy market with high-precision solar test and measurement products. In this environment, our customers are putting a premium on productivity. ASP is launching new sterilization monitoring products, broadening their leading position in biological indicators, allowing customers to reprocess surgical instruments with greater speed and efficiency. Further, Gordian acquired NSR, a natural extension of the reconstruction workflow, which provides cost data that will allow them to expand job order contracting in the U.K. Turning to Slide 6. We are pleased to announce our agreement to acquire EA Elektro-Automatik, enhancing our leading position in advanced electronic test and measurement solutions. EA specializes in the high-power segment of the market that serves a number of growing end markets, including data centers, energy storage, e-mobility, grid modernization and hydrogen power alternatives. EA expands Tektronix addressable market. It complements and diversifies their offerings in the fastest-growing areas of the power market, solving for power density and efficiency challenges and creating a more sustainable and electrified world. With an estimated $175 million of revenue and low 40s operating margins in 2023, EA is expected to be accretive to our growth in margins. Tektronix\u2019 global scale, including a 10x increase in go-to-market resources, accelerates EA\u2019s global market expansion. Further, the Fortive Business System will be a valuable tool in achieving commercial, manufacturing and operational synergies, creating unparalleled value for customers and shareholders. As a result, we are targeting an attractive double-digit return profile in year 5 and earnings accretion that ramps as we delever, given our robust free cash flow. In summary, the acquisition of EA reflects our commitment to more durable and higher growth and ability to drive higher returns for Fortive for years to come. Turning to Slide 7. Fortive Business System continues to be a differentiator for us, enabling our business to drive innovation and profitable growth. We recently completed our annual CEO Kaizen Week. This event is a hallmark. We\u2019re demonstrating our culture of continuous improvement and our ability to deliver outstanding results in our operating companies in one powerful week. As always, we bring together our most senior Fortive leaders, including our segment leaders and many of our operating company presidents with a total of 41 teams and over 500 team members driving significant improvements in growth, margins, free cash flow and breakthrough innovations. Some Kaizen highlights include : at ISC and Qualitrol, their events realized 100% to 125% improvements in productivity. ServiceChannel reduced their time to onboard new customers, and Provation had a 2x improvement in the conversion of marketing leads, both enabling more and faster ARR growth. Tektronix deployed a Copilot, leveraging AI to bring technical expertise to customers and internal automation to significantly improve their efficiency and customer experience. And Fluke Health Solutions had breakthrough results in dosimetry reporting, reducing customer response time by more than 50%. In summary, this year\u2019s event continued to emphasize the power of the Fortive Business System and the breadth of applications across our portfolio driving sustained results. I will now provide more details on each of our three segments, beginning with Intelligent Operating Solutions on Slide 8. IOS grew core revenue by 4% with good growth in most regions. Margins continue to benefit from our portfolio evolution with high-margin software growth as well as price realization and productivity benefits driving 230 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Highlights in the quarter included, core revenues were up low single digit as solid core demand and NPI traction buffered expected channel normalization. EMA continued its strong performance with another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Fluke secured a number of wins in secular growth markets, including a sizable calibration order from an aerospace and defense customer. Fluke also continues to see success with new product introductions with the recent launch of MecQ, a first-to-industry acoustic imager for diagnosing mechanical failures. EHS revenues grew mid-single digit with double-digit iNet growth at ISC and another strong quarter for SaaS and Intelex with over 50% growth in ACV customer bookings in the quarter. In addition, Marathon Petroleum, our largest iNet and SAFER Systems customer recognized Industrial Scientific with their Corporate Exceptional Partnership Award. Facility and asset life cycle revenues grew high single digit, driven by continued strength in SaaS. Gordian continues to drive market penetration as more customers utilize their job order contracting platform to procure and manage their large infrastructure projects. Accruent secured an agreement with Zavery University to provide its facility management software which included cross-selling with Gordian, and ServiceChannel launched several innovations for both subscriber and provider software releases contributing to strong overall growth. Turning now to Slide 9. Precision Technologies reported 1% core revenue growth and adjusted operating margins of 26.5%, expanding 60 basis points, reflecting strong price realization and productivity benefits. Some highlights of the quarter include, Tektronix is executing on robust backlog in power and digital test and measurement solutions and delivering low single-digit core growth and outstanding operating margin expansion. This included over 20% revenue growth in North America, reflecting continued customer investments to solve the proliferation of new power design challenges for batteries, EVs and industrial applications. Tek orders continued to normalize off a 40% 2-year stack at the end of 2022. Double-digit order declines at Tek were greatest in China. However, we did see weekly patterns improve sequentially as we moved through the quarter. Further, we expect continued lead time improvement and channel normalization, with orders returning to growth in the coming months as customers continue to prioritize investments in semiconductor advancements, AI-enabled compute and electrification of everything. Sensing Technologies saw another quarter of strong orders and revenue growth at Qualitrol. This included a meaningful deal in the quarter from a large U.S. utility customer for full transformer asset monitoring solutions. Elsewhere in Sensing, slowing in China was reflected in lower-than-expected orders and revenue -- Lastly, Pacific Scientific EMC reported another quarter of double-digit sales growth as it benefits from Kaizen activity to improve manufacturing capacity and operational execution to deliver on record backlog. Moving now to Slide 10 and Advanced Healthcare Solutions. Core revenues were up 2%, reflecting improved underlying sterilization demand, partially offset by higher than expected U.S. channel inventory in ASP. For the third quarter, the total impact resulted in $11 million in less revenue, impacting AHS core growth by over 300 basis points and adjusted operating margins by almost 200 basis points. Elsewhere, high-growth markets saw revenues up high single digits, driven by robust growth in Latin America as well as good growth in Asia. Adjusted operating profit margins increased by 200 basis points year-over-year. We are seeing traction on pricing actions as well as the benefits of the productivity initiatives reflected in higher margins. Additional highlights in the quarter include Census continued to grow its subscription revenue with its Censitrac SaaS business increasing mid-teens, benefiting from continued traction in both new logo expansion and cross-selling opportunities as customers standardize on their leading instrument tracking software solution. Blue Power Solutions revenue increased slightly as high single-digit growth in its core dosimetry business was partially offset by project timing. We also saw continued market weakness in Invetech, accounting for approximately half of the slower than expected growth in the segment in the third quarter. Lastly, Provation had another quarter of excellent growth, over 20% driven by continued APAC SaaS adoption and new logo success. Previewing the fourth quarter, the ASP channel transition is now complete, and we expect growth to accelerate EHS. This includes the initial ramp of ASP\u2019s recently launched portfolio of steam sterilization monitoring products, which will further build over several quarters as they expand their global reach. We continue to expect margins to ramp in Q4 and 2024, driven by consumables growth, price realization and productivity actions. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Chuck, who\u2019ll provide more color on our third quarter financials and our 2023 outlook starting on Slide 11. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. We generated year-over-year core revenue growth of 2.5%, which included a single-digit growth in North America. As Jim mentioned, we saw -- over 20% growth in Tektronix and acceleration in our software and recurring revenue streams, which more than offset moderation some of the Sensing businesses. Western Europe revenue was up slightly as growth in software was offset by normalizing growth in hardware products. Asia saw a continued strength in India, up mid-teens and Japan up high single digits, which was more than offset by low double-digit decline in China. We had anticipated growth in China would slow in the second half as we lapped outside growth in prior years. For example, Tektronix was down over 20% in China in the quarter. However, it was still up 20% on a 2-year stack basis. We also saw continued slowing in Sensing, given the current macro environment, while AHS grew high single digit as electric procedure volumes improved in the quarter. Turning to Slide 12. We show operating performance highlights for the third quarter. Adjusted gross margins increased 160 basis points to a record 59.7%. On a 2-year stack basis, they are up an impressive 240 basis points driven by the benefits of our portfolio evolution, the continued application of FBS initiatives and strong price realization. Adjusted operating margins expanded 150 basis points to 25.9% or 300 basis points over the last two years, reflecting higher gross margins and the benefits of the productivity initiatives we executed earlier this year. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.85 despite higher year-over-year interest and tax expense. Earnings are up 30% on a 2-year stack basis, and free cash flow was $384 million, reflecting a 25% increase over the prior year and over 50% growth in the last two years as we continue to grow earnings and effectively manage working capital. Turning now to the guide on Slide 13 and the outlook for the remainder of the year. For the fourth quarter, we are adjusting our range to reflect caution around the macro in China and delayed recovery in Invetech. Core revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 1.5% to 3%. Adjusted operating profit margins are anticipated to increase by approximately 150 basis points, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.95, representing 5% to 8% growth and includes $5 million of onetime additional corporate expense related to the remediation plans following a cybersecurity incident in early October. We also plan to proactively fund an incremental $35 million of productivity initiatives in the fourth quarter, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS outlook with accretive benefits expected in 2024. Finally, we expect free cash flow of $415 million, representing conversion of approximately 125% of adjusted net income. Turning to the full year recap. We are reiterating the midpoint of our earnings guidance for 2023, which is coming in at the high end of the outlook we set at the beginning of the year. Things have largely played out as we expected with some upside driven by secular tailwinds driving market expansion in new customer innovations, resiliency of roughly 40% of recurring revenue, elevated backlogs and carryover pricing in our hardware products businesses, buffering, moderating demand as order rates normalize throughout the year. As a result, we have core growth and margin expansion in each of our segments. Core growth for the year as reported is now expected to be approximately 5% with adjusted profit margins anticipated to increase approximately 150 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected in the range of $3.37 to $3.40, having raised our guidance twice in the year, and we continue to expect free cash flow of $1.25 billion, representing a conversion of 105% of adjusted net income and 21% free cash flow margin. With that, I\u2019ll pass it back to Jim to provide some closing remarks. James Lico : Thanks, Chuck. I\u2019ll start to wrap up on Slide 14. Consistent with 2023, we believe we will see sustained core growth and robust margin expansion and free cash flow growth in 2024 despite the evolving macro environment. What continues to differentiate Fortive is our ability to deliver mid-single-digit through-cycle growth, reinforcing our portfolio durability and the power of FBS to deliver strong margin expansion. The consistency of our execution reflects the strength of our product vitality and alignment to high-growth secular trends, continued solid customer demand in the buffer of excess backlog, adding to a resilient growth profile. In health care, we expect a continued modest pace of industry recovery to drive stronger growth and incremental margins as we lap discrete 2023 headwinds. Lastly, in software and other recurring, our efforts to increase demand generation and strengthen our go-to-market capabilities is expected to drive strong SaaS and license revenue growth in 2024. This brings me to Slide 15 and how we drive differentiated performance and value creation for our shareholders. As we finalize 2023, we are demonstrating another year of strong execution, delivering record gross margins, operating margins and free cash flow. The sustained results underscore the power of the Fortive Business System to relentlessly drive continuous improvement throughout our portfolio. As we showed at our Investor Day in May, by executing the Fortive formula, we expect to roughly double our earnings per share and generate more than $8 billion of free cash flow over the next 5 years. Our acceleration of capital deployment, as demonstrated this quarter, further positions Fortive as a higher-growth cash flow compounder and a premier company delivering exceptional value to shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Elena. Elena Rosman : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Krista, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to start with the Precision business, just how the guidance sort of has moved around Tektronix. So it seemed like the test and measurement market was getting worse a few months ago, and you raised the Tektronix revenue guide for the year and now has come down. So maybe just help us understand, was it simply China suddenly getting very bad in late Q3 that caused such a revision? And maybe give us some context now with that PT segment being down organically in Q4, what sort of history tells us the duration of that sales downturn should be for the PT segment? James Lico : Yes, good morning Julian, it\u2019s Jim. And I think when you look at it, you\u2019re right. When we look at kind of where we\u2019re at now, we\u2019re back to where we were. And I think that at high single digit, I think, for the year for Tek. I think we\u2019re -- really what we saw, and you sort of answered it in the question is probably a little bit more of a step down in China. We obviously have good strength in China on a 2-year basis. I think in the third quarter -- I think we\u2019re like 30% on a 2-year stack. But I think what we saw in China was a little bit of inventory, a little bit cautiousness on the part of a number of distributor and direct customers all around China, not really necessarily industry-based, maybe more broad-based. I would call it more caution than anything. That\u2019s probably the single biggest aspect to it. We did have some push-outs a little bit from a couple of large orders that we saw as well. But I would say the big Pareto [Ph] bar on that conversation related to Tek is really what is really China. The good news on it and what we\u2019ve seen, as you know, over the last several quarters with PMIs where they\u2019ve been, semiconductor index down, a number of factors that would suggest that some -- we\u2019re coming in -- we were coming into what we\u2019ve been calling normalization. I think we\u2019ve been consistent in that regard. We\u2019ll see Tek get a little bit better in orders in the fourth quarter than they were in the third. And our 90-day funnels actually look better now than they have been. So I think point of sale in a number of places, North America and in Europe, as an example, we\u2019re good and will probably continue to be pretty good. We actually -- China POS was actually decent in Q3 as well. So if I would just stay high centered on Tek, I\u2019d say high [indiscernible] China trend third quarter probably at the low point in many respects, will start to get a little bit better as we get towards the end of the year. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then any broad thoughts on sort of PT overall? You\u2019ve got down organic sales this quarter. How quickly are you assuming that flips positive? James Lico : Yes. I think what we\u2019ve been talking about strategically around PT has been that we thought -- we\u2019ve done a lot of work in Tek to try to move that growth rate, make it less cyclical. Our service business, as an example, in the third quarter, was up 3%, which is, I think, a good environment relative to sort of stabilizing the business a little bit. We haven\u2019t done as much work in Sensing. We\u2019ve called that a low single-digit business. And as you know, we\u2019ve had double-digit growth there here for a couple of years. So we anticipated that normalization there. I think what we\u2019ve seen over the last sort of 60 to 90 days is what I would call more slowing. And so the PT number really in Q4 is really around Sensing. Some of that\u2019s China, some of that\u2019s some direct OEMs that have sort of pushed out blanket orders into 2024. Typically, some of that is our lead times coming down. Some of that, I think, is a little bit of slowness. We talked about it on the second quarter call, automation, principally in Europe, that continues. HVAC U.S. and Europe, also a little slower. And then as I mentioned, China. So that really is the PT story in the fourth quarter relative to kind of the change in the guide. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And just one very quick follow-up, health care. It\u2019s been a sort of a litany of issues for a few years. Once we get through the channel transition, which it sounds like that\u2019s finished, do we get back to sort of mid-single digit-plus growth in 2024? Is that the sort of natural entitlement as you see it without any onetime negatives? James Lico : Yes. I mean, we\u2019ll get out of guiding for 2024. But I do think we\u2019ll see mid-single digit, for sure, maybe just to sort of characterize what we saw from an ASP perspective. Obviously, this channel transition, we called out about $10 million. It was about $6 million more than we anticipated in the third quarter. And some of it is really why we have the strategy to go direct. It was really about the lack of visibility we really had on natural demand. When we take out those sort of adjustments for channel inventory in the second and the third, what we see is on a 2-year stack, mid-single digit growth in the second, third and fourth. So we really see more consistency. Obviously, some noise there we would prefer not to have as well. But I think where we stand into the fourth quarter, the channel situation behind us, we feel good about that. We feel good about the work the team has done. Obviously, a little bit more -- we\u2019re not proud of a little bit more noise than anticipated. We\u2019ll certainly take that. But where we stand today, I think, is in a much better position strategically, should set us up well for 2024. And quite frankly, that when you see the margin expansion in health in the third, 200 basis points, we\u2019ve talked about that margin continued improvement. I think even on a little bit less revenue, we had good margin expansion. So really, when you look at it kind of a good walk into Q4 and certainly sets us up for what we think will be a much better 2024. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thanks so much. James Lico : Thank you Julian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Stephen Tusa : Hi, guys. So just on the hardware backlog you guys have talked about in the past, where do we stand on all that, the 1 that was like $350 million at one point? What\u2019s the status of the hardware backlog? James Lico : Yes. I think you tried to take us up last quarter from $330 million to $350 million. But I think, Steve, it\u2019s come down. I think that\u2019s a fair statement. We sort of said we might end the year in the $200 million range-ish we thought, and that\u2019s what I said in the second quarter. We think that\u2019s maybe more between $100 million, $150 million-ish, depends on how the order rate. Some of that is just blanket orders that pushed into 2024 so it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean as dramatic as that number. But we\u2019ll still lock into with the excess backlog of over $100 million. So not as much as we anticipated, and that\u2019s principally in Sensing, a little bit of Tek really in China -- related to China, the conversation I just had around the answers to Julian\u2019s questions. But I think where we stand today is still with $100 million-plus of backlog, that doesn\u2019t include EMC, which obviously has a very, very high backlog. So I think we still have an insurance policy going into 2024. Stephen Tusa : And then what happened at Invetech? Can you just maybe discuss a little more of the drivers of that business for the quarter? James Lico : Yes, that business is really mostly high centered on design, engineering and manufacturing for the diagnostic and bioprocessing market. Certainly, you\u2019ve heard over certainly the last couple of days how that\u2019s taken a step down to some extent. We thought our guide -- I would own this one. We thought the second half guide was sort of bottom for us. And I think as it turned out, it was not bottom and a little bit more. We think now we\u2019ve taken that down to where we think that is. But certainly, we\u2019re certainly a little bit overzealous. It\u2019s not a core health care market. As you know, the core health care market really centered around hospitals. But I think where it stands today, the engineering resources, we\u2019ve certainly seen some customers sort of push projects into 2024. That\u2019s what the guide reflects. Stephen Tusa : One last one for you. Does this feel recessionary to you? And are you guys -- do you have a playbook for costs, if so? James Lico : Yes. I mean, I think, Steve, thanks for the question because I think at the end of the day, it really -- I don\u2019t know yet if this is recessionary in full. I think four quarters of PMI being where it\u2019s been and a number of other indexes around industrial production and some of those things having been slow, I think we\u2019ve seen pockets of that. And that\u2019s been reflected in some of the order rates that we\u2019ve described over the last couple of quarters. But I think if we come back to the original guide of the year, we\u2019re on that number. We prepared for slowing in some places. That\u2019s why margin expansion was so good in the second and the third quarter, following on a little bit less revenue. As we said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve opted our productivity view of a little bit. And again, maybe a little bit of abundance of caution but to be prepared for any environment. And we still think next year could be good. I think as we said, a number of the things that have played out in the strategy. Software was really good in the quarter. It continues to be strong. Our services businesses continue to be good. You saw Fluke in better shape, I think, than maybe if we were in a recession and their point of sale is pretty good. So I wouldn\u2019t call it necessarily yet but I think there\u2019s pockets of things, and we\u2019ll be prepared for it. Stephen Tusa : Great. Thanks a lot. James Lico : Thank you Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Sprague : Can we just kind of maybe come back to Tek first? So orders are down in the quarter, but you\u2019re expecting them to inflect positively in Q4. Can you just maybe elaborate on what\u2019s driving that or is that just the comps now moving the other way? Like what kind of visibility do you have on improving orders at Tek? James Lico : Yes, it\u2019s a couple of things. I think number one is we\u2019ve seen slowing in Tek orders for a few quarters now. And so some of it is comp. You\u2019re right. We started to see some slowing. The two and three year stacks are still really strong, so we\u2019re working off a level of order -- just raw order dollar numbers that are still very, very good, quite frankly, unprecedented in the history of the company over the last few years. So in that sense, it really -- there is much of a comp issue. We started to slow in the fourth quarter of last year. So yes, that\u2019s it. And then there\u2019s a little bit of -- we think China maybe get a slightly better, it was pretty dramatic in the quarter, but even in -- we\u2019ve seen some early signs that maybe that gets a little bit better. I wouldn\u2019t call it good. I\u2019d just call it a little bit better. So we had some order push from Q3 to Q4. We think we\u2019ll see those things as well. So the majority of it is comp. We\u2019re not counting on a big step-up improvement. But we are seeing some things that might suggest things might be a little bit better, and that\u2019s reflected in how we\u2019re talking about it. Jeffrey Sprague : And on this inventory realignment in ASP. So you misjudged it a bit in Q3. Like what is your kind of visibility that you totally understand what\u2019s in the channel and we don\u2019t have some additional hangover into Q4 or maybe there\u2019s some hangover baked into your Q4 numbers still? Charles McLaughlin : Hey Jeff, this is Chuck. No, we don\u2019t have anything baked into Q4. We\u2019re done shipping to the distributors. And if there\u2019s some -- we\u2019re confident that we work through everything. It was bigger than we had visibility to, which as Jim mentioned a few minutes ago, is why we wanted to make this -- one of the reasons we want to make this change. We wish we\u2019d been able to size it properly out of the gate. But as I said, that\u2019s why we make the change. But nothing in Q4. And so we -- what we are going to see is ASP to be in mid-single digit in Q4. Jeffrey Sprague : And maybe just a quick one. This cyber issue, is this totally wrestled to the ground or do we have some kind of open-ended issue we\u2019re dealing with there? James Lico : Yes. We experienced a network infrastructure disruption from what we\u2019re calling a cyber-incident in the quarter. We talked about some costs to mitigate that, roughly $0.01, around $5 million that\u2019s in the guide. That\u2019s what we called out. We did have some downtime in some North American facilities. Those are back up and running. We definitely think we can mitigate that. We\u2019ve mitigated the issues relative -- we have first contained the issues. We\u2019ve mitigated them. We\u2019ve completed the investigation. We\u2019re implementing the final remediation measures. So we don\u2019t believe this incident has a material impact on the quarter. So that\u2019s where we stand. Jeffrey Sprague : Right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Hi, everyone. Can we start with the EA acquisition? One of the things that struck me in the release is you talked about how you want to leverage the Tektronix franchise. And maybe just kind of elaborate on that. Is it distribution? Looking at their products, there\u2019s a lot of kind of similarities in terms of benchtop, but it doesn\u2019t seem to me there\u2019s a lot of product application overlap and maybe I\u2019m wrong there. So how does the leveraging the Tek franchise play out here? James Lico : Yes. There\u2019s not a lot of product overlap, Deane, you\u2019re right, but there is a bunch of application overlap. We\u2019ve talked about the power market at Tek for a number of and how that\u2019s really been driving growth even in the quarters we were just describing, we continued to see strength. And that\u2019s really been on the backs of our mainstream oscilloscopes and probes and our sourced measuring units. And almost in every one of those applications is also an EA-type product, if you will. So we will 10x their go to market. They were mostly direct in Germany and parts of Europe, mostly with distributions in countries around the world. We\u2019ll 10x that with our own go-to-market from a capability, both direct and channel capability. We think that\u2019s a tremendous leverage point. It is at the call point we\u2019re at and we see a lot of those applications relative to seeing EA right there in many cases or, in many cases, seeing others and understanding that we can be a partner to EA in that regard relative to the go-to-market. So we feel good about the synergies. It\u2019s obviously a very good business. It\u2019s had very strong growth. It\u2019s got software like growth and software-like margins. And we think we can really help accelerate the continued market expansion of the product lines. Deane Dray : Great, that\u2019s good to hear. And then just as a follow-up in some of the themes about what are you seeing that might be recessionary or not, two areas I\u2019d be interested in hearing, the typical Fluke sell-in versus sell-through, how that is the cadence there? And then broadly, the cadence for the quarter, if you broke out revenue growth or orders, how did it play out in the quarter by month? And did you exit in a more deteriorating fashion or not? James Lico : Yes. I mean, I think when we look at Fluke POS, as an example, in North America is probably the best place to think about the U.S. economy. It played out pretty consistently, although point of sale came in pretty consistently. We got to look at 2-year stacks because as we fulfill backlog over the last 12 to 18 months, it does in some respects, distorted a little bit. But by and large, pretty consistent. I think when we looked at China, it was probably a little slower as we got -- as we went through. But I think we have a good understanding of where that was and that kind of thing, and that\u2019s broadly China, not just Fluke. So I would say that\u2019s how anticipate it. Tek, on the other hand, was their order growth was actually better in September than it was through the early part of the quarter. I would say, though, we did see a little bit later in the month. And so there was maybe a little bit of a dynamic where in a few places. But I think that\u2019s really what -- the biggest change in really how we think about the second half, though, is really coming back to less, maybe really specific OEM customers within Sensing in those markets I described and China. I think those are the 2 big changes that we really saw. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : I guess a question on PT and the decision to sort of buy EA. I think for years and we\u2019ll have Tek. But it was like one of the acquisitions back at Danaher, this is the one that didn\u2019t go well. And there were questions and all of a sudden, there\u2019s a lot of attention being paid to it, right? Press report at NATI, clearly, you\u2019re making a bet here with EA. Can you just talk about the evolution of the company\u2019s thinking about sort of Tek and how you\u2019re thinking about the business overall? Where this is all of a sudden a key area for capital deployment? And what it is you\u2019re seeing two, three years down the road that gets you excited? James Lico : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I would say, number one, when you look at the returns of Tek from back a while ago, those returns are good, no. Yes, we had a little bit of challenge in the early days. That\u2019s exactly right, but that\u2019s a little bit of old tape. The returns now are good. And I think we feel good about the business. And I think the performance in the business over the last several years and the profitability that\u2019s come with that has been very good because of the strategy of getting out of some businesses that were much more volatile, the video business being one of them but a few others, getting into more services, which gives us a higher attach rate and less volatility. And you\u2019ve seen that play out over the last couple of years. I think as a large business within the company, we\u2019ve been very specific. And we think we\u2019ve been very deliberate in terms of our narrative that the power market was a very good market for us. It had good trajectories relative to secular drivers around electrification. That\u2019s not just EVs. Sometimes, people think of that as mobility. That\u2019s much more around storage. It\u2019s much more around the use of renewable energy and the challenges that, that brings to the grid, the challenge it brings to data centers, the challenge it brings on storage. And we\u2019ve got an exceptional -- we\u2019ve had exceptional success in those markets over the last few years. We talk about that relative to our own success as the mainstream oscilloscope line in that platform and the success that, that\u2019s had. So a natural extension of that is what we see at EA. And that\u2019s an opportunity for us to have a high-value bolt-on. It accretes immediately to Tektronix\u2019 growth rate and profitability. And I think investors, hopefully, will -- I think, and we\u2019ve had good it\u2019s interesting, I\u2019ve had industry people that I\u2019ve known for decades tell me over the last 48 hours, what a great deal that is. We obviously got to continue to talk to folks about it to help them understand the company. But I think when you see it for what it is financially and what it is strategically and the fact that we can get the kind of returns that we\u2019ve described, I think it\u2019s a very good addition to Tek, and we\u2019re excited about it. And we\u2019re excited about not only what it happens in 2024, but quite frankly, what it really brings to the business. And we\u2019ve talked a little bit about this. But as we highlighted our 2028 targets for EPS and free cash flow, EA gets us about 30% to 35% -- about 40%, actually, of the M&A EPS target. So when you look at that -- at a multiple that we were trading at today. So we feel really good about the deal, and we feel good about the opportunity to really to bring that team on. It\u2019s an outstanding team, and we think it will be a great addition to Tektronix and to PT. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up on just software, but specific, I guess, facility and asset life cycle, right? We sort of slowed down to high single digit growth. And I apologize if I missed it, but what were the key headwinds that sort of took it down from double digits to high single digits? And how much visibility do we have on this business reaccelerating into year-end and into 2024? Thank you. James Lico : Yes. We -- I think FAL is in great shape. It\u2019s a great story relative to IOS margin expansion that we had. Obviously, we\u2019ve had a great year-to-date in IOS margin expansion, and FAL is a great part of that story. We had a little, I would call it, a little bit of slowing in Gordian but that is really not slowing. It\u2019s just really -- we had an exceptional first half, and so it\u2019s a little bit of moderation more than anything, but I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it. That business has never been as good a shape as it is right now. So I think at the end of the day, ServiceChannel\u2019s on a great trajectory. We talked about a number of the good things that are going on in Accruent. I wouldn\u2019t read anything in to FAL than we feel really good about it. It\u2019s -- we\u2019re in a good place. It\u2019s going to be a good setup for 2024. The business is really humming along. Andrew Obin : So 10%-plus is still a good place hold for this business long term? James Lico : Yes. I think we\u2019ve said sort of high single to low double and it might move around -- you do have a little bit of nonrecurring service business in that a little bit that plays out every once in a while, you get a little bit on the comps. But yes, I mean, it\u2019s going to be that way in the 9%, 10%, 11% kind of percent probably you can dial that in for strong success in the years to come. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Good morning, everybody. I got disconnected earlier so if someone asked this question, I apologize. But can you be -- can you clarify on this channel adjustment going direct? Is there a margin payback? I would imagine you capture some of that margin that distributors were getting, but are we going to see that in the numbers? Or did you have to add costs in proportionately to that change? Charles McLaughlin : Scott, this is Chuck. Yes, there\u2019s a margin component to that. It\u2019s about 7% on the revenue that was going through the North America distributor. And you\u2019ll start to see that show up in price in Q4. Scott Davis : Okay, good. And when you guys think about kind of your pricing strategy, and I imagine it\u2019s dynamic by SKU, but is this new world we live in one where you can go out every January 1, you think, with some sort of placeholder price increase and capture it in the marketplace? Or is that not how to think about it? James Lico : No. I think whether it\u2019s -- we probably have several dates. If I were to think about the hardware businesses, which we\u2019ve obviously had unprecedented price over the last few years, but we will continue to have good price. We always -- we think about it as value capture more so than price. We think about our innovation capability. And if we can bring on higher innovation, ultimately we\u2019ll be rewarded for that from a gross margin perspective. I think our gross margin trajectory over the last few years is really -- is not only a good testament to FBS but it\u2019s also a good testament to innovation and our ability to launch products that have tremendous value. So I think the pricing environment is going to be better going in 2024 than normal. But I would say -- I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s better than 2023. I would just say it\u2019s better than normal. And we would anticipate continuing to look for those pricing opportunities. You\u2019ll see that a little bit on the software side and built into net dollar retention. And then our pricing metric that we often talk about is really more related to the hardware businesses. But as Chuck mentioned, we\u2019ll get a little bit more price in health care. We\u2019ve been getting more price in health care over the last few quarters. We think that will continue as well into 2024. So a number of things that will be -- that we feel optimistic about. We\u2019re not in a guide scenario just yet for 2024, but we are optimistic we can continue to get price. Scott Davis : Super helpful. Best of luck for the rest of year, guys. James Lico : Yes, thanks Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Hi, guys, good morning. So just on the 4Q, just mathematics here. Look, obviously $0.01 on corporate with the fiber. It seems like it\u2019s like maybe $0.01 or $0.02 on FX. Just maybe just confirm that, that move in FX about $0.01 or $0.02 on 4Q. But I\u2019m just curious on Tek there\u2019s obviously a pretty weak forward guidance from them. And I think we\u2019re trying to all figure out whether this is deterioration in short cycle demand or whether consumers of chips like yourself are just destocking. You\u2019ve been obviously holding buffer inventory and destocking. So any perspective you have on that, Jim would be helpful. Charles McLaughlin : Nigel, why don\u2019t I take the first one? I think there is a little bit -- I wouldn\u2019t say $0.02 impact on FX in the fourth quarter. I think it\u2019s probably a little less than one. But there is some effects just to close that one out. And you did note there is $0.01 in corporate cost for the remediation or efforts on the site. James Lico : Nigel, a little bit. I think I caught your question on TI and a little bit about inventory in the channel and things like that. I didn\u2019t [Indiscernible] their everything they said, but I did read a little bit about it. I would just say from a Tektronix perspective broadly around maybe components and kind of the market, if you will, I think the biggest place we saw some level of inventory correction was in China. We do track inventory levels embedded in our guide as some lowering of inventory in China over the next couple of quarters. We are -- I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re at elevated inventory levels as demand comes down a little bit. Lead times come down. We are managing with individual channel partners relative to inventory. But I think in general, we feel like we\u2019re in a pretty good place with the guide of where that all sets up. Obviously, the biggest decision in that is really where the demand goes. But we think we\u2019ve dialed in the kind of demand. The order of projections that I was describing earlier in the call really embedded a number of those things in those complex -- regional complexities into how we\u2019re talking about Tektronix. So if that\u2019s the answer, let me know. But if I missed it, let me know. Nigel Coe : No, no. I\u2019m just curious if you were like taking down ship inventories in particular, but... James Lico : I was looking down our inventory. The 1 thing about us, and you know this because our working capital performance has been so good. We really didn\u2019t build a lot of inventory into the company. We certainly will be taking actions on inventory, given our revenue guide for the fourth quarter is a little different than it was. So we\u2019re certainly working on that. But in terms of having big inventories on our own, we haven\u2019t necessarily been building big inventories. That\u2019s the sort of lean manufacturing, quite frankly. So sorry, really good question. Nigel Coe : No, that\u2019s right. Yes. And then my follow-up question, I think this is a quick one. I thought Slide 14 was a good slide showing the variability in revenue growth, but ultimately, around a mid-single-digit type of growth rate. And 2024 was sort of to that. So I\u2019m just curious, does the same thing, as we frame 2024, does the same apply to incremental margins? And the spirit of the question is you\u2019re coming off a really big year for incrementals. So I think we\u2019re north of 60%. Does that mean that 2024 might be sort of below natural levels? Or are you confident you can build on 2023 margins in the 40%, 50% range, perhaps? Charles McLaughlin : Nigel, a couple of things to think about as 2023 margins are very good. And normally, we\u2019d think about 40% incrementals and I think it\u2019s been 60%. That has to do with more with the productivity things that we did early in the year and then you saw us do some more. So no, we would always expect 40% incrementals moving forward. And then it will be a little bit more elevated because of the actions that we\u2019re taking right now. So we will build on what we\u2019ve done here, and we would expect them to be elevated from what they would be because of the actions that we\u2019re taking here in the second half. James Lico : And Nigel, relative to core growth, I think hopefully, that slide is helpful because what we were trying to articulate is what we really said is mid-single digits through the cycle. So after a couple of years of 10% like growth, we would anticipate having a little bit of normal -- we\u2019ve been talking about this for three quarters. We have a little bit of normalization. We talked about that consistently about that in the second half of the year. We\u2019re seeing that mostly very, very consistent with what we talked about. I think a little bit of difference in Sensing, a little bit of difference in China relative to what we talked about. But again, I think we\u2019re seeing that normalization here in the second half of the year. And I think that\u2019s very consistent with how we would look at a mid-single-digit grower through the cycle. And as Chuck just mentioned, the fact that we\u2019ve been prepared for things means we\u2019ve been able to drive really good margin expansion even with some slowing in the second half of the year because of our preparation and because of how we run the business. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s great. Thank you. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning everyone. James Lico : Hey Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : So I think one of the keys for ASP as you go into Q4 2023 and 2024 is consumables coming back and being relatively strong. I think you\u2019ve talked about underlying elective procedures improving. I would surmise that\u2019s the case in the U.S. and I guess in China at this point. But what is your visibility into the consumables ramp-up, and if anything, would stop ASP from recording the stronger consumables demand? Charles McLaughlin : So Andy, a couple of things just from elective procedures, generally in Q2, we thought we were 95% around the world. A little bit slowed in China because of the anticorruption stuff probably did 90%. But definitely improving around the world. We do have this inventory adjustment transition in North America. But when you look through that, the actual consumables growth is already there. It\u2019s there in Q2 and Q3 when you understand how the customers are using our products. And that\u2019s where when Jim talks about the 2-year stack, we\u2019re up 8%, 9% from Q2, Q3, Q4 rather consistently when you just take that one thing out. So we think we\u2019re already seeing that and what\u2019s actually going to use at the. Let me stop there and see if that made sense. Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes. No, that totally makes sense. And then maybe just shifting gears, Jim, could you talk a little bit more how you\u2019re thinking about M&A now? After the announcement of VA and you had the three small bolt-ons, how are you balancing thinking about the higher rates environment in terms of your own M&A strategy? And should we expect a higher tempo of M&A from Fortive over the short to medium term? James Lico : Well, I think it\u2019s really -- when we were in our -- when we had our Investor Day in May, what we tried to outline was the opportunities in front of us. And I think what I tried to really try to communicate that and consistently is really around the fact that we were active, that we -- I think I said in the second quarter call, I thought we\u2019d get some things done in the second half. But maybe -- I probably had four of the five parts already drawn at that point. But I think we\u2019ve been busy. We\u2019ve been active. We\u2019ve been looking for unique situations. I think everybody was looking for a step down in massive price differences. We\u2019ve seen a number of peer companies pay robust prices. I think what we\u2019ve been able to do is find those unique situations. Those three bolt-ons were unique situations, places like Azima, where we\u2019ve had a long-term relationship with them and a little bit of a partnership. Solmetric, which is a tool solar tool company. These are unique things that we\u2019re able to do that are really product extensions with high ROICs. And as I was mentioning earlier in the call, EA is really very similar. It\u2019s a business we\u2019ve known for a while. We\u2019ve known it in the market. They actually are well known amongst all test and measurement players for their technology and their ability to sort of play in the really good high-growth applications. And so I think we\u2019ll continue to look for those opportunities that are there, and we think they are. We\u2019ll continue to do that. But we\u2019ll also do that within the context of looking for strong returns, and that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see. And I think what makes us -- I think what we\u2019ve been trying to talk about is that we would demonstrate these things, they\u2019re hard to plan out. So sometimes they come in bunches like they did this quarter. But we will remain active, but we\u2019ll be looking for those opportunities that are, I think, very similar to what we\u2019ve seen this quarter, which is unique situations where we really have an opportunity to get higher returns. Andrew Kaplowitz : That\u2019s great, Jim. And Chuck, just to sort of follow up on my first question. You don\u2019t need a consumables ramp up to make your Q4 margin, right? You already have it. It\u2019s just the other thing getting better? Charles McLaughlin : Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. Thanks guys. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Joseph Giordano : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on AHS. Like I think if I look back, right, like going back to 2018, the average growth is something like high 2% range, and this year is going to be kind of maybe a little bit below that. So I know there\u2019s a lot of different things and you\u2019re certainly not the only people that get kind of surprised to what\u2019s going on in health care now. I mean, that\u2019s pretty much everybody. But like what makes us really confident modeling forward that the entitlement is like mid-single digits-plus and that\u2019s really only happened 1 time since 2018 despite portfolio changes there? James Lico : Well, I think embedded in what the comment Chuck just had about consumables is number one, obviously a little bit of noise, but we had COVID for several years, and that certainly created a lot of noise given the fact that it was a regional situation, we were kind of behind in the U.S. for a while and then China and all that. I won\u2019t reiterate all that. You know it. I think where we stand today and what Chuck just described is as you sort of look through kind of these onetime channel situation, which we really believe was the right thing to do strategically, we\u2019re seeing that growth now. And I think the 200 basis points of margin expansion in the third quarter in the segment really speaks to the fact that ASP\u2019s margins are starting to get up better because the rest of the margins in the segment are very strong. So we feel good about the launch point relative to how we\u2019ve just described it. And 2024, as I said earlier in the year, 2023, the health care market would be a little bit better. It wouldn\u2019t be great but it would be better and 2024 would be better than 2023 and 2025 would be better than 2024. So we continue to think that -- we continue to see that. So that\u2019s what gives us the confidence. And again, I understand, given the fact that this inventory situation in the third quarter was a little bit more than we anticipated, but -- and so obviously, that puts some skepticism in the nature of the question. But I think as we stand here today with what we\u2019ve got going, we saw good equipment growth, high-growth markets. Growth in the quarter was 10%. So I think we\u2019ve got other parts of the world in better shape, and now we\u2019ve got -- we needed to get North America in a better shape. That\u2019s really been the drag on the business in the last few years. And we feel that we needed to do the channel change in order to make that happen. And that\u2019s now behind us, and we walk into the fourth quarter and into 2024 with a number of those things behind us. Joseph Giordano : Fair enough. And then just last for me on the hardware backlog that you talked about. I think you said like what, it was 350 or so last quarter, probably ending around 150-ish, give or take, at the end of the year. So I guess, rough numbers we\u2019re talking like orders under revenue by like $100 million a quarter right now? And then we exit the year as a pretty small percentage of like the total business there. So like we need to -- when does dollars have to -- like dollars of orders rather than percentage of orders have to start inflecting before like the revenue catches down to the orders? James Lico : Yes. Yes, a couple of things. Number one is just remember, we created about we\u2019ve created $300 million over -- that $330 million is an excess backlog number, not a backlog number. So in a couple of years, we created $330 million just to -- and we said then we naturally deplete -- under normal circumstances, we would deplete backlog in the second half of the year. That\u2019s pretty natural. We had said that was likely to get us from $330 million to $200 million. We now think that\u2019s about $125-ish million, call it, $100 million to $150 million, maybe because I don\u2019t think we can be super precise here. And so it\u2019s call that about somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million to $100 million difference. We think some of that already got pushed into 2024 and some of it probably is inventory corrections mostly in China. And it\u2019s really the Sensing story that I talked about earlier in the call. So hopefully, that reconciles a little bit of that for you from a numbers perspective. Joseph Giordano : Thank you. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joseph O\u2019Dea: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on the just kind of inventory rationalization. And could you explain a little bit more kind of the differences between Fluke versus Tek and Sensing? And so what -- I think you\u2019re seeing it in Fluke as well, but it seems like you\u2019re seeing it in ways which it isn\u2019t surprising. And so whether that\u2019s a function of there were longer lead times in Tek and Sensing that led to more forward buying, whether that\u2019s more tied to the end mark they\u2019re serving? Just trying to understand why they might be marching down a little bit of different paths in terms of managing through some of the destock effect. James Lico : Yes. Joe, are you talking about inventory or backlog? Joseph O\u2019Dea: I\u2019m talking about inventory. James Lico : Okay. Well, I don\u2019t think we had a big inventory correction here. If I -- I might have miscommunicated that, but I think what we\u2019re really saying, the backlog answer I just had is really the story relative to our rate. And I would say most of that in Sensing is not really inventory as much as it is -- it could be inventory but it really is much more OEMs really pushing out. I think it\u2019s much more of a demand issue than in excess in specific verticals. The majority of that backlog reduction, which you could think of that as the order kind of orders changing is really in three specific verticals as we talked about, one being in sort of in automation, industrial automation, mostly with Europe OEMs, semiconductor, really two equipment companies that we supply, HVAC kind of on a global basis in China and a little bit of medical with some specific customers. So that\u2019s really the big change in our excess backlog number that I was just suggesting to Joe, and that\u2019s really mostly in Sensing, a little bit of Tek, a little bit at Fluke, but not -- but really a big story. And relative to inventory in channel, what I was trying to suggest is, yes, a little bit at Tek relative to China. But in North America and Europe, we still had pretty good POS. And I would anticipate that if demand\u2019s really normalizing a little bit more. So if we continue to see that, we\u2019ll see some normal changes in inventory as lead times come down, but nothing -- we don\u2019t anticipate at this point anything dramatic. Joseph O\u2019Dea: That\u2019s helpful. And then I wanted to ask on EA and just how to think about the revenue growth potential and incrementals there over the next kind of five years, what you\u2019re thinking about to get to that kind of ROIC target. I mean, it seems like we\u2019re looking at maybe solid double-digit revenue growth and some really strong incrementals and the 10x go-to-market is pretty compelling. But maybe any details there in terms of kind of what you see for that revenue growth over the next number of years? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. Joe, we think it\u2019s going to be low double digit over the next five years. Really strong incrementals here like we\u2019ve got some other examples that about 60% fall through. It gets us -- I think we talked about or as Jim mentioned earlier, with 20% of our next 5-year free cash flow, we\u2019re going to get $0.40 of EPS out in 2028. That\u2019s the math that we\u2019ve given out. James Lico : And I would just add, that\u2019s obviously a lower growth rate than they\u2019ve anticipated. We think there\u2019s upside opportunity as well, given the synergy and the go-to-market expansion. So we like the business, and we look forward to continuing to talk about it in the near term. Joseph O\u2019Dea: Thank you. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Jim Lico for closing remarks. James Lico : Thanks, Krista, and thanks, everyone, for taking the call. We appreciate the time and energy and enthusiasm of the questions. We obviously have some -- we\u2019ll have some follow-up with many of you and we look forward to that. I think what you saw in the quarter, obviously, a few changes on the revenue line. But I think what we\u2019ve tried to say from day one is that we see some normalization in the second half. We saw that maybe a little bit more in the third than we anticipated. But what we also said is that we\u2019ll continue to drive margins and continue to set the business up for long-term sustainability and success. I think the margin expansion you saw the free cash flow, the number of deals that we did that was very consistent with the strategy we\u2019ve outlined. We think we continue to set up for 2024. Well, we\u2019ll obviously get to a guide here in the next few months. We look forward to finishing the year out here strongly. We\u2019ll see you on the road, and we look forward to taking your follow-up. Thanks, everyone. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Fortive Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Elena Rosman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rosman, you may begin your conference. Elena Rosman : Thank you, Kristina and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. With us today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We represent certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by Regulation G are available on the Investors section of our website at fortive.com. Our statements on period-to-period increases or decreases refer to the year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise specified. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and the actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make here today. Information regarding these risk factors is available in our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 [ph]. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Lico. James Lico : Thanks, Elena. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. I'll begin on Slide 3. Fortive delivered outstanding operating performance again in 2023 through our proven formula for value creation. Our transformed portfolio of businesses delivering consistent through-cycle performance reflecting a more durable company with mid-single-digit core growth in 2023 despite a mixed macro environment. Strong execution by our teams drove another year of record margins with adjusted gross margins now approaching 60% and adjusted operating margins nearing 26%. Throughout 2023, we focused on unleashing the full power of FBS, reflected by record participation in KAIZEN events, including our largest ever CEO KAIZEN week. The results of these KAIZEN's were tremendous, including an average of 50% productivity and 50% lead time conversion improvements. Our industry-leading free cash flow generation funded accretive capital deployment, including our best year executing on bolt-on acquisitions, accelerating our growth strategy across all 3 of our segments. We also opportunistically bought back shares and increased our dividend, enhancing shareholder returns. In summary, we remain committed to our strategy and its success is evident given the consistency of our results which I'll highlight on Slide 4. We built Fortive to drive growth, drive progress and drive value. Reflecting on our evolution, we made significant steps again in 2023 towards our vision of a premier company. This includes 5% core growth and 160 basis points adjusted operating margin expansion. The benefits of our portfolio transformation are reflected in our progress to date, averaging rule of 35 [ph] performance over the last 5 years. FBS is driving commercial success as we expand into new growth markets, speed innovation cycles and maximize investment returns across our 3 operating segments. For example, in 2023, we saw a 33% increase in our revenue attainment on new product launches. Many of these new products are contributing to the approximately 60% of our revenues that positively impact climate, health and safety concerns and aligned to the U.S. sustainable development goals. Our operating companies are seeing a greater than 20% acceleration in software development time through the use of Gen AI, improving our ability to deliver more value to customers. Our culture of innovation, learning and continuous improvement is contributing to gains in our industry-leading employee engagement scores, a critical component of our sustained success. Lastly, our acquisition performance contributed to our record free cash flow in the year, underpinned by industry-leading net working capital performance and accelerated returns on invested capital. On Slide 5, you see how our portfolio is strategically positioned to increasingly benefit from secular growth trends. Every day, we are helping our customers harness the power of emerging automation and digitization technologies streamline crucial workflows and embrace the energy transition. Some highlights in the fourth quarter include : in IOS, Fluke's new family of Multi-product Calibrators are providing the broadest workload coverage across some of the fastest-growing markets. Recent bolt-on in RedEye is helping to transform customers' digital experience with a modern centralized hub for engineering document management, solidifying our Accruent's leading position in that market. In PT, Tektronix is harnessing the power of open source software with the first release of its Python Native Drivers to help our customers automate their instruments and accelerate their testing types. Together with EA which closed in early January, Tektronix is expanding its addressable market, adding complementary performance solutions to their best-in-class electronic test and measurement suite serving the fastest-growing areas of the power market. In AHS, Landauer is helping customers reduce energy usage, waste and carbon emissions with their new Digital Dosimetry Solution. And ASP launched their new sterilization monitoring products in North America and Asia helping customers achieve greater efficiency and assurance as they work to keep up with rising clinical demand. Turning to Slide 6 and a spotlight on M&A performance; our two most recent large deals provide an excellent example of the Fortive flywheel for value creation and action. In 2021, we accelerated our segment strategies with the acquisitions of ServiceChannel and proVation information. These two world-class software offerings are creating compelling value for our customers. And Fortive, having fully embraced the power of FBS to drive double-digit ARR growth and significant margin expansion. For example, ServiceChannel exited 2023 with adjusted operating margins in the mid-20s up from breakeven when it was acquired. And proVation delivered 112% net dollar retention in its GI solutions, up approximately 8 points Censis acquisition. The execution of our disciplined acquisition strategy strengthened by the value FBS creates and is a critical component of how we achieve sustained results over time. You see that reflected in their industry-leading net dollar retention as our innovation and customer centricity tools are helping them retain and grow their existing base. Turning to Slide 7; our ability to deliver differentiated results enable our world-class business system. Across Fortive, we leveraged FBS to better understand our customers, accelerate innovation, expand market share profitably, improve operations and forge the leadership skills we need for the future. One of the best things about FBS is that we never stop improving it. As our portfolio evolves, we are expanding the tool set and capabilities that allow us to set and deliver on high expectations, as you just saw in the ServiceChannel and proVation examples. In 2023 [indiscernible], our center of excellence for software data and AI expanded its capabilities to further support digital transformation and drive innovation, next-gen products and productivity across Fortive. Core to our success is how our leaders immerse, teach and lead from the front with FBS. Together, they make KAIZEN the way of life for our 18,000 team members reinforcing our strong culture of inclusion or everyone's contribution matters. Looking at the chart on the right, what is unique and differentiated about Fortive, the breadth of results that are compounding over time. Since 2019, we have sustained our target of mid-single-digit through cycle core growth. We have delivered outstanding margin expansion above our annual commitments. We have converted more revenue to income growing adjusted EPS at 14% compounded rate and converted more income to cash, compounding free cash flow at an average of 19% over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Chuck to provide more color on our fourth quarter financials and our 2024 outlook, starting on Slide 8. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim and hello, everyone. We ended the year with a high level of performance, generating earnings growth of approximately 3x revenue. Core revenue growth of 3% in the quarter reflected an acceleration in IOS and Healthcare, partially offset by anticipated slowing in Precision Technologies. We achieved record margins in the quarter and full year, driven by the strength of our brands. Earnings per share of $0.98, reflecting operational beat at the midpoint with earnings up 11% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $413 million, down versus the prior year as expected and up 56% on a 2-year stack basis. For the year, core revenue growth was 5%, exceeding our initial outlook of 4%. Adjusted gross margins expanded by 180 basis points to 59.5%. Adjusted operating profit grew 11% and margins expanded by 160 basis points. Adjusted EPS of $3.43 grew 9% and we delivered on our free cash flow forecast of $1.25 billion which represents 32% growth on a 2-year stack. Turning to Slide 9; I'll now provide highlights on the fourth quarter performance of each of the 3 segments, beginning with Intelligent Operating Solutions. Q4 core growth was 6%, reflecting continued momentum across this segment. with stable POS trends in all regions and new logos and customer bookings contributing to strong ARR growth. Adjusted operating margins expanded 300 basis points to 34.2% driven by margin expansion in all businesses, accretive software mix and price realization and productivity initiatives. Overall, we have seen better durability in Fluke throughout the year. given the benefits of innovation and customer adoptions in key growth verticals. Environmental Health and Safety continues to see strong high net growth at ISC and double-digit SaaS growth at [indiscernible]. Facilities and asset life cycle at double-digit core growth throughout most of 2023 driven by continued strength in SaaS, contributing to record margin expansion. Moving on to Precision Technologies. Core revenues in the quarter were slightly ahead of expectations, down 1% driven by lower Sensing revenues more than offsetting growth in Power, Food and Beverage and Aerospace and Defense market. Adjusted operating margins expanded 270 basis points to 29%, enabled by favorable price and productivity benefits funded throughout the year. Additional highlights include Tektronix which had a record year with 9% core growth, up 25% on a 2-year stack basis, reflecting the benefits of our focused innovation and vertical markets growth initiatives. And while Sensing Technology revenues were down low single digits in 2023, they were up low double digit on a 2 year stack and ended the year with a return to growth in 2 of our 4 businesses. Now on to Advanced Healthcare Solutions. Q4 growth was 3%, driven by an acceleration to mid-single-digit growth at ASP, excluding Invetech, AHS core growth would have been approximately 6%. Adjusted operating margins expanded 160 basis points to 25.7%, driven by flow-through on consumables, price realization and product additional highlights include. At ASP, we are through the North American channel transition from indirect to direct, driving 7% consumables growth in the quarter. Our Software businesses continued their pace of double-digit SaaS growth with new logo success at Censis and proVation. We expect to sustain this momentum in 2024. Turning to Slide 10; you can see total growth in the fourth quarter of 4% was driven by expansion in the core with minor contributions from FX and bolt-on acquisitions. By regions, we had mid-single-digit revenue growth in North America, driven by growth in all segments, including stronger growth in consumables, benefiting AHS. Western Europe revenue was up slightly as growth in software was offset by normalizing growth in hardware analytics [ph]. Asia saw continued strength in India and Japan, however, was more than offset by high single-digit decline in China. As a reminder, we anticipated growth in China would be down as we lap outside growth in prior years. Turning now to Slide 11; we're introducing 2024 guidance, starting with the full year. We expect growth of 6% to 8%, with core revenues up 2% to 4% and acquisition contributions of approximately $215 million. Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 10% to 13% with margins of approximately 27%. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $3.73 and $3.85 up 9% to 12% include a $0.13 headwind from higher interest expense associated with funding of the EA acquisition. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 14.5% to 15%, in line with the average of the last 2 years and reflecting the benefits of the EA acquisition. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.38 billion, representing conversion in the range of 100% to 105% of adjusted net income and 21% free cash flow margin. For the first quarter, we anticipate revenue growth of 3% to 5%, with core flat to up 2%, driven by the continued momentum in our IOS and AHS segments, partially offset by a low to mid-single-digit decline in PT. Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 6% to 10%, with margins of approximately 24.8%. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $0.77 to $0.80, up 3% to 7% includes a $0.04 headwind from higher year-over-year interest and free cash flow of approximately $180 million, reflecting normal semi variation. Moving to Slide 12 and the outlook for 2024 by segments. You can see we expect positive growth and operating margin expansion in each segment in 2024, supported by our alignment secular tailwinds, new product introductions resulting from our robust innovation efforts. The continued resilience of our software and other recurring revenue businesses, the expected delivery of the remaining approximate $100 million of excess backlog in our hardware products businesses, another year of FBS driven execution and the carryover benefits of the productivity initiatives that we executed in 2023. By segment for the year, we are planning IOS to continue its momentum with mid-single-digit core growth and another 100 basis points of margin expansion. Key drivers include stable demand and NPR traction in the hardware products and continued ARR growth supported by strong 2023 SaaS bookings. We are planning for PT revenues to be up 10% at the midpoint in 2024 with core growth up slightly, reflecting the benefits of the EA acquisition and normalization of orders in hardware and products businesses in 2023. We expect EA to be accretive to adjusted operating margins in 2024. And together with the benefits of our productivity initiatives, we expect PT margin expansion of over 100 basis points. PT's outlook also reflects the realignment of INV into Sensing Technologies Group as we explore strategic alternatives for INV design and engineering business. The remainder Invetech's includes product revenues that align more closely to our automation businesses in Sensing. For comparison purposes, we have provided pro forma segment results for 2023 in the appendix. In AHS, we are planning mid-single-digit core growth, with operating margin expansion of over 125 basis points driven by volume, price realization and productivity. We expect an acceleration in the growth at ASP driven by their improved channel position, NPIs and procedure volumes and new logos and SaaS migrations are expected to drive continued software growth in Healthcare. Before opening it up for questions, I'll pass it back to Jim for closing remarks. James Lico : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start this wrap up on Slide 13. I am incredibly proud of the contributions of our 18,000 team members to make 2023 another record year for Fortive. Over the last couple of years, our success executing our strategy to build a more resilient company reflects our strong foundation and enduring principles that underpin our unique and compelling culture. We talked about the operating rigor and leverage of FBS tools to innovate and drive growth across our segments. In addition to higher core growth, the deals we have done are contributing to our multiyear track record, including strong performance again in 2024. Since 2019, we are sustaining 7% revenue growth, delivering 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion per year, driven predominantly by higher gross margins compounding earnings and free cash flow double digits; we have cut net working capital as a percent of sales nearly in half, building 50% more free cash flow per dollar of revenue. This is a testament to our portfolio transformation and the power of FBS fueling our current and future success and with a $60 billion served market, we have substantial runway to accelerate growth organically and inorganically. This brings me to Slide 14 and how we drive differentiated performance and value creation for our shareholders. With a consistent and compelling 2024 outlook, including 6% to 8% total growth and over 100 basis points adjusted operating margin expansion in every segment. We are on track to our 2025 target of $4.50 of earnings and $1.6 billion of free cash flow. We are confident in our ability to differentiate our performance and believe our outlook is appropriately balanced, remaining agile to deliver for customers and shareholders should the environment differ dramatically. As we showed at our 2023 Investor Day by executing the Fortive Formula, we expect to roughly double our earnings per share and generate more than $8 billion of free cash flow over the next 5 years. Our M&A funnel remains strong and our acceleration of capital employment as demonstrated in 2023, further positions Fortive as a higher growth cash flow compounder and a premier company delivering exceptional value to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Elena. Elena Rosman : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our comments. Kristina, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Just the kind of trend in the shorter-cycle businesses, Tek and Fluke, maybe just an update on where you stand, book-to-bill how the revenue did this quarter and then how you're thinking about how the year plays out next year? James Lico : Yes, Steve, it's Jim. I think, number one; I would differentiate Fluke and Tek here. I think we certainly saw, we saw mid-single-digit growth at Fluke in the quarter. We saw growth in orders, point of sales in the mid-single digit around the world. So I think we're seeing the real benefits of the number of transformation things that we've done from an innovation perspective, also with some of the M&A work we've done and in good shape. And I would say Tek, Tek was low single digits in the quarter but quite frankly, off a 20% growth comp in Q4 '22. So still saw some good performance there. We felt really good about the quarter they produced as well. And certainly, the year that Tektronix had is unprecedented a record year, as we said in the prepared remarks. So as we go into the next year, I think it's -- I think, more of the same at Fluke. We've really seen some resilience and durability activity that we've talked a lot about over the years, playing out there. We probably have a quarter. They're about their fifth quarter of negative bookings. And obviously, we've been working off backlog there. And we would anticipate that book-to-bill there turns positive and probably Q2. So we feel good. North America was really good for tech, where a little bit of slowing that we saw within China as we talked a little bit about our China growth in total and Chuck's prepared remarks. But obviously, part of that Tek's one of our bigger businesses in China. Part of that story is the Tektronix there. So I'll pause there and you've got a follow-up, I'll certainly cover. Steve Tusa : Yes. And then just how much price do you assume in the for the guide? For 2024? Charles McLaughlin : We're thinking about 2% to 3%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Good afternoon, just like on the reclass of Invetech to PT, it's a small business, it seems like margins are relatively depressed maybe 6% to 7% margin. Just wondering, I think, Chuck, you went through some of the logic about just maybe talk about what this achieves this class? And maybe just in terms of the importance of this ASP rather AHS acceleration, kind of like how is that benefiting sort of the outlook for AHS because were you assuming that Invetech recovers? Just trying to think about AHS on a like-to-like basis here? Charles McLaughlin : Thanks for the question, Nigel. I'll take the margin question first. We're talking about the business expanding 125 basis points but that's on a like-for-like basis, if you really look at where we ended with Invetech and we're up probably 200,250 basis points but the business is generating margin expansion of 125 and that's what we've got in the guide. I think the rationale for switching it is the event design engineering piece just isn't as big as we thought it was going to be and it's not but not really moving forward. And so the part that is now the majority of this business really fits better in Sensing. James Lico : Yes. Nigel, I would just add, we called out in the slide materials that Invetech was a headwind in the quarter for health care to the tune of about 280 basis points. That's probably the largest year-over-year headwind that Invetech has seen. I wouldn't expect the size of that to continue but probably still in the 1% to 2% [indiscernible] continued to be in health care throughout 2024. But that's now reflected in PT. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the transition ASP consumables. Just confirmed that's now fully behind us. There's no lingering impact there? It sounds like it is. But maybe I think we can see the clear sort of margin benefits that we should see coming through from capturing that distributor margin. But maybe talk about the opportunities to drive better growth and having that direct customer connection, what do you see as a potential for revenue benefits? James Lico : Well Nigel, I would say, number one, yes, we're definitely fully through it. So you saw the benefit of that. I think as we said in the prepared remarks, consumables in North America were up about 7%. Consumables around the world, we're up about 4%. So good performance there. We think mid-single-digit guide for ASP for the full year is a good number. Certainly opportunity to go and on the margin front which we're going after. We were just with the team last week. We actually had them with, we had our Board meeting there and we have the team there for an operating review, highlighting the level of innovation. I talked about in the prepared remarks. We now have a new set of consumables around steam sterilization that are going to now be in the U.S. and Asia that are certified. So a number of opportunities here to continue to improve the growth. Those are obviously all in Consumables which obviously have higher fall-through. So you like the guide here overall held up 125 basis points in margin expansion mid-single-digit growth. We think that's a great launch point. It certainly certifies I think a lot of the things we've been saying about the direct North American strategy and certainly more broadly around the strategy at ASP and how health will just be a real durable grower for Fortive in '24. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : I just wanted to check on the sort of margins in the first quarter. So I realize it's not a big sequential decline in sales but you've got a very heavy sort of sequential step down in margins there in Q1, 100% or so kind of drop-through. So is that reflecting maybe something on mix in any of the businesses in the first quarter versus the fourth? I'm just trying to understand maybe on Precision, in particular, how their margins are starting out the year in Q1? Charles McLaughlin : Nigel, the biggest thing is there's just a seasonal step down in revenue dollars from Q4 to Q1 and that's what gives you a normally seasonal step-down in the margins, pointing out that our Q1 guide is up 75 basis points. So that's a pretty good expansion there. So I think we're seeing pretty good performance across the segments in margin expansion, too. James Lico : Yes. And I would just say that guide represents record operating margins in the first quarter for Fortive. So I think when you just look at, we do have some expenses that start back up at the beginning of the year, obviously, salaries and some of those things. There's a little bit of that. But at the end of the day, if you just step back, record, that will be a record first quarter for, in the history of Fortive. Julian Mitchell : And then my follow-up would just be -- is typical, I suppose, you give guidance for year one and then someone asked about year two. But if I look at Slide 14, you do have that, I guess, it seemed medium-term when you gave it but you've got $450-ish million or maybe $430 million [ph], excluding capital deployment number for 2025 and obviously, a year from now, that will be a formal guide whatever you end up giving not a medium-term aspiration. So I guess I'm trying to ask kind of how, given it is only 11 months away now, that period how seriously should investors treat that number of $450 million [ph] does require a fair amount of M&A over this year. So any thoughts around the M&A market backdrop. One of your acquisitive peers were saying it's maybe looking a little bit better now. James Lico : Yes, a couple of things. I think when you look at our history in terms of double-digit EPS growth and the compounding free cash flow, I think, it's not an enormously to get to that $450 million. That's why we put those numbers out there a year ago and we reiterated them in the guide and on the presentation. So we obviously feel good long way away, a lot can happen but we feel good about it. I think relative to the M&A market; we just closed a quarter where we did basically 5 deals -- between including kind of closing in the early part of January. So it's across the board in every segment, a variety of different sources from private equity to private ownership, founder-led companies good breadth across a number of our workflows. So we feel really good about the M&A environment and we just demonstrated really good progress against the M&A environment. EA is starting off really well. And where we start -- we now think that's going to be accretive in the year, only right after closing it. So we've seen really good things there. So, I would say the -- what we've done, we're really proud of that work, good work that set us up well back to your comment about '25 would the EA and those other deals are going to be helpful in '25 for sure. And quite frankly, when you look at the environment that we're in right now, probably a little bit better. Certainly, we've demonstrated that and we want to continue to, as always, as you know, Julian, we're always busy and we're excited about the opportunities that are in front of us but we're also incredibly excited about the teams that have just joined Fortive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Just a couple for me. Just back on ASP and the Consumables growth, 7% sounds pretty healthy. Is there some kind of I don't know, kind of channel fill in the direct model that had to happen, as you looked from distribution to direct, there something abnormal about that number? What are you expecting for consumables growth in the U.S. for 2024? James Lico : We'll be in the mid-single-digit range. There's probably a hint of catch-up from Q3 there but not a lot of inventory build we would expect it to be mid-single digit for them across the board. And obviously, I wouldn't want to be a predictor of 7% every quarter. But as we said, we validated the strategy, I think, in Q4 with what we want to do as I mentioned, with the team last week, they're incredibly optimistic about where they stand today and where they stand for the year and in the future years as well. So I think we're in a good place. Jeff Sprague : And then just on EA, obviously, then didn't own it in Q4 but any color on how it grew in Q4? And can you just be a little more specific on what you expect for growth in 2024, again, to be in M&A but kind of the underlying growth in the business in 2024? James Lico : Yes. We, first of all, we closed the first week of January; we're off to a good start. 100-day plan is scheduled. We've got our [indiscernible] room set up with integration. Our teams are really excited about the work we can do together. As you remember, Jeff, when we announced the deal, we said we'd have the opportunity to take our big Tektronix sales force and sell those solutions. We started our annual sales kick-off over the last couple of weeks. A lot of excitement about that. Relative to, specifically to your question, December was a record order month for the business. So they ended the year strong and there's a tremendous amount of growth opportunities there, in front of us. They've got a good backlog situation. So we feel good. We feel good about the revenue base for the year and what that can grow. Obviously, it won't be in our core but until '25 but we feel good about the growth. Relative to we now think this is probably a mid-single-digit ROIC in '24 which is up from the original thesis around the deal. So we're already ahead of the game. Growth should be good. And we think the business is probably in the $190 million to $195 million -- $195 million range, that's probably where it will be for the year. So. So we're in a really good place with the business. It's a good team. As I mentioned before and it's going to, that's why I think when you step back and look at the deals we did, the previous question, we feel good about the year. 6% to 8% overall growth for the year stands up, obviously, EA being one of the big parts of that but the other acquisition is adding some as well. Jeff Sprague : And just I'm sorry, a little quick housekeeping one, too. Just the design piece of Invetech, is that a divestible business? Or are you just winding it down? And how big is that piece? James Lico : It's in the $20 million range of revenue breakeven. So it's, we'll look at a number of options. I think we've got, there are buyers out there for sure. The team is working on some different things. So the other part of that business is called [indiscernible] motion. So as you can imagine, it really was originally in our Sensing and Automation businesses. It's really -- it helps Life Science and customers but it's but like our other Sensing businesses, quite frankly, it has more of an industrial aspect to, from an OEM perspective. That business has done pretty well over the last few years. So we'll anticipate keeping that as part of the portfolio but we're going to look for options on the other time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : The word destocking didn't prop up in any of your prepared remarks which is a relief. Any color there in terms of inventory in the channel, Fluke, sell-in, sell-through, any issues there? James Lico : Yes. I think to the second part of your question, mid-single-digit POS growth at Fluke around the world in the fourth quarter. So, good solid growth. Down from the double digit we've seen for a while. But still, I think that would be, that we take that number pretty solidly. A little bit of destocking at Tek in the U.S. Single-digit millions but a little bit and some in China, maybe more broadly. I would say that that's, we now think China is likely to probably not grow in the year that's embedded in our guide and some of that is going to be just, I would say, less destocking than it is just conservativeness on the part of the Chinese distributor and Chinese channel partners to sort of see how the macro evolves out there over the year. But again, that's embedded in our guidance. Deane Dray : So just to clarify on China, that's flat for the year. Is the expectation? James Lico : Probably down low single for the year. So that would be our anticipation at this point. A couple of things there. Just starting what we've seen thus far is customers -- a little bit more conservative, as I mentioned. As you know, Deane, we've talked about this over the years. You really don't know China until you see March, you get out, you get to after the Chinese New Year, see how channel partners and customers are going to unfold for the year. We've seen more conservativeness up to this point, in the year. So our anticipation is that the year sort of progresses. We had a really tough comp in the first quarter in China. We had great growth in China last year in the first quarter but we would anticipate for the full year that China would probably be down about low single digit. Deane Dray : Great. And just one clarification for EA. I believe you said that you were targeting 100 basis points of margin improvement for this year and that it would be the Tek sales force would be selling. Did they come with a sales force at all? And where is that 100 basis points? Is there any kind of manufacturing efficiencies? What are the drivers around the improved margins? Charles McLaughlin : So Dean, a couple of things to unpack there. When we got EA and they just come with 40% incremental margin. I think the 100 basis points is about core growth that it adds to Tek, is what we called out. We would expect the volume growth that there's, do they go from 40% to 41%? Yes, that wouldn't be super surprising for them. But I think that was more about the impact on core growth for everyone for at Tek. And then on the sales force, I think Jim can give a... James Lico : Yes. I mean if they came with about a sales force of roughly 40 folks. We 10x that with Tektronix. We have the ability to sell that solution across the board. The teams are working through their cross-selling strategies. And one of the things we said when we announced the deal was that we thought a real opportunity primarily outside of Europe to really accelerate the business through the addition of the Tektronix sales force. So yes, so as Chuck mentioned, already a very profitable company. They had great growth too; they're a good growth company, a great growth company. And even with their size, they had growth at Tektronix and PT. So we're excited about that opportunity. Obviously, that's not the core for the year. That'll be in '25. So far, we really, we're really excited about the business joining Fortive. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, everyone. Chuck, maybe just a little more color on the expected AHS improvement in '24. Could you talk about Fluke Health, they were discontinuing product lines in '23, as you know, causing you some noise are they over the hump here in '24? And when you look at ASP, I know you're still building out your overall international infrastructure and supply chain. Are you over the hump there in terms of progress and how much restructuring is helping your margin in '24? James Lico : Why don't I take the first part of that. Yes, Fluke help will probably be in the mid-single-digit range for the year, so pretty close to the segment growth, maybe a little bit less in the first quarter and a little bit better, or first half and a little bit more in the second half. So but they are through some of the things that you described as well. Charles McLaughlin : With regards to the margin expansion, probably the bigger issue bigger driver behind the margin expansion at Health is the growth at ASP and the top line growth, getting through that just distribution and having Consumables in North America show up like they did in Q4. I think that's probably I had to score 80% of what's driving the margins there. Andy Kaplowitz : That's helpful, guys. And then maybe just a little more color on price versus cost expectation in '24? I know you said price Chuck but one of your industrial peers report today and reported quite rocky results in terms of its handling of the global supply chain. It seems like Fortive is handling supply chain quite well. Pricing obviously remains sticky. But could you elaborate a little bit what you're baking in for price versus cost and how you would rate the predictability at this point of the global supply chain? Charles McLaughlin : Well, I think there's a couple of things. In terms of the inflation we're seeing, we're seeing that come down and that's why you're seeing, the price we're putting into the market come down. But we will expect to stay ahead as we always do on the price cost. To supply chains, that continue to get incrementally better every quarter but that doesn't mean they're back to what we would call normal and problems can crop up from time to time. But we think that incrementally better is what we see there. Remember, we're not open to big commodity exposures that can cause maybe some of our peers or other companies that, we have a pretty good line of sight and great, every month, Jim and I are meeting with the OPCO teams hearing what we're seeing on inflation but it's trending the right way, meaning the rate of inflation is coming down. James Lico : Yes. And I would just add the proof points. Our gross margin expansion over the last several years has been very consistent. I think that speaks to our ability to manage the situation, not just on the price side but on the cost side and our working capital continues to get better and as we noted, as a percent of sales. So we're doing that while not having to have significant increases in working capital. In fact, our working capital is getting better. So we, I think what we'll see this year Andy, just to add on to that is that our teams have done a really nice job. We were just with all of our teams, a couple of weeks ago and they're doing a really nice job on design savings as well. So not only on the negotiated savings but also looking at design, what we call our value engineering effort. And our value, I think we'll have a, right now, our plans for value engineering would be, our cost reductions out of value engineering will be at a record in '24 when we deliver on that through the year. So a number of things we're doing to continue to stay ahead of price cost knowing that probably price wasn't going to be able to stay at those levels that we had over the last few years. We've always been a good price company. So we'll continue to get our fair share. But I think what we're also trying to do is really push our teams hard on the opportunities on the cost side as well. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : I'm not very good at the Star 1 thing. It's a skill, I guess. But anyways, the, a lot of questions have been answered but I'm kind of curious on ServiceChannel and proVation. If you combine those deals, combined, they're pretty darn important to the kind of long-term growth story. But pretty dilutive the first year and change. But where do you think you'll be in 2024 versus a deal model and those things combined, will you be back in the positive on those things? And I would imagine the compound, right? I mean the growth is so -- it should be high enough, the margin is high enough that the returns on capital kind of go through kind of hockey stick at some point. Are we there yet when you think about 2024? Charles McLaughlin : Scott, a number of things. First of all, from a top line standpoint and really the bottom line, we think we're on track to running ahead. So but I think when you're talking about dilutive as the ROICs come from low single digits, they're in mid-single-digit territory and accelerate going forward. So we think those two are right on. But accretive now that the, to the top line growth, so let me stop there and see if I understood that part of the question. Scott Davis : Kind of I guess kind of my point and perhaps you can do this after is that when you announced those deals, it was, I think that the language Jim used at the time is you'll be really happy we own these assets someday just given the growth rates. So I'm just kind of curious if you feel the same way? James Lico : Maybe just to give you a little bit. I think we were, we anticipated, if I remember correctly in the first year, $0.10 of accretion we ended up with $0.12 of accretion. So in the first year, we delivered on the accretion side. As Chuck mentioned, we're incredibly happy with these businesses, maybe just to take your point. You could see and that's why we really put them on the chart. When you look at the growth rates in the businesses, they're very strong. proVation was already a very high-margin business. One of the highest in Fortive already. ServiceChannel, obviously, was a breakeven business. So there were some concern, could we get that business into the sort of accretive margin rate that we see that's so strong and in Fortive and obviously in IOS and we're obviously there on the Fortive side and they're approaching the IOS side. So we feel really good in that regard. And the other part of it, we're trying to really make a point in that -- in the prepared remarks, Scott. I know you understand this but it's really how FBS has really made a difference here. You see the net dollar retention, where that's at, now, the ARR growth. The really FBS has really made it both teams, really embraced FBS on the growth and innovation front. They've done a nice job in that in a short period of time. And that's where, that's how you see the net dollar retention numbers which are obviously extremely good and the business is well positioned for the future. And to your point, also, they don't stop at 10% rights, right? They're going to continue. And if you've got 110% to a 112% plus net dollar retention margins in the structure and growing at this rate? Obviously, the [indiscernible] are going to go above 10% in the out years. Scott Davis : Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Just real quick guys. Does Invetech get worse before it gets better? Just partially just given Sprague's question on kind of the wind down or the sale of the design business but put these things you're selling into some pretty tough markets. But does that end up getting a little bit worse before it gets better in '24? Are we already there? Charles McLaughlin : I think we're going to run into some easier comparison in the second half and so it will stop being a tough compare for us. And I think that we need some of the dynamics of those markets to recover. Keep in mind, this is a business that's less than $100 million in total. And so it's not it's not quite as impactful as bringing some of these other movers like EA and ASP right now. James Lico : I would say, Scott, embedded in the PT core growth outlook for Q1, there's about a 1% headwind to core growth in PT due to Invetech. Scott Davis : It's a statement that you've had a good quarter when we have to pick on a $100 million business, right? So, good job. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason from Baird. Robert Mason : I may have missed this, Jim. But how do you think about your overall software growth in '24 relative to the 2% to 4% core growth? How does that roll up? James Lico : Yes. We feel really good about it, Rob. I think when you look at not only maybe starting with '23, we had really good growth in '23. We'll have high single-digit software growth in '24. So when we look at the ARR numbers, they're good. Obviously, we're just talking about ServiceChannel and proVation in the previous question. But I think across the board, [indiscernible] going to have high single-digit growth. So we feel good about where it's at. I think it's a testament to the strength of how FBS is really adding value and it's a testament to those businesses. and the work they're doing. We didn't talk a lot about AI but we'll start to see as we get into late '24 and '25, so some of our Data Analytics and AI solutions are also going to help the growth rates there. So we're in a very good place. And I think the strategy is playing out the way we anticipated which is those businesses would have more durable, higher growth rates and ultimately, that would benefit Fortive not only on the growth side but on the margin front. We certainly saw that in '23, you absolutely see that with our double-digit EPS kind of numbers that we'll show in '24. Robert Mason : Very good. Just as a follow-up, specific to Sensing. How do you, some of your semi cap customers are certainly starting to tee up expectations around a better '25I assume that's, you didn't mention that end market, specifically aerospace, defense, food and beverage, maybe do better this year. But how are you thinking about that market turning in that business for you, semi-cap equipment? James Lico : Yes. Well, in Sensing, we're about 6 quarters of negative order rates. So we don't anticipate to see the overall over rate start to change the book-to-bill there probably in and around 1, in the second half, for sure, probably starting in sometime in the second quarter. So we start to see things move. We didn't talk about it but number, maybe more broadly about Sensing. One of the things we saw in the fourth quarter was rather than get 12-month blanket orders which we would typically get with OEMs. We got 3-month [indiscernible] orders. So we will see that those orders pick up probably in the second half. So that's the state of the world. Relative to the semi index and where it's at, we're starting to see the green shoots of customers that are starting to talk about orders and our businesses that are maybe in the earlier stages there, a little bit of Setra, a little bit in our KEITHLEY business at Tektronix. they're starting to see customers talking about the second half of this year. So, we would -- I would think that just overall, we'll start to see some things. We're not anticipating a big step up there. We'll let the [indiscernible] patterns determine that. But we do anticipate at least seeing some of that turn in the second half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes. Just maybe and I don't know if, when you were talking before Sensing, you were specifically referring to Sensing or Tek. But maybe just to confirm, what's happening with Tek book-to-bill? And what kind of exit rate are we at a Tek right? Just sort of if you look at the peer orders, Keysight, NATI, you still have orders down, let's call it, mid-teens. So to understand correctly, we're thinking that based on the feedback we're getting on the comps, revenues will be up low to mid-single digits next year, right? Is that the right framework? James Lico : For Tektronix, we think business will be about low single digits for the year. So just from a revenue perspective, we've had 5 quarters of negative orders there. We'd probably see that in the first quarter. We'll start to see things turn. The book-to-bill starts to turn in and around the second quarter there; so just to kind of give you a sense. And that's -- we've had aerospace and defense has been good. It continues to be good. but it's mostly broadly around electronics and things like that. So some semiconductor customers as well. So and the comments I made around Sensing, semi, I also made a comment about KEITHLEY which is the most of the exposure we have in Tektronix relative the semiconductor. So we think the business is a good place. Obviously, low single digits in the fourth quarter against a 20% comp from a year prior. So still in a good place, record year for Tektronix from a revenue perspective. But probably a quarter or 2 here of absorbing, continuing to absorb some of the market dynamics we described and but the business is in a good shape and exit rate into '25 probably in a good place. Andrew Obin : And where are we on book-to-bill, sorry? James Lico : Well, I think in fourth quarter, probably 0.85, probably but we're always below 1 in the fourth quarter. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a broader question because it's certainly been a weird '23 and it seems like '24 is going to be strange as well. But I think at your Analyst Day and it's just sort of going back to Julian's question, you did outline the '25 target but you also outlined longer-term targets, right? And if you look at '25 target with sort of, I think, CAGR is 12.5% and longer-term targets, 13.5%, right? We printed 9% EPS growth last year. This year, target is 9% to 12%. I told to get there, there's cushion here, right? Invetech is out of the way. We're probably going to do some M&A. But from your perspective, what needs to sort of go back to normal change from a macro standpoint, what's the biggest lever that needs to change, right, to sort of get back \"normal\" where you guys can sort of accelerate EPS growth from what we've seen last year. And what we're sort of guiding to this year? Or is that all just M&A? Sorry for an extensive question but yes. James Lico : Well, I think when you look at our track record over 4 years and what we try to do is not take any one particular year because when you average them out, when we're talking about the out years here, we're talking about the average, right? And when you look at the average, they're not too different future versus prior history. So I think what passes a bit pull-off here. If you look at the success we've had over the last 4 years relative to EPS growth and you sort of fast forward, we continue to use our free cash flow. Obviously, we had interest expense a little higher last year than we anticipated which is why that number would single digit will delever through the year, as you know. So that has some improvements as well. But I think at the end of the day, we're in a very good place relative to those targets and I think this reflects it. So, there's obviously the macro is always a geopolitical situation. It's probably always one of those things you think about but that's why we said in the prepared remarks, that we've got some scenarios to continue to be agile and dynamic based on what the economic situation looks like it's the best way to say it. So Software and Healthcare is going to continue to compound at higher rates of growth and higher rates of margin expansion and that's going to continue to mix up the portfolio, particularly if you take a longer period of time, like in 2018. So I would say those are the dynamics. You've got to see continue to see those businesses continue to get better, like they will this year, like they've been doing and then continue to do the things that we've been doing relative to productivity and innovation that will continue to help us work through the various markets, secular drivers that we've attached ourselves to broaden the workflow. And I think the last thing I'd say Andrew, is the 5 deals that we did over the last 30 or 3 months or so, they all have an opportunity to continue to accelerate our compounding. They're all attached to good growth drivers. They're additive growth year and, from a margin perspective, from a bolt-on standpoint, they're all making their associated businesses better over time. And when you take a few years out, they're going to become a bigger part of that. So some of them are small. But if you take a 2-year or 3-year out period, you're in a, they'll be additive as well. So and then as I said, the M&A environment is still, looks like it continues to get better here and we're excited about that. Andrew Obin : And if I could just squeeze in one more. Should we start to think about Fortive as increasing dividends annually and some framework around share buybacks, maybe offsetting share issuance as long as we're there? Charles McLaughlin : Well, in terms of the dividends, what we've tried to signal is that as our free cash flow and earnings per share increase, our, you'll see our dividends increase on the same trajectory. With share buybacks, what we did is we restock to where we had, over the last 2 years, we've been opportunistic on buying some shares back. And we just went back to the level we had 2 years ago. M&A is still the priority. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from TD Cowen. Joseph Giordano : Just a couple on the M&A side and capital deployment kind of piggybacking on what Scott was talking about. So I mean, you highlighted proVation and you highlighted ServiceChannel. And I think it's pretty clear as to how companies like that can lever up growth and they can accrete to EPS and what they can do to margins. I'm just curious on like the ROIC of these things. Because I think like on proVation, the math was something like it needed to grow 15% a year and have margins expand to like almost to mid-50s from the mid-30s or something like that to hit like a 7.5% return in year 5, like, it looks like at least that slide suggests it's under those targets. So like how do you evaluate where you are in ROIC on deals like that? Charles McLaughlin : First of all, we look at our ROICs and go back to looking at where the revenue needs to be. Margins start to upgrade on probation as talked about and we're running ahead of where we thought we'd be on the top line. So maybe talk off-line exactly what the original assumptions were. But that's where we know we're at for both of those deals. And so we're on track or ahead of where we thought we'd be a couple of years in. I think the, so I think that's as simple as I can put it. James Lico : Joe, I would just maybe just add on is the reason why we highlighted these two companies two years out is because when we bought the companies, there were some skeptics, quite frankly, people didn't think we could get ServiceChannel margins into the 20s as quickly as we did. People didn't think that proVation would grow during COVID the way it did. So yes, I wouldn't necessarily say [indiscernible] these were slammed up because there were some doubters out there. And I think what we tried to do in, with two years in, it suggests, or to demonstrate that that, hey, we're exactly where we thought we were in case we're ahead of the game. We were ahead of the game first year out, as I mentioned in the previous call relative to EPS. So these businesses are in good shape. And as we highlighted back in May, these are, this is consistent with a number of the other deals and that's really what you see in '24 is the portfolio durability based on the success of those deals. So I would just add that into the broader the broader view of M&A and how it's continuing to add ROIC continue to get better and it's adding more durability and capability of the organization. Charles McLaughlin : And just to clarify, this came up earlier but the combined ROIC and certainly for proVation is already in the mid-single digit for '24-range. Joseph Giordano : Maybe to piggyback on that, like, you've done deals now across like SaaS type deals and you've done hardware-centric deals as you kind of run FBS through these businesses, I mean, it flexes different muscles that you need to use depending on these. Are you finding like one type of deal somewhat easier to accomplish the goals that you set up at the outset? James Lico : Well, I would say, certainly, hardware deals is something we've been doing for 20 years in there's, to use your muscle framework. There's a lot of muscle around that. You saw that in, even with some of the COVID challenges in ASP, our continued ability to do things like really improve the free cash returns on the business because of working capital. So I would certainly say that that's, those are things that we've done for a long time. But I think and this is really one of the reasons why we put it on the slide, is that we've really built tremendous capability around software, FBS for Software. And we didn't talk about it but we've now got an FBS suite of AI tools which are really helping drive innovation drive commercial activities for the Software broadly but also for the Software businesses. So we've really, I'm really proud. I said it in the prepared remarks around how the FBS in and of itself is getting better. And that really means more broadly. It's really, it is, I think what we're really proud of is the fact that if you look at the Fortive's portfolio today, FBS needs as much to a Software business or a Healthcare business or a Traditional Industrial business. FBS may mean different tools. It may mean different applications but the rigor and discipline is exactly the same. Operator : And we do have time for one last question. Again, this will be our last question of the day. The line comes, I'm sorry, the question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: First question just related to the price volume composition of organic and implying volumes kind of flat to up 1% for the year. And I'm trying to understand where kind of the upside risk might sit on the volume side and whether the embedded assumptions are more sort of moving sideways and there can be some upside risk on maybe easier short-cycle comps in the back half of the year? Or just how you've thought about that volume piece of the equation and if there's anything embedded within that as things getting better over the course of '24. James Lico : I think when you look at and I'll take the hardware business here. When you look at the hardware businesses, there's not a big inflection point as we go through the year. So probably I would say we don't see a big volume, we don't need a big volume inflection as we go through the year simply because of that. I would say, secondly, we're not really expecting a lot of restocking here. So I would say there's probably some volume upside to restocking if we were to see that. But I would say we're certainly not counting on that; and if it was probably more a second half dynamic. Joseph O'Dea: Okay, makes sense. And then on the productivity front, can you just talk about the margin contribution you anticipate from productivity in '24 and the degree to which that's kind of carryover from '23 actions or additional actions to drive kind of more productivity gains in 2024? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. I think that normally, we would expect 40% incremental margins. And for the year, we're going to end up at 45%. There's some puts and takes earlier in the year that that we've seen but we're seeing probably if you think about probably $0.07 or $0.08 of productivity coming into, from those actions that are selling into 2024. Joseph O'Dea: Meaning actions you've already taken and so that's just carrying into '24. Charles McLaughlin : We're done with the productivity actions, just the benefits are coming in, not that we're taking any more. Sorry about that. Operator : And I'll now turn the floor back over to Jim Lico for closing remarks. James Lico : Thanks, Kristina and thanks, everyone, for taking the time today. I know it's a busy day for all of you. Hopefully, what you heard today was our really the benefits of the work we've been doing for several years, both in '23 and how we anticipate '24 to play out. So we're, we feel very, very comfortable with where we stand today. Lots going on in the world, as many of you know but I think how we built constructed the portfolio over the last several years, post-Vontier, is we feel and expect to have a good setup for this year. We're certainly around for any questions. We want to thank everyone, for your support for '23. We know we'll probably see a lot of you out on the road here over the next few weeks. We look forward to that. And obviously, our team is available for questions and follow-up and then over the next several days. So, thanks. Have a great day. Have a great earnings season and we'll see you on the road. Operator : Thanks. Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Fortive Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Elena Rosman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rosman, you may begin your conference. Elena Rosman : Thank you, Dennis, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Elena. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin on Slide 3. We have a strong start to the year, exceeding our expectations for core revenue growth, margin expansion, earnings and free cash flow in the first quarter. Our strategy to enhance our customers' safety and productivity across a number of vital sectors, from manufacturing to health care, is delivering more value for customers and more durable growth for Fortive. We delivered better-than-expected performance in each of our 3 segments, reflecting enhanced portfolio positions, the benefit of innovative new products and our dedication to the Fortive Business System. By harnessing our unique competitive advantages and strong execution capabilities, we are confident in our raised outlook for the year, which includes anticipated double-digit adjusted earnings and free cash flow growth. As we look ahead, the success of our strategy is reflected in faster and more profitable through-cycle growth, which, combined with the rigorous application of a differentiated business system, delivers supportive formula for value creation by compounding results year after year. Further evidence of our strategy to build a more durable collection of businesses and higher recurring revenue profile is shown on Slide 4. Today, Fortive revenues are split with approximately half derived from highly differentiated products businesses, helping customers harness the power of emerging technologies and embrace the energy transition. As a result, today, roughly 1/3 of these revenues support customer investments in electrification and AI. Further, with the added benefit of diversification, approximately 60% of our product revenues have continued to grow despite select end markets slowing. Moving to the right side, the remaining 50% of our revenue includes approximately $600 million of recurring health care consumables, which are benefiting from the go-to-market changes we made last year and improved global health care markets driving faster and more profitable growth in 2024 and beyond. It also includes approximately $1 billion in software revenues, which have grown high single digits the last few years and will continue to be accretive to our growth and profitability. As our safety and productivity solutions across the enterprise continue to help solve customers' toughest challenges, we expect sustained outperformance going forward. Turning to Slide 5. The IOS segment is really a full manifestation of our strategic playbook to evolve the company organically and inorganically, to reduce portfolio cyclicality, align investments to secular drivers and increase through-cycle core growth. With almost $2.8 billion of revenue planned this year, IOS continued to build on its leadership positions in instrumentation, software and data analytics, all benefiting from customer investments in key megatrends, keeping the world running safely, efficiently and more sustainably. Over the past few years, we have expanded IOS' addressable market to $30 billion, adding companies that play in strong secular-driven markets, including the 4 bolt-ons last year. Within IOS, our scalable software business is now over $800 million in revenue, growing high single digit, helping customers streamline and digitize their workflows. Today, roughly 1/3 of this segment is now in recurring revenue models, and we have further built-in durability through the intentional diversification of end markets and customer use cases that we serve. As a result, Fluke has improved through-cycle resiliency with continued order and revenue growth despite contracting PMIs over the last 16 months. In facilities and asset life cycle, new logo bookings have grown double digits the last few years, underpinning continued strong multiyear growth. And in environmental health and safety, we continue to accelerate innovation and geographic expansion, driving faster growth in this platform. As you can see from the chart, this has culminated in sustained strong performance at IOS, including over 700 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion since 2019, providing an excellent blueprint for the future evolution of Fortive as we continue to execute our formula for value creation in AHS and PT. Turning to Slide 6. You can see how our portfolio is at the epicenter of the proliferation of electronics and sensors, enabling a more intelligent and sustainable future. Tektronix is solving our efficiency challenges across new and diverse end markets, benefiting from growing demand for high-performance computing systems, including academic and government institutions, defense agencies, energy companies and the utility sector. These new investment cycles start with semiconductors, then shift to infrastructure, and finally, to software and services. The addition of VA, the market leader for high-power electronic test solutions, will drive faster through-cycle growth in precision technologies, increasing their exposure to energy storage, mobility, hydrogen and renewable energy markets. EA is also benefiting from the rise in high-performance compute and deployment of AI and networks, which makes it an excellent complement to Tektronix. The transformation of the electrical grid is a long-term secular tailwind for both Qualitrol and Fluke. Qualitrol provides the world's energy grid with monitoring equipment and sensors to ensure the life stand and customers are adding considerable capacity to support infrastructure investments and new sources of energy. Lastly, at Fluke, we are ensuring the power efficiency and reliability of these global infrastructure investments, including tools to support the installation and maintenance of solar panels and the reliability and performance of EV storage equipment, including chargers and stations. Turning to Slide 7. Our increased innovation velocity is a direct result of our world-class business system and the work we've done to revamp our product development process to drive more consistent differentiated results. For example, in the last year, our teams identified over $1 billion of new revenue opportunities through the dream stage of our lean portfolio management process, leveraging benchmarking we did with other technology companies in our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs, to incorporate best practices and early-stage product development. As we prioritize new product development, we have reallocated roughly 25% of our R&D spend from the sustaining of legacy products to the funding of new product innovation. Fortive Software System is improving our feature on-time delivery as our operating companies are seeing a greater than 20% acceleration in software development time using Gen AI, creating bandwidth for higher value work and enabling faster innovation for our customers. FBS lean tools are also driving continued adjusted gross margin and operating margin expansion and industry-leading working capital metrics. Over the last 5 years, we've expanded adjusted gross margins over 400 basis points, operating margins by more than 600 basis points and reduced net working capital as a percent of sales by 550 basis points, with improvements in both our hardware and software businesses. In summary, FBS is fueling growth and innovation, driving differentiated operating performance, including higher free cash flow generation, our currency to further accelerate strategy and compound results through the Fortive flywheel for value creation. I'll wrap up on Slide 8. We're off to a strong start to the year. Core to our success has been the groundwork we've laid over several years to create more durable growth in each of our strategic segments, including at IOS, where we're seeing steady global demand for our products and technologies and continued high single-digit ARR growth. In PT, we knew coming into the year, that the normalized demand in Tektronix and Sensing would result in declining core growth in the first half, lapping strong multiyear growth rates. In the quarter, we saw demand for electrification and AI hardware, drive a return to positive book to bill in Q1. At AHS, we are seeing continued momentum in growth and profitability with continued consumables recovery and accretive software growth underpinning our outlook for the year. Turning to the right side. Continued execution in 2024 sets us up well for the achievement of the long-term targets we laid out at Investor Day last May, driven by an acceleration of software and nonrecurring products growth in 2025 and underpinned by secular investment trends; continued strong margin expansion, enabled by FBS-led innovation and operational improvement; and double-digit adjusted earnings and free cash flow growth, consistent with our long-term track record since 2019. We remain focused on enhancing shareholder returns with ample firepower to fund attractive M&A opportunities that will continue to fuel the Fortive formula for value creation. And with that, I'll turn it over to Chuck to take us through the details on the first quarter financials and updated outlook for the year. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. We're pleased with our Q1 performance, including 3% core growth, reflecting better-than-expected performance in all 3 segments. Total revenue growth of 4% included the benefits of acquisitions, partially offset by approximately 1 point of unfavorable FX. Highlights of our first quarter performance include record margins in the quarter, with 110 basis points of adjusted gross and operating margin expansion, reflecting outstanding operating performance. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.83, over the high end of our guidance, with adjusted earnings up 11% year-over-year; and free cash flow was $230 million, up 54% year-over-year, driven by strong execution across all 3 of our segments and some favorable [ trends ]. The trailing 12-month free cash flow is $1.33 billion, representing strong momentum towards our full year guidance of $1.39 billion. Turning to Slide 10 and the first quarter performance in each of our 3 segments, beginning with Intelligent Operating Solutions. IOS core growth was 5% in Q1, with consistent mid-single-digit core growth across all 3 platforms. M&A contributed 1 point to total growth, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Adjusted operating margins expanded 160 basis points to 31.8%, driven by favorable price realization and volume increases across the segment. Additional highlights include stable growth at Fluke, driven by the benefits of innovation and customer adoption in key growth verticals. Environmental Health and Safety had a steady growth in the quarter, with strong operating margin expansion enabled by pricing uptake and FBS-enabled efficiencies. Facility and asset life cycles continues its pace of double-digit SaaS growth, including multiple-accruing cross-sell deals with Red Eye and service channel customers. Overall, IOS is benefiting from a strong innovation pipeline, with several new product launches in the first half ramping as we move through the year. Moving on to Precision Technologies. Core revenue in the quarter was down 2%, driven by normalizing demand at Tektronix and Sensing. Total growth reflected the benefit of the EA acquisition, partially offset by FX headwinds and the divestiture of certain product lines of the Invetech. We've completed our 100-day integration plan for EA, and we are more confident in the strategic value of the combined businesses, having identified significant opportunities in the sales funnel, some of which combine EA's power supply offering with Tektronix services to better serve customers. PT adjusted operating margins expanded 80 basis points to 24.4%, reflecting accretive EA margins and productivity initiatives. Additional color includes Tektronix declined mid-single digit, as expected, driven by normalizing demand in China and slower growth in the U.S. due to delayed customer R&D investments. Sensing Technologies was down mid-single digit, with order trajectory improving as we move through the quarter, while utility and food and beverage markets remain strong. PacSci once again had double-digit growth in the quarter. Now on to Advanced Healthcare Solutions. Q1 core growth was 6%, driven by improved market conditions and consumable. Adjusted operating margins expanded 200 basis points to 24.2%, driven by strong volume growth and price realization, more than offsetting FX headwinds. Additional highlights include ASP is benefiting from the North America channel transition completed last year. Further, as hospitals continue to focus on safety and compliance and the increasing need for energy efficiency, ASP is gaining share with their proprietary hydrogen gas plasma technology that consumes 70% less energy per year than steam sterilizers. Book health benefited from growth in biomedical quality assurance equipment as well as supply chain and operational improvements. Our AHS software businesses continued their pace of double-digit SaaS growth. Censis is boosting sterile processing productivity with their next-gen AI\u00b2 instrument recovery platform, with strong new logo bookings in the quarter. And new customer wins at Provation were partially offset by lower year-over-year license revenue, driven by a large customer order last year. Turning to Slide 11. You can see total growth in the first quarter of 4% was driven by expansion in the core and positive M&A contributions, partially offset by an approximately 1 point of FX headwind. By region, we have low single-digit core revenue growth in North America, with growth in all segments despite normalizing hardware product demand. Western Europe core revenue was up mid-single digit, driven by backlog conversions and secular investments supporting energy transition. Asia was up slightly, driven by low double-digit growth in India, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in China. And growth in IOS and AHS was more than offset by expected slowing in PT. Turning now to Slide 12 and our guidance for the second quarter and the full year. For the second quarter, we anticipate revenue growth of 2% to 3%, with core flat to 2%, driven by continued strength in IOS and AHS, partially offset by core mid-single-digit decline in PT, consistent with our prior view of the first half performance; adjusted operating profit margin is estimated at approximately 26.7%, up 75 basis points year-over-year; adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $0.90 to $0.93, up 6% to 9%; and free cash flow of $270 million, reflecting double-digit growth in the first half. For the full year, we continue to expect core growth of 2% to 4%. Total growth is now expected in the range of 4.5% to 6%, including an approximate $60 million FX headwind versus the prior guide and the partial Invetech divestiture reducing revenues by approximately $30 million. Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 9% to 13%, with margins at 27% to 27.5%. We are raising adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $3.77 to $3.86, up 10% to 13% year-over-year to reflect the strength of the first quarter. The effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%, in line with the average of the last 2 years. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.39 billion, representing 11% growth year-over-year and a 22% free cash flow margin. Before opening up for questions, I'll pass it back to Jim to provide some closing remarks. James Lico : Thanks, Chuck. I'll wrap it up on Slide 13. The strong start to the year and an enviable track record of improved through-cycle performance, our transformation execution and strategy to build a more durable company is playing out. However, our strategy is reflected in the continued momentum of positive core growth over the last 14 consecutive quarters, even as demand slowed in select end markets. And the strength of our execution and dedication to FBS is reflected in 15 consecutive quarters of adjusted operating margin expansion, delivering more value to customers. When taken together, we are confident in our raised outlook for the year, continuing our track record of compounding earnings and free cash flow growth double digits in 2024. By executing the Fortive formula for value creation, we think the best is yet to come, with an opportunity to roughly double our adjusted EPS and free cash flow over the next 5 years. With that, I'll turn it to Elena. Elena Rosman : Thank you. Dennis, we'll now take our first question. Operator : Your first question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a first question around the Precision Tech revenue outlook. There's clearly some concerns from the commentary of one of your [ oscilloscope ] or instrument peers today. So I just wondered how you're thinking about that Precision Tech revenue growth trajectory over the balance of the year and particularly in Q2. And maybe any broad color on how that product hardware orders and how those have been trending versus what you'd expected? James Lico : Yes. Julian, thanks for the question. I would say a couple of things. What we saw in the quarter was a book to bill -- I'd start with the sort of high-level. We saw book to bill of about 1, and we anticipate that book to bill as well in Q2. So we're starting to see the orders come back. Obviously, shipments, not yet. Probably on a revenue basis, probably PT is lower, Q2 will probably be the low point.  We don't have a huge step up first half to second half. The first half is really playing out the way we anticipated. So in that sense, we're seeing an order book building. We're seeing -- we said last call that we would start to see orders, start to move to growth at the tail end of the second quarter. Everything we've seen, thus far, would support that sort of trajectory. So we've seen some green shoots in some places. I can talk more about that. Things like Tektronix, where our Keithley business, which has tended to lead the effort on the return and was the first to go down, is now going to be high single-digit revenue growth in the first half. So we're starting to see the things that would certainly point to that trajectory change. I'll stop there and see if there's a follow-up. Julian Mitchell : And I guess, sort of broadly on the guidance adjustments, you'd laid out your segment sort of core growth guide for the year last quarter. Just wondering if any of those had changed this time? And just trying to understand sort of in the P&L guide, the adjustment to the interest expense guide. Is that sort of a redeployment of divestment proceeds or something? Just trying to understand that sort of net income raise, with adjusted EBIT guide slight reduction? James Lico : Yes. Relative to the revenue guide, obviously, what we saw in the quarter, a little bit stronger than we anticipated for Q1. We feel good about that on the backs of health strengthening. We've had several good quarters now at Health, that's a mid-single digit for the year, and we feel good about that. IOS, similarly, good strength there. We stood out in a number of places. Fluke has been very resilient as we talked about. PT is down a little bit.  So we're probably more down to the flattish up slightly. So we'll be able to -- with the other 2 segments being better. And I think, the other thing, just on the absolute terms is we absorbed, as we said, about $60 million worth of FX as well. So important to just kind of look at the total revenue growth here as the ability to absorb that, I think, really speaks to the strength that we've had. And certainly, as you see that in the -- even with the weaker PT, we were up 80 basis points of margin expansion. So I think the power -- we're certainly seeing good growth in the 2 segments, and we're managing exceptionally well the trajectory of PT right now with strong margin expansion and with things that are occurring that are going to give us confidence that the second half improves a little bit. We don't need a big step-up at PT in the second half in the total dollars perspective, and what we've seen, thus far, supports that. And I'll let Chuck talk a little bit about some of the other details. Charles McLaughlin : Julian, the interest expense came down primarily because, since the last time we guided, we went out and put a euro bond in place. And so that came in better, like 3.7% coupon. So that's the major change. That roughly offsets the impact -- OP impact of the FX. Elena Rosman : And just to put that in dollar terms, that's about $15 million of lower interest expense versus our previous forecast. About $2 million of that was reflected in first quarter. And then to Chuck's point, about the $50 million roughly of OP hit that we do have from FX. So that's really the offset. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Just a couple of things. Just on the comment on the FAL businesses, this grew mid-single digit and kind of normalizing. Is that basically the trajectory you're expecting then for kind of the balance of the year in that group of companies sort of mid-single-digit growth? James Lico : No, Jeff, we'll get that -- we'll be moving back to high single. We had a really big comp at Gordian in the first quarter. I think they were plus 25% a year ago. So ARR growth for that was about high single digits, it was roughly 9%. So good ARR growth that supports sort of high single-digit growth for the year. Jeffrey Sprague : And then just on EA's performance actually in the quarter, right? The M&A impact, I think, is influenced by the divestiture, right? But so just trying to kind of understand how EA, actually, revenues performed in the quarter? You didn't own it last year, but maybe give us some sense of kind of what the growth trajectory was there? Charles McLaughlin : Yes, Jeff, a couple of things. FX, it pushed EA's revenue down a couple of million. And then divestiture, about $5 million, with the agreement to separate some of the Invetech business that shows up on that line. So I think he is impacted by those 2 things, down about $7 million. Elena Rosman : So Jeff, the dollars from EA, obviously, were higher than the overall M&A dollars in aggregate for PT. So EA is roughly $35 million, offset by about $5 million [ worth ] of tax. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Jamie Cook : Just a follow-up on the PT revenue guide. I know last quarter, you specifically guided to the $2.42 billion to $2.465 billion. I'm wondering, on Slide 4, you implied PT is $2.3 billion. So is that the actual revenue guide? And can you comment given the lower revenue guide, how you're thinking about margins relative to your prior guidance? And then my last question, on the M&A front, I think before you were saying top line M&A would add, you'd get 4 points. Now you're saying 3 points. Is that just FX and Invetech? Elena Rosman : Yes. So Jamie, just on the prior guide, yes, the $30 million has come out of the PT revenue from Invetech. And then to your point, there's probably another 2% that's come out due to FX. Some of that is obviously for EA as well as the core business. So that $2.3 million is the midpoint of the PT revenue guide as you pointed out. Jamie Cook : And then your margins on PT, can you give us an update there given the lower rev? Elena Rosman : Yes. No change to the expectation of margins for PT. James Lico : Yes. Jamie, I think that's a reflection of -- and certainly, as we said, not a lot of -- no real change here to not much change in the outlook relative to that. The first half playing out pretty much like we saw so -- we've seen some business move into the second quarter or second half, excuse me, but we've been able to manage the margin front exceptionally well based on a couple of scenarios that we thought the year would play out. So a number of places in PT that we've got strength at EMC, we talked about utilities, our food and beverage businesses. So we've got some good strength there in a number of places. And obviously, that's helpful to the margin front as well. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : A couple of questions. So first, just if we want to start with M&A and kind of mark-to-market your pipeline, is there -- should we -- or could we assume that the EA type of deal is -- and valuation range is kind of the type of stuff that you guys are looking at in '24? I'm sure it's a wide range of properties, but trying to just narrow that down a little bit? And perhaps just a little bit of a mark-to-market on how that pipeline looks. James Lico : Yes, sure. I would say, number one, is there's probably a wide variation of valuations out there right now. You've seen some -- you haven't seen a lot of things trade, but there have been fully valued trades that have gone on relative to various things in the marketplace. Both things we'd be interested in, but also things that just have occurred. I would certainly say that we're obviously going to stay very disciplined. I think what we tried to highlight on the IOS slide in the deck was the benefits of M&A and how that really has created that really durable segment with both from a standpoint of revenue growth, but also really strong profitability. And we're going to look for those kinds of things. I think the 4 deals that we did, the bolt-ons we did in the fourth quarter relative to IOS, EA, as an example, those are more than likely, but there's a wide spread of things we did, right? We did some software. We did some data. We did some hardware businesses. The funnel looks that way, but we'll remain disciplined right now around valuation. And I think we're well served to sort of continue to be active, but at the same time, be selective around the opportunities. So I think we can get some things done for sure. But by the same token, I think we're going to remain disciplined. And we like to -- the revenue for EA has come down a little bit for the year. We really feel good about that deal. We're still going to -- the accretion on that is still going to be the same as it was relative to our original thought process. So it's still going to be a very accretive deal and a really good deal into '25. So those are the -- certainly the kinds of things we'd be active in for sure. Scott Davis : Okay. Helpful. And then just to go back to the guide, and honestly, I never ask about a specific guide in this way. But if you look at your comps, if you look at the commentary or just think about what you've said over the last hour and then think about where ASP is at, I would think that, that guide for the year -- rest of the year, seems a bit on the conservative side. Is that -- would you characterize that? Is it perhaps just being a little bit cautious on China or just general global macro? Or am I in the right ballpark that maybe this is you guys just being a little bit conservative. And if nothing changes, perhaps you'd probably at the higher end of that, if not higher. James Lico : Well, we just beat our first quarter guide. So that's the first thing. And there was an operational beat there of about $0.01. And they're really $0.02 when you look at we offset the FX and then $0.01 of corporate cost. So it's a good -- I think it was a good start, a very good start to the year. I said that in our prepared remarks. I think if you said, hey, hey, Jim, would you like to get out of the gate at 110 basis points of gross margin and operating margin expansion? Or would you like to drive EPS at 11%? I'd say that's a really good start. And I'd say our full year looks a lot like that, too. So we like the guide. And what we tried to highlight is, yes, there is some uncertainty. I would tell you, I was with the China team a week ago. And they're feeling better about where they were versus, call it, 8 weeks ago when I was with them the first time in the year. They were much more optimistic. We would talk to some of the quality productive forces, investments that China is talking about. So we still have -- we still sit right now in our guide, embedded in our guide is China being down. But at the same time, there's probably some opportunity of some of the Chinese government active investments occur because those are in places that are very subsequent important to us.  Our other high-growth markets are already growing. Interestingly enough, our other high-growth markets, which are bigger than China, are growing mid-single digit, there probably some opportunity there. So it's still early. And certainly, there's a lot of things out there that you could say could go another way, but -- well, we really got out of the gate really well and feel really good about it. And we'll work every day to make it better for sure. Let's see where we get through in the second quarter. But yes, there's certainly some opportunities. We tried to highlight like energy transition AI, the percent in product revenue is at some places where there's certainly opportunity for us to continue to do well. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Just following up there. I heard yet another AI reference, a lot of references in the prepared remarks. So where would you rank order -- you don't have to go through them all, but what are the most important exposures where you have near-term, real-time leverage to the AI build-out? James Lico : Well, yes, I think where we showed on the slide in high-performance compute and in data center expansion, the chips that are going to go into data centers, as an example, next generation. We got an 8-digit order from a Keithley as an example for that in the quarter that will ship later in the year, with some semiconductor manufacturers in Taiwan.  So I would say, first and foremost, we're seeing it on the chip build-out. We're certainly seeing that. We're certainly seeing it again with utility infrastructure and grid infrastructure growth at Qualitrol and Fluke. Those would certainly stand out as direct investments relative to the preparation of AI and the future of the world.  So -- and then on the flip side, we're starting to launch AI solutions, Deane. So when we think about what we're doing at Censis, Provation, Gordian, the's quarter we just announced the Gordian platform, which allows for us to integrate all of our data and solutions together. So we'll start to see some of those in our revenue base. It's selling AI solutions as well. So on the front end, we're seeing the early stages of that investment. And with -- primarily within PT, we'll start to see that play out. We're starting to see that play out in Keithley. We'll start to see that play out of Tek in the second half.  And then, obviously, with Qualitrol and Fluke certainly with -- as those data centers and things get built, we're going to certainly participate in that relative to both the electrical grid infrastructure needed to support that as well as the tools needed to sort of build those data centers and maintain them as well. Deane Dray : Great. Those are real specific data points, so I appreciate your sharing. And then as a follow-up, and I might have missed it in your answer to Julian's question, but the weakness in Tektronix you referenced, what was the delayed customer R&D in the U.S.? Is that just -- is it product cycle related? Is there anything related to worries about the election that's starting to read through some hesitation in orders? James Lico : Yes. Deane, I think, well, the first half is going to play out at Tek almost identically to exactly how we thought it would play out. So I don't want to -- I want -- I should say that first. I would -- well, certainly, what we see is some delay on what I would call [ MilGov ] investments that we typically start to see early in the year. They're still in the funnel. They're now showing up maybe later in the year. That's both direct government customers as well as some of the primes. So that's a movement of that.  The good news on that is we're seeing them in the funnel, and they're growing in the funnel. So -- and we're starting to see some of those orders, hence, the book to bill is over 1. So we're certainly starting to see those things. Generally, we would have been able to convert them to revenue maybe a little sooner. But because the funnel's moved and because some of those things have come a little bit later in the end of the second quarter, then that really presents it for more of a second half opportunity. But at this point, we wouldn't see those canceled. And I don't think we tie those to the election. I think we'd probably tie that more to just investment decisions that people have made with some uncertainty as the year started out maybe delaying some of those investments. As you well know, sometimes those investments can get delayed for a quarter or 2. But ultimately, I think, as you said, our customer base or the leading technology companies in the world, are they going to not invest in technology and innovation? I think it's a good test they're going to do that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Can you just delve a little bit more into Tektronix and the book to bill there? I know you guys mentioned the hardware in total. Book to bill, but maybe just give us an update on maybe where the, I guess, excess backlog, if that's even a thing still. Kind of where the excess backlog sits and then Tektronix' book to bill, and then what you'd expect for growth for the rest of the year there at this stage. Elena Rosman : Yes. Steve, Tektronix' book to bill was 0.95 in the quarter. For PT, Sensing and Tek combined is 1.0, and for hardware products overall was 1.0. And then we talked about Tektronix revenue being down mid-single digit in the quarter. Our expectation would be that Tektronix revenue for the year will be down mid-single digit, but that's always been reflected in our outlook for the year. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. So no change there. And then maybe just sticking on book to bill. I think it's like a little bit hard to like calibrate these EA revenues, I guess. We had expected something a little bit more than where it was, and I'm not sure we've quite bridged the gap on that. But what's, I guess, the book to bill for that business just to kind of help us understand what kind of run rate they're going at on the EA side, that new acquisition? Elena Rosman : Yes. I'll just really quick on the numbers for EA, and I'll let Jim comment on the acquisition overall. We had expected revenues for EA for the year to be, call it, $190 million, $195 million. That's come down. It's probably closer to $180 million to $185 million. Part of that is foreign exchange, and part of that is some push out of larger projects in the year. Specifically, in Q1, right, the revenue, we talked about the $35 million, again, we have planned for something in the low 40s for the quarter. There is a seasonal component to that. And maybe, Jim, you want to talk a little bit more about, certainly, the kind of 100-day review and give some color on the acquisition. James Lico : Yes. Steve, I would say a couple of things. One, as we said in the prepared remarks, we -- one of the things that's really evident and certainly have been around the world, not only with the U.S. view of this, but China, India, a number of other places, we clearly see a great product that customers really like. So I think, as we start out, we really affirmed the fact that the product and the technology is really, really strong.  As Elena said, a little bit less revenue in the first quarter. I mentioned this in a couple of places in the first quarter that getting the backlog out in that business has been a little bit more challenging than anticipated in terms of that. So book to bill, I think, was over 1 in the first quarter. But our opportunity to sort of continue to work FBS and make the factory a little bit more flexible and, certainly, we're in the process of doing.  We've come down a little bit on the -- on what we think the revenue will be for the year. We still think the accretion is the same. So we're still going to deliver, from an earnings perspective, in a very good place. And we feel good about the business. So mobility is a little bit slower. We anticipated that mobility would be slow this year. That was certainly in our view. And so that's played out. But the data center opportunities are very good. And quite frankly, the funnel with Tektronix is building well. So we said we need -- we were going to build that funnel in the first half. We would start to see that revenue in the second half. And we feel good about the funnel build, thus far. We mentioned one of the opportunities on the prepared remarks around how now we're linking their sales with our services with a large-scale order that we'll get here shortly. We feel really good about the synergy opportunity as well. So maybe taking a little longer to get started, simply because of maybe some of the things in the marketplace, but feel really good about it right now. And we're in a good position for that business as it stands to finish the year and move into '25. C. Stephen Tusa : And where do the excess backlog stand today? That's my last one. James Lico : Yes, I'm not -- forgive me, I'm not sure what that number is, but it's probably in the, I guess, in the $10 million-ish range or something like that. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. So normalized. James Lico : Yes. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim, just in AHS. I know you did well in the quarter, and maybe you talked about some potential upside there. You did mention maybe some Provation headwinds still. Is there anything that's still holding you back at all from even better performance, with the understanding that it was quite good in the quarter? James Lico : Yes. I mean we're really happy about the quarter. And if you think about the number of quarters here, obviously, we had the transition in North America last year. But if you look at what we've done multiyear and high-growth markets exceptionally well. The strength of the strategic nature of what we wanted to do is really playing out well. So we feel very good about where ASP is at. We feel good about the broader segment.  Relative to Provation, we -- in the first half of last year, we had a large-scale license software business order that we're going to work through in the first and second quarter. That business will still grow well this year. SaaS is growing double digit in the business. So we really feel good about where Provation is. But we do have to work through that large license customer that it's kind of -- plays out a little bit more of a onetime opportunity. Good news about that, it's a very large license deal that we're going to be able to convert fast over the next several years. So in terms of opportunity, there's still great opportunity to Provation. So we feel good about where the segments stands. We mentioned in some of the prepared remarks,about some of the -- what things we're seeing around our plasma strategy and the efficiency and efficacy of how we do hydrogen peroxide and all that. So the product and innovation wheel that we started to talk about, steam sterilization, BI, biological indicators, a number of the things that we're really -- we're trying to work through over the last couple of years. We're starting to see the innovation flywheel get started at ASP. And so we feel good about where the segment is at and where it's going to go through the year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Great. And then I know you reiterated it, but like when I think about the [ 450 ] for next year, like there's a fair amount of moving pieces nowadays, FX, M&A, as we talked about. So what's your confidence level, Jim, at this point? And what do you need to do to sort of get there? James Lico : Well, I think, number one, I think the first quarter affirms what we're able to do, right? With the growth rate that we had in the quarter, we still drove strong EPS growth and strong free cash flow growth. Our guide demonstrates that. So we get to the end of the year, double-digit earnings growth, double-digit free cash flow growth, really strong operating margin expansion, a great setup for -- and a little bit on a not mid-single-digit growth yet. So as we move into mid-single-digit growth and our track record of earnings growth, free cash flow growth and margin expansion, I think those are the things that give us confidence.  Now again, it's April of '24. We're talking about a 2025, [ if I may ]. But at the end of the day -- or will be made here shortly. So I think at the end of the day, we're in a very good place to talk about '25. But obviously, we're very focused on '24 here. So -- and I think what we'll see through the quarters is the demonstration of that, the kinds of numbers that I think really support our multiyear path, which has been very good, and also our multiyear future. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So I hate to like retread. Ground has been trod on already. But -- so Elena, you mentioned Tek down mid-single digits. That was in the plan from day 1, down mid singles in 1Q. I'm just curious why things wouldn't get better in the second half of the year just given the comps? And therefore, my question really is, in second quarter, is Tek down sort of high singles, maybe a bit worse than that, some PT down maybe mid-singles? Just thinking about how we should think about the way this comes through the year? Elena Rosman : Yes. That's right, Nigel. And as we said in our prepared remarks that we expected PT to be down mid-single digit for the quarter. That would include Tek to be down slightly more than that. So in -- probably in that mid- to high single-digit range for Tek in Q2. Nigel Coe : Okay. James Lico : So then I would say, Nigel, that your point around inflecting getting a little bit better, that's the book to bill that we talked about. That continues to do good. Keithley is a good leading indicator. The PMIs are a good leading indicator. Our sales funnels are a good leading indicator. And so we'll step through a little bit better performance as we get through the second half. Elena Rosman : I think the other thing to consider, right, is that Tek did continue to grow revenues throughout all of last year. Nigel Coe : Right. Okay. That's clear. And then the pricing of PT, I think, was about 1 change, 1% or so for the year -- for the quarter. It's been a bit of a decel versus the run rate. Is there a risk that, that could go negative or flatten out completely, given the weakness in volumes? Charles McLaughlin : Nigel, this is Chuck. I wouldn't expect that to be the case. I think there's a little bit of timing here. But as we move through the year, we expect that probably in PT, we had, I think, 1% to 2% and gradually going up as we move through the quarters. James Lico : And Nigel, just to add, price/cost is in a good place. So when you look at the margin expansion that we did in PT in the first quarter and the anticipated margin expansion through the year, we'd probably get a little bit less price when the top line is like that. It's not unnatural to maybe not maybe give a little bit up. But the price/cost stance is really good. So we're in a good position to be able to do that and still grow margins. Nigel Coe : That's great. And sorry, a quick one on EA. The 1Q seasonality for kind of the full year, is this a business that typically has a weak 1Q and then a back half loading in the plan? James Lico : Yes. It's -- we're new to it. So we've got some multiyear history, but you have the numbers, you don't always have the history. It's certainly a business that has historically been back end weighted, that's for sure. So that private companies sometimes don't necessarily push everything until -- make sure the end of the year. So that's not unusual. And we'll get the cadence here improved every quarter as we work through the integration. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: I wanted to start on the 60% of revenue you talked about growing through the industrial slowdown and the PMI, I think primarily related to Fluke. But drill the question really around the ability to grow through PMI slowing. And to what degree you attribute that to outgrowing end markets or other factors that were at play for Fluke to post more kind of stable trends through some of those headwinds? James Lico : Well, I definitely think we're outperforming the market. And I think Fluke's done a great job. When you look at a number of things, obviously, an outstanding global franchise presence in every -- pretty much every country of the world. Team does a great job on the innovation front. We had 4 new product launches just in the first quarter alone. Our eMaint business is doing really well. So our Fluke reliability growth -- eMaint was up 17% in the quarter. So just as we look over the last several quarters, our ability to outgrow PMI has really been the long-term work we've done to make the business more durable. And that really is an end market story. Our solar and EV product lines grew over 30%. So it's really been redirecting -- we talked about in one of the prepared slides about our lean portfolio management or our product development process and how we're really designating those R&D investments towards more secular drivers. Fluke is certainly a good example of that in terms of what they've been trying to do over the last few years and the 2 bolt-on deals that they did in the fall, which really has supported and helped around those same secular drivers. So I think we're in a really good position in the business because we've been intentional about the innovation investments. We've been intentional about our commercial investments, and that's playing out. And certainly, share is always a tough thing because most of their competitors are our regional companies in various countries. So we don't have great numbers on market share. But as we look with our -- as you know, a good chunk of that business is with channels. And our channel partners are certainly excited about our partnership and what we can do together. That's usually a good sign of how we're performing. Joseph O'Dea: And then I also wanted to ask on ASP. I think consumables in North America was up 7% in the fourth quarter, just looking for what you saw in the first quarter and as you're sort of on the other side of the transition through go-to-market, how that's coming together to drive some of the consumables demand? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. For ASP, specifically, in Q1, I think we were up 11% in Q1, just pretty much right where we expected to be here. Now as we move through the year because that transition happened over the year, that's going to moderate some of that. But right on track and delivering the growth we expected and please see, as well as, importantly, the margin expansion. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Joseph Giordano : On Fluke, obviously, that business has been remarkably resilient. Is that business, like you mentioned solar, is there a risk on -- an election risk there if policy changes shift? Or is that just -- could that just be offset by more positive trends within data center electrification, things like that? How would you kind of handicap that into an election if the administration changes? James Lico : Well, I think number one is we're more tied to the maintenance of those than we are to the construction of them. So in many respects, it's what's out there today. And so that's number one. Number 2 is, I think when you look around the world, certainly take a global view of solar, too, and you have a very good global opportunity. I would say the same thing about electrification. So -- and it's really more of the maintenance of those systems than the construction of those statements -- those situations. So much more tied to the maintenance -- the field maintenance of all of that. So I would say we feel very good about the opportunity. And I think, if you think longer term over the next few years, you'd probably bet on those things continue to be pretty good. So yes, I think we're much more tied to the -- I think the bottom line is we're much more tied to the maintenance of those -- the field maintenance of all of that. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And then just curious, with the numbers on EA lowering the top line a little bit, is that business still like 40-plus EBITDA margins at the lower revenue rate? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. Yes. It came out very strong. And actually, it's also why we're seeing that margin expansion at PT. That's part of the story. Operator : Today's final question will come from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. Andrew Buscaglia : So you talked to -- gave some good color around PT getting through the rest of the year, your margins really -- your margin guidance really implies quite a step-up in the back half. What are some other contributors, specifically within AHS, that might help that? And then specifically in IOS, your incrementals have been outstanding. But what's like a normalized incremental as we get through 2024? Charles McLaughlin : Andrew, I think the -- a couple of things to think about. We generally think about incrementals at around 40% in the base case. So that's probably a good place to start. When you're talking about the step up as we move through the year, we've got the top line with 48% of the revenue in the first half and 52% in the second half. So there's always this upward trajectory in terms of seasonality from the first half to second half, and that drives through more volume. And that's the biggest key to expanding the margins. When you look year-over-year, the 100 basis points that we saw in Q1, it steps up through the year because of volume and normal seasonality. We guided to 75 basis points for the year, and I think -- or more with the productivity initiatives. Health is off to a great start with 200 basis points. So we've got a lot of things going the right way, but it's really the volume falling through those in. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. And staying with -- just touching on AHS. The distributor transition is definitely helping you guys. Can you talk a little bit more about that business as we progress through the year? I think -- yes -- I think with the way that your incrementals have been strong there. Can you talk a little bit more about how that continues there -- as sustainability there? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. We've got that for health care. Keep in mind, it's early in the year, but 125 basis points for the year. But in Q1, you're seeing the full benefit show up with the dealer transition here in Q1. If you remember Q4 last year, it also saw the full benefit. And as we move through the year, there's going to be a little bit of stuff that we're getting into tougher margin expansion, but we expect to be over the $125 million margin expansion for the year at AHS. Very pleased with another strong quarter of really strong margin expansion and growth here, and we expect to continue that through the quarter or through the years. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Jim Lico for closing remarks. James Lico : Well, thanks, everybody, for the opportunity to spend some time today. We -- hopefully, you hear from us, feel really good about the first quarter. We feel really good about the full year. Obviously, some puts and takes relative to everything. But the guide holds, and it is raised. And so we feel, operationally, we're executing very well. From a margin expansion from an EPS perspective, free cash flow, we're executing really well. We love the fact that the trajectory on Health now after several quarters is in such a good position. And we've got a number of opportunities here that are really playing out, we're excited about. So hopefully that comes through. We look forward to the follow-up calls. I know our team will be available, and we'll see you on the road here shortly. Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes Fortive Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Elena Rosman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Elena Rosman : Thank you, Diego, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today\u2019s call. With us today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today\u2019s call. Information required by Regulation G is available on the Investors Section of our website at fortive.com. Our statements on period-to-period increases or decreases refer to year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise specified. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statement that we make today. Information regarding these risk factors is available in our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the day that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Elena. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. Our second quarter results showcase strong execution across our businesses, allowing us to deliver earnings and free cash flow at the high end of our guidance with 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 9% adjusted earnings growth, despite revenue at the low end of our guidance. Our performance continues to reflect our ability to adapt to the low growth environment and deliver differentiated financial results enabled by FBS-led innovation and productivity actions. Our leadership positions across durable growth markets are reflected in upside performance and Advanced Healthcare Solutions and continued momentum in Intelligent Operating Solutions positioning Fortive well for the future. As we look ahead, we are excited to see the acceleration of our innovation and new product launches, delivering more value for customers and sustained growth for Fortive. We are confident in our updated outlook for the year, reflecting strong growth in our recurring revenue businesses and continuing our track record of mid-single-digit through cycle core growth and compounding earnings and free cash flow by double-digits in 2024. Turn to Slide 4. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our second quarter and year-to-date results, as well as what we\u2019re seeing as we look ahead. Second quarter revenues were up 2% with flat core growth. Acquisitions contributed 3 points to growth, partially offset by a foreign exchange headwind. Strong operational execution contributed to record second quarter adjusted growth and operating margins, and earnings per share of $0.93. Year-to-date, we achieved 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and double-digit earnings and free cash flow growth on 3% revenue growth. Turning to what we are seeing across our businesses, Intelligent Operating Solutions and Advanced Healthcare Solutions continue their momentum, benefiting from durable and recurring revenue, as well as new product introductions aligned to secular growth drivers. This demonstrates the success of our capital deployment strategy in these segments, where we continue to focus our bolt-on efforts to further enhance growth. Across Fortive, our recurring revenue is now 42% of our portfolio growing low-double-digit year-to-date, we expect that pace of growth to continue in the second half. Government spending delays broadly contributed to revenue coming in at the low-end of our second quarter guide, primarily driven by delayed military and government R&D projects impacting Tektronix, as funding continues to be prioritized to production-related programs, and slower job order contracting growth at Gordian, as they lap government stimulus funding in 2022 and 2023. Orders of Precision Technologies were down in the quarter as expected and book-to-bill was stable at 1.0. Consistent with our prior outlook, we expect orders to return to low-single-digit growth in the third quarter. However, our updated 2024 revenue outlook does reflect a slower than expected recovery in certain end markets and PT in the second half of the year. We are offsetting lower revenue with new productivity actions and have reflected the delay in global minimum tax implementation and our tax rate guidance for the year. Chuck will cover the outlook for the rest of the year in more detail shortly. Lastly, our free cash flow performance continues to differentiate with industry-leading free cash flow margins allowing us to repurchase 2 million shares in the second quarter and continue that pace the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 5, I will provide more detail on second quarter segment performance as well as our expectations for the full year. Intelligent Operating Solutions total revenue growth was 4% with core up 3%. Acquisitions were favorable, partially offset by an FX headwind. Adjusted operating margins were down slightly versus the prior year, although up approximately 400 basis points on a 2-year stack, with strong price realization and volume growth more than offset by growth investments. Additional highlights include, Fluke revenues were up low-single-digit plus, including mid-single-digit industrial products and double-digit ARR growth in the quarter, a strong proof point of our efforts to make the business more resilient. Fluke\u2019s bolt-on acquisitions, Solmetric and Azima DLI, continued outperform contributing to Fluke\u2019s growth in the quarter. EHS grew low-single-digit paced by recurring revenue contributions, including strong SaaS and iNet growth, partially offset by slower product sales at ISC. FAL grew mid-single-digit, or mid-teens on a 2-year stack, with continued normalizing growth at Gordian and lapping the wind down of pass-through revenue at service channel. FAL maintained its pace of high-single-digit SaaS growth, and we expect to see that reflected in accelerated core growth in the second half. For the full year, we expect the IOS to deliver mid-single-digit core growth, with approximately 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Precision Technologies was down 1.5% in the quarter, with core decline of 6.6%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures contributed 6 points to growth, partially offset by FX. Adjusted operating margins were down slightly year-over-year, with lower core volumes almost fully offset by productivity benefits, favorable price, and M&A. Additional highlights include, Tektronix core revenues went down mid-teens as revenues normalized to bookings. We saw pushouts of large Mil-Gov projects in the Americas, and slower recovery in China, partially offset by mid-single-digit services growth. EA has seen large EV mobility and battery expansion projects push out, reducing its revenue outlook for the year to approximately $130 million. While sales cycles are longer for these large projects, EA has seen a doubling of the sales funnel on smaller run rate projects across industries, validating the go-to-market synergies with Tektronix and positioning the business well for 2025 and beyond. Sensing with down mid-single-digit in the quarter with continued strength in utility grid, food and beverage, and healthcare end markets more than fully offset by weaker industrial and factory automation demand. And lastly, Pacific Scientific delivered another quarter of mid-teens core revenue growth driven by robust demand. We finished Q2 with a stable one-to-one book-to-bill and are expecting revenue to return to growth in the second half. For the full year, we now expect PT growth down low-single-digit with adjusted operating margins approximately flat. Advanced Healthcare Solutions revenue growth was 3% with core growth of 5%, partially offset by unfavorable FX of approximately 2%. Adjusted operating margins expanded 260 basis points with strong volume, price realization, and productivity benefits more than offsetting growth investments. Additional highlights include, ASP Censis grew mid-single-digit, driven by double-digit consumables growth, enabled by the successful North American channel transition at ASP, and new doors and cross-sell expansion at Censis. Fluke Health Solutions was up low-single-digits with double-digit dosimetry services growth. Provation grew low-single-digits, lapping a large prior-year licensing win, while SaaS revenues up nearly 50% in the quarter. Given the strong first half performance, we now expect AHS full-year core growth to be at the high-end of mid-single-digit, with over 150 basis points of adjusted OMX for the year. Moving to Slide 6, several short-cycle industrial markets, served by our Precision Technologies segment, faced headwinds in the second quarter. We saw continued customer caution, weighing election and macro uncertainty, contributing to OEM and channel weakness, and further CapEx-related project delays. North American revenues were up slightly, benefiting from mid-single-digit growth at IOS, driven by strong industrial and software growth, mid-teens growth and healthcare consumables, and continued strength at PacSci, partially offset by lower Tektronix revenues. In Europe, we saw revenues normalized to bookings, with a mid-teens decline at PT, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in IOS and low-double-digit growth in healthcare. Core revenue in Asia was down low-single-digit, driven by slower government spending and distributor de-stocking in China. Japan was up mid-single-digit or better in all segments, and in India we saw slower growth, given election uncertainty, impacting project timing at Tektronix. Core growth for the quarter largely centered on our high growth markets, excluding China. These regions have now eclipsed China in size and account for approximately 14% of sales. Looking ahead, we expect improvement in core growth in the back half of the year, driven by favorable order rates, as well as continued strength in AHS and software. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Chuck to talk through our updated third quarter and full year guidance. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I will provide our Q3 outlook, as well as an updated outlook for the full year. For the third quarter, we anticipate revenue growth of 3% to 4.5%, with core growth of 2% to 3.5%, driven by continued momentum in IOS and AHS, and roughly flat core growth at PT. Adjusted operating profit margin is estimated at approximately 27%, up over 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $0.92 to $0.95 of 8% to 12% and free cash flow is expected to be approximately $360 million. For the full year, total growth is now expected in the range of 3% to 4%, approximately 1.5% lower than the prior guide driven by the revised outlook at Precision Technologies and further FX headwinds. Core growth is now expected to be in the range of 2% to 3%. Adjusted operating profit margin is still expected to be in the range of 27% to 27.5%, up 100 to 150 basis points year-over-year. Note, we have offset roughly half of the operating profit shortfall related to the lower revenue with productivity actions, and as a result, we are still expecting to average 60 incremental margins given the proactive restructuring we did coming into the year. The other half of the earnings offset is coming from a lower effective tax rate now expected to be approximately 12% for the year. As a result, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS range to $3.80 and $3.86, up 11% to 13% year-over-year. Looking at the right side of the slide, you can see the benefits of our portfolio transformation improving the through cycle durability and growth rates of the portfolio. Fortive\u2019s continued growth is enhanced by increasing level of recurring revenue and our focus on innovation, which I\u2019ll highlight on the next slide. Over the last 8 years, we have been intentional about building a proven tool set around how we prioritize and develop new products, bring them to market faster, drive greater returns on R&D investments and deliver differentiated value for our customers. We have several examples of how our increased innovation velocity is contributing to core growth with a pipeline of new products, including in Q2 Fluke launched its new EV charging station analyzer, which allows technicians to perform multiple tests with a single tool. FAL recently launched the Gordian Cloud Platform, an integrated cloud-based capital planning tool, and a current space intelligence, a comprehensive real estate planning and space management optimization plan. NPT, Tektronix, continues to enhance its oscilloscopes platforms, bringing more power analysis tools to the engineer\u2019s bench. They recently launched the 4 Series B, with more powerful processor system to speed up analysis for power converters being designed for a broad range of industrial applications. At ASP, new innovations are also enhancing core growth. They recently secured U.S. FDA approval on a new steam monitoring biological indicator, which allows them to ramp up sales on this product in the second half of the year. FBS is driving success as we identify and expand the new growth market, speed innovation cycles, and maximize investment returns across all three operating segments. For example, we reduced the amount of sustaining engineering spend as a percentage of the total by roughly 20% and redeploying the savings to fund future growth with new products and software features. As a result, we have created a funnel of over $1 billion in new market and revenue opportunities, roughly 3x [ph] was just 3 years ago. AI has also been a key enabler to our success, although we are still in the early innings. We created our vision several years ago with the establishment of the fourth, our incubation hub and center of excellence for AI and machine learning. Coupled with our partnership with startup studios, Pioneer Square Labs, we test new AI ideas developed by our operating companies. In Q2, our teams incubated seven new growth ideas, some of which are likely to become new 40 products while others potentially new startups. In summary, we view R&D as a high return investment and a critical driver of our improved through cycle growth, operating leverage and return on invested capital. With that, I will turn it back to Jim to provide an update on our long-term targets. James Lico : Thanks, Chuck. I\u2019ll continue on Slide 9. Our revised full year outlook yields double-digit adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth in 2024 and keeps us well on path to achieving our long-term targets. While we\u2019ve seen both tailwinds and headwinds since we first issued those targets, you have also seen how we\u2019ve adapted to the lower growth environment in 2024 and still raised our earnings guidance through the year. This is a testament to our culture of continuous improvement and our relentless focus on delivering for shareholders in any environment. We also still expect to generate over $8 billion in free cash flow in the next 5 years, which allows us to further accelerate earnings growth and shareholder returns through disciplined and accretive capital deployment. Our priority remains bolt-on acquisitions to existing growth platforms in areas of demonstrated strength, while also enhancing returns to shareholders. We continue to believe share repurchases are a good use of capital, and we expect buybacks in the range of 5 to 6 million shares for the year consistent with our recent track record. Further, we announced our first dividend increase in 2023 and plan to continue to grow our dividends in line with earnings and free cash flow. With a powerful combination of the Fortive business system and disciplined capital deployment, we think the best has yet to come with an opportunity to roughly double our adjusted EPS and free cash flow over the next 5 years. I\u2019ll wrap up now on Slide 10. With a strong start to the year and track record of improved through cycle performance, our continued strategy to build a more durable company is playing out, as evidenced by our strong growth and recurring revenue businesses. We\u2019re confident in the achievement of our revised 2024 outlook, which demonstrates the benefits of durable growth drivers and tailwinds from innovation investments, while de-risking the areas of protracted recovery. Our free cash flow generation continues to be robust, underscoring the differentiation of the Fortive business system and the compounding capability of our portfolio. By executing the Fortive formula for value creation, we are poised for higher returns on invested capital. The deals we\u2019ve done since our inception continue to get better, and we remain disciplined on further capital deployment to enhance value creation. With that, I\u2019ll turn it to Elena. Elena Rosman : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Diego, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please state your question. Scott Davis : Hey, good, I guess, morning to you guys, Jim, and Chuck, and Elena. James Lico : Hi, Scott. Scott Davis : Hey, Jim. I wanted to dig in on R&D a little bit. Is it fair to say you\u2019re seeing the impact of R&D on the margin line but not on growth yet? Or is there any way to kind of tease that out a little bit? James Lico : Yeah, sure, I think really both. What we tried to highlight, and obviously we did last quarter as well, is to give a sense of, one, how FBS is really moving a portion of our sustaining engineering capability into innovation. That obviously has a long-term compounding effect, but we\u2019ve been doing that for several years now. And I think some of the examples that we talked about that Chuck had in the prepared remarks are certainly evidence of better growth. Fluke\u2019s durability here is certainly part of their engagement in our new product development process. We talked about the FDA approval on a product at ASP that takes a little longer in healthcare to really see that. So certainly on the gross margin front, because we\u2019re pretty disciplined about making sure that products that we launch, if they\u2019re replacing products, they replace them at better gross margins, which is really more value to the customer. And then you\u2019re seeing also in a number of the places where we\u2019ve got tailwinds relative to growth, part of that is certainly an innovation story. Scott Davis : Okay. Makes sense, Jim. I\u2019m just looking at Slide 9. I\u2019m trying to use \u2013 I\u2019m trying to figure out what\u2019s implied here on capital deployment. Can I get to your 5-year with buybacks? Is that this white part that\u2019s capital deployment upside, is that buybacks plus M&A? Could it be entirely buybacks? Is it possible to get there with the current plan? Charles McLaughlin : Yeah, Scott, this is Chuck. Well, clearly, we\u2019ve already done some M&A, but we do include buybacks as part of our capital deployment. So we think that with the bolt-ons that we did in the fourth quarter and what we\u2019re likely to do going forward, we still think that we have line of sight to that accretion 2025. Scott Davis : Okay. Best of luck, guys. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. James Lico : Yeah. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please state your question. James Lico : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning, Jim. Maybe just first off, so just trying to understand the sort of revenue guide for third and fourth quarter. So I think last year your sales were down low-single-digits sequentially in Q3, and then up mid-single-digit in Q4 sequentially. It looks like this year you\u2019re assuming sort of flat sequentially Q3 and then up mid-single-Q4. But I guess versus last year you have a smaller backlog today and there\u2019s more macro uncertainty. I think it\u2019s fair to say. So maybe help us understand sort of the confidence in that revenue outlook, please? Charles McLaughlin : So Julian, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments first. What we\u2019ve got in here is basically normal seasonality, maybe even a little bit less. I mean, you just look at the percentage in the first half versus the second half. And also, as you go forward from Q3 into Q4, obviously we\u2019ve got a couple of \u2013 we\u2019ve got IOS and AHS really showing up as we would expect, and then we\u2019ve de-risked PT going through there. But we think that we\u2019ve got a pretty reasonable breakout between both of those quarters in terms of the revenue. James Lico : Hey, Julian, I would just say on a 2-year stack basis, they look pretty similar from where we\u2019ve been. And so that gets into the comp question. We do think \u2013 we will see orders grow here in PT in the second half. So I think it\u2019s an important distinction is that we will see some of that comps, obviously, so we will see a little bit of order growth in the second half and we\u2019re confident in that happening. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up looking out to the fourth quarter on Slide 12, so you have that a very hefty margin increase dialed in there sequentially going from 27% to 29%-plus. Yeah, when we look at sort of last year\u2019s fourth quarter, I think the PT margin was flat if we\u2019re looking at sort of some of those sequential moves, I guess, what gives us that confidence on that very large sequential increase? Is it all top-line? Or is there something coming in around cost savings anything else perhaps that\u2019s really pushing up that that margin so much sequentially? Charles McLaughlin : So when I look at it from going from Q3 to Q4, we\u2019ve got about the same dollar step up going there and that\u2019s falling through sequentially usually don\u2019t love sequential margins, but about 60% falling through from Q3 to Q4 to get to those margins that\u2019s really approximately the same dynamic that we demonstrated last year terms going up that that sequential incrementals from Q3 to Q4 and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got built in here. So nothing other than that is really about the top-line. A little different if you go by segments, but I think you can see it\u2019s really just the top-line step up. It\u2019s the biggest piece of it. James Lico : And that overall yearly incrementals at 60% we think shows pretty well, I think, it speaks to as we\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks the proactive restructuring that we did at the beginning of the year. The continued productivity actions that we\u2019ve taken throughout the years we\u2019ve seen things, I think, gives us confidence in that sort of margin expansion if you think about first half of the year about 100 basis points of margin expansion in the first half. So, a really good launch point in which to get to and as Chuck described, the incremental is very similar to what we\u2019ve seen in previous years. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please state your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Or good afternoon. James Lico : Good morning. Nigel Coe : So, Chuck, I think you mentioned PT flats organically in 3Q. That\u2019s obviously a big improvement from down to 7. I don\u2019t understand the 2-year stack, but when we look at the sequential, I think it\u2019s up 3% PT Q-over-Q, which again is unusual. So, I\u2019m just wondering some of these delays you called out to military and government. Are you assuming that comes back in the third quarter? And then maybe on top of that, just talk about, what we\u2019ve seen in the channel, sell-in versus sell-out. Are we seeing some big impacts right now? Charles McLaughlin : So I think you\u2019re right, there\u2019s a bit of a step up, mostly from probably a big deal that moved from Q2 to Q3. Otherwise, I think you\u2019d see PT revenue looking about flat, and that\u2019s the single biggest difference. As Jim mentioned, we expect bookings to return to positive growth in Q3, and I think that also helps. And then you\u2019ve got some quick down, we\u2019ve got a couple of businesses in PT, Qualitrol, Anderson, and EMC, name three, that are actually helping with that step up as well. Elena Rosman : I would just add, Nigel, that on the inventory level, we do see distributor inventories are largely pretty normalized across all the regions, which does give us confidence in the order rates returning to growth in the second half. Nigel Coe : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then a quick one on EA, the 130, I mean, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re shocked by the EV and battery produce delays, but I think the impact on revenues is surprising. And I think the second half is lower than the first half. So I\u2019m just wondering to what extent do you think you\u2019ve now de-risked that outlook, and sort of how much battery EV revenues are remaining right now in the EA? James Lico : Yeah, we don\u2019t have a lot \u2013 we really de-risk the EA at this point. I think we\u2019ve seen for a few quarters, we had always come into the year knowing that EV in particular would be low, but we did have a number of projects in the funnel that the customers were fairly confident that those would happen in the year. As we progress through the year, those have gotten pushed and pushed. And so we\u2019ve decided to just mostly de-risk all of that out of the year. So we really, unfortunately, that\u2019s not going to be in the year, but we still those orders have not disappeared. What we\u2019re really seeing is we haven\u2019t seen the step up in some of the other aspects, broader battery storage as an example. So, we\u2019re really on track, we\u2019re actually ahead of the game on our synergy opportunities in the funnel. So, we\u2019ll see a little bit, certainly, that\u2019s probably going to be a 25 aspect too. So, I think the net-net on all that is, Nigel is, we\u2019ve de-risked the year, we continue to see the industrial logic of the deal, strategically, product, technology, all of those things, but certainly we\u2019re putting in a little bit of a pause from a customer investment perspective and that\u2019ll those \u2013 we continue to believe those will happen sometime in 2025. Nigel Coe : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Nigel. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Chase. Please state your question. Stephen Tusa : Hi, guys. How\u2019s it going? James Lico : Hi, Steve. Stephen Tusa : Can you just talk about just the industrial \u2013 more the industrial software parts of the portfolio, putting probation aside, what just broadly you\u2019re seeing there? I mean, you mentioned a couple of businesses and their growth rates. What is the total growth rate for those businesses and any theme you\u2019re seeing there on customer budgets, perhaps going to more direct AI applications as opposed to ones that are going to weave it in over time? James Lico : Yeah, Steve, we had a very good quarter for software. So if we were to think about FAL as an example, mid-single-digit in the quarter, but ARR was up high-single-digits growth. So we still believe FAL will be high-single-digit for the year. We had a little bit of a different probation after a couple of years of what we would call accelerated growth, more on the reoccurring part of the business. Generally, we\u2019ve seen a lot of budget flush relative, because of stimulus in 2022 and 2023. We didn\u2019t see as much of that flush in this year, but we continue, we have a number of new customers starting in the second half of the year, particularly in the federal world. So we really feel good about Gordian in particular as we get in. Accruent continues to improve. Their order growth rate has been very good for the first half of the year and service channels very good as well. So we see that inflecting in the second half of the year really a couple of points, because we were good \u2013 we were high-single-digit in the first quarter, I think. So if we just take FAL in general, our gross dollar retention is at 99%, very strong. Our net dollar retention is 102, 103. We\u2019ve seen some really \u2013 we\u2019re probably not seeing it, to your question, maybe a little bit of new logo distancing than what\u2019s normal, but as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, both Gordian Cloud and our space intelligence that are current, we\u2019ve now got even better innovation into the market in both those businesses. So we think the demand environment for those opportunities is really good as well. So we feel good about that. On the intellect side or an EH&F side we continue to see good SaaS growth and intellects as well. So we\u2019re getting a high-single-digit range. So we\u2019re in a good place here and quite frankly, I think, we\u2019re making some great opportunities for us into the future with a number of innovations that we\u2019re excited about both in the second half and into 2025. Stephen Tusa : And then, lastly, you guys are doing a pretty good job of delivering on expectations, but looks like there\u2019s a bit of upside needed in consensus to hit that your long-term target next year. When would you kind of reevaluate that the 450 number or act to get there whether it\u2019s kind of paying down debt? Or like when would we kind of reevaluate that EPS target, because The Street right now is obviously comfortably below that not moving very much? James Lico : Yeah, I mean, I think we\u2019ve always thought 450 is both aspirational and but achievable. We talked about the competence in the prepared remarks. We certainly got some tailwinds and headwinds. A number of the tailwinds we talked about, like healthcare and the new product innovation, and certainly some of the software businesses I just described. A little bit of headwind, but there\u2019s a couple \u2013 we\u2019ve talked for a couple quarters now that there\u2019s a few ways to get there. The buyback maybe a little bit of accelerated on the buyback front. Obviously, M&A, EA is going to be a little bit of a headwind, but our bolt-ons, the other four bolt-ons we did last year are all accelerated and are over-delivering as well. So, yeah, we\u2019ll certainly update that number. But as we said \u2013 and we said continually, if I think about the starting point of the year, we\u2019re going to beat our EPS this year, but we\u2019re going to get there a little differently than we anticipated in January, but what we know to be true is we\u2019re still going to beat that original EPS target. Number of ways \u2013 we\u2019ll always have tailwinds and headwinds, and we\u2019ll certainly give an update on that as we get closer to 2025, for sure. Stephen Tusa : Great. Thanks a lot. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Jeffrey Sprague : Yeah. Hello, everyone. James Lico : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Hey, hello, I hope everybody\u2019s doing well. Hey, I just wanted to put a finer point on tech specifically, make sure, at least I have it dialed right, maybe for the benefit of others also. Can you just clarify what is the expected performance for tech specifically for the year and what was it previously in terms of year-over-year revenue decline? Elena Rosman : Just on the core growth at tech, we now expect it to be down a low-double-digit in terms of revenue. Previously, we had expected it to be down mid-single-digit flow. James Lico : Yeah, Jeff, just a little bit of color on that, probably. I would say. the two things that have really changed. One, we described some of that Mil-Gov business moving out. And then after moving a few times, we decided to take some of that out. The second piece is China, we\u2019re not seeing the recovery in China we had anticipated. As you know, the Chinese government had put a number of incentives into play in the back half of the \u2013 the end of the first quarter. One of those around replacement investments we thought would get more traction in the economy and it hasn\u2019t. So it\u2019s really those two things that are the big changes relative to what we\u2019ve seen. So as Elena just said, you know, we\u2019re going to be down low-level digit. And if we step back for 3 years, that\u2019s still going to average of mid-single-digit growth over a 3-year tagger will still be even with that number of mid-single-digit. Jeffrey Sprague : And then maybe just \u2013 I don\u2019t have all the comps in front of me. I\u2019ll dig them out after the call, but just then the progression into the remainder of the year for tech, you said orders are expected to be up. Will that convert relatively quickly to revenues? How would you expect the revenues to kind of play sequentially off this Q2 level? Elena Rosman : I would say on a year-over-year basis, our expectation for tech core year-over-years is going to be down in that low-double-digit range for Q3 and Q4. There\u2019s a slight uptick, as obviously some of the orders that we\u2019ve already seen in tech will turn to revenue, but it\u2019s really still a down low-double-digit in both Q3 and Q4 on a core basis. James Lico : We are seeing some longer-cycle aspects of the business that are setting up for order rates or shipments in the late part of the year and early part of 2025. Jeffrey Sprague : Got it. Thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there. I appreciate it. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good day, everyone. James Lico : Good day, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, I want to circle back, it\u2019s related to Steve\u2019s earlier question, but we\u2019re hearing more issues in the software side about risks of churn and disintermediation by some cheaper AI-enabled products. This has come up on other calls. Are you seeing any issues, and maybe specifically for Accruent and Service Channel? Thanks. James Lico : We\u2019re not. And in fact, both Accruent and Service Channel aren\u2019t going to accelerate through the year from a core growth perspective. So, this is always dated back to our workflow strategy, Deane, in many respects, where we really were working really hard in our assessments of businesses that we wanted ones that had real vertical expertise, some of which was built on our hardware experience. And so, we\u2019ve got real opportunity to provide some AI solutions into our workflows as well. We mentioned Gordian Cloud is a good example. We now bring together all of Gordian\u2019s solutions into one cloud offering. So we feel really good about the position of those businesses. We are always looking for competitive threats, no matter whether it\u2019s AI or any other competitive threat. I also think the scale positions that we\u2019ve got in some of those places while they\u2019re niche, they\u2019re good positions. FAL were the number one player in the market is an example, probation would be the same. So as we move into the healthcare side of the house. So, I think, we\u2019re in a good place to take advantage of AI. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, seven new ideas that we\u2019re working through in the business relative to just this last quarter with our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs. So we\u2019re going to continue to really look for AI as a solution set. But to your specific question, we\u2019ve not seen any disintermediation or competitive threat at this point. Deane Dray : Great. That\u2019s really helpful. And then one for Chuck. Maybe just give us some color and context around the lower tax guide for the second half. What\u2019s driving that? Is that mixed? Is there anything one-off like a reversal of an accrual? Just if you could share that. Charles McLaughlin : Well, there\u2019s always a lot of things going on in tax, Deane. But the big thing by far here is to move out of the pillar too for us. Minimum global tax rate isn\u2019t going to impact us this year. And so that pushed out, and that\u2019s the single biggest thing. Deane Dray : Thank you. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please state your question. Joseph Giordano : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. James Lico : Hi, Joe. Joseph Giordano : How would you respond to someone who says that you guys are being a little bit late to the party in some of these cuts to some of the cyclical markets? Like when I see tech, this is two quarters in a row. But some of your competitors have been at the top. I think you\u2019re arriving at the right place. Just so you\u2019re getting there a little bit slowly. And then like with EA, I believe we were talking almost 200 at the beginning of the year, right, now we\u2019re at 130. So how would you respond to that kind of comment? James Lico : Yeah, I think we\u2019re close to 185, 190-ish, I think, but that\u2019s probably close. Some of that\u2019s FX. I wouldn\u2019t say relate to the party. But obviously, what we\u2019ve seen is some things that are abnormal to what we\u2019ve seen in the past. As an example, even last year when orders were tough, that Mil-Gov segment was really strong. We\u2019ve got a multi-million-dollar repeat order that moved, that we did in the second quarter of last year, that has moved into the second half and we\u2019ve cut in half. So that\u2019s an unusual, we had real good line of sight to that. That\u2019s a piece of the move. The other is we\u2019ve typically seen, I think over 20 years, the Chinese government\u2019s actions get traction. So I think those things maybe are a little unique to us but maybe not. So I think we\u2019ve certainly been prepared for it from a cost perspective and that\u2019s why you still continue to see the strong margin and EPS growth for the year. But I think at this point it\u2019s appropriate getting into the year with 6 months left to take stock of where we\u2019re at and that\u2019s our story. Joseph Giordano : And if I\u2019m thinking on M&A now, I\u2019m guessing you guys you just did a big deal and you\u2019re buying back some stock, but if your M&A from here is going to be a little bit closer to home, closer to existing assets, like how are you thinking about where you want to go like near-term? Is it more about like, hey, this is something that\u2019s under pressure, we can get a good deal, but there might be downside? Or are you more like inclined to pay higher for something that is moving in the right direction you feel more confident with the near-term growth outlook like how what\u2019s that calculus like internally? James Lico : Well I take stock of what we\u2019ve done over the last several years and we typically do one to two deals a year from a bolt-on perspective. But when you think about the recurring revenue that we have now 42% of sales growing in low-double-digits, all of that is acquired assets. So we\u2019re really seeing the benefit and the resiliency of the acquisition strategy that we\u2019ve had and now that we build these foundations those four bolt-ons that we did last year all into the workflows and growth platforms we have today. We think we\u2019re seeing the benefit of that and so that those are real strong opportunities for us we\u2019ll continue to do that. But, again, we\u2019re going to be selective and while we remain busy on things. You\u2019re not seeing a lot of deals transacted this year thus far, and I think that\u2019s because you continue to see seller interests very often not aligned with buyer interests. And so, we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined and we\u2019re in a great position given the number of deals we did in 2023 to continue to work on those and make them a great part of life. We have the deals that were in 2019 and 2020 and 2021 that you\u2019re seeing the benefit of play out in 2024 for us. Joseph Giordano : Thanks, guys. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jamie cook with Truist. Please state your question. Jamie Cook : Good morning. Thanks for the questions. One, just on your guide for Europe and for Asia, you maintained your core growth guide for both of those geographies, however, sales core growth deteriorated in the second quarter relative to the first quarter for both of those regions, they\u2019re just trying to understand confidence level or is there recovery expected in the back half of the year? And then my second question, not to be nitpicky, but the IOS margins were down 20 basis points year-over-year. You still had core growth. You had positive pricing. You are maintaining your guide for the year, but was there any nuance in the second quarter that drove the margins down year-over-year? Thank you. James Lico : Thanks, Jamie. Maybe we\u2019ll take some of this with Chuck. Yeah, I mean, we brought Europe down a little bit. It\u2019s a little bit within the low-single-digit framework, so it\u2019s down a little bit from where we\u2019re at. We see healthcare has been really good in Europe as we see it continue. So there\u2019s some pieces of Europe that have remained pretty good. So on a core perspective, we brought it down a little bit. North America will be our highest growth region this year for sure, and that just speaks to all the parts of the business within North America, where a greater chunk of our recurring revenue is. But on the IOS margins? Charles McLaughlin : Well, IOS margins are like 34% or so, down nominally with a little bit of mix, but on a 2-year stack, I think there are 300 basis points. So we\u2019re very happy with those margins, and I would expect that you will continue to see that margin expansion continue at the normal rate in Q3 and Q4. Jamie Cook : And sorry, just to follow-up, you didn\u2019t answer on Asia, the guide is maintained. Even though Asia got worse, it doesn\u2019t sound like China is getting better. James Lico : China got worse within the guide, for sure. The rest of Asia is a little bit better. So I think where we stand now, China is now just about 10% of our sales and our high growth markets back to China are now 14% of our sales. So we\u2019re seeing good growth. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that India was a little slow in the quarter, but we see good India growth the rest of the year as one example. So we just think that the other parts of Asia will \u2013 we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that Japan was pretty good. So we think the other parts of Asia will hold up as they have in China, but we did, as part of our de-risking, particularly in PT, we did take China down for the year. Jamie Cook : Thank you. James Lico : Thank you, Jamie. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Please state your question. Robert Mason : Yes, good morning. Just wanted to see if you could comment on your pricing outlook for the balance of the year. A couple of your segments saw a step up. AHS and IOS saw a step up in pricing during the quarter and just how you\u2019re thinking about pricing for the balance of the year? Charles McLaughlin : Hey, Rob. We\u2019re thinking overall 2% to 3% a pretty good number. And, it\u2019s been coming down, the amount of price versus last year and the year before. But that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing about now is what I\u2019d expect to see in the second half. Now, in mind that healthcare, we work very hard to be able to get price into our contracts and you\u2019re starting to see that. So I think that pretty much holds going forward, but in that 2% to 3% range in the second half. Robert Mason : And then just a follow-up around EA. I\u2019m curious, Jim or Chuck, just how are you thinking about what\u2019s possible, the potential in terms of capturing synergies, some of the commercial synergies you\u2019ve talked about as you go into 2025. Yeah, against, if we end up at 130 in revenue this year and you talked about that funnel maybe doubling in smaller orders, what kind of contribution maybe we\u2019d be thinking about? James Lico : Well, we\u2019ll see what the number ends up being, because some of it will have been what we end up transacting here at the end of the year. But that number is, we think somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 million to $20 million right now and growing. So that\u2019s the funnel. So as we\u2019ve got, we won\u2019t collect all of that funnel. But that funnel is starting to build here. So we feel good about it. We\u2019re ahead of the game. Let\u2019s see where we transact the remaining part of the year and as we get into next year. But I think what we\u2019ve seen and as mentioned before is the technology is good. Customers like the business. We haven\u2019t seen very little cancellations from orders. It\u2019s just as we know a number of the customers have just delayed their investment cycle. But we still believe new battery chemistries are critical to battery storage. Data center battery storage is still going to be really important. EV mobility eventually will come back. So a number of the long-term growth drivers are still there. But we certainly are seeing a momentary lapse in some of the customer investments for sure. Robert Mason : I see. Thank you. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please state your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hello, everyone. James Lico : Hi, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Jim, you mentioned the 60% incrementals for the year. It was obviously quite good and partially based on the restructuring you did coming into the year. But what does that kind of performance tell you for how you might be able to bridge toward that 450 next year? Do you still see a good likelihood of above-average incrementals next year of healthcare, for instance, continue to recover and your short-cycle businesses do start to come back? Charles McLaughlin : Yeah, Andy, this is Chuck. We see, first of all, we\u2019ve got two segments, IOS and AHS, that are really on a good path into what we wanted them to be in 2025. And then, as you noted, we did productivity and cost savings out last year. And we\u2019ll be doing more of that in the back half of this year. It\u2019s not as dramatic, but to get onto the right glide path into that 2025 number. So we\u2019ll alter spend less, not slow the rate of the spending in there and then take a little bit of cost out, particularly in PT. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. It\u2019s interesting. No questions on AHS, they must be doing something right. So let me just ask you then, consumables out double-digits, hospitals seem to recover in the U.S. Does this seem like an extended period now of good growth for AHS and how you\u2019re performing in terms of improving the ASP business in China? James Lico : Yeah, the ASP business has been on a good run for several quarters and, obviously, we had some noise with the North American channel transition and the exit of Russia and a number of things. When you look across now the last several years, that\u2019s a good growth and we believe strongly that that\u2019s the benefit of the business. We\u2019re just now getting the innovation funnel going, right? We mentioned that the steam sterilization product that we just launched, which is a [seven second BI] [ph]. We\u2019re in a really good place from an innovation front. We\u2019ll start to get that innovation flywheel moving. The team has done a great job from a commercial success perspective. So we think ASP is an important part of the transition in health. And on the backs of Censis\u2019 SaaS revenue growth, we mentioned on the prepared remarks that probation SaaS business was up over 50%. So we\u2019ve got a number of good things. And obviously, we continue to improve the margins, the fall through as you described. And the previous question is good there. So we think we\u2019re on a good run here. There\u2019ll always be some puts and takes, but we feel good about it. We feel good about where we\u2019re at. And the team is doing a really nice job from an execution perspective. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color. James Lico : Yeah. Thanks, Andy. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. Please state with your question. Joseph O\u2019Dea: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you just sort of characterize a little bit what you\u2019ve seen over the past 3 months when we talk about EA? I think on the sort of sensing side within PT, you also noted some softer trends in industrial and factory automation demand. Really, you\u2019re trying to understand the degree to which, there were expectations for things to get a little bit better, and that just hasn\u2019t happened as things push to the right, or the degree to which things kind of softened sequentially over the course of the quarter, and then what you attribute that to? So any color there would be helpful. Operator : Please stand by. We need to just reconnect the speakers. Stand by, please. Thank you for your patience, ladies and gentlemen. We\u2019ll continue with the question-and-answer session. Go ahead, Mr. O\u2019Dea. Joseph O\u2019Dea: Hi. Thanks a lot. I just thought you hated my question, but I\u2019ll try again. James Lico : Sorry about that. Joseph O\u2019Dea: No worries. Basically, I just wanted to understand trends over the course of the quarter. I think we see kind of the reset on expectations of EA, I think in prepared remarks he talked about within PT and the sensing side, a little bit of softer activity in industrial and factory automation. And so I wanted to understand whether what you saw over the course of the quarter was sequential softening? Or if it was more a matter of earlier expectations for things to get better, and that\u2019s just kind of pushing out to the right? So, overall, just how you would characterize those trends over the course of the quarter? James Lico : Yeah, obviously, I would say healthcare was good throughout the quarter, IOS obviously with the software businesses, those are pretty consistent throughout the quarter. Fluke on the POS front actually got better in June, so that was \u2013 we haven\u2019t talked about Fluke, but we had a very good quarter with Fluke and should have a good year with Fluke. Our industrial business, the industrial group business at Fluke was actually up mid-single-digit in the quarter. So we feel good about some of the trends there that\u2019s a decent front on the non-CapEx side of our business. What we really saw in most cases was really the larger projects moving. So we tend to close those later in the quarter. It\u2019s the nature and the some of the way that business transacts Mill-Gov tends to be a little later in the third [ph] quarter. And we just saw those things pushed to the right now. Some of those things have been pushing for a few \u2013 as an example on the EA front, some of those projects were being pushed from previous quarters. So the de-risking really came out of really three things. Number one was seeing those projects continue to get pushed and now maybe being out of the shipment window at tech maybe more broadly a little bit more slower OEMs and some of the sensing businesses. And I would say finally is just the China recovery being pushed out. Those three things. And so, I would say that what falls into your expectation versus just what we saw most of it was things we saw maybe there\u2019s one expectation front probably is the China aspect. Well, we thought China might get better here in the quarter and it hasn\u2019t and now we anticipate that recovery is going to be slower through the year. Joseph O\u2019Dea: That\u2019s helpful color. And then just related in the conversations you\u2019re having with customers and as they sort of push things to the right a little bit what you\u2019re hearing from them in terms of why are they doing that? What are they waiting for how much of it is kind of macro and election and interest rates or other things that they\u2019re paying attention to and waiting on some spending as a result? James Lico : Yeah, I would call it a combination of uncertainty related to maybe geopolitical a little bit. That\u2019s kind of a global point, not as much a U.S. point, but certainly around the world. That\u2019s probably part of it, and I think some of it is macro uncertainty. Obviously, PMI is starting to recover, but maybe not around the world as quickly as possible, and so I think people certainly decided to hold off a little bit. And certainly on the Mil-Gov front, that\u2019s got a government spending aspect to it, uncertainty of what the defense budget is going to be. And obviously, you know, much of the defense spending is going towards production type things and the one thing you can delay is the R&D investments, and so a lot of that pushing out of the Mil-Gov piece is that R&D investment that is much more easy to push than obviously the production side of things. Joseph O\u2019Dea: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll hand the floor back over to Jim Lico for final comments. Thank you. James Lico : Diego, thank you, and thanks everyone for being on the call. We appreciate your patience as we switch phone lines here in Everett. We\u2019ll try to figure out what happened there. But obviously, we\u2019ve got plenty of time for follow-up calls and opportunities to catch up to give you more clarity as to what we\u2019re talking about today. As we said in the prepared remarks, the portfolio we\u2019ve built a lot of resiliency to see that. As I mentioned, on the recurring revenue growing in low-double-digits. We feel strongly about the importance of de-risking the year, while at the same time really being able to drive double-digit EPS growth, double-digit free cash flow on a little bit lower revenue than we anticipated. I feel good about where we\u2019re at right now strategically. As we talked a number of points we made on the call, we are seeing some market things, but obviously our share positions and our continued ability to innovate have never been greater. And so we feel the portfolio is in good shape to do that on a continuous basis. I look forward to talking to everyone on follow-ups, and if we don\u2019t see you before in the fall, have a great summer. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is Brock, and I will be your conference facilitator this afternoon. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Fortive Corporation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Elena Rosman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rosman, you may begin. Elena Rosman : Thank you, Brock, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. With us today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by Regulation G is available on the Investors section of our website at fortive.com. Our statements on period-to-period increases or decreases refer to year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise specified. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements we make today. Information regarding these risk factors is available in our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 27, 2024. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Elena. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin on Slide 3. Our third quarter results showcase strong execution across our businesses, allowing us to deliver earnings and free cash flow at the high end of our guidance with 14% adjusted EPS and 12% free cash flow growth on 3% revenue growth. Our profitable growth reflects our dedication to building a high-quality portfolio, innovating with new products, delivering more value to customers and our dedication to the Fortive Business System and culture of continuous improvement. Our leadership positions across durable growth markets are reflected in upside performance in Advanced Healthcare Solutions and continued growth in Intelligent Operating Solutions. We're pleased with the positive momentum and double-digit orders growth at Precision Technologies. Our updated outlook continues our track record of compounding earnings and free cash flow growth by double digits in 2024 while maintaining a balanced perspective on our end markets as stabilizing demand trends drive sequential improvement as we move through the remainder of the year. Looking forward to 2025, we are poised to accelerate our strategy and ensure consistent value creation as we progress toward the spin-off of the Precision Technologies segment. The separation remains on track. And as previously disclosed, we accelerated the pace of share repurchases in the third quarter, reflecting our commitment to value-enhancing capital deployment. So with that, let's take a closer look at our third quarter and year-to-date results on Slide 4 and give you some color on what we're seeing in our businesses. Strong operational execution contributed to record third quarter adjusted gross and operating margins with 60% incrementals in the third quarter on 1% core growth. These results extend our strong year-to-date operating performance with adjusted EPS up 11% and free cash flow up 13%. Turning to what we are seeing across our businesses in the quarter. Our software businesses once again posted high single-digit ARR growth. Hardware orders returned to growth, up high single digit with strong contributions from Fluke and Tektronix. While we continue to leverage FBS to mature our supply chain and increase production capacity to support accelerated demand at Qualitrol and PacSci, we shifted approximately $15 million in shipments out of the quarter. We also saw customers delay spending, including select Gordian state and local customers navigating budget and macro uncertainty. Lastly, consistent with our intent to deploy the majority of our free cash flow to share repurchases between now and the completion of the spin, we bought back approximately 4 million shares in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately 6 million. Turning to Slide 5, I will provide more detail on our segment performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, starting with IOS and AHS. On a combined basis, revenues grew 4% with adjusted operating margins up 130 basis points to over 30%, representing another quarter of consistent mid-single-digit growth and robust margin expansion. Moving to the right. Intelligent Operating Solutions expanded adjusted operating margins 50 basis points on 3% revenue growth, approximately 2% core. Acquisitions and FX were both favorable. Additional highlights include booked revenue was up low single digits in the quarter, driven by new product innovations; and continued success of recent bolt-on acquisitions, partially offset by customer shipment delays. Leveraging FBS innovation tools, Fluke launched five major new products in September, a record month for NPIs, extending their leadership position in solar and energy storage tools. Orders at Fluke were up high single digit with improving trends in most regions. Segment ARR growth was high single digit, driven by mid-teens growth in eMaint as well as traction on upsell and cross-sell revenues in FAW, driving an acceleration in SaaS growth and meaningful improvements in net dollar retention. For example, the Accruent and RedEye product integration teams are accelerating customer transitions to our cloud-based engineering document management solution. FAW is also seeing good traction on the recently launched Gordian Cloud Platform, driving new logo velocity in K-12 and higher ed growth markets. For the full year, we expect IOS to deliver mid- to single-digit core growth with approximately 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Advanced Healthcare Solutions expanded adjusted operating margins by over 300 basis points on 8% revenue growth or 9% core, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Key growth drivers include double-digit consumables growth as expected. We had upside from strong capital and equipment sales at ASP and Fluke Health with share gains in select markets and almost 20% SaaS growth driven by Provation. We also had several examples of how our increased innovation velocity is contributing to core growth with a pipeline of new products, including ASP's release of their new ULTRA GI Cycle designed to reprocess duodenoscopes using hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization, which significantly improves the safety of patients and technicians as well as the environment. ULTRA GI Cycle was developed in partnership with PENTAX Medical and will be ramping sales in Q4. ASP is also expanding the launch of its steam monitoring biological indicator, making it now available in over 30 countries. Looking ahead, Provation just launched the next phase of Apex Insights, their proprietary data analytics tool that features real-time data visualization to drive informed decision-making and boost provider productivity. Based on the strength of their year-to-date execution, we now expect AHS to grow mid- to high single digit and expand margins by over 200 basis points for the full year. Turning to the Precision Technologies on Slide 6. Revenue was flat in the quarter with a core decline of almost 4%. Acquisitions net of divestitures contributed over 3 points to growth. Adjusted operating margins were up 70 basis points year-over-year to 26.4% with lower core volumes more than offset by productivity benefits and accretive M&A. Core revenues at Tektronix were down high single digit, slightly better than expected. However, orders were up high single digit after several quarters of decline. Recovery is being led by investments supporting AI applications, particularly from customers like NVIDIA and TSMC. Tektronix is also using FBS innovation tools to expand its addressable market, adding complementary performance solutions to their best-in-class electronic test and measurement suite serving their fastest-growing markets. Next month in electronica, Tek will launch a first of its kind oscilloscope probing technology to enable next-generation power applications. And EA will release an industry-first triple channel bidirectional power supply, supporting new markets with higher test capacity, density and efficiency. We had double-digit growth in Qualitrol and PacSci EMC despite some shipment delays I previously mentioned. Customers are continuing to ramp grid capacity to support the demands for electricity and new sources of energy. And rising defense spending globally in advanced systems development drove another quarter of robust demand at PacSci. Overall, sensing technologies revenues declined low single digit. However, we had good orders growth as demand in certain industrial markets stabilized. As a reminder, we expect PT revenue to be down low single digits on a core basis for the full year with adjusted operating margins approximately flat. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the Precision Technologies orders and revenue trends since 2020, which historically were highly correlated. This chart reflects the divergence we have experienced the last three years as orders outpaced revenues post pandemic. With bookings at record levels, we began to burn through excess backlog in late 2022 as order rates declined. Since then, revenue has been normalizing to orders, and stabilizing demand trends overall are driving a return of orders growth in Q3 and Q4 2024, positioning PT for a gradual recovery in the year ahead. Moving to Slide 7 and a look at the regions. We saw continued strength in select end markets and stabilizing market conditions broadly, driving an improvement in order rates as shown in our major regions. For example at Fluke, September POS was positive in all regions as daily run rates in the U.S. and China have been trending upwards all year and rates in Europe started to stabilize. Regional revenue growth in the quarter continues to be driven by our recurring software, services, and consumables businesses in North America as well as double-digit growth in PacSci. We saw sequential improvement in Western Europe, partially driven by easier industrial comps and strong growth at ASP as sales investments in new products in select markets drove share gains. Growth in Asia continues to be impacted by weak demand in China. POS remained stable as customers and partners hold out investment decisions and inventory replenishment. The rest of Asia accelerated to high single-digit growth in the quarter, driven by recovery in semiconductor investments benefiting PT. And India continued to benefit from double-digit growth in IOS and Healthcare. With that, I'll turn it over to Chuck to talk through our updated fourth quarter and full year guidance. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. Turning to our Q4 and full year outlook on Slide 8. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate consistent performance to Q3 and year-to-date with revenue growth of approximately 3%, 1% core at the midpoint. This includes strong recurring revenue growth at IOS and Healthcare, and the expectation that continued customer and macro uncertainties will shift recovery in select markets to 2025. Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 6%, driving approximately 75 basis points of margin expansion. And adjusted diluted EPS guidance is expected to be in the range of $1.11 to $1.14 with free cash flow of approximately $425 million. For the full year, growth is expected to be approximately 3%, 1% core. Adjusted operating profit margins are expected to be up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year with roughly 60% incremental margins, reflecting the quality of our portfolio and the proactive restructuring we did coming into the year. Further, we plan to fund additional productivity initiatives in the range of $20 million to $30 million in the fourth quarter, benefiting 2025 and beyond. We are raising the full year adjusted diluted EPS range to $3.84 to $3.87, up 12% to 13% year-over-year. This, coupled with our free cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion, continues our track record of compounding earnings and free cash flow every year, which are up 14% and 17%, respectively, over the last five years. And now I'll turn it back over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Chuck. I'll resume on Slide 9. While it's too early to provide formal guidance for 2025, we are encouraged by stabilizing trends we are seeing in our markets. We expect continued momentum in our recurring revenue businesses which will contribute to higher core growth next year. As discussed, the orders growth we are seeing in Precision Technologies is supportive of a gradual recovery through the year, recognizing the potential for ongoing geopolitical and macro uncertainties. The durability of the portfolio and the power of FBS will continue to drive results, with increasing contributions from our innovation efforts, including the many exciting new product launches I highlighted on today's call. Further, with improved core growth, continued strong operational execution and the benefits of the productivity initiatives Chuck referenced, we are poised for another year of strong incremental margins. Lastly, as we announced in September, we intend to deploy approximately 75% of our free cash flow generated between now and the separation to share repurchases, providing a further tailwind to EPS growth in 2025, partially offset by the potential for tax rate increases across the world, providing a headwind to our overall effective tax rate for next year. I'll wrap up now on Slide 10. We remain committed to delivering for shareholders, and our third quarter performance once again underscores our relentless focus and execution to drive resolve. As Chuck referenced, our consistent execution has resulted in differentiated double-digit adjusted earnings and free cash flow compounding over the last five years, demonstrating our ability to profitably evolve our portfolio to deliver in any environment. We are progressing well towards the actions we announced in September to accelerate our strategy and shareholder value creation. Olumide, Tami, and I have had the opportunity to meet with many of you over the past couple of months. We are seeing strong conviction in the compelling investment profiles of Fortive and PT NewCo, both of which are strategically well positioned for growth in 2025. I'm happy to share that the ramp-up work to execute the spin transaction is in place, and all functional teams and deliverables are on track as planned. Our team's dedication to innovating for customers and creating exciting growth opportunities for our businesses underscores the collective ingenuity of our team members and the power of our culture and shared purpose : Accelerating progress for customers, shareholders, and each other. As a result, the best is truly yet to come. I could not be more excited for the future as both companies are well positioned to deliver enhanced value for all our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it to Elena. Elena Rosman : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Brock, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. James Lico : Hi Nigel, you there? Nigel Coe : Yes. That'd be the mute button. Thanks guys. Appreciate the time. Obviously, you haven't got to be a math genius to figure out what the 4Q buildup is by segment. Just want to make sure that we're thinking about the moving pieces the right way. So 5% AHS, down maybe 2% PT, up maybe 2% IOS. Is that in the right ballpark, Chuck? Elena Rosman : Sorry, so you're saying for the fourth quarter, Nigel, on core growth? Nigel Coe : Yes, for the fourth quarter, exactly, yes. Just want to make sure that you got that right, yes. Elena Rosman : Yes. I think you're in the mid to high-single-digit for AHS. Your PT number is down low single-digit, and IOS is up low single-digits. Nigel Coe : Okay, so maybe a bit more growth in AHS? Charles McLaughlin : Yes. Nigel Coe : That's great. Yes. And then just on AHS go ahead? James Lico : No, go ahead. Go ahead. Nigel Coe : No, no. I'm just going to just follow-up on the AHS consumables. It seems that the kind of the strategy of going direct is starting to really come together there. So just wondering if you can maybe just expand on that direct sales channel kind of strategy. And are you seeing kind of the benefit of increased share with some of the customers? Any sort of impact on Provation cross-selling around that? I know that was part of it. And then just maybe just touch on some of the IV shortages we've seen related to the hurricane. Does that have any influence on North American consumables in the fourth quarter? James Lico : Yes. Thanks, Nigel. So I would say a couple of things. We're broadly - we're really pleased with the 9% core in the segment itself. As you said, ASP is really executing well. And obviously, the margin expansion in the segment also speaks to the execution. The North American transition has been really strong, and we feel really good about it relative to customer intimacy. I think at this point, I would say it's helping us more on the capital side. We have several good capital wins. I would say one of the nice things we saw in the quarter was also mid-single-digit capital growth at ASP as well. So I think, when you look at the go-to-market, it's not only influencing the ability to sort of get the consumable ramp rate, but it's also helping us on the capital side, probably not yet as much on the Provation side. Provation had a very good quarter. Their SaaS growth was really strong. A number of good conversions, and they've continued to execute. Their growth will - has really continued to get better through the year. They do have that license software headwind in this quarter, which dissipates so we'll see improved growth as well in Provation in the fourth quarter. So you obviously have the comp a little bit in the third quarter, so just to be clear, there is a little bit of tailwind from the comp last year at ASP, because of the channel conversion, but execution across the board. Fluke Health was up high single-digits. So just across the board, good execution. Relative to the IV bag situation, we've seen a little bit of headwind in October, a couple of million bucks probably. We'll continue to track that so, we're certainly watching it. I think the benefit of the direct movement that we've got now is we know how consumables are going the next day. So we've got much better transparency as to what's going on with North American customers for sure. So I think across the board, you'll see consistent execution. And I think now when you step back, I mean, health is the strong story that we were really talking about several years ago, and now you really see the benefits now quarter-after-quarter with our execution capability, and just the great job the team is doing. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks, Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Nigel. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe I just wanted to start with a sort of question around near-term dynamics within the IOS segment. So clearly, some slowdown there in the third quarter. It seems like you're expecting that to kind of hold the line with low single-digit growth still in Q4. Maybe just help us understand, in the current quarter, what we should expect for Fluke versus FAW in terms of organic growth rates? And was the softness in IOS something that happened late in Q3, how is that trending at present? Any color around that, please? James Lico : Yes, sure. Thanks, Julian. A couple of things. One, as you said, low single-digit growth in the third and the fourth. But I think when you step back, really, a couple of things happened. One, as we progressed through the quarter, I think what we saw at Fluke was really two things. First of all, I think the good news at Fluke was the IG business actually grew low single-digits in the quarter. So we actually saw, despite some of the PMIs and some of those things, we still saw the industrial business grow. What we really saw was some hesitation on the part of calibration customers. I think that falls into the category of sort of government uncertainty since most of those customers fall into that case. So we saw some of that. And that's really the sort of impact, a little bit of that at Fluke. And I think the second thing is we normally would see a better ramp rate, through the quarter. And what we saw just from a lot of our channel partners, was the sort of hesitance to take on major marketing programs. We had a tremendous new product launch lineup for the - as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And we saw really, really strong product innovation and anticipated, maybe a little bit of a better take rate on those programs. And we've assumed that, that's just going to continue for the remaining part of the year, that maybe some of the macro uncertainty is going to - maybe a lower growth industrial environment, might cause our channel partners to be a little bit more hesitant on those programs. So a little bit of that, that's how we'll continue to think about it, as well as the government customers thinking, about maybe they won't take everything from a FAW perspective, that we've got the orders on. As we mentioned, Fluke had high single-digit order growth in the quarter. So, we feel good about where the order rate is. Point-of-sale got better through the quarter. And I think on a global basis, we had point-of-sale growth throughout the world. So in that sense, I think you're seeing just a little bit of hesitation on the inventory side and a little bit of hesitation on the programming side. In FAW, we had a lot of good in FAW - but it really was going in some jurisdictions and states just decided to not spend as much money on the job side. Our SaaS growth was double-digits at Gordian. So we saw good software growth, but the take rate on some of the procurement really reflected, I think, some of the government uncertainty that might be out there. And we've sort of assumed that, that continues a little bit for the remaining part of the year. We had teens bookings growth at Accruent. We saw good growth in service channels. So we think as we lead into the year, we're going to sunset some of those really, really difficult comps at Gordian as we move into '25. And the take rate, some of the things that we've got going on the bookings side at Accruent service channel sort of really a good setup for '25. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just looking at Slide 9 for a second on the sort of 2025 initial thoughts. So sort of looking at it all together, is the view that kind of all three segments should see organic growth next year, should have strong incremental margins again helped, by the proactive restructuring occurring in the current quarter? And then sort of below the line, any sort of clarity you could provide, as of now on the sort of tax rate? This year is 11%. Kind of what are the ranges of where that tax rate could end up next year? And anything you wanted to flesh out on the operating margin expansion degree? Charles McLaughlin : So Nigel, I'll take a couple of those. Margin expansion and core growth, we would expect organic growth in all three segments next year at this point. We're a long way from giving a guide. But with - when we have mid-single-digit growth, 75 basis points margin expansion is probably what you should look for going there. But with regards to the tax rate, it will go up from where we're at right now, calling it at 11%, probably towards, I'd say at this point, somewhere 13% to 15%, but we've got to get a little bit closer. James Lico : And then maybe on the - just on the revenue side and what we're seeing, I think really, I think when you look at maybe taking with IOS and Health, as I mentioned, the IOS setup relative to bookings and software is a good place for FAW. We think we continue to see - we'll certainly see growth in IOS, and I think that will -- FAW will bring that up as we get into the year. Health will continue to be good, as we mentioned, probably in the mid-single-digit range. So we should see that growth there. And then on the PT side, I think it's a gradual recovery. Still too soon to tell, Julian. But at the end of the day, I think what we've seen in terms of PT for the third quarter, double-digit orders growth. It was 8% at Tek, so good orders growth in the quarter. We would anticipate we'll continue to see good orders growth. That should give us growth - that gives us good confidence in growth in PT for next year. But how that plays out, as I said in the prepared remarks, probably a gradual recovery as we move through the year. I'm not sure the world completely shifts on January 1. So I think we'll see a gradual recovery, but a good path, as Chuck mentioned, to good earnings. And as you said, with the restructuring, the product restructuring that we've done, as well as the normal productivity that we normally drive in the business, we should see good incrementals just like we have this year. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. James Lico : Thanks, Julian. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. James Lico : Hi Scott. Operator : Scott, you there? Perhaps you have your line muted, sir. Elena Rosman : See if we can come back to Scott. Operator : Okay. We'll move on to the next question. Joe Giordano of TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Giordano : Hi, thanks guys. Good morning. Can we start on EA? You tempered expectations there last quarter. Obviously, the headlines across those markets aren't great right now, even if the business itself is well positioned within them. Like what's the risk of like a lack of a recovery in the future? How should we temper like what we think over the foreseeable future, for recovery of the top line in that business? James Lico : Yes, we had - I think we did about $26 million or so in the quarter. We think it will look similarly that - so I don't - we don't have a big expectation of a big uptick here in the remaining part of the year. We've got some backlog that will shift as well. So I think at the end of the day, Joe, we're really thinking. We're seeing good - the synergy work that we talked about last quarter in terms of the small order business continues to do well. We actually had a large order from a utility. So the movement into different verticals away from just mobility, I think we're starting to play out. We had a seven-digit order from a large utility in the quarter. So we feel good about a number of the synergy things we're doing. But as you point out, the end markets relative to EV and mobility are certainly going to be slow. That's been tempered in our - that sort of tempered our enthusiasm around any near-term recovery. We would anticipate that really, I think, consistent with others sometime in the back half of next year and into '26. So that's sort of in our work. Some of our proactive restructuring is to sort of get after some of that. And we feel like a lot of the synergy work we're doing well, and we're executing well. And so that with the return of the market starts, to bring that business back. But it will start to recover through the year, but certainly, I think the big parts of the market, which is probably specific to your question, really, we see as an end of '25, '26 kind of time frame at this point. Joseph Giordano : Yes, fair enough. And I think you answered my follow-ups kind of in the slides potentially, but I'll ask them anyway. So Fluke was weaker in the quarter, but orders seemed okay. Like I guess most industrial markets are doing way worse than Fluke. So are you seeing any risk of Fluke just lagging those declines? Or do you just feel like that business is - order suggests that that business continues to grow from here? And then similarly on Tek, orders are inflecting positive. You had that chart in the slides of that gap. Like does that - if orders stay on this trend, does that flip to revenue positive like what, like mid-next year, 1Q, '25? Like how should we think about that? James Lico : Yes. I think we got two very different stories. I think number one, on the Fluke side, as you mentioned, a much more durable company than maybe what people were accustomed to. As I said, in some of the large order business where there's a little bit more capital involved on the calibration side, we did see - that's really the headwind that we saw relative to the second half and the description that we had in the prepared remarks. But orders were better, as you said. Point-of-sale starting to inflect. I would anticipate we'll continue to see growth and that's what we think, but the probably more, low single-digit growth at Fluke here in the near term. But really good execution. Our Fluke Networks business is growing high single digit as an example, based on some of the data center build-out. So we've got some pieces that are doing well. And as I said, the industrial business continues to perform at low single-digits, which I mean when you think of this environment of the PMI being down for 20 months, the fact that our orders are up 13 of 15 quarters, I think just speaks to the durability of Fluke. It's moving off its mid-single-digit growth trajectory. But obviously, that will come back as some of the - as the PMI and some of the industrial production stuff starts to turn a little bit. Relative to Tek, as you said, orders inflecting, that's a good sign. That's what we've been saying for a couple of quarters now is that, we thought the second half would inflect the growth. Some of that is comps. So we'll - and generally, that's a three to six-month kind of time horizon so we'd start to see some of the impact of that order growth probably in the late first quarter, maybe early second quarter at this point. So we'll see how the second half - we'll see how the fourth quarter plays out. But I think that's how we would see it as we stand today. We've got to get through budgets. We'll see how we finish this year, and we'll see how some of these uncertainties play out that obviously are out there on a global basis. Joseph Giordano : Thanks, Jim. James Lico : Thanks Joe. Operator : The next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. James Lico : Hi Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Hi, good afternoon everyone. Hi, I hope all is well. Hi, just a quick one first on share repurchase. Maybe you kind of presented the broad strokes here. But looks like you could have done more, right, on your cash balances and what you're expecting here through year-end. Are you dealing with stranded cash in this, what, roughly $800 million, or so I see on the balance sheet? And just give us a little bit more color on what we should expect going forward? Charles McLaughlin : Jeff, no, it's not a stranded cash issue at all. What we did is we looked at the third quarter and we did share repurchases that equated to 75% of our projected free cash flow. Now it came in a little bit stronger, and that's why it's a little bit less. What we'd look to do - we'll catch that up in this fourth quarter. And then probably - and then also look to deploy 75% against our expected free cash flow plus the catch-up. Does that make sense? Jeffrey Sprague : Yes, absolutely. And then Jim, just thinking about moving towards spin. You made a comment, I think, about sort of standing up the teams. But maybe elaborate on where we're at with naming rest of the management board, that sort of thing? And is it - are we still on track for the plan as announced? Or now that it's kind of out there, and you've sort of advertised your intentions, there's some additional chatter about other possible outcomes? James Lico : Well, I think number one is a little bit more from the prepared remarks. Yes, the ramp-up work, as I mentioned, is going well. I mean, we've got all the teams staffed relative to the work that needs to be done. We're heavy into recruiting. We're starting to secure folks. It was only six or seven weeks ago, but we've made really good progress in a short period of time. Chuck and I did a review with the team on Monday, and feel really good about kind of where a number of our steps are at. So we would still say we're on track for that fourth quarter of '25 time frame. There's a number of big events that will occur over the next 60 days. And as we see how that plays out, that will determine if things could happen quicker or anything like that. So I feel like we're in a very good place right now, given we only announced a few -- not even two months ago, and we'll see where we're at in a few months. But there's a number of big items that really have to happen, the Form 10 and some of those kinds of things. So yes, we feel good about where we're at. I think your questions relative to inbound offers and anything like that. I think what we said is we said at the time was we would receive inbound indications of interest for portions of our portfolio. We get that on a regular basis, even any time. And so, just as we said at the time of announcement, we would expect to see some things, and of course, we would evaluate any inbounds against available alternatives. So we'll do that. But like any other M&A, we wouldn't comment on anything specifically, but we did - we were out there saying that we would listen to things so that's where we continue to stand. Jeffrey Sprague : All right. And then just a quick data point. Chuck, can you tell us what price was in the quarter, and what you're expecting for Q4? Charles McLaughlin : 3% across the company and we do expect the same level in Q4. James Lico : And Jeff, I think one of the good things in the quarter that we didn't say in the prepared remarks, is that we actually saw volume improve from the second quarter to the third quarter. So it was nice to see. It's still negative volume, but the volume is getting better. So I think that just speaks to a little bit of the recovery, we talked about relative to orders, and now we're seeing a little bit of the natural demand play out in a few places. Jeffrey Sprague : Understood. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot. James Lico : Thank you. Charles McLaughlin : Thanks Jeff. Operator : The next question is from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. James Lico : Hi Scott. Scott Davis : Hi guys, I guess we got disconnected somehow. Modern phone systems we don't know how to use. But hi, this may end up being a stupid question. But as your mix, sales mix shift and Tek changes more towards the guys like NVIDIA, does that - are their needs different? Are they different as a customer for you guys in what they need, how they need it, what they want to pay for it? Just any color on those would be helpful? James Lico : No, I would say in the short answer, is they're buying the best technology. And in our case, they're buying some of the high-end solutions that we've developed over time for those specific applications. And so, we were very competitive in those kinds of solutions because they're really tailored to some of the things that the NVIDIAs and TSMCs need for these high-performance data centers, and that kind of thing. So no, there's no margin headwind at all in those solutions. Scott Davis : I was hoping you'd say tailwind but anyways, helpful. Just to drill down a little bit on this customer delay spending thing. Do you sense that some of this is - I mean, there's been macro uncertainty for a while now? So is some of this related to the election and perhaps some uncertainty about policy and tariffs and things like that? And maybe we get a little bit of color on that. We'll have visibility on that in a week or two. But is there - is it more related to that? It just feels like we've had macro uncertainty. You guys have probably commented on that for five of the last six quarters or so? James Lico : Yes, I would say it's a couple of things. And I think, yes, I think the quick answer is yes. When you think about the calibration business or you think about Gordian, they're selling into government entities. And certainly, at the state and local level, there was - I think there was more uncertainty as we got closer to the election. A couple of specific jurisdictions, I think we could directly tie to that like New York City as an example, where there's obviously been some issues there. So definitely, some of this is that and that's an acceleration for maybe what we saw several over the last few quarters. As you said, there has been some macro uncertainty for - relative to PMI and things like that, but a little bit more. And I think the other part of it is just the reluctance for inventory has just continued. And I think we thought with some of the promotional activity and marketing programming that we had going. We anticipated a little bit better take rate than we anticipated. And I think that just maybe speaks, to maybe our customers' lower growth environment expectations, and now that sort of manifests itself with us. Scott Davis : Okay. Good color. Thank you guys, appreciate it. James Lico : Yes Scott. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hi. Good morning, everyone. James Lico : Hi Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Just thinking a little bit more about Fortive by geography. You gave us orders this time by region. You just talked to Scott about North America. But mid-teens growth in Europe, maybe that seemed pretty strong, and then Asia up slightly. I think your Q3 orders were against easier comps. But any more color on the regions? And then China continues to look tough for several of your peers, at least in terms of revenue. It was down high single-digits for you. So what are you seeing inflation [ph]? James Lico : Yes. Maybe one backdrop is the comment I made just in general, which is the Fluke point-of-sale on a global basis growing for September is maybe just a little bit of a backdrop of color that gives us some sense of the world. As you said, we gave you orders. There is -- there's some easier comps in some of those places. Asia ex China, Andy, would have been actually up almost double-digits. So the Asia order situation is really a China situation. And as you said, we were down high single-digits in revenue. But I think some of the - Health was flattish on the revenue side. So we think in China as an example where it was flattish. That's probably pretty good performance relative to maybe some of the challenges that some of the other healthcare folks have talked about relative to China. And that really has to do probably with our consumables revenue there. We are seeing the reluctance in China for healthcare around tenders and things like that. More broadly, I think North America will hold up the best, simply because of we've got our most recurring revenue there. Consumables is there. Our software businesses are there. The PacSci business is there. So, we would see orders holding up better in North America. And I think Europe is probably a comp issue along with real strength in health. So we said that in some of the prepared remarks, and obviously in the presentation, but just to give you a little bit more color around what we're seeing, around the world. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful, Jim. And then obviously, going back to AHS for a second, it's been a difficult few years for you up until the last year or so. But given '24's strength and your own self-help in the segment, could you see an extended runway here of higher growth in that mid- to high single-digit range? I know your long-term guide's mid-single digits. But maybe a little bit more accelerated growth and better margin performance out of that. What's the runway in AHS like? James Lico : Yes. I think we had a little bit of noise in the second and third quarter of last year, given the channel transition. But I think if you take a three-year view now, we've got solid mid-single-digit growth in the segment and solid margin expansion in the segment. So first of all, I think now that we've gone through the noise, I think everybody now can see, it's a little bit of the -- now see the benefits of the strength of the strategy, and how things are playing out. I would caution everyone around getting to high single-digit. I think we really believe that long-term view is high - is mid-single and feel good about that. But that will come with continued improvements in margin expansion for sure. We'll continue - and I think one of the good stories that we haven't talked about yet on the call is the new product introduction we talked about in the prepared remarks. We now are seeing -- we've gotten the commercial flywheel going in ASP. The last move of that, the high-growth markets were growing really well in ASP for a few years. We've got North America in shape last year. The team has done a great job, really, I think, using the tools of FBS, to drive continued consistency on the commercial front. And now you see the innovation front, right? We've got new innovation coming. We've expanded the use of the biological indicators in the 30 countries. So now we're getting the innovation flywheel started. We feel really good about that. Our Provation launch is really our new AI -- the start of some AI launches that you'll see at Provation. So we really -- I think we set us up well, but let's see how the market continues to play out. And I think mid-single is a good place to be for Health for now. With maybe a little bit better margin expansion than elsewhere. But I know as you see in the quarter, with Health margins now, when you look at the quarter, Health margins as strong as they were at 27%. Those are bench-markable margins for our healthcare business, and we feel really good about it. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate all the color. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Yes, I guess good morning to you, Jim. Just to follow up on Jeff's question. Can you hear me? James Lico : Yes we can, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Okay. Excellent. Just to follow-up on Jeff's question, you had 2.9% price this quarter. Seems to be quite a bit better than peer pricing of 1% to 2% that we're hearing from other industrial companies. Can you just talk about just overall pricing environment? I know you talked about fourth quarter, but anything structural? Have you sort of rethought your pricing strategy? And how much of this momentum in terms of outperformance is sustainable into '25? James Lico : Well, as you know, Andrew well because you know us well, we've had good - we've always, I think, been above peers relative to our price. And I think that speaks to why our gross margins are so high and why, quite frankly, our R&D expenses may be a little bit higher than others is, because we get paid for the innovation that's in the marketplace. And so I would expect us to continue to be above peers. We always reconsider those things as we think about -- as we look at share positions and as we think about opportunities for growth, and we'll always do that. But I think it's really the basis of our innovation. And we certainly had, as I said before, some really strong innovation in a number of places. So we think the environment remains good for innovators, and I think that we fall into that category. Andrew Obin : Okay. Thank you. And just a little bit more color on high single-digit core order growth in Tektronix. Is this all green shoots in semiconductors? Just would love to get more color as to what are the other areas that have turned positive? James Lico : Yes. I would certainly say part of it is comp. So what we said was the dollars are going up, which is good. So we look at it in two bases, obviously, the run rate, the growth rate as well as the total dollars and they're going up. So that's a good sign as you meant. We're starting to see some things that are coming out. We referenced some of those on the prepared remarks, where we're seeing people who are investing in data centers and investing in batteries and investing in next-generation electrification. The new designs and the new innovation that our customers are trying to bring out, we're obviously helping them with those solutions. And so that's really where the green shoots are. They're in different parts of the world. As an example, we had a good quarter in Korea because we're starting to see some investments in Korea. We've seen some other parts of the world. China has still been a little tough, but we've absorbed that and still continue to be good in other parts of the world. So it's really about the -- a lot of the parts of the strategy we've talked about electrification. Some of that is next-generation government and MilGov. Those are parts of the economy that still continue to be good. We see that in other places, and we started to see some of those things come back. Some of the order delays that we talked about in the second quarter, we got those orders in the third quarter. So a number of things have just started to come in place. Still tough in the sort of basic base business of broadly defined semiconductor, broadly defined industrial. But as you said, we are seeing some of those green shoots have impact as we start to see the order rate turn. Andrew Obin : Terrific. Thanks so much. James Lico : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : The next question is from Jamie Cook of Truist. Please proceed with your question. James Lico : Hi Jamie. Jamie Cook : Hi, how are you? I guess two questions. I guess what sort of struck me about the quarter was the strength, I guess, in the PT margins, given that organic growth continues to sort of disappoint there. So is there anything that's going on there structurally, the price? Just trying to understand. I don't think we've ever had a margin that high except for maybe a fourth quarter. And then I guess just my second question on the framing to 2025, understanding the spin is going to happen at the end of 2025. And so maybe the question isn't as relevant, but I still think it speaks to the quality of the assets within the portfolio in SBS. Can you frame your - how you think about the historical like sort of 450 EPS number that you guys put out there for 2025, and the different levers that you could pull to get to an EPS number close to that? Thank you. Charles McLaughlin : Jamie, this is Chuck. A couple of things on PT. One is we've got two things going in. We came into the year and we did some self-help at the end of last year, so some restructuring and that's helping across the whole company but also you're seeing that in PT. Also, the EA business is, while not in core, it's in total and those came in with really good margins. I think those are probably the two biggest drivers behind the operating margin expansion you're seeing. James Lico : Yes, Jamie, I would say relative to the 450, we always said the 450 was the target and never would be a guide. Just I would reiterate that. And certainly, with revenue being -- our jumping-off point of revenue now being roughly a couple of hundred million dollars lower than we anticipated, we certainly would say that we'll have a good -- we have a pathway to good earnings and free cash flow growth for next year and feel good about that. But I think we're -- we don't want to get to a specific guide. I think the core components that we tried to outline until we get to February was IOS and AHS recurring revenue will continue to drive growth. As I mentioned, PT will have a more gradual growth path in the year, which should have growth. As you said, our incrementals are always good. It's really a foundational piece of FBS. I'd harken back to our five years. Our five-year average here is 125 basis points of margin expansion, 12% profit growth and 14% EPS growth. So I think our path is definitely prologue. We're definitely going to see those trajectories. But I think we need to see where we end up the year. And I wouldn't put - I wouldn't dial 450 in any way, shape or form. I think we're going to - we're - that was, like I said, that was never - that was always kind of an aspirational target. And certainly, with the conditions that we've seen relative to the revenue we'll be - we'll have really good EPS growth for next year. But let's see where we get to when we finish the year. Jamie Cook : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Great day, everybody. This came up a couple of different times but just frame for us what the plan is on this proactive restructuring, and this is above your normal level. And what sense of payback or timing and across which segments? Thanks. Charles McLaughlin : I think it's - we've got a couple of solar places. That's where we're targeting where, I think. And I think the payback we usually talk about is within 1 year. Maybe it's a little sooner than that. We'll give when we get into giving the guide, we'll probably nail that down a little bit. Deane Dray : Okay. And then this is more of a nuanced question, but when you talked about the -- some of the slowing decision-making and policy uncertainty and so forth, you cited calibration customers that might be deferred. And maybe just I don't understand that business well enough. But that, to me, sounds like they have regulatory obligations. You can't defer it that long or maybe there's a warranty issue. But when you say some calibration customers are deferring, what exactly are you referring to? James Lico : Yes. So we've had tremendous growth over the last several years at Fluke calibration team. Some of it is regulatory, some of it is replacement. I think what we've seen is where we have regulatory decisions or expansions, we certainly are seeing that revenue. But I would say where we have replacement, people are deferring replacements a little bit until they see a number of things playing out. Some of that's in the government and so they're just being a little reluctant to replacement. So we're assuming at this point that, that's going to continue for a little while until we maybe get a little bit more certainty and that's really how it plays out. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Chris Snyder of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Snyder : Thank you. I think you said previously that in addition to PT orders being up double digits year-on-year, you're seeing sequential improvement in the absolute order rates from Q2 to Q3. I guess my question is, is that primarily or entirely just driven by the military and government orders that got pushed out of Q2 and seems like came through here in Q3? Or are you seeing broader sequential improvement across some of the other green sheets that you mentioned? James Lico : Yes, I think certainly in the places where we're seeing real growth like Qualitrol and EMC, it's true growth and it's really, I think, secular-driven, given the markets they play in. And then I would say at Tek, it's absolute beyond just what we saw from some of those things moving. So it's a little bit more than that. So in that sense, we -- that's what gives the confidence that we described. And then, of course, as I said on the growth rate, it's the comp side but on the dollars basis, it's how I just described it. Christopher Snyder : And then I guess just following up on PT. I certainly understand in the back half year, organic growth is below order rates because you're comping backlog burn as we see on this Slide 6. But as we look into 2025, should revenue at PT grow in line with orders? Just because it seems like 2024 is roughly a 1.0 book-to-bill year so you don't have that kind of backlog burn comps as we go into next year. So any thoughts on that would be helpful? Thank you. James Lico : Yes. I think at a high level, we would start to see those growth rates merge. There's a little bit of noise in the EMC business and in the sensing business, when we start to see the larger OEM contracts start to grow. So that could be a little bit different by quarter. But on a full year basis, that tends to mute itself out over time. Christopher Snyder : Appreciate that. Thank you. James Lico : Thank you. Operator : The last question today comes from Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Joseph O'Dea: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to - I think you commented that some shipments had pushed from Q3, maybe to Q4 or further in Qualitrol. I think that's been an area of some strength. And so I'm not sure if that's kind of projects and just delays or kind of what customers might be deciding to do there. So any color there? James Lico : Yes. Joe, it's really a function of the other to Sensing came in a little slower, and we anticipate getting more out from Qualitrol and EMC than we anticipated. So this is not a customer demand situation at all. They've continued to grow really well. In fact, both of them had, I believe, had record quarters. But it was really inability to countermeasure some of the other weakness. And it was really - so we've assumed that, that probably doesn't happen here for the remaining part of the year. But the demand profile for both those businesses is very strong and should be, and we certainly believe that's going to go well into '25. Joseph O'Dea: And just kind of, is that more supply chain-related and maybe not reaching the potential that you thought you had for shipments there or just any additional thoughts on it? James Lico : A little bit of supply chain, a little bit of factory capacity. It's just - it's a little bit of both. I would say on the defense side, a little bit more supply-chain. Joseph O'Dea: Okay. Understood. And then just Provation and that driving the 20% SaaS growth at AHS, are you seeing kind of acceleration there? And just anything when it comes to innovation or end market activity that's supporting that acceleration? James Lico : Yes, I think it's a few things that we're really excited about. I think when we bought Provation, one of the things we said was, we would start to see some of the growth for the SaaS conversion because we have our current licensed software solution is really -- PVMD is it's very much pervasive in hospitals. The conversion to SaaS very much will be part of our innovation story. But it would also be part of the hospitals themselves moving to cloud and moving all of their operations to cloud. Obviously, the advent of AI and the promise of AI has more hospitals moving to cloud. And when they do that, they're really ready for our Apex solution. And so, we're just seeing an acceleration of that story. So it's a combination -- we announced in the prepared remarks. Some of our launches that are really AI-related, the start of that for us. But we're also, to some extent, following the technology trend of hospitals moving to cloud. And when they do that, they want Apex. And so, we're really excited about that business. As you mentioned, the SaaS growth is very good. And we would anticipate that, that continues to be very strong. And in many cases, as you know, we're converting our maintenance stream to Apex. And those maintenance stream conversions are at a very strong rate. So really, the strategy playing out very much how we thought it would when we bought the company several years ago. Elena Rosman : I would just add that in the fourth quarter, we'll have lapped the license headwind from last year. So that does mean that the growth rate in Provation does accelerate to high single-digit in the fourth quarter, and would accelerate in 2025. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Jim Lico for closing remarks. James Lico : Thanks, everybody, for taking the time. I know a very busy day for all of you in an obvious - as always, a busy earnings season. Hopefully, you heard from us today really a sense of some of the things we really were prepared for and in a lower growth environment, a number of really strong execution. I think we fall to the 60% incrementals, the strong operating profit growth that we had and EPS growth, really on the backs of lower growth. That will continue in the fourth quarter. And I really think that speaks to the power of FBS and the power of our ability to execute in this environment. We feel good about what the ramp - what '25 - what we can do in '25. We'll see how that plays out. But I think one of the things we've talked about for several years really played out this quarter is the pervasiveness of our innovation capability. You heard it at Fluke. You heard it at Tek. You heard it at ASP. You heard it within FAW. All of our major businesses, lots of examples of new innovative products that will - that are hitting the marketplace to give us what we think are really exciting opportunities and really speaks to the power of the changes we've made in our innovation process over the last several years. So we'll look forward to the continued follow-up from many of you, and we look forward to seeing you on the road here soon. Have a great rest of the season, and we'll talk soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Daryl: My name is Daryl, and I will be your conference facilitator this afternoon. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Fortive Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. On keypad, if you would like to withdraw your question, press star then the number two. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Elena Rosman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rosman, you may begin your conference. Elena Rosman : Thank you, Daryl, and thank you everyone for joining us on today's call. With us today are James Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, information required by Regulation G is available in the Investors section of our website at fortive.com. Our statements on period-to-period increases or decreases refer to year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise specified. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. Information regarding the risk factors is available in our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 27, 2024. With these forward-looking statements, they speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Lico : Thanks, Elena. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin on slide three. Fortive delivered better-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter, including higher core growth, earnings, and free cash flow. These results capped a strong year for Fortive, including another year of record margins with gross margins of 60% and adjusted operating margins nearing 27% while continuing to fund future growth. In addition, we compounded adjusted earnings and free cash flow by 13%, contributing to our strong multi-year track record of differentiated financial performance. Our accelerated pace of innovation in 2024 helped us sustain top-line momentum given the mixed demand environment, further enhancing our outlook for 2025. Turning to the year ahead, Fortive is poised for improving core sales growth and continued strong operating performance. We've taken a prudent and balanced approach to planning the year, reflecting momentum in our bookings and durable revenue growth in industrial operating solutions and advanced healthcare, and stabilizing trends in precision technologies driving a gradual recovery through the year. Lastly, we are progressing well on the actions we announced last year to further accelerate our strategy and enhance value creation. Our teams have made meaningful progress towards the separation of the newly named Precision Technologies company called Ralliant. We now expect the transaction to close early in the third quarter. We also executed on our plan to prioritize the return of capital to shareholders, utilizing our record free cash flow to repurchase shares. In summary, these actions reflect our commitment to unlocking long-term value for all our stakeholders. Turn to slide four. 2024 was another year of consistent compounding, including the achievement of several record financial metrics. Since our inception, we have evolved our portfolio and leveraged the Fortive Business System to accelerate growth and innovation, expand market share and profitability, and forge the leadership skills we need for the future. The exceptional value created for customers and shareholders is reflected in our sustained multi-year performance, including an acceleration to mid-single-digit core growth on average over the last five years, over 600 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and 350 basis points of adjusted gross margin expansion amidst unprecedented inflation. Our accretive capital deployment has contributed to higher growth and higher returns. As a result, we grew free cash flow an average of 18% per year over this time, underpinned by industry-leading net working capital performance. In summary, what is unique and truly differentiated about Fortive is the breadth of results that are compounding over time relative to peers. The reason for this five-year track record of success is our commitment to FBS and the strategic evolution of our portfolio. Turning to slide five, our evolution of the Fortive Business System and continuous improvement mindset driven acceleration in MPI velocity, helping to sustain our top-line momentum. Within FBS, we have built over time a proven innovation toolset to identify unmet customer needs, develop new products, and bring them to market faster, which ensures greater returns on our R&D investment. Just several examples of how our increased innovation velocity is contributing to growth across the enterprise. Starting with iOS, Fluke launched a record 20 major new products in the last two years, extending their leadership position in solar and energy storage tools and contributing 200 basis points to growth in 2024. Facility and asset lifecycle revitalized their innovation efforts for the last three years, launching its strongest slate of new products and enhancements, while also expanding margins 800 basis points. Revenues from these new offerings are expected to more than double in 2025 versus last year. ASP launched a record of six new products in 2024 with 510(k) approval, expected to contribute over $10 million of revenue in 2025. Probation added to their leading GI position with their next phase of Apex Insight, a proprietary data analytics tool that boosts provider productivity, contributing to a 67% increase in Apex SaaS sites in 2024. PT is also leveraging FBS innovation tools to advance the world's technology. Tektronix launched four new products. Charles McLaughlin : Their best-in-class electronic test and measurement offering, serving their fastest-growing markets. Sensing Technologies is launching sensors for monitoring the liquid and air cooling system within data centers, and Qualitrol continues its double-digit pace of growth with new electric grid monitoring energy storage solutions to support the expansion of global power infrastructure. They're also leveraging our investments in the form of developing advanced software, data analytics, and AI capabilities, and we expect to launch new AI-based product sets in 2025 and 2026. Moving to the fourth quarter and full-year results on slide six, we ended the year with strong operating performance, generating an adjusted earnings growth approximately three times revenue growth. Core revenue growth of 2% in the quarter reflected an acceleration at iOS, partially offset by the anticipated decline in Precision Technologies. China headwinds continue to mute the recovery we are seeing in certain markets. Acquisitions net of divestitures were offset by unfavorable FX as the dollar strengthened in the quarter. Further highlights of our fourth-quarter performance include 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, adjusted earnings per share of $1.17 reflecting a $0.05 beat at the midpoint, with earnings up 19% year-over-year, and record Q4 free cash flow of $465 million, up 13% year-over-year. For the year, core revenue growth was 1%, reflecting the mixed demand environment and core decline in PT. Adjusted operating profit grew 7% and margins expanded 100 basis points, representing over 60% incrementals. We delivered earnings and cash flow above our initial guidance coming into the year, with adjusted EPS of $3.89, up 13%, and record free cash flow of $1.4 billion, representing 23% free cash flow margins for the year. Turning to slide seven, I'll provide more detail on our segment performance for the quarter and the full year, starting with iOS and AHS. On a combined basis, quarter revenues grew 4% with adjusted operating margins up 140 basis points to over 33%. This represents 12 consecutive quarters of consistent mid-single-digit core growth on a combined basis, reflecting the durability and resilience of these businesses. For the full year, combined iOS and AHS delivered 4% core revenue growth and 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, with over 60% incrementals. Moving to the right, Intelligent Operating Solutions expanded operating margins 190 basis points on 4% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, with M&A contributions partially offset by FX headwinds. Stable industrial products demand overall and NPI momentum drove mid-single-digit revenue growth at Fluke. Shipments outpaced our expectations exiting the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect a slower start to the year in Q1 before returning to more normalized growth the rest of the year. Growth in facilities and asset lifecycle accelerated to high single digits in the fourth quarter, enabled by stronger take-rate revenue across our government and multi-site retail product offerings. As you can see on the far right of the page, advanced healthcare solutions grew core revenue 5% in the quarter, with FX headwinds approximately 150 basis points total growth. Consumables normalized mid-single-digit growth as expected, and probation accelerated growth having lapped the license headwinds earlier in the year. AHS expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 40 basis points in the quarter and 200 basis points for the year, driven by high margins consumable growth partially offset by unfavorable FX. Turning to Precision Technologies on slide eight, revenue was approximately flat in the quarter with a core decline of 3%. Acquisitions net of divestitures contributed approximately three points of growth in the quarter. This represents the second consecutive quarter of sequential core growth improvement, enhanced by double-digit growth in utility and aerospace and defense markets. Adjusted operating margins contracted 200 basis points on lower core volumes, partially offset by productivity benefits and accretive M&A. Core revenues at Tektronix were down low double-digit in the quarter as expected. However, orders were up high single-digit for the second consecutive quarter. We continue to see investments supporting power, compute, and communications for data center expansion and demand for defense applications driving Tektronix orders growth. While China and EV mobility remain weak, we had another quarter of double-digit growth at Qualitrol and PacSci, as our teams continue to ramp production capacity to keep up with strong demand. Moving to the right side of the page, you can see the Precision Technologies revenue and adjusted operating performance for the past four years. Since 2021, PT has grown core revenue at 4% CAGR, with adjusted operating profit growing twice that rate at an 8% CAGR over the period. Core revenues declined 4% in 2024. Improved portfolio positioning and focused innovation efforts have dramatically improved the through-cycle performance. Leveraging FBS tools, we've expanded our addressable market and added complementary solutions aligned to favorable secular trends, including next-gen power applications for new markets and new sources of energy around the world. As a result, PT is a much more durable business today with a stable margin and free cash flow. James Lico : Profile. Charles McLaughlin : Poised for recovery in 2025. With that, I'll turn it over to Chuck to discuss our 2025 outlook. Thank you, Jim, and hello everyone. Turning to slide nine, let me set the stage for how we're thinking about the year. We continue to be encouraged by stabilizing demand trends overall, which gives us confidence in an acceleration in revenue growth from 2024 to 2025. While we are providing full-year guidance for total Fortive, I thought it would be helpful to frame the key drivers of the respective new companies. Starting with New Fortive on the left, comprising our iOS and AHS segments, we expect revenues of approximately $4.1 billion, supported by demand for our leading safety and productivity technologies and market share gains from new product introductions. We expect stable underlying industrial demand at Fluke with positive point of sale in North America and Western Europe. China is expected to slow both from a GDP and industrial production perspective, and we have reflected that into our outlook. We expect sustained momentum in our software and recurring revenue businesses, including double-digit ARR growth in SAL and stable consumables growth in healthcare. This yields low single-digit plus to mid-single-digit core growth for New Fortive in 2025. Regarding phase, we expect growth in the second half to outpace the first, primarily due to timing and days impact in Q1. Turning to the PT company, we anticipate revenues of roughly $2.2 billion in 2025, with core growth up slightly for the year. Our businesses aligned with power infrastructure, compute and communications invest, coupled with aerospace and defense systems, comprise approximately 35% of revenue and are expected to grow double digits again in 2025. Coupled with stabilizing trends in broader semiconductor and sensor markets, we anticipate a return to core revenue growth in the second half of the year. On slide ten, we provide further details on Q1 and 2025 guidance. Starting with the full year, we expect core revenues up 1.5% to 3.5%, FX is expected to be an approximate $90 million headwind for the year or roughly 150 basis points of impact to total growth. Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 2% to 5%, and adjusted diluted EPS guidance is $4.00 to $4.12, up 3% to 6% for the year. Our adjusted EPS guidance includes a $0.20 to $0.25 headwind from a higher effective tax rate and FX. This is offset by lower share count and a slightly lower interest expense. Adjusted free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, which excludes the impact of separation-related cash costs of roughly $185 million. The conversion rate on adjusted net income is approximately 100% excluding these items. For the first quarter, we anticipate core revenues to be roughly flat. FX is expected to be an approximate $30 million revenue headwind. iOS and AHS will start the year slower due to Fluke's stronger finish in Q4 and fewer days in Q1 impacting consumables and service utilization. PT is expected to be down mid-single digits, representing our toughest year-over-year comp. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be roughly flat, and EPS is expected in the range of $0.83 to $0.86, including a $0.05 headwind from unfavorable FX and higher tax. With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim to conclude. Thank you, Chuck. I'll continue on slide eleven. We've made considerable progress on the actions we announced last September to accelerate our strategy and enhance value creation. Starting on the left, we utilized our record second-half free cash flow to repurchase approximately 10 million shares, representing 80% of our free cash flow, slightly more than we committed to when we announced the separation. We remain committed to deploying free cash flow for incremental share repurchase. The balance sheet remains in great shape. We exited 2024 with net leverage of approximately 1.6 times, and we continue to expect that each company will sustain investment-grade balance sheets after the spin. Moving to the right, we expect the separation to close early in the third quarter. Following the progress our team has made to date, including confidentially filing a draft registration statement with the SEC in December, we are processing initial comments. We expect a Form 10 filing in the spring. Our efforts to hire top talent are well underway, ensuring we assemble a world-class corporate team to drive future success. Earlier this week, we announced that PT Newco has an exciting new name, Ralliant Corporation, and we appointed Ganesh Murthy as the board chair. James Lico : We also announced that Alan Spoon, who is retiring from the Fortive board, Charles McLaughlin : and Kate Mitchell will both join the Ralliant board. Together with Tammy, these board designees reflect Fortive's commitment to the new company's success and sustained value creation for all stakeholders. We will continue to provide additional updates as they become available. I'll wrap up now on slide twelve. Last week, we were excited to announce that Char Dube was appointed Fortive's new board chair, succeeding Alan Spoon. On behalf of the board and management team, I want to thank Alan for his leadership and all he's done to shepherd Fortive to become a more durable growth company. As we enter this new chapter, I and the rest of the board are confident Char is the right person to serve as the next chair. She's been providing valuable contributions to our board since 2020, and her deep insights into our business, culture, and strategy, combined with her extensive operational and leadership expertise, prepare her well to steward the execution of our long-term strategy for the more focused and resilient portfolio. This next chapter is a manifestation of the strategy we laid out at our inception : profitably evolve our portfolio, deliver in any environment. That was the case in 2024. Our enhanced portfolio positions, innovative new products, and dedication to the Fortive Business System have allowed us to deliver consistent compounding performance over the last five years. We are well-positioned to continue this track record in 2025 and beyond as we progress through the separation. We could not have reached this milestone in Fortive's journey without our unique culture and the passion of our 18,000 teammates around the world. Together, we show up with a mindset that we can do and be better. I know I speak for the entire Fortive team, including Elizabeth and Tammy, when I say I could not be more excited for the future as both companies are strategically well-positioned for enduring success. With that, I'll turn it to Elena. Elena Rosman : Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Daryl, we are now ready for questions. Daryl: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. You may press star two to remove your question from the queue. Our first question is from the line of Robert Mason with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Robert Mason : Yes. Hey, Rob. Hi, and happy Friday. Thanks. Usually not saying that on a Fortive conference call. So just maybe to start, Jim, could you dig into the product side of the business and thinking this is more around, you know, I'll say iOS and AHS, New Fortive. When you framed out 2025 or made some initial comments back in October, just curious around the product. Has anything changed, evolved? Has as you've tightened up the plans? You made a comment around China being softer. But just some perspective there around the product side. Yeah. And maybe take away around for the absent first of all, first of all, on New Fortive, as you mentioned, iOS and AHS, I would say, you know, really the aspects of the business in software and healthcare are really performing well. We had a little bit stronger end of year at Fluke. Some of that would we should get into that later, but I think, you know, just continuing to demonstrate in Fluke the resiliency and durability, particularly around product innovation, much of which we highlighted in the prepared remarks. I would say what's changed may or maybe what's well, going into 2025, Rob, a lot of the past is similar. We've got a little bit of headwind on the days and the consumables businesses. And the service parts of our software businesses, which have a little bit of headwind just in the quarter. But really good performance in Q1 across the portfolio and what I'll call New Fortive. On the PT front, I would say, a lot of the orders were good at, you know, we talked about the order growth in a couple quarters in a row now. We'll see order growth in the second half as well in PT. And I would say, you know, China but again, there, China weak. And, you know, we're not getting out of the gate here. If you really as we anticipated, but we're certainly not seeing any dramatic increases in China as we start the year out. Understood. And maybe just as a follow-up, you know, specifically, and maybe this touches on some of PT because you do have more government exposure there. Are you seeing anything post-election, Robert Mason : that Robert Mason : you know, around the flow of funds, that you're trying to account for in the planning. You know, just within your various government exposures? We have not. In fact, you know, I think we've said this in a couple places. Parts of the portfolio where we have exposure to government, Gordian is a good example, although less more state local, less federal. But, you know, but our productivity solutions really, I think, are gonna resonate and really drive cost reduction. So to some extent, we think an opportunity where we're more where maybe there's more fiscal responsibility actually plays to our plays in our favor Robert Mason : On the product side of the businesses, we've actually seen strength. We you Robert Mason : we actually in you know, we've gotten some nice large orders from some of the primes across the portfolio. So I would say at this point, nothing would indicate that customers are changing their mindset around where they're where they're seeing our business here at least over the, you know, over the over the past few months. Great. Thanks much. Thanks, Rob. Daryl: Thank you. Our next question's come from the line Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Hi, Julian. Hey. Good afternoon, Chuck. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just the first question on the Precision Tech organic sales guide. So just there's a bunch of moving pieces, but just trying to understand that improvement in year-on-year organic sales from the first quarter to the balance of the year. Maybe help us understand how much of that is a function just of selling days, versus, you know, easier comp versus some end market improvement that you've embedded maybe in China or somewhere else. And also, I suppose, the orders conversion into sales, you've had six months of decent orders. Sounds like that will persist. Are we seeing those orders converting to sales already and it's just the mismatch is just a function of different comps or are these somehow kind of longer-dated activities in the order book that will come into revenue later than normal. Charles McLaughlin : Yeah. A lot to unpack here, Julian, but let me let me let me start with the I think what you were talking about the cadence. I would certainly say the cadence through the year for PT will be, you know, really down mid-single-digit in the first quarter. Probably a little bit better in the second quarter and then some growth in the second half. I think that gets to them to be about up slightly for the year. Some of that's gonna be comps, particularly in China, where we see a lot more of the dramatic tougher comp in the first quarter and in the first half. We've always said that we thought some market improvement would occur in the back half of the year. That's embedded, but it's not a dramatic improvement in any way, shape, or form, but we do think some markets would start to come back, and we've actually seen a number of things where customers were actually seeing that. The other aspect is we're getting to really high really high volume numbers in places where we're seeing dramatic growth, principally in Qualitrol and in EMC. We've got some investments to improve capacity, which will also help us in the second half. I think the combination of, you know, comp in China, some market improvement, but nothing dramatic. And the combination of our ability to get more out here is really what changes first half to second half. And then, you know, I think as I think about really what with when we look at the business more broadly, it's also the innovation case. We mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but a number of the innovations, particularly in Tektronix, really starts to take hold in the second half. None of it but we really don't have a lot of that embedded at this point. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And and then just my follow-up would be around The, you know, tariff potential there and any way in which you could size perhaps, you know, share of purchases or cogs or something like that from some of the countries that may be affected in terms of US. Charles McLaughlin : Tariffs. Daryl: Yeah. Charles McLaughlin : I would say number one, the Canada, Mexico, even though they were they were postponed really doesn't have impact to us. So so in that sense, really no impact. China the China tariffs as you know, we've had a strong playbook since 2018. We really just pulled pulled out that play playbook. We talked about the, you know, number of scenarios that we we created several months ago when when when we started hearing about what the potential could be. We've already enacted those measures and and that's embedded in our guide. So we you know, the ten percent tariffs in China have been countermeasured, and we'll we'll move through what we have I think to some extent how we thought about the year from a macro perspective in China does have some of the the economic impact of some of the tariffs. I'm not sure we could point to any of those with true specificity, but I think the the way we plan China gonna be down here, you know, mid single digit for the year in China. For Fortive. Think it betts the fact that, you know, there's gonna be some uncertainty amongst customers and, in China and, you know, ultimately, that'll impact our revenue. So we've we've tried to be prudent about that as we as we look into the into the year. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Daryl: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Hi, Nigel. Oh, good afternoon. Hi. Good morning. Good afternoon. Nigel Coe : Chuck, I think this is might be your last earnings call. I'm sure you're gonna miss this. This whole process, but thanks for the help over the years, and good luck with your retirement. So Thank you. Couple quick ones. Couple quick ones here. Just the the the days headwind in one Q, we've we've heard this from some other companies. Is this just the you know, leap year in the in the prior you know, year quarter or was there something on Chinese New Year? Any any more color there And and then just, you know, FX has sometimes had an impact on margin conversion. I think mainly within AHS. So any any sort of peculiar sort of things to to to kind of flag with this, you know, dollar strengthening? Charles McLaughlin : I think that there are a couple of things there. It may Nigel Coe : you were asking about days, I think there's Charles McLaughlin : Nothing It it's just a simple day's catch. I don't think we have you know, when you look at the whole year, I don't think there's a big difference in there. So they'll come back but that's that's the main thing there. Think when you talk about health margins, they get hit with a little bit more impacts. Impact to the margins. Think that's what you're seeing there. Elena Rosman : There's a bit of a bigger day's impact to health care. We think about you know, how much of that data is impacted with consumables. For example, that's about two hundred basis points of headwind in the first quarter. Daryl: So they're gross. Okay. Yeah. Two hundred basis points. Yeah. That's that's what I was thinking as well. Nigel Coe : And then just follow on with the spin. So wondering if there's any more visibility on public company costs and and stranded costs from spin. Yeah. And I think we we sized them roughly around fifty million dollars sixty million dollars I think. Some of that Charles McLaughlin : we'll get after between now and spin. Elena Rosman : And offset is about half of that, and the other half would probably take maybe twelve to eighteen months to work down. And work out. But we we expect to to get Get all. Normalized. Charles McLaughlin : And, Nigel, on the on the separation cost, I think we you know, in the slide, showed a hundred and eighty five million. Yeah. That's mostly one that's all one time cost. That's mostly professional services. Taxes, lawyers, the banker fees to do some of that work. So we we we've outlined that on the slide as well. So as Chuck said, we'll we'll get after the separate you know, we'll get after the stranded costs Making good progress on building the teams here. So we feel as I as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we feel really good about ability to get get teams ready for and hence our ability to speed up The timeline Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, Jim. Elena Rosman : Thank you. Daryl: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Steve Tusa : Hi, guys. How's it going? Good. Chuck, thanks thanks for all the help over the years, and best of luck. Elena Rosman : Thank you. So it Steve Tusa : just on the on the product businesses, back to the the tariff question. Did you guys see any kind of preordering ahead of the change in administration and potential tariffs, and I'm just curious as to how the, you know, quarter played out sequentially by month kind of adjusting for seasonality. No way. Elena Rosman : If you if you could Steve Tusa : Yeah. So I I wouldn't say we identified any additional revenue relative to relative to people pre buying Steve. You know, what we saw in the in the fourth was pretty good cadence through. Point of sale was positive in North America. As an example, it flew So and that cadence was, you know, relatively consistent throughout quarter. That's probably our best benchmark. But, you know, we identified roughly about ten million of revenue at Flume that we think came out of the first quarter, but that was really more both mostly US distribution and European distribution. People were starting to get close to incentives as the year played out and so that, you know, there was a little bit of additional buying to get into incentive plans and things like that. So it's really that that we identified. So it really wasn't around tariffs. It's near as we can tell. Got it. And then just last one on the as a follow-up on the Tektronix, the the t and m side of PT. Which verticals are you are you seeing the best order rates in? Which ones are Daryl : kinda picking up here the most? Steve Tusa : I mean, we've had it we've had really strong anything tied to, you know, defense has been strong. For several quarters. I would say, the the high end what I'll call, for lack of a better term, the high end of of of semiconductor, high and high speed compute, hyperscalers, those kinds of biz yeah. Quantum computing, all of those have been really good. So design efforts investments that are going into those those opportunities have been really strong. You know, broadly, industrial hasn't has been pretty good too. You know, particularly in North America, Where we've seen the the weaknesses as we mentioned in the prepared remarks is really Western Europe. And and in China and that really part part of that is EV mobility And the other part of that is just broadly China and and most of that is really export control customers that we can no longer no longer do business with. Daryl: Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot. Have a great weekend. Steve Tusa : Thanks, Steve. Nigel Coe : Yep. You too. Daryl: Thank you. Our next question's come from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Jeff Sprague : Hi, Jeff. Good day, everyone. Hey. How are you doing? Good to catch up. Had a couple loose ends here. Just on the days, Charles McLaughlin : we just have the number? Like, how many days are we talking about here? Sounds like it's two ish. Elena Rosman : Two days. Yes. Two days, and it was about eight million dollars. Nigel Coe : Yeah. Jeff Sprague : And you think it'd you know, you think it affects what, sixty or seventy percent of your business? Is that the right ballpark? Elena Rosman : It's really it's no. It would be consumable. It's are about half of healthcare. And then the remaining, call it, three or four million is in in services and places like Gordian to take great business. Jeff Sprague : Yeah. So it doesn't have to be services most so you think about daily service Charles McLaughlin : like we would do in the service organizations Yeah. For Fluke and Tack. As well as the services that we have in software. Jeff Sprague : Okay. I think it might impact things in distribution, but maybe not. If the people want it, they'll catch it up Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just on China, think you said down mid single digit. I think that was a twenty twenty five estimate. Can you just kind of level set us on how much China what China did in twenty twenty four for the year and in the quarter? Yeah. So I think for for the High single digit. Yeah. Down high single digit for twenty four. Charles McLaughlin : Down mid single digits for twenty five, with probably q one being down, you know, high single digit to low double digit. In in the quarter. Mhmm. But that's more broadly. And you know what's interesting? Jeff Sprague : Jeff is. Charles McLaughlin : Our high growth our high growth markets ex China have actually been continuing to grow really well. And so know, that's I think the offset there is gonna be we continue to see good growth in some of the other higher high high growth markets. Jeff Sprague : And then just maybe finally for me on sort of the flat AOP for Q1. I I take it that's still some margin pressure in PT. And then some upward trajectory in the other two segments, but any anything you'd say there to kinda get us in the right ballpark? Charles McLaughlin : Yeah. I mean, I would I would say but on flattish growth, we're typically gonna you know, that's that's that's kind of the overall overall affordive You know, we had good margin expansion in last year, so a hundred and ten basis points twenty four. Q one. So when you kinda look at where we're at on a two year stack, still good despite kind of that low single digit growth that we would have had in on a on a on a comparable basis But it's exactly right. New Fortive or iOS and health health will be will have good margin expansion and, you know, with being down the way we are in PT, we'll doing a nice job of offsetting when I think about how we've done in PT over the last Your Given the fact that our, you know, tech being down, our highest gross margin business, it's been really good operational performance to offset a number of those things. And obviously, our margin expansion for the year was good in twenty four and part because of iOS and AHS doing a great job, but also the the countermeasure work that PT did as well. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks a lot. Thank you, Jeff. Daryl: Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Davis : Hey, Scott. Hey, guys. You know, it's good morning out there still. But Charles McLaughlin : hey, I don't think you addressed it on prepared remarks, but maybe you did, but this is this Daryl : for Chuck. The tax rate is seem to be pretty volatile for the size of the the company. Is there Charles McLaughlin : a particular reason why that's been hard to to pin down? Nigel Coe : Well, Scott Davis : the tax rate came down in Q4. Due to discrete items. That's typically where most of those things land and they be somewhat unpredictable and we don't forecast them. And so I think that's that's what you're seeing there. And when you take out discrete items, it's actually holding into that fourteen percent range. A don't have. Okay. Sounds Daryl : I get it. Julian Mitchell : Alright. So Daryl : if we wanted to mark if we if you wanted to mark to market kind of where we are with probation and and ASP. Let's just take those two businesses. What do you guys think Scott Davis : So Daryl : the the new realistic kinda long term growth rate are. I mean, we know what what you thought they were when you did the deals, but it's been a few years now. So If we just mark the market now and you said, okay, over the next five years, what or even longer, what would you expect to be kind of the entitlement potential growth rate to those two assets now? Charles McLaughlin : Yeah. I would say ASP mid single digit. That's a combination of additional elective procedures, plus some price plus some, you know, volume share gain, and then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're really starting to see the innovation flywheel start. So we feel good that, you know, as as as we've talked over the years, Scott, that it you know, we had six five ten k approvals here and, you know, it takes a while to get the innovation cycle moving in in health care because of the regulatory environment. But we've we're really starting to see that. So we feel really good about that mid single digit growth rate going on You know, it's a little bit impacted how we just talked about the days. That's know, our biggest day's impact is that ASP. But when we look really at the entitled growth rate, it's mid single digit. Probation, probably high single, low double. You know, when we look at the SaaS conversion, it'll it'll move around a little bit depending on how that conversion goes. That's a combination of really just the continued work, great work we're doing haven't talked about it in a long time, you know, in some time, but you know, they're doing a great job. I mentioned the the dramatic improvement increase in SaaS sites that we had, and, that's really the great work we're doing. We've really got a sales motion going And as we also mentioned, we've got Apex Insights, which is their AI offering. Which is now starting to get some traction as well with customers. So so call it you know, high single to low double, and that's that's really what we thought we would underwrite when we when we bought the business. Daryl: Yeah. Consistent. Okay. I'll pass that. Thank you, guys. Best of luck this year. Bye, Chuck. Nigel Coe : See. Daryl: Thanks, Scott. Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Yes. Good morning, Eric. Andrew Obin : Hi. How are you? Just the first question, maybe talk about your your software assets, you know, Gordon, Accruent, Service Channel, Where are we in those growth rates and what do the those look like exiting the year and Daryl : going to twenty five? Charles McLaughlin : Yeah. We had our growth of high single digits for both the quarter and the year, Andrew. Daryl: Our software revenue grew overall high yeah. In in q one, it's gonna grow Charles McLaughlin : high single, and that's with some headwinds on the service front. So think that high single is good. We're seeing you know, we we have those dramatic growth rates at Guardian for for a number of years. So the Gordian rate's moderating a little bit down into the into the you know, double digit range. Low low double digit But we're seeing in purpose at a current and service channel, so good growth good growth there. I just mentioned about probation good growth there. So intellects, we've we've we're starting to improve the growth rate there. We've had we had a little bit of a challenge there in twenty four, but we've done some nice work. To continue to improve that. So, you know, overall software in very good shape. Know, we we mentioned it a number of places where we've got some innovation going on as well. In foul in the prepared remarks. So x, the team's executing well. Innovation, flywheel is starting to starting to take take take have some real impact I would think those businesses and I think as you look at around it, I know you you do this a lot, I think those numbers are gonna hold up pretty well. So we feel we feel good about where our software businesses are. And and we've also dramatically improved the profitability. We talked about this. Eight hundred basis points in the prepared remarks. In in FAL. We're Andrew Obin : we're Charles McLaughlin : we've we've got a lot we're really demonstrating how FBS can really accelerate it. Software business, and I think you'll you'll continue to hear that as we as we progress through the year. Daryl: And can we just talk about sort of utilities and power vertical It seems, structurally, things are changing there over the long term. How is the conversation changing with the customers? Do you need to capacity? Do you have the right exposure? If you could expand on that because that's a big topic. You. Charles McLaughlin : Yeah. It is. And so it really comes in two ways. In in the smaller way, it comes from what we do with EA and Tektronix where we are really playing in a lot of the technologies and R and D investments that are going into the next generation of utilities and and as as the grid gets get the grid gets improved and technologies are going into that, obviously, r and d organizations around the world are designing those components and designing those those chipsets and we're very involved with tech and e a there. The bigger number as you point out is the Qualitrol. And and that's been very strong. That's both on the grid monitoring side, but also on the transformer side. We've got a number of new sensors that we're launching with those businesses. We've had double digit growth. In in that business for several years. And as I mentioned on a previous question, we're ramping capacity because some of we're really up against our own capacity here. And we we look out that's a longer cycle businesses. We look out the next twelve to eighteen months. We continue to see customers making dramatic investments in those markets. So we that's gonna be a good growth driver as we've talked about for for for what I'll call, Reliant. We have a new name now for And that'll be a good growth driver for rallying going forward. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Daryl: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Joe Giordano : Hi, Joe. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Daryl: When I benchmark tech versus your peer peer group, Charles McLaughlin : do you think you guys have just more structural exposure to things like EB in China than some of your competitors do? Well, I think the the counts are tough because you know, you don't you have a perfect perfect view, but Daryl : would say Charles McLaughlin : with with EA, we might have a little bit more EV exposure as a percent of the business, but but I think I think those numbers are relatively in line. And when we cap them against over multi years, we we see pretty similar performance. Daryl: Okay. Charles McLaughlin : Then just on PT margins in the quarter, like, I think they were expected to ramp pretty considerably, and they were down sequentially on higher revenues. Just curious any color on that. In in q four or q one? Nigel Coe : Q four. So the PT margins in q four. Elena Rosman : Yes. They they were down relative to the the volume decline. Charles McLaughlin : Avenue. Elena Rosman : Two hundred and twenty basis points. Scott Davis : But you've been successful with Yeah. We have a little bit less revenue there and a little bit less revenue in Charles McLaughlin : Places where? You know, they're in some of our higher profitable businesses. Some of that is that production capacity point I made. Some of it's a tech. So a little bit of that a little bit of that is is is a little bit of volume and then a little bit of mix too. K. Thanks, guys. Scott Davis : Thanks, Joe. Daryl: Thank you. Our next question's come from the line of Andy Kaplowitz. With Citi. Please proceed with Hey. Good morning, everyone. Andy Kaplowitz : Andy. Chuck, thanks for all your help. Chuck and Jim, maybe you can update us on how you're thinking about price for cost in twenty five? There's obviously some tariff related uncertainty, but I would imagine that the material cost inflation has been relatively benign. So what's embedded in your expectations for Twenty five. Charles McLaughlin : We've got about two hundred little over two hundred basis points price Daryl : in across the enterprise. Charles McLaughlin : And that that's pretty consistent. Look, maybe two hundred and twenty five basis points up. That's pretty consistent in in across segments. So in that in that sense, we'll continue to to you know, we always go after more price. So that's usually a a a testament to our our team. We'll see you know, that'll that'll mean some we'll start to see volume on on the in on the iOS front here. But, you know, we won't have volume in PT most likely. So given given given the outlook that we've got around flattish. So so for the full year. Andy Kaplowitz : Helpful. And then in AHS, I I think in Elena Rosman : q three, you had double digit consumables growth. It was mid single digits in q four. I know you talked about the difference in days in q four, q one. That's probably the big reason. But do you see anything in AHS that actually slowed? Or was it really just the days there a difference, a bigger difference in growth between US and, for instance, Europe? And China in AHS? Daryl: Yeah. Health is in a really good place Charles McLaughlin : You know, q four had didn't have the benefit of the year before comp that q two and q three did. So we really saw good underlying performance A little bit of impact on this Ivy bag situation which will we'll see in a couple of months in q one, but but but, you know, broadly, really good performance at at in health, particularly really across the board in all the businesses. I would say Europe was good. So in that sense, China a little a little challenge. So I would say if you're anywhere in health where we're we're watching is is in China, Daryl: But Charles McLaughlin : more broadly across the across the world, Japan, Middle East, you know, we're really seeing good performance across our health businesses. Now our most global business is ASP. So when we think around around the world, it really is, you know, ASP is really the one One visit. Sells everywhere in the world. Elena Rosman : Appreciate the color. Nigel Coe : Thanks, Andy. Daryl: Thank you. Our next question's come from the line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Chris Snyder : Hi, Chris. Yeah. I wanna Daryl : How's it going, guys? Appreciate the question. Chris Snyder : I wanted to ask on PT orders. You know, great to see that double digit positive for the second quarter in a row. Are orders going higher in absolute terms? Because I know, you know, the the comps are negative. And then, you know, with that, anything you could share on on how Precision Tech's the book to bill is trending in q four? Thank you. Elena Rosman : Yes. So it's a book to bill for for PT and and certainly for tech and sensing on a combined basis. Is one for the year. It's a little below just just below one. It's point nine six. For the fourth quarter, but that's typical for us in the fourth quarter given the the seasonality of the shipments that we have in the fourth Charles McLaughlin : Yeah. I would say dollars I think were up q four from q three. And and we'll grow we'll grow orders in the first half. MPT, Little bit of pressure in the first quarter because of some of the comp issues I was mentioning around China, but we we still see continued growth in orders here in the first half. So and and Steve's question around, you know, how does some of the timing I think it was Steve's around six months or nine months, we'll start to see some of that shipment impact We did see some of those orders more back end loaded Some of it is because there's semiconductor related and there's semiconductor investments in the second half. But we also saw some of our sensing companies that typically get blanket orders some of those orders we've got normally, we get for a full twelve months. We've only got for a few months. So we we we see a little bit of that order rate coming into shipments more little bit more back end loaded than than typical. The the but we we feel very comfortable with with that sort of seasonality relative to years past. Thank you for that. We really appreciate it. Chris Snyder : And then maybe just following up. You know, I was surprised to see Precision Tech organic growth worse or lower in q four, I think down mid single versus the q four down three just because we we are seeing that, you know, positive order momentum. Doesn't seem like the day's impact is all that material for for Precision Tech based on some of the the the prior commentary? So I guess Charles McLaughlin : is is this is the is the is q one is that endowment single reflecting Chris Snyder : EA Electro now coming into organic? And you know, with that, what is the expectation for EA Electro in twenty five? Thank you. Daryl: Yeah. So I would say a couple things on the first quarter. Charles McLaughlin : One is China China a little bit a little bit more challenge than we anticipated, so I would say that's part of that. Second of all, you're right. EA going into core and EA's best quarter last year was was the first quarter because of the backlog coming in. So that's part of it as well. We think, you know, some good the good thing about EA, we certainly and we mentioned in the prepared remarks that just a put a ball around it, Much of that e a much of that e b mobility challenge we saw principally in Western Europe and in China is the a. So that is that is certainly we think EA will grow mid single digits this year. And with the power of FBS and some of the things we've done operationally, we're gonna get that mark their mark rate. Back to where they were when we bought the company. So so the margin rate is now in really good shape. We're gonna put it in we'll be the business will be back into growth mode as we move through the year. Tektronix sales synergies are ahead of plan in the really, really working well particularly in North America. As we find new new point parts of growth in different markets and we've started to started to get some of those orders So I think those that that those are some of the things that are going well. But, again, the well, we've talked about this through twenty four. The large order EV business that that was a big part of their business back in twenty two and twenty three, We we have not seen that come back nor we plan for it to come back in twenty five. Elena Rosman : I just added the the EA headwind is about ten million dollars. On a per basis. That's it's ten million of the core decline. For, you know, year over year for q one. Daryl: Thank you for that. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good day, everyone. Also, I wanna wish Chuck all the best. Thanks. Thanks, Dean. Hey, Chuck. Before you ride off into the sunset, I wanna put the spotlight on networking capital and at six percent, that puts Fortive in among the elite. Daryl: And so Deane Dray : I was hoping you could just parse out How that looks, New Fortive versus Ralliant. Did I say that right, Ralliant? So Yes. You did. How does that break out? I would imagine Scott Davis : the more software part of new Fortive Deane Dray : skews that lower, but just directionally, can you help us there? Scott Davis : Yeah. I think that I'm not sure. I haven't really looked at it that detailed in terms of with Ralliant, but we have looked at it excluding the software, which would have it around nine percent. That's what I would expect Ralliant at And that's But which is also really good. Yeah. Well, both have a really good working capital. Deane Dray : So Charles McLaughlin : similar question for the two. I was not expecting Ralliant to be that low on the net working capital, which is a positive, obviously, but just what does that mean for Ralliant's free cash flow for both companies? Kind of free cash flow cadence for on an annual basis, Scott Davis : based upon that. It's got to be both Charles McLaughlin : very comfortably above one hundred percent Elena Rosman : Conversion? Charles McLaughlin : No. I think Scott Davis : I'm not above one hundred percent, but pushing and I say that ninety five percent to one hundred The two things that really drive you over a hundred would would be whether you have software. Some software companies have maybe working capital and or doing m and a. And be able to do improvement. But I I I expected to be ninety five. Charles McLaughlin : Yeah. We'll certainly get more clarity as we get to investor day, but you know, Dean, you point out free cash flow of both businesses is gonna be really strong. Scott Davis : Great. And just to clarify, on your software business, Charles McLaughlin : collectively, are you at Scott Davis : the negative working capital level? Collectively, I don't no. Because not all software companies do that, but some some do. I I I think we're we're pretty flat. Yeah. I think we're we're still working through service channels probably the Charles McLaughlin : the the big change there. Scott Davis : Dean, Charles McLaughlin : they weren't typically that way. And so, you know, contractually, we're working through that over time. Accurant's probably the biggest negative working capital software business we have. Scott Davis : Great. Daryl: Thank you for the all that color. Scott Davis : Thanks, team. Daryl: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Elena Rosman : Hi. Jamie Cook : Just two quick follow ups. One, within PT, I think last quarter you noted some improvement in semi. Can you just talk about what you saw specifically in the fourth quarter and your expectations for twenty twenty five? And then my other question or, you know, congrats on on the spin happening earlier. Just because we get questions, and I I assume you know, the the probability of any anything happening on PTA, an inbound offer, we can just assume that sort of put to bed and and and not not on the table. Thank you. Scott Davis : Yes. I I take the second one. I think that's probably a pretty that's a that's a fair assumption that we're we're going forward with the with the spend. And we've evaluate all in inbound offers. And then, remind me of the first question that that you had. Charles McLaughlin : Oh, this is Ruben and Sammy. Yeah. I I Hey. Maybe it's Jim. I would I would say a couple of things. One is where we're kind of a little bit getting back to the prepared remarks. The high speed compute aspects of of semiconductor been good. You know, NVIDIA is a customer Some some of the large hyperscalers are customer set. I would say that's the good part. I would say that pretty typical to what you're seeing in some other places. The the weaker aspects of semi are more the discreet you know, sort of discrete consumer products, that kind of stuff. And we don't anticipate a return on that. We're starting to see some green shoots there. But, without a doubt, and that some of that's in the order rate, but we we're we're sort of expecting some improvement in that by the end of the year. But we haven't anticipated any big dramatic improvement through in the end by the in the end of the year. Jamie Cook : Thank you. Elena Rosman : Thank you. Daryl: Thank you. Our next question's come from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with Charles McLaughlin : Hi. Hey, Joe. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey. Scott Davis : Fair amount of focus on on China, but, you know, just if you could talk a little bit about regional expectations specific to to Fluke, really, and and how you think about the Charles McLaughlin : growth opportunity within the guide. We think about it from North America, Europe, Elena Rosman : China kind of perspective. What what type of growth do you think you can do in Fluke? Charles McLaughlin : Yeah. I think we think about we did I think we did know, sort of low single digit plus. It's Luke at twenty four. We anticipate the same thing being in twenty five. So pretty similar expectations He's done a nice job. As we mentioned, you know, making a lot of their own luck with with this acceleration of innovation cycle. North America will be the will be the winner in the clubhouse most likely. Regionally? We did but we expect some growth in in Western Europe. And we expect good growth outside of China in the high growth markets. We do expect probably China to be down a little bit. In the full year with most of that being in the First half? Just because of comps mostly comp challenge. So we don't have a big anticipation of any big big improvement in in in the market. As I mentioned, point of sale is a little mixed. Our our sort of day to day run rate point of sale at Fluke in Nigel Coe : China? Charles McLaughlin : Is actually down down but our sort of project based point of sale is actually up. So so we are still seeing some and I think that's really a function of the innovation We're finding places where that innovation can work. Sort of the day to day run rate business is still hasn't come back yet. And and we'll probably we'll we'll continue to stay you know, prudent around that as well. So, you know, Fluke's Fluke's in a really good position as we start the year off and after after a strong finish. Some of the know, maybe a little bit of that weakness in the first quarter is what we mentioned, which is some of the revenue coming out of the first quarter. Scott Davis : We saw that in the fourth. Charles McLaughlin : And and then on the sensing side, Nigel Coe : just any color on what kind of growth you expect out of Qualitrol, trying to get a little bit of perspective on whether those capacity constraints and what kind of an impact they have on on growth constraints. And then also within sensing, just anything on Hanksler and Demand trends in in Europe. You know, whether there's there's anything encouraging there. Charles McLaughlin : Well, I would say number one, Qualtrul, multiyear double digit growth and we would expect that again this year. So and and that's a little bit of the capacity constraints, not just the volume this year, it's the sum total of the continued volume growth that we we've got. So we'll have a little bit of capacity increase there that to to deal with the long term demand trends that are that are very strong. Sensing in general, we saw order growth in the second half. I think double digit order growth in sensing in the second half. So we but some of the blanket orders that we would normally see at the end of the year to cover the entire year we did not see and I would say that's part of that is Hensler as as you point out. And I you know, I think where your question is going is exactly right. You know, they're their exposure to European automation is is a higher percentage of of anywhere else in sensing and and that's really where their business is the most week. And also China's been Scott Davis : And we Charles McLaughlin : we have some automation customers there as well. So and that would principally be in discrete automation which is probably consistent with a lot of what you heard from others Scott Davis : you know, over the last few weeks. Nigel Coe : Indeed, it is. A lot. Scott Davis : Thank you. Daryl: Thank you. Our last questions will come from the line of Scott Graham with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Graham : Hey, Adam. Good afternoon. Good morning for you. And Daryl : thank you for taking the question. And, Chuck, good luck and be happy. Scott Davis : Thank you. A couple of questions. Daryl: Around first of all, on my questions are actually all around the margin. So in the quarter, you know, was price cost your, you know, your typical spread fifteen hundred basis points. Is that fair? Elena Rosman : The price was three percent in the quarter. It's And when you look at gross margins, we expanded gross margins ten basis points from the quarter. Scott Davis : So Elena Rosman : relative to that, you know, sort of spread, it's probably on par with what it's been over the course of the year. Daryl: Okay. And then could you remind us what the restructuring savings will be what's what's the plan there and how they layer into earnings in as the quarters progress Elena Rosman : We we funded twenty million dollars of restructuring in the fourth assume that that rolls in and and get gradually we see the the benefits of that over the course of the year. Not much Maybe a couple million dollars of benefit, call it a penny, in the first quarter. Daryl: Go ahead. Thanks a lot. Nigel Coe : Alright. Thanks, Scott. Daryl: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jim Lico for any closing comments. Scott Davis : Well, thanks, Gerald, and thanks everyone Charles McLaughlin : incredibly incredibly thoughtful set of questions. We appreciate all that. Obviously, Elaine and team will be available for any other questions. Just want to thank everyone A lot of comments around Chuck. I just wanna make sure everybody knows he's he's not going anywhere. He's gonna continue to support the Fortive team here. Scott Davis : In Charles McLaughlin : through the spin. So you you you may have an opportunity to hear from him a little bit. But he's done obviously, done a great job for us over the years and and we're we're excited for what he will do next. But but that's not just that's not tomorrow. He still got some work to do near as I can tell. So Daryl : Anyway, Charles McLaughlin : as you as you can hear, exciting times for us. We couldn't be more excited. Good finish to the year. Yeah. I think in many respects, we we pointed out some of the five year numbers that I that we're really proud of. When you look at several records set in two thousand twenty four, around a number of things despite some of the mixed macro environment, we were able to do a number of things on the margin and free cash flow front I think are just synonymous with FBS and really have an opportunity to to really set us up for two thousand twenty five. But the probably the most important thing is how FBS has really driven innovation. And and really when you see that across the board, I think you'll hear more of that as we progress through the year. We're excited about twenty five. We're excited with fact that we can bring to you the the idea that the spin is gonna happen faster it really speaks, I think, as well to the power of FBS and the quality of our team. So we'll we'll look forward to the follow-up questions. We'll see many of you out on the road here soon. A lot to do here between now and in the spin. Excited about it. We look forward to continue to talk. About all the exciting things going on in Fortive. Thanks. Have a great day and have a great weekend. Elena Rosman : Great. Daryl: Thank you. This does now conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. May disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
